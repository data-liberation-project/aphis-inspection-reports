The chincilla had pushed up on a movable door section of the caging wire of the enclosure that had been\nfastened with a carabiner type clip at the top but had no fastening on the bottom. The carabiner clip allowed the\nchincilla to push up the door about an inch to an inch and a half which gave the chincilla enough room to stick out its\nhead and neck. The chincilla was able to be freed from the opening and appeared unhurt. The chincilla may injure\nitself on the current enclosure setup and if it escapes, it would fall to the ground which would also lead to injury.
