The right eye appears dry with a discharge covering approximately one\nthird of the surface. The whites of both eyes are slightly reddened. The licensee stated that the dog has been\ndiagnosed by her veterinarian as having dry eyes as a result of cherry-eye surgery as a puppy. She said her vet\ntold her to keep the eyes clean, and the hair around them short. The licensee has not consistently followed her\nveterinarian's directions for treating this dog.\nEye problems can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be\nuncomfortable or painful to the animal.\nThe licensee must have the adult Shih Tzu re-evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and\nprovide the inspector the documentation of this visit upon request.\nA bottle of Ivermectin that expired November 2014 was found intermingled with other medications, and is therefore\nconsidered ready for use. The licensee stated she used the Ivermectin within the past week to deworm two puppies.\nThe inspectors directed her to tell her veterinarian that she used the expired medication on these puppies and get a\nrecommendation for this situation. Both puppies appeared healthy. The expired bottle was discarded at the time of\nthe inspection.\nUsing expired medications can have an adverse or diminished effect, or not treat the condition for which it was\nintended.\nThe licensee must ensure all animals are given proper veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by May 7, 2016.\nInspection and exit interview conducted by Scott Welch, VMO, and Lynn Clarke, ACI with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nWelch Scott, Veterinary Medical Officer"
