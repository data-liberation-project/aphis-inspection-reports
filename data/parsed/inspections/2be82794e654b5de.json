I stayed for 30 minutes in the\ndriveway calling the licensee on the numbers provided. The home phone has now been disconnected and the cell\nphone is set to not take any messages. The licensee has never returned any phone messages or tried to make\ncontact with this inspector and has not been inspected once since he became licensed. This licensee has actively\nrefused to communicate with the inspector to allow an inspection and has continually made no effort to work out any\narrangements for future inspections. Attempts have been made on multiple days and times with no results, and the\nlicensee has not communicated any 'optimal times for inspection' options after repeated messages and 'attempted\ninspections' requesting this information. This is the fifth attempt at an inspection since his Pre-license August 1,\n2013.\nPlease contact this inspector at 618-315-3649 ASAP in order to sort out optimal times for inspections."
