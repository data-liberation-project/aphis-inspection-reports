According to medical records and\ndiscussion with the Director and the AV, animals have not been getting fecal exams performed as outlined in the PVC.\n***A 2-year-old male giraffe currently living at the facility has not had fecal exams every 3 months as stated in the written\nprogram of veterinary care. The animal arrived at the facility in December 2022 and was dewormed at that time.\nAccording to the PVC, this animal should have had a fecal exam performed every 3 months, but there were no fecal\nexams performed from December 2022 to July 2023.\nAccording to the Assistant Director, a fecal exam was submitted for laboratory testing earlier this week (results are\npending). At the time of the inspection, the giraffe was extremely thin, with prominent hip and shoulder bones, clearly\nvisible neck bones, and a protruding spine; weight loss in giraffes can be caused by untreated parasite infections.\n***A 2-year-old female alpaca (\u201cBabette\u201d) experienced severe weight loss (10 lbs lost in 3.5 months) and required\nemergency hospitalization (beginning on August 17, 2023) and a blood transfusion due to heavy parasite infection.\nMedical records for this animal, who has been on the property for 2 years, do not include any fecal exams.

No fecal exam or parasite\ntreatment had been performed in 2023.\n***A male alpaca (\u201cCarson\u201d) died in November 2022 and a necropsy found severe parasite infection. This animal last had\na fecal exam in December 2021 and was last dewormed in June 2022.\n***A female red river hog died on July 19, 2023 and a necropsy found a large number of parasites in the animal\u2019s\nintestines. The necropsy report stated that the high number of parasites is a predisposing factor for cause of death (which\nwas intestinal volvulus). This animal had been on the premises since January 2023, but had not had any fecal exams or\ndeworming treatments.\nAdditionally, the PVC states that carnivores should be vaccinated for rabies annually. Review of medical records showed\nthat only carnivores used for public encounters were being vaccinated for rabies. Carnivores not used for public contact-\nsuch as 2 binturong and 2 serval cats- have not been vaccinated for rabies annually.\nThe facility is giving 4 penguins a daily supplement which expired in March 2023.\nThe AV was contacted and confirmed that the instructions in the written PVC have not changed and should be followed. It\nis important to follow the AV\u2019s instructions for animal care, testing, vaccination, and treatment. Failure to follow the AV\u2019s\ninstructions can result in animal\u2019s becoming sick or dying.
