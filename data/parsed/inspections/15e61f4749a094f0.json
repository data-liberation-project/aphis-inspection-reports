This\nenclosure needs to be maintained structurally sound in good repair to protect the enclosed animal from injury. All\nexposed cattle panels need to be adequately covered, and the shelter floor needs to be safe and solid.\n- A wire panel fence serving as a public barrier around the perimeter of the hyena enclosure is secured to large\nwooden posts. On at least one post, several portions of the fence are not physically connected to the post resulting\nin a large gap at the top of the post.
