The bedding material was hay and straw but\nwas very sparse on the floor, with portions of the floor exposed. The owner stated that he had placed fresh bedding\nmaterial in the shelters several days before and that the dogs kicked it out. During the previous 5 days,\ntemperatures at night have been less than 20F degrees and daytime temperatures have been less than 50F\ndegrees. Lack of sufficient bedding in cold environments increases the risks of sickness and hypothermia situations.\nSufficient clean dry bedding material is necessary to provide protection when the temperature is less than 50F\ndegrees. More bedding material is necessary when the temperature is less than 35F degrees for the dogs to\nburrow into and remain clean and dry and have better protection from the cold. The owner must provide more\nbedding for the dogs and maintain it at sufficient levels any time the temperature is less than 50F degrees and\nadditional bedding must be added when the temperature is less than 35F degrees.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: ON 26 FEBRUARY 2015, licensee was verbally instructed to provide more bedding\nbefore the end of the day and to maintain sufficient bedding when the temperatures are less than 50F."
