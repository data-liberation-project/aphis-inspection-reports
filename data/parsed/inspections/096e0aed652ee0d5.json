This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by approving an amendment to the protocol.\n* Two monkeys with head caps were reported by veterinary care staff to have them cleaned monthly. The margins\nare clean and without evidence of discharge or discoloration. The IACUC-approved protocol states that head caps\nare to be cleaned weekly. There is no part of the protocol addressing care when there is no activity using the posts\nor chambers, as is the current situation. Care of research-related implants may be different for active versus inactive\nstatus, but the difference must be addressed in the approved protocol. Correction: the IACUC is set to meet the\nweek following the inspection, where correction will be addressed."
