They were reportedly\ntransported in crates with blankets and a heating pad, and they were fed every three hours for the duration. The\ncubs were bright and alert and moving around normally at the time of inspection.\nIt has been determined that transporting neonatal (<4 weeks old) nondomestic cats is not consistent with safe\nhandling and protecting them from harm. The rigors of travel can cause behavioral stress and discomfort. In\naddition, neonatal animals are not considered to have competent immune systems until they have had a series of\nvaccinations. They were potentially exposed to pathogens from other animals and people along the way.\nCorrect by no longer transporting neonatal animals from this point on.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a licensee, an IES investigator, and an Oregon Department of\nFish and Wildlife representative."
