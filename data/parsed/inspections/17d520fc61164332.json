On June 10, 2021, a\nninth biopsy procedure was performed on one animal enrolled on this protocol. Increasing the number of procedures\nconstitutes a significant change to ongoing activities which was not reviewed and approved prior to being implemented.\n- An animal enrolled on IACUC approved protocol #XXXXN000018 had a surgical biopsy performed on Friday, May 20,\n2022. The approved pain management plan on the protocol included the administration of a long-acting opioid and\nmeloxicam daily 5 days post-procedure. The animal received analgesics per protocol on the day of surgery but did not\nreceive meloxicam on May 21 or May 22, 2022. Failure to administer post-operative analgesia in accordance with the\nprotocol constitutes a significant change that did not undergo IACUC review and approval.\n- IACUC approved protocol #XXXXN000020 includes the administration of immunosuppressive agents after a transplant\nprocedure, up to six total doses. One animal received a transplant on July 27, 2022 and was subsequently treated with six\ndoses of the immunosuppressive agents per protocol. On August 15, 2022, an additional dose was administered to the\nanimal, which constituted a significant change that did not undergo IACUC review and approval.\n-A rabbit enrolled on IACUC approved protocol #XXXXN000015 underwent a study procedure on January 26, 2023. The\nmonitoring schedule on the protocol includes twice daily monitoring for three days after the procedure. On January 27th,\nonly one observation was performed. Failure to monitor animals in accordance with the protocol may compromise the\nability of the researchers to detect problems of animal health and constitutes a significant change that did not undergo\nIACUC review and approval.\nThese deviations from IACUC approved protocols were identified by the facility and voluntarily reported to USDA.\nCorrective measures had been implemented prior to inspection; to remain corrected after July 18th, 2023."
