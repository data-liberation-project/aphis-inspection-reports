The second enclosure,\ncontaining one adult female, has a wasp nest next to the access door. At the time of the inspection there are no\nmethods in place for the control of flies and wasps. The flies could cause contamination of the food source and\ncontact with wasps could have a negative impact on the health of the adult dogs and puppies.\nAn effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs, and birds and mammals that are\npests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce\ncontamination by pests in animal areas. The licensee must establish effective methods for controlling flies and\nwasps in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.\nTo be corrected by: October 10, 2017\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
