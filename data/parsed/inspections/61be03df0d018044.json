The left eye was pale in\ncolor instead of the normal dark color.\n**Two Chinchillas (No ID's, located in back section - south) - The right eye of both chinchillas had a crusty material\naround it and the eye was not easily visualized.\nThese chinchillas were observed in the previous inspection (April 6, 2015). The licensee reports to have followed a\nfive day treatment prescribed by a consulting veterinarian but has not communicated to the attending veterinarian\nthat the eye problems remain unresolved. When a prescribed treatment fails to correct a problem that an animal\nhas, the licensee must promptly notify the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be evaluated and adjust\nthe treatment plan per the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations. Failure to treat unresolved health problems under the\nguidance of the attending veterinarian can cause animals to remain in pain and may allow sickness to spread to\nother animals in the building.\nThe licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to have the affected animals evaluated and to have a\ntreatment plan documented and ensure that the plan is carried out. Documentation of the treatment plan and that it\nis being followed may be requested by inspectors in future inspections."

      "narrative": "In evaluating which animals have received treatment since the last inspection the facility could not locate chinchilla\n#118. Chinchilla #118 was listed in the April 6, 2015 report as needing to be evaluated by a veterinarian. The\nfacility was not sure if #118 remained at the facility. We searched the enclosures and found chinchilla #118 and\nfound that its left eye had problems. There were no enclosure markers or notes indicating that the facility was\naware that it needed treatment. Lack of close daily observations does not ensure that a sick or injured animal will\nreceive veterinary treatment if needed. The facility must develop and maintain a routine of daily observations of\neach animal. The facility must be in direct communication with the attending veterinarian promptly when animal\nhealth problems are observed or when prescribed treatments do not resolve an animal(cid:25)s problem."

More appropriate flooring\nsurfaces must be provided that do not have gaps large enough for the chinchilla's feet to pass through to protect\nthem from injury.\nDuring the inspection, the licensee stated that a couple of chinchillas had gotten out of their enclosures. It was\ndetermined that both escapes occurred in the stacked enclosures in the first room and involved one female with one\nbaby in enclosure numbered #6 on the top row and one male in enclosure # 151 located in the middle row.
