These sharp points and edges could wound the puppy.\nThe primary enclosures must be kept in good repair. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so\nthat they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs, protect the dogs from injury, and enable all\nsurfaces in contact with the dogs to be readily cleaned and sanitized.\nCORRECT BY: 09/27/2018\nThis inspection was conducted on 09/24/2018 and the exit interview was conducted on 09/25/2018 with the\nlicensee."
