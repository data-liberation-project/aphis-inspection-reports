The areas of hair loss were irregular in shape and extended beyond the\nreddened skin lesions located within the regions of hair loss. The lesions appeared to be reddened and scabbed.\nThe largest sore on the left side was approximately \u00bd inch diameter and had a few smaller, pinpoint sized lesions\nnear it. There was also an approximately 1 inch diameter reddened lesion near the base of the tail. A small amount\nof fecal-like material was noted in the fur on the right side of the rear leg. The licensee was not aware of the dog's\ncondition prior to the inspector pointing it out. This dog's condition could be due to an injury, infection or a variety of\nother veterinary medical conditions. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding this dog's\ncondition in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and\nfollowed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
