The attending veterinarian was consulted by phone on 2 May 2017, when the injury\nhappened, but the licensee had no documentation of the phone conservation with the attending veterinarian, the\nrecommended treatment, or documentation that the medication had been given as directed by the veterinarian.

The licensee must ensure that\nall animals showing signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a timely manner by a veterinarian as part\nof the facility\u2019s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility uses appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times. The outcome of this consultation including the\ndiagnosis, treatment plan and how the condition will be resolved must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request.

In addition, an approximately 1/2 inch, round, hairless, moist, lesion exposing pink tissue was\nobserved on the left front foot pad. The licensee stated that on the 2nd of May 2017 the dog was injured by a piece\nof barbed wire. The licensee stated that she removed the barbed wire from the exercise area. The licensee stated\nthat she contacted her attending veterinarian (AV) by phone and was told to treat the dog with an oral antibiotic\ntwice a day and to clean the lesion with peroxide. The licensee stated she ran out of the oral antibiotic on May 17th\nand had not ordered any more. The licensee has not communicated with the AV regarding the dog\u2019s ongoing limp\nand wound since the initial phone consult on 2 May 2017. The AV has not evaluated this dog\u2019s injury even though\nthe wound is still present and the dog continues to limp and occasionally not bear weight on the left front leg. Foot\nproblems can be painful causing discomfort when the dog has to place weight on the affected foot. It can affect the\nmobility and daily activity of the dog. An untreated open wound can lead to further medical complications,\nunnecessary pain and distress for the animal. Failure to communicate illness, whether it appears mild or serious,\nto the attending veterinarian, could result in improper care of the animals. For example, this could lead to failure to\nseek professional veterinary care in a timely manner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the\nanimal's condition. The licensee must observe all animals daily to assess their health and well-being. Daily\nobservation of the animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided that a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal\nhealth, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
