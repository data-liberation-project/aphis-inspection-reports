This hoof was curled inward toward the lateral hoof, constantly pushing the lateral digit outward. Hooves\nthat are left unattended can cause lameness in the animals. The licensee must provide appropriate hoof care to the\nanimals and ensure that all of the animals receive adequate veterinary care as required."
