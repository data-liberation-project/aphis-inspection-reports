      "narrative": "At the time of inspection the perimeter fence for the facility was found to be out of compliance with section 3.127 (d).\nA gate in the perimeter fence in the expansion construction zone was found inoperable and left open and\nunattended. There were several gaps or openings at various locations under the perimeter fence or its gates that\nmeasured from four to nine inches. Additionally, there are regularly-spaced \u201cwildlife corridor\u201d openings in the fence\nat ground level that measure seven inches in height by up to thirteen inches in width, and the inspector had\npreviously been told that these openings would be sealed, but they remain open as of the time of inspection. The\nentire perimeter fence was not examined at the time of this inspection, as it was observed that the problems\nidentified at the last inspection remained uncorrected. Regardless, to be clear, the standards must be met for the\nentire perimeter fence.\nThe fence should prevent people and animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing\nsecondary containment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The fence should consistently\nmeet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. Failure to meet the standards specified in 3.127 (d)\ncould endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility. Gates in the fence should remain closed if\nunattended. The fence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described\nhere. Gaps that could allow animals to pass under the fence should be closed. If \u201cwildlife corridor\u201d openings in the\nfence are required by another regulatory agency, then a variance must be attained from the USDA / APHIS / Animal\nCare Administrator in order to allow for this deviation from the requirements.\nThis inspection was conducted on 12/5/17 with the facility representative, and inspectors Smith and Rosendale.\nAn exit interview was conducted on 12/8/17 with facility representatives, and Dr. Smith.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRosendale Marcy, Veterinary Medical Officer"
