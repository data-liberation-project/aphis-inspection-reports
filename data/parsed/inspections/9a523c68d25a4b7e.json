The\nlicensee stated that she had been attacked by another dog about one month earlier, so he had moved her into an\nenclosure by herself. However, he did not have her examined by a veterinarian even though the licensee stated that she\nhad not improved with time. At the time of the inspection, the dog was lethargic, moved about very little, and was\nextremely thin with a wasp-waist and visibly prominent ribs, vertebra, and hip bones. She had multiple areas of missing\nhair over her head, legs, body, and tail with dry, flaky skin. Many of these areas also had lesions with yellow crusty\nmaterial and/or open, reddened sores. Both elbows had missing hair with crusty yellow material and dried blood. Both\nhips had quarter-sized lesions with missing hair, thickened skin, and open moist sores with a yellow discharge. Untreated\nmedical problems can worsen with time, can be painful, and can affect the overall well-being of the animal. The licensee\nmust have this dog examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis, must follow the veterinarian\u2019s treatment plan, and must keep\nmedical records for inspection.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 18, 2023. NOTE: The licensee called his veterinarian during the inspection to\nschedule an appointment for the dog."
