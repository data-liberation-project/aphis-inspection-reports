The red fox escaped through the open doors and ran into the\nwoods that surround the facility. The facility representatives have made several attempts to capture the animal, but\nhave been unable to do so. Improper handling practices (i.e. leaving the doors open during cleaning) led to the\nescape of the fox. An animal escape can cause severe distress, trauma and/or physical harm to the animal.\nHandling of all animals must be done as carefully as possible and in a manner that cannot lead to an animal escape\nwhich can cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort for the animal.\nTo be corrected from this day forward.\nInspection and exit briefing conducted with a facility representative."
