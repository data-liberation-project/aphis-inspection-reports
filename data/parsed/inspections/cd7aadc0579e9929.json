The procedure was necessarily conducted in a darkened room. The animal was noted\nto have respiratory distress and the veterinarian was notified, but the animal expired in spite of resuscitation efforts.\nIt was found that the pop-off valve on the anesthesia machine was left closed and went unnoticed in the darkened\nroom. This was the first of several animals scheduled to be imaged, but the remainder of the studies that day were\ncancelled.\nSince the event and prior to resumption of study activities, the anesthesia machines have been modified so that the\npop off valve cannot be left closed - it must be held closed for pressure checking the machine, and it automatically\nreturns to the open state when the operator releases hold on the fitting.\nCorrect by: This non-compliance was corrected as described prior to the time of inspection.\nAn adverse outcome was reported in early July 2013. On June 27, 2013, a total of twenty-one rhesus macaques\nwere hospitalized and six animals died or were euthanized from a previously stable breeding group of 260 animals\nhoused outdoors in a one-acre corral. All of the animals were injured as a result of fighting within the group. They\nconcluded that the event was likely the result of displaced aggression triggered by construction activity - noise and\nvibration - on land near the corral. This new construction involved frequent heavy trucks passing around the end of\nthe row of corrals. The affected corral was the last in that row, with the trucks passing just outside, along the exterior\nwall.\nThe Center responded by halting construction that day and relocating the remaining 233 rhesus macaques to\nanother outdoor corral further from the construction site. Additional enrichment was added - swimming tubs,\nbranches, treats - as well as additional monitoring by the Behavioral Services Unit, which studied behavioral trends\nand compared them to readings from five noise and vibration monitors placed around the areas of construction and\nanimal housing. They also developed housing modifications to allow for better social interaction or avoidance as\nneeded by the animals.\nCorrect by: This was corrected by responding to the event, as described, prior to the time of inspection.\nAdditionally, the facility must develop comprehensive plans to address the impact on the animals for all future\nconstruction. These plans must include logistics for animal relocation in relation to construction activity if necessary,\nincreased monitoring of the animals, and intervention to address any escalation of stress activity in the animals."

      "narrative": "A large percentage (>50%) of rhesus macaques in all different housing types have significant, non-pruritic hair loss.\nRecent response to animals with alopecia has been largely through the Behavior Sciences Unit (BSU). While\nstudies to identify potential causes in the past have been done, there is not evidence of a comprehensive clinical\ndiagnostic plan to determine underlying physical causes. The semi-annual physical examination of all of the\nnon-human primates (NHPs) at the facility was adjusted recently to include alopecia scoring; once they complete a\nfull year's data set, analysis can begin to analyze incidence by location and season to help with diagnoses.\nHair loss in NHPs is multifactorial. Physical as well as psychological components need to be considered to try and\ndetermine treatable causes. Hormonal influences are currently at their peak since it is birthing season, however\nanimals of all ages and both genders are affected. Hair loss can be a problem in that it negatively influences the\nskin protection and thermoregulation abilities of the affected animals.\nCorrect by: May 15, 2014. The NHP Resource Veterinarian stated they will have a comprehensive colony plan in\nplace in 30 days to diagnose and develop a therapy plan for treatable physical causes, to continue the behavioral\ntherapy, and to implement more complex diagnostics such as food trials or other \"response to therapy\" modalities.\nThe most severely affected must be evaluated and treated first."
