      "narrative": "Under protocol #18065, 8 hamsters were used in an imaging study, during which they are anesthetized and placed\non a heating pad. On three separate occasions, multiple hamsters have been burned, which resulted in tissue\ndamage, ranging from hairloss and redness to sloughing of an entire ear. On 4/27/18, it was noted that 2 of 3\nhamsters that had been anesthetized on 4/24/18 had evidence of trauma to their ears. On 4/30/18, it was noted that\n2 of 2 hamsters that had been anesthetized on 4/29/18 had evidence of trauma to their ears. Imaging was\ndiscontinued until the cause, a shorted heating element, was isolated and corrected. However, on 6/16/18, it was\nnoted immediately after anesthesia that 1 hamster had a severely inflamed ear, and the next day, 4 of 5 hamsters\nimaged on the same day showed evidence of tissue damage to their ears. Records indicate that corrective actions\ninclude lowering the temperature of the heating pad for future studies and placing a barrier to protect the face and\nears from coming into close contact with the heating pad. In total, 6 hamsters suffered thermal injury to the face,\nshoulder, and/or ears, of which, 2 were injured on 2 different occasions and 5 of the 6 hamsters sloughed at least\npart of an ear. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that\ndoes not cause trauma, thermal stress, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from\nthis day forward."

She was\nanesthetized and examined and determined to have multiple fractures in her leg. She was euthanized at the\nattending vet\u2019s recommendation. Because there is no documented handling between the last health check and the\nhealth check when the swollen leg was discovered, it was determined that she injured herself on the wire cage\nstructure. Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the hamsters from\ninjury. Correct from this day forward.\nNo regulated species were present at the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC Administrator."
