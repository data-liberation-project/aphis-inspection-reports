He said he needed them signed and dated because\n\"you people lie and we need this to show the judge how incompetent you are.\" The USDA inspector stated he\nwould not sign the photos.\nIt was discovered during this exit interview that a non-compliant item listed under Section 3.129 was spilled duck\nfeed (present in the kangaroo enclosure for the co-housed ducks) rather than spilled kangaroo feed. In order to\nensure the report was accurate, the USDA inspector stated he would remove the citation. The facility\nrepresentative then said he was going to keep the draft report with the error and wanted a new one created. The\nUSDA inspector explained that the correction would mean the original was not a final report and that the draft was\nonly used for review and to ensure it was correct. He then said he wanted to keep the draft report and would not\nreturn it. He said he wanted this to show the judge all the mistakes that the USDA makes. The USDA inspector\nthen printed the corrected copy of the inspection report, completed the review of the report with the facility\nrepresentative, and asked if the facility representative would sign it. The facility representative then said (cid:28)I will sign\nit if you man up and sign the photos I want signed.\" The USDA inspector stated that he would only sign the\ninspection report. The facility representative left the room and said he needed to talk to the licensee. He returned\nin approximately 10 minutes and said they were keeping the original report and if the USDA inspector refused the\nsign the photos he was going to get a video camera to record a statement from the USDA inspector stating why he\nwould not sign the photos. At that time, the USDA inspector advised the facility representative that the exit interview\nwas over and that the inspection report would be delivered by certified mail. The USDA inspector also explained to\nthe facility representative that a citation under Section 2.4 would be added to this report for interference of the\ninspection process. He then said, \"Fine. Put it on there. Just be sure you say what happened.\"\nA licensee or representative shall not interfere with any APHIS official in the course of carrying out his or her duties.\nThe facility representative(cid:25)s actions during this exit interview interfered with the completion of the inspection process\nand made it impossible to ensure a correct copy of the facility inspection report was delivered during the exit\ninterview. His comment about using the draft report and photos to show the incompetence of the USDA inspectors\nin court was an attempt to intimidate the USDA inspector and therefore interfered with the inspection process. The\ninspection process requires a working relationship between the USDA and the facility and interference makes this\nprocess difficult to impossible.\nCorrect by: Immediately"

Ocular\nconditions are painful and these eye conditions left untreated can lead to worsening of the condition and loss of\nvision as well as unnecessary pain and suffering in the animals. Both of these goats require veterinary attention to\ndetermine the cause of and recommended treatment of these eye problems. Correct this by having these animals\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian no later than June 6, 2014 and following all treatment recommendations.\nDocumentation of this examination and treatments must be maintained for future examination by APHIS officials.\nTwo black faced white Suffolk-type Sheep (#305 and #310) have overgrown front feet. These sheep were housed\nin the production barn. Both of these sheep have front feet that are overgrown to the point that the claws are\nbeginning to cross.

Correct by ensuring that these animals have routine foot care (such as\ntrimming) provided no later than June 11, 2014 and farther, by ensuring that all routine husbandry and veterinary\nprocedures are provided in the future.\nOne black faced white Suffolk-type Lamb (#160) housed in the production barn has a swollen red mass between the\ndigits of the front left foot. This mass is bright red and is moist in appearance. This sheep is currently walking\nnormally and does not appear lame at this time. This type of lesion can result from both infectious and\nnon-infectious causes, which left untreated, can worsen resulting in lameness or fly-strike of the affected area.\nVeterinary examination is necessary to determine the proper course of treatment.

This animal(cid:25)s spine and ribs are very evident even\nwhen viewed from a distance. Weight loss and poor body condition can indicate the presence of many underlying\nmedical conditions including dental problems, heavy parasitism, and numerous other infectious and non-infectious\ncauses.
