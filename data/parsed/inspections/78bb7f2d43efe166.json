The licensee had\nnot identified this condition and therefore had not consulted the veterinarian for treatment.\n\u2022 The left eye of a gray and brown rabbit was white and opaque. The top and bottom eyelids of the left eye were\nmoderately reddened. The rabbit maintained the left eye half-way closed. The licensee explained that the rabbit was\nacquired with this eye condition, but the veterinarian had not been consulted.\nFailure to promptly identify diseases/injuries as well as failure in seeking veterinary guidance for pre-exiting conditions\ndelays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in animals with such conditions. The licensee must ensure\nthorough daily observation of all animals as well as timely communication with the attending veterinarian in order to\nprovide proper diagnosis and medical attention. The currently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an\nappropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.\nTo be corrected by April 11, 2022."
