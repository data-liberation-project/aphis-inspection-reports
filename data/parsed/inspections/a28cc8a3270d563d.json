Examples of\ndiscrepancies are listed below:\n-The PVC for the raccoons states that rabies vaccinations are to be administered annually for the 23 raccoons. No\nrecords of annual vaccinations for these animals were available during this inspection and could not be verified by the AV.\n-The PVC for the nondomestic cats (5 bobcats, 1 Eurasian lynx, 2 caracals, 1 serval) states that FVRCP, FELV and\nRabies vaccinations are to be administered annually. No records of these vaccinations were available during this\ninspection and could not be verified by the AV.\n-The PVC for the nondomestic canids (8 red fox, 4 arctic fox, 6 adult coyote) states that the following vaccinations are to\nadministered annually: DHLPP, Bordetella and Rabies. No records of vaccination were available during this inspection\nand could not be verified by the AV.\n-Per the PVC, all raccoons (23), nondomestic cats (5 bobcats, 1 Eurasian lynx, 2 caracals, 1 serval), nondomestic canids\n(8 red fox, 4 arctic fox, 6 adult coyotes) and 3 lemurs are to be treated with a monthly topical ectoparasiticide. No records\nof monthly treatments were available during this inspection and could not be verified by the AV.\n-The PVC indicates that intestinal parasite screening is to be conducted every 6 months for the raccoons (23),\nnondomestic cats (5 bobcats, 1 Eurasian lynx, 2 caracals, 1 serval), and nondomestic canids (8 red fox, 4 arctic fox, 6\nadult coyotes). No records of these screenings were available during this inspection and could not be verified by the AV.\n-The PVC states that annual heartworm tests are to be conducted for the 8 red foxes and 4 arctic foxes. No records of\nthese screening tests were available during this inspection and could not be verified by the AV.\nThe PVC is dated 2016 and contains many species that are no longer present at the facility (African Crested Porcupine,\nNorth American Porcupine, mongoose, coati, badger, hedgehog, sugar glider, groundhog, cavy, capybara, javelina,\nCanadian lynx, sand cats, chinchilla, wallaby). The PVC does not list opossum as a species, but there are at least 3\nopossum on the premises.\nHaving a PVC that is inaccurate, is not up to date and most importantly, is not being followed by the AV and licensee can\nsignificantly impact the health and welfare of the animals at a facility.\nThe regulations state that (a) Each dealer or exhibitor shall have an attending veterinarian who shall provide adequate\nveterinary care to its animals in compliance with this section.\n(a)(1) Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-\ntime attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of\nveterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor; and\n(a)(2) Each dealer and exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the\nprovision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.\nCorrect by 16August2023."

Its hip\nbones and ribs were readily visible from outside the enclosure. The Body Condition Score for this animal is 1 of 5 (with 3\nbeing ideal weight), The licensee had not observed the poor condition of the cat and had not discussed its condition with\nthe Attending Veterinarian (AV) (confirmed with AV). The unthriftiness and thinness of the cat are considered indicative of\nsignificant underfeeding, improper diet, and/or illness. In addition, all bobcats on the premises were noted to be\nexceptionally thin with BCS ranging from 1.5 to 2 of 5 (with 3 being ideal weight).\n-One wolf hybrid (Eclipse) was observed to have a hairless, scabbed patch of skin along its dorsum. The patch was\nestimated to be approximately 5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. The animal was observed scrubbing its back along the\nfence line trying to scratch the affected area. The licensee stated that the animal was under the care of the AV and that\nthey were applying medication daily per the AV\u2019s direction. There were no medical records or medications present at the\nfacility to indicate treatment. The AV was consulted, and no records were available indicating that the AV was aware of\nthe skin condition and had not prescribed medication for this condition.\n-One wolf hybrid (ID 06) was observed by the inspector to be lame on its right front limb. It was observed to limp\nintermittently and gingerly placed that paw to the ground when in motion. The animal lifted and carried that leg when\nstanding still. The licensee stated that they were unaware of the lameness and had not consulted the AV at the time of\ninspection. The AV stated that they were unaware of this lameness.\nNot conducting adequate daily observations on each animal at the facility and reporting these findings to the AV can result\nin animals experiencing untreated injuries or significant declines in health conditions.\nThe regulations state that each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that\ninclude Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being; Provided, however, That daily observation\nof animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of\nanimal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by conducting and reporting daily observations to the AV and by providing adequate veterinary care by\n02August2023."

The inspector is 5\u20195\u201d tall and sections of the fence were \nmeasured to be level with their head.  \n \nNot having adequate fencing around nondomestic canids can result in escape of the animals.  \n \nThe regulations state that all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter \nfence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially \ndangerous animals, such as, but not limited to, large felines (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc.), bears, wolves, \nrhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator.  \n \nCorrect by 02August2023. \n3.130  Direct\n   \nWatering. \nOne bobcat was observed to drink water for 9 minutes during observation by the inspector. The inspector did not observe \nan empty water bowl, as the cleaning staff was rapidly cleaning enclosures and filling water bowls before the inspector \ncould observe the area conditions. The extended period of water consumption is indicative of a lack of water being \nprovided as frequently as required to maintain adequate hydration and may indicate the potential for an undocumented \nillness.  \n \nNot providing adequate water on an as-needed basis can result in animals suffering from dehydration, as documented by \nthe excessive drinking behavior observed during this inspection.  \n \nThe regulations state that if potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as \nnecessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, \nand type of the animal. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. \n \nCorrect by 19July2023. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. \n \n n",
