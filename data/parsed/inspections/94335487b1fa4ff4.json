Despite increased daily observations and the addition of\ncameras within the habitat, the bird was declared missing/deceased on August 5, 2025. Employees were unable to\nvisualize this animal since July 18, 2025. Additionally, one Wood thrush was noted missing from its habitat on September\n12th, 2025. The staff identified an approximate 4 x 4 inch round hole in the front corner of the habitat that was not present\nthe night before. While the facility\u2019s investigation of both events showed no evidence of feather loss, predation, or pest\nactivity, the staff increased surveillance, observations, and housekeeping measures immediately following each event.\nCompromised housing enclosures can provide a route of escape, entrapment, or injury to the animals contained therein.\nThese animals are more vulnerable to harm and further injury when they are not safely contained or cannot be accounted\nfor. The facility must ensure that bird enclosures are maintained in good repair, protect the birds from injury, contain the\nbirds, and restrict other animals from entering that may negatively affect the welfare of the birds housed within.\nCorrective actions were taken by the facility following these occurrences.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
