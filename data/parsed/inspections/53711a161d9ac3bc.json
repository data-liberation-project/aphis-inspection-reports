This dog's left\neye is red with large blood vessels present in the white of the eye, and on the surface of the eye over the iris there is a\n~2mm-diameter black nodule with blue cloudy discoloration of the remainder of the eye. There is no ocular discharge and\nthe dog is not squinting, but the eye does appear smaller than the opposite eye. This dog was seen and diagnosed with a\ncorneal ulcer by the veterinarian and prescribed an ophthalmic ointment on 19 January 2022. The veterinary record says\nto have the eye re-checked 7 days from that time if not resolved. No additional medical records were available at the\nfacility, so the inspector contacted the veterinarian to ask about follow-up. The veterinarian said they had not re-examined\nthis dog, and given a description of the eye's current appearance, they are not satisfied with the current treatment and\nwould like to re-evaluate and pursue further diagnostics and/or treatments.\nFollow-up care such as status updates, re-examination, and further diagnostic and treatment methods are part of\nproviding adequate veterinary care. Even though treatment was initially given as prescribed, the amount of time elapsed\nsince the veterinarian wanted to re-check the eye if not resolved is inappropriate and not consistent with adequate\nveterinary care given the dog's current condition. Correct this by ensuring appropriate methods are used to diagnose and\ntreat diseases & injuries as they occur through to their resolution, including re-examination and follow-up care as\nprescribed by the veterinarian in the case of longer-lasting conditions.\nCorrect by: 18 February 2022\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee's wife.\nEnd Section"
