      "narrative": "On 9 March 2017 an adult sheep underwent a cardiac bypass procedure under \"protocol C.\" This sheep was\neuthanized by the veterinary staff on 13 March 2017 for complications. \"Protocol C\" was not approved for survival\nsurgeries or the cardiac bypass that was conducted on the sheep. Since Protocol C contained no survival surgeries,\nthe IACUC had not reviewed requirements for after care such as recovery, analgesia, post-operative monitoring.\nFollowing the animals death, lab personnel tried to transfer the deceased animal to another approved protocol\nwhich contained a cardiac bypass and recovery. The incident was investigated by the IACUC and according to\nfacility documentation the change was made by lab staff post-mortem to avoid noncompliance.\nOn 3 March 2017 another incident was noted involving a lamb was scheduled under \"protocol A\" for a cardiac\ndevice implant. After the animal had been anesthetized and prepped for surgery it was decided by the investigator\nthat animal was not a candidate for the \"protocol A\" surgery. The animal was recovered from surgery and several\nweeks later the investigator decided to use this animal under \"protocol B\" in which a by-pass would be conducted.\nThis animal was not approved for transfer between \"protocol A\" and \"protocol B\" prior to the surgery being\nconducted. The by-pass conducted is not an approved procedure under the protocol in which the animal was\nassigned.\nThe university has re-trained staff and created several safeguards to help prevent future re-occurrence. Under the\ncurrent Veterinary Verification and Consultation SOP, the veterinary staff will review animal transfers at least 24\nhours in advance of the procedure.\nProcedure conducted by investigators that are unapproved by the IACUC may lead to unnecessary pain and\ndistress for the animals. IACUC must review and approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or withhold\napproval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.\nCorrect by: 13 June 2017"
