      "narrative": "**** In building #2 there was a female Shih-Tzu (chip# 941000016564114) with a discharge surrounding both eyes.\nThe hair appeared to be wet and darkened in a streak-like fashion encircling both eyes. Upon closer observation,\nthe fluid-like discharge was cloudy and pink in color. Clumps of dark brown to black material were observed in the\nhair surrounding the eye and appeared concentrated in the corner of the eye. Also, the eyes appeared watery and\nthe pink tissues lining the eyelids (conjunctiva) appeared to be mildly inflamed. Upon further examination this dog\nalso had an accumulation of brown material coating over 50% of the surface of all of her teeth. The gum line had\nreceded up and away from the cheek teeth exposing a 1/2cm of a tooth root on the upper right hand side. These\nsigns are consistent with the presence of dental disease, can be painful, lead to the development of other health\nproblems, and can inhibit the ability of the animal to eat normally. According to the licensee, he had not noticed this\ndog's condition until it was pointed out by the inspectors. The licensee scheduled an appointment with the attending\nveterinarian in the afternoon, the same day as the inspection to get the animal evaluated, diagnosed, and treated.\n**** In building #2 there was a female Bichon Frise (chip# 497F301973) with a matted shut right eye and the globe\nof the eye wasn't visible due to the excessive matting in the hair on the eye. While observing the dog's eyes, the\ndog would frequently move its head from side to side. There was debris in the hair on and surrounding the eye,\nblocking view of the eye. Clumps of brown to tan material were observed in the hair obscuring the eye. The\nattending veterinarian had been contacted and an appointment was made for later that day.\n* The watery eyes and/or discharge and matting on or around the eyes could be the result of injury, infection or\nother veterinary condition which may cause discomfort. The licensee must have these animals examined in order to\nensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed.\n-- All non compliant items from the previous inspection on 4/30/15 had been corrected:\n2.40 (b)(2),the medication was removed\n3.1 (c)(3) the floors of each of the enclosures had been cleaned\n3.1 (f) the building with the drainage issues had been removed from the premises and a piece of plastic was added\nto the wash downs on building #6 in order to prevent the feces and waste from collecting on the ground\n3.6 (a)(2)(I) the building with the wire issues had been removed from the premises, and\n3.11 (a) the excessive waste build up under the outdoor enclosures had been cleaned.\nInspection and exit interview was conducted with Brittany Light, ACI, Debbie Cunningham, VMO and the facility\nrepresentative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCunningham Debbie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
