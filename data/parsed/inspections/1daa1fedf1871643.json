      "narrative": "As approved in protocol 17-003, the investigator performs a major operative survival procedure followed by a major\noperative terminal procedure on armadillos. The armadillos are frequently acquired from a different facility with an\nimplanted ibutton device intra-abdominally. The protocol contains measures for an additional procedure to retrieve\nthe ibutton if the previous investigator needs them returned before surgical procedures can be scheduled. The\nprotocol is not clear in its description of ibutton retrieval but upon questioning, it became clear that the retrieval\nprocess must enter the abdominal cavity. Procedures that enter the abdominal cavity are major operative\nprocedures. Under this protocol, three armadillos, DN92 on 7/11/18 and DN91 and DN94 on 7/12/18, underwent\ntwo major operative procedures from which they were allowed to recover before undergoing a 3rd terminal\noperation. No animal shall be used in more than one major operative procedure from which it is allowed to recover\nunless justified in writing for scientific reasons, required for routine or emergent veterinary care, or approved by the\nAPHIS administrator. If protocols are unclear, the IACUC shall take measures to clarify as needed, to determine if\nproposed activities use animals in more than one survival procedure without written justification or administrator\napproval. Correct from this day forward."

      "narrative": "In review of the IACUC meeting minutes and reports over the last year, there has been no annual review of current\nand continuing protocols. The IACUC inspects the facility and reviews the care of the animals but does not review\nthe protocols nor associated procedure records in order to identify any deviations. For example, Protocol 17-003\nstates that armadillos will be euthanized during a terminal surgery with an overdose of barbiturate. However, two\narmadillos, DN87 on 3/30/18 and DN85 on 3/31/18, were euthanized at the completion of the procedure by\nadministering an overdose of the anesthetic drug Propofol. Propofol overdose is not a method of euthanasia that\nhas been approved by the IACUC for this protocol. Without continued oversight and review of activities involving\nanimals by the IACUC, the welfare of research animals may be jeopardized as a result of unidentified deviations\nand unmonitored activities. The IACUC shall conduct continuing reviews of all activities in covered species at least\nannually. Correct from this day forward.\nThis inspection was conducted with the principal investigator and the exit interview was conducted with the\ninstitutional research compliance officer.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBoone Bonnie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
