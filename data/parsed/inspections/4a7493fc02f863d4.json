Structures which do meet the strength requirements for the species housed, or\nare not properly maintained, may pose a risk for animal escape, injury or death.\nCorrective actions should address both the reinforcement/securing of panels in the farrowing pen to prevent further\nescapes, and the securing of floor drainage grates to prevent exposure to drainage pits in the event of a possible\nescape.\nCorrect by 04-14-2018 and prior to further animal usage.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Chief Operating Officer and Clinical Research\nVeterinarian.."
