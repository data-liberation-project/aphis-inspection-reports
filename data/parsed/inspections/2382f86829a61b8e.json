      "narrative": "An excessive accumulation of feces was stuck to the fiberglass floor and PVC cage furnishings in multiple guinea\npig enclosures in Rooms 135 and 136. Some enclosures were noted to have dried fecal debris stuck in the seam at\njunction of the floor and sides of the enclosures. A film of unidentified dried residue was also noted on the interior\nwalls of two enclosures.\nThe facility houses multiple guinea pigs per enclosure with a partially solid floor and minimum of bedding material.\nExcreta and debris is sticking to solid surfaces and is not being cleaned frequently enough to prevent excessive\naccumulation. Additionally, the facility SOP for complete cage change out states it will be done weekly but\npersonnel stated cage changes were only being done every other week.\nPrimary enclosures for guinea pigs must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of\ndebris and excreta. Adequate cleaning will prevent soiling of the animals, minimize disease hazards and reduce\nodors. The facility indicated the current enclosures may be replaced with a style that will facilitate updated\nhusbandry practices. In the meantime, cleaning should occur more frequently under current housing conditions.\nCorrect by: April 24, 2017.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Vice President."
