These\ncontainers were away from the wall which allowed for the accumulation of discarded nesting material and feathers to build\nup behind it. Located on the lids were minor amounts of bird droppings. Storing feed containers this way, encourages\nbirds to perch above them. The combination of bird droppings, feathers, and discarded nesting materials, makes it difficult\nto maintain a clean area around the food supply. Supplies of food, including food supplements, bedding, and substrate\nmust be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies.
