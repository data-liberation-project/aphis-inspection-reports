The macaques had been shifted into the adjacent run through a connecting tunnel the previous day to\nallow their enclosure to be cleaned. They were then shifted back into their primary enclosure. There was no\nobservation made at that time that a macaque was missing. It could not be determined upon facility review how the\nmacaque accessed the adjacent enclosure. Because it could not be determined how the macaque got out of her\nenclosure and into the other enclosure additional husbandry procedures have been put in place, as well as\nadditional training in the procedures.\nAll animals shall be handled in a manner that will minimize distress and protect them from injury. The corrective\nand preventive measures instituted after the incident appear to be appropriate.\nCorrected.\nThe exit briefing conducted with the Institutional Official and other facility representatives on 9/24/2015.
