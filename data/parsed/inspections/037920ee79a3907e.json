      "narrative": "There was a male white poodle (microchip # OAO-327-6515, DOB 2008) with severe dental tartar, sores on both\nfront feet and excessive matting. Severe dental tartar and creamy yellow discharge was observed on both sides\n(left/right) and the upper/lower cheek teeth. Gum tissue was bright red, puffy and pulling away from the tooth root.\nBoth front feet had open wounds approximated the size of a pea on the top of the foot. The area of the wounds\nwere wet, red and swollen. Matting of the fur was loosely over the body of the poodle with tighter, heavier and more\nsoiled matting around the front feet. The mats were varying in size but all of them on the feet were wet and dark\nmaterial was present with in the mats. Excessive matting with thick wet, dark oily material was seen on the edge of\nboth ears and inner ear flaps.\nThere was a chocolate and white chihuahua (microchip # OAO-271-6111, DOB 2010) with severe dental tartar.\nSevere dental tartar and creamy yellow discharge was observed on the upper/lower right canine teeth. Gum tissue\nwas bright red, puffy and pulling away from the tooth root. The rest of the teeth were not present.\nThere was a female English Bulldog (DOB 2009, named Helen) observed squinting. The inner eyelids were vibrant\nred, swollen and excessively tearing with a yellow brown discharge encompassing the outer eyelids. The white\nportion in both eyes was severely bloodshot. The surface of both eyes were moderately cloudy.\nThere was a female English Bulldog ( DOB 2015, named Violet) observed consistently squinting her right eye. At\ntimes she would completely close her eye with excessive blinking.The inner eyelid was red and swollen. She pulled\nher head away when trying to examine the eye closer. Mild cloudiness was observed throughout the surface of the\nright eye.\nThere was a male English Bulldog (DOB 2014, named Zazu) with patchy, swollen, red and hairless regions on both\ncheeks, neck and both front feet. On the right cheek was an irregularly shaped dark, yellow, crusty region\napproximately 2 centimeters in diameter. The entire muzzle, chin and neck, down to chest bone was moist, sticky,\nswollen, hairless and severely red in color. Both front feet were warm to the touch, severely red, and swollen large\npatches of hair loss.\nThe licensee stated all 5 dogs were microchipped but the reader was non-functional. He supplied two of the\nmicrochip numbers from paper records.\nVeterinary care issues such as those listed above can cause pain and discomfort to the animals and can lead to\nfurther health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian for proper diagnosis and an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be\ndocumented and made available to the inspectors upon request."
