Staff discovered the escapes and injuries the\nfollowing morning: ID# UG1389 sustained lacerations and fractures on the right foot requiring amputation of two toes; ID#\n8344164188 sustained lacerations to the face and left hand, and severe trauma to the right hand which required\namputation of a finger; ID# 40618 received a skin laceration on the left arm. All animals recovered with veterinary care,\nand the registrant instituted new procedures, purchased new locks and held training sessions for all staff working with\nnon-human primates at the facility.\nFailure to ensure these non-human primates were secure resulted in escapes and serious injuries.\n***On 01/28/2025, a clinical staff veterinarian supervised a technical skills and euthanasia training session for veterinary\ntechnicians using an anesthetized, six-year old female cynomolgus macaque (ID# 3379843401). At the end of the\nsession, the veterinarian and one of the veterinary technicians confirmed the absence of respiration and heartbeat, but did\nnot perform a secondary, physical method of euthanasia as preferred in the facility's standard operating procedure for\nLarge Animal Euthanasia (SOP# ACL-2112.2). According to the supervising veterinarian, the animal was placed in a\nsealed bag and and inside a refrigerator to await necropsy, then the veterinarian returned to the procedure room a short\ndistance down the hallway. Necropsy staff removed the animal moments later, and facility correspondence states that the\nanimal \"...exhibited signs of respiration and a heartbeat...\". Necropsy staff immediately notified the veterinarian, who\nquickly returned to the necropsy room to administer an additional, effective dose of euthanasia solution. The veterinarian\nand necropsy staff then confirmed cessation of respiration and heartbeat, and necropsy staff immediately commenced\nnecropsy. The veterinarian stated that the time elapsed between the first euthanasia attempt and successful euthanasia\nwith definitive confirmation of death was only approximately five minutes, and that the animal never exhibited movement,\nvocalized or showed any further signs of consciousness; however, failure to employ sufficient measures to ensure certain\neuthanasia prior to placing the animal in a biobag and refrigerator resulted in the animal potentially beginning to revive\nand could have caused it to experience unnecessary distress and discomfort or pain. Following this incident, the registrant\nrevised their Large Animal Euthanasia SOP to require application of a secondary, physical method of euthanasia and\ndelivered training to all veterinary staff involved with large animal euthanasia.\nThe registrant must continually ensure that all employees who work with non-human primates are trained and capable of\nperforming tasks as expeditiously and carefully as possible, to avoid trauma, behavioral stress, harm and discomfort, as\nwell as prevent escapes and ensure proper euthanasia.\nCORRECTED BEFORE THE TIME OF THIS INSPECTION ON 5/21/2025"
