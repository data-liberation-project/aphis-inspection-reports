Both sides explained that such a visit does not\noccur regularly and has not happened in a long time, at least more than one year.

The attending veterinarian confirmed not having been made aware of\nany of the following occurrences:\no A Bengal tiger, Sheila, has 2 small circular red hairless lesions on her left hind limb. They are both approximately the\nsize of a penny, one on her thigh and the other at the top of her foot (hock). A consulting veterinarian pointed this out to a\nfacility representative and indicated it might need further investigation.\no A white-faced capuchin named Calvin is being given medications every 6 to 8 hours instead of every 12 hours as\nindicated in the instructions. Per a facility representative, a consulting veterinarian approved this change in time interval.\no The Bengal tiger Sheila is now being fed mostly boneless meat per the guidance of a consultant since per a facility\nrepresentative she did not eat the bone and seemed to have some difficulty eating bone-in meat. All the other wild cats\nare now fed a mix of boneless and bone-in meat instead of all bone-in meat per the recommendation of the same\nconsultant.\no The black bear, Tuffy, is being given medications in peanut butter sandwiched by 2 graham crackers again per the\nrecommendation of a consultant.\n- The attending veterinarian also stated not having reviewed or approved the diet composition or supplements currently\nfed to any of the wild cats housed at the facility.\nWhen the veterinarian is not given the appropriate authority, the provision of veterinary care may be inadequate or\ninappropriate.

The attending veterinarian explained\nrequesting a keeper\u2019s assistance from the facility in order to restrain the primate and perform an aspirate of the mass. The\nfacility planned on scheduling the procedure but due to scheduling issues, failed to do so. No further communication was\nhad on the topic and the primate remained as is with a facility representative explaining that they are monitoring the\ncondition.\n- The facility identified certain animals in need of care and planned on consulting on some items with other veterinarians\nbut did not communicate the findings with the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was not aware of the\nfollowing:\no The lion liberty being overweight. A consulting veterinarian stated having discussed this with the facility.\no A black and white pot belly pig with his abdomen hanging very low, almost dragging on the ground. The facility identified\nthis condition and scheduled an appointment with another consulting veterinarian for examination.\n- Ongoing communication with the attending veterinarian about the progress or change in condition of animals with\nchronic ailments is not occurring. The current state of the tiger Sheila and the black bear Tuffy, both with pre-existing\nchronic conditions, have not been communicated with the attending veterinarian for the establishment of a plan for future\ntreatments or ongoing progress updates:\no The tiger Sheila was prescribed by the attending veterinarian a supplement for arthritis approximately 3 months ago.\nSince, per a facility representative, Sheila is more mobile, but her gait continues to be abnormal. During inspection, she\nwas seen walking slowly, deliberately, putting one paw down completely before lifting the other. While walking, Sheila\u2019s\nback was hunched and the top of her hind feet (the hocks) were dropped on both sides, touching the ground with each\nstep. The attending veterinarian was not aware of this gait and explained it to be different from what she had seen before.\nShe expressed the need to examine the animal for diagnosis and to develop a treatment plan.\no The black bear Tuffy was also prescribed by the attending veterinarian medication for his arthritis approximately 3\nmonths ago. Per a facility representative, he is more mobile and active but he continues to have an abnormal gait. During\ninspection, the bear was seen walking slowly with his left front foot in a continuous state of extension and swaying his\nhead slightly after every step and when standing. Tuffy\u2019s right eye was also abnormal with some whiteness within the\npupil and a cloudy white ring around the Iris. When asked, the facility representative explained that he has and always\nhad cataracts. The attending veterinarian explained not having examined the bear in a long time and could not recall what\nhis eye looked like last and did not know if the condition had changed. She also did not know if the bear\u2019s gait changed\nsince prescribing the medication.\nCommunication with the attending veterinarian on newly identified animal problems is necessary to establish a plan of\naction. Furthermore, ongoing communication on pre-existing conditions is crucial in order to communicate the current\nstate of an animal for the establishment of a new treatment plan if needed or a progress update schedule. The lack of\nfrequent and direct communication between the facility and the attending veterinarian could lead to a delay in treatment\nfor animals in need. A more rigorous as well as effective mechanism of direct and frequent communication must be\nestablished so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to\nthe attending veterinarian.

The facility must ensure an 8-foot-high perimeter fence for dangerous\nanimals and a 6-foot-high fence for non-dangerous animals as well as non-human primates.

In addition, a Bengal tiger named Sheila is also being given less than half the required\namount of supplement even though she is mostly being given a bone-less diet since per a facility representative she does\nnot eat bone. Therefore, this supplement is the main source of calcium for Sheila yet she is being given a severely low\ndose for her requirements. The bone content in the diet as well as the amount of supplement added for each animal was\nnot discussed with or approved by the attending veterinarian.\nFeed contaminated with rot or mold may be unwholesome as well as unpalatable to the animals and could result in\nillness. Underdosing animals on supplements containing vital nutrients such as calcium without prior consultation with a\nveterinarian may negatively impact their health and overall well-being of the animals.
