The licensee indicated that he was traveling on the road with one of\nhis animals. At that time the Animal Care regional offices had not received an itinerary from the licensee prior to\novernight travel. The lack of a required itinerary was also noted on the inspection reports dated 10/18/2016,\n4/28/2016, 6/16/2015, 8/20/2014 and 11/3/2014. The absence of an itinerary inhibits inspection for compliance with\nregulations and standards of the Act while the animals are away from the home facility.\nThe licensee must submit an itinerary to the Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever\nthe animals will be exhibited at a location other than the approved site(s) and whenever travel extends overnight.\nThe itinerary shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of all animals intended\nfor exhibition at any location other than the approved site.\nNote: This inspection report was sent by standard and certified mail.\nAdditional Inspectors\nWelch Scott, Veterinary Medical Officer"
