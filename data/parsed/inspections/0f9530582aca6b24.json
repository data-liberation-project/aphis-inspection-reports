The deer did not bear full weight on that limb, frequently\ntouching only the front of that hoof on the ground. The deer also had an ~0.5\u201d circular area about an inch under the left\neye that is pink and appears wet. The facility representative stated that the animal had injured itself when frightened and\ntrying to escape the pen during the evening of the 4th of July fireworks. The representative noted the swelling the week\nprior but said that he was now seeing that it had become larger since he first noted it. The veterinarian was not contacted\nbefore the inspection, but the facility representative immediately called the veterinarian to arrange an evaluation of the\ndeer.\nFailure to report health issues when detected can result in a delay in appropriate care and potentially worsening\nillness/injury or even death.\nThis animal needs to be evaluated by the veterinarian at the earliest opportunity, and the licensee must establish and\nmaintain a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of\nanimal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nTo be corrected by 07/17/2021.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nCINDY RHODES, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOREnd Section"
