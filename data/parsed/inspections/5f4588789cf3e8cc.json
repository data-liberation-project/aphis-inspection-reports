The licensee stated the dog was in a dog fight two days ago.\nAnother dog, an approximately 7 year old female poodle (microchip #900111881600916), had an open wound on its\nabdomen. I originally observed the dog sitting in the corner with a black substance on the upper part of its left rear leg.\nUpon closer observation, I observed an open wound on its abdomen and a reddish/pinkish liquid oozing/dripping off of the\ndog. In addition, the dog appeared to have a very difficult time moving around and appeared to be either extremely\nuncomfortable or in pain. The dog seemed to be lethargic.\nNot providing adequate veterinary care doesn't ensure the well being of either dog. Both dogs appear to be uncomfortable\nand in pain. Untreated open wounds can become infected and cause further problems.\nThe licensee must have both dogs examined by the attending veterinarian so that an accurate diagnosis can be made,\nand an appropriate treatment plan can be developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times by providing the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\ndiseases and injuries.\nCorrect by 7/22/25.\nNote: The licensee contacted the attending veterinarian during inspection and the attending veterinarian will be coming\nout to examine both dogs today."
