The inspector tried to explain to the licensee the site is still listed as active in the USDA database\nand subject to inspection until the Regional Official has been notified to cancel the site. The licensee yelled that \"it\nis cancelled and you were told that in Fairbanks and you shouldn\u2019t be here!\" The inspector explained that had not\nbeen the conversation in Fairbanks and again explained this site was still active. The licensee again yelled at the\ninspector in a hostile manner, \u201cYou need to leave!\u201d The inspector asked the licensee if he was refusing to have the\ninspection and he replied \u201cYes!\u201d The inspector replied \u201cOkay, you have a good day\u201d, walked back to the car and\nleft the property. The inspector left the property at approximately 2:20 pm.\nInterfering with the inspection process prevents the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal\nWelfare Act. The licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS\nofficial in the course of carrying out his or her duties.\nTo be corrected from this day forward."
