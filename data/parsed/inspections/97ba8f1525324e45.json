Five enclosures\n(containing 10 dog total) had a build up of dirt, grime and hair that was hard- packed along the edges of the\nenclosure. Various areas in the enclosures also had collections of old, wet hair, dirt and feces stuck on the cement\nflooring with flies hanging around those areas. These types of accumulations of organic matter increase disease\nhazards, can soil the dogs and encourage insects/ pests that may bite or cause stress to the dogs. Licensee must\nensure that the enclosures are cleaned at least daily to prevent accumulations of organic matter, minimize disease\nhazards and to help reduce the number of pest that may be harmful to the dogs.\n** To be corrected by: 10/26/16\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative."
