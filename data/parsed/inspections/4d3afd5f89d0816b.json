The rust is rough to the touch and\npitting the metal. During the routine check on the animals last night, the licensee noted that one sugar glider had escaped\nfrom its enclosure due to a broken rusted wire creating a large enough opening to allow escape. The facility has placed\nfood and water in the building and is trying to recapture the sugar glider.\nExcessive rust will lead to loss of structural strength of the metal which can lead to injury or escape of the animals in the\nenclosure. In addition, pitted rusty surfaces cannot be cleaned and sanitized. The sugar glider enclosures must be made\nand maintained such that they are structurally sound including being free of excessive rust."
