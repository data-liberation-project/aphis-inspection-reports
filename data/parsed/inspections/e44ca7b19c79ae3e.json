The back legs were held to the right side and appeared\nunable to support the weight of the animal when walking. The muscles on the back legs appeared decreased in size and\nthe animal was dragging the back end when walking.\nA brown and white adult guinea pig in Pen 3 was observed to have difficulty walking and appeared lethargic. The animal\nwould often fall to the side and kick out the back legs trying to move. There was also hair loss and decrease in the size of\nthe muscles on the back legs and back end.\nA brown and black adult guinea pig in Pen 2 was observed with an abnormal right eye. The right eye was crusted shut\nwith yellow discharge. When the eye was gently opened, the tissues in and around the eye appeared red.\nThe licensee had not observed the health issues in these animals and was not administering any treatments.\nMasses, difficulty walking, and eye conditions can all cause discomfort and worsen if not treated in a timely manner.\nThe licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate\nplan for diagnosis and treatment."
