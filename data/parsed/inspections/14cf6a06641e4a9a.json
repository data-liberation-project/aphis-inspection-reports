I then called the partner\nagain letting him know I was at his facility and would try to wait a while before leaving the premises. I also explained\nthat If I couldn't get in contact with him to do the inspection that this visit would be considered an attempted\ninspection. At 5:40 pm I informed the person on the premises to let the partner know I couldn't wait any longer and I\nleft the premises at 5:45 pm. A responsible adult was not available and shall be made available to accompany\nAPHIS officials during the inspection process."
