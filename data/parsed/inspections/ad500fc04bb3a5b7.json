      "narrative": "The facility could not verify that the Guinea Pig primary enclosures are being adequately sanitized. The facility currently\nuses temperature-tapes to verify that the correct temperature (180 degrees Fahrenheit) is reached by the automated\nwashing systems. There have been numerous failures of this system to reach the required temperatures and numerous\nadditional weeks where the staff has failed to follow their internal procedures to test the temperatures in order to verify\nthat the washing system is functioning properly.\nTemperature tape readings record whether the cage wash reaches the required 180 degrees. Records were evaluated for\na 25-week period from January to June 2023. Although the facility\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) require\ntemperature tape to be used a minimum of weekly, during the 25-week period for which cage wash temperatures were\nevaluated, temperature tape was only used a total of 14 weeks for the Rack washer and 16 weeks for the Tunnel washer\n(missing a total of 11 weeks and 9 weeks respectively). Of the weeks that were tested, records showed that the color\nchange was incomplete (indicating a failure to reach temperature) a total of 7 times for the Rack washer system and an\nadditional 4 times for the tunnel washer system showing that the systems are failing to reach sufficient temperature a\nsignificant portion of the time. Additionally, the same SOP requires that when there is a failure of the cage washing\nsystem to reach the appropriate temperature that staff must conduct additional temp-tape monitoring of temperature every\nday for 7 days. For times where the color change was incomplete, the facility only recorded a portion of them as a\n\u201cfailure.\u201d Following an identified \u201cfailure\u201d to reach temperature, temperatures were monitored for at most an additional 1-2\ndays, demonstrating a lack of adherence to the facility\u2019s internal SOPs. When asked, the facility representative states that\nduring failures an alternate sanitization method is implemented including the use of a disinfectant (a detergent is used in a\nprevious step). The facility representative confirmed they have no means of determining whether the alternate sanitization\nmethods are occurring or not after these known failures to reach required temperatures. Based on the number of times\nthe system has failed to reach the required minimum temperature and the repeated failure of staff to follow the internal\nSOPs regarding monitoring, there are instances where cages are not being appropriately sanitized.\nInadequate sanitization could allow for the growth of disease-causing agents that may increase the risk of health hazards\ntowards the animals. Primary enclosures for guinea pigs shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water which is at\nleast 180 degrees Fahrenheit or by one of the other approved methods such as live steam or a detergent followed by a\ndisinfectant. Correct by ensuring that the primary enclosures are adequately sanitized using at least one of the three\napproved methods. If automated systems for cage washing are used, additionally ensure that those systems remain\nfunctional and are monitored regularly so that adjunctive or alternate methods are implemented in the event of\nmalfunctions.
