Several days later, the animals had not responded to the\ntreatment instituted by the PI staff, the Attending Veterinarian was notified of the issue who then treated the nile rats\nappropriately. A facility must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes a mechanism of direct\nand frequent communication to the attending veterinarian so that timely information on problems of animal health is\nconveyed to the attending veterinarian for the health of the animals. The facility has instituted several corrective\nmeasures to prevent recurrence of this issue.\nThis item has been addressed by the facility and was self-reported to USDA.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative."
