The leg had a small scab on the lower portion, the puppy did not show any signs\nof pain when touching/moving any part of the affected leg, and no signs of swelling were observed. Inspector found this\ncondition had been reported to the licensee by a caretaker late on 11/14/2024, however the licensee said it had not been\ncommunicated to the AV prior to the inspection. Lack of prompt communication with the AV doesn't ensure that an\nanimals' condition gets appropriate treatment. Adequate daily observations of animals' conditions must include prompt\ncommunication with the attending veterinarian on abnormal conditions. Ensure that abnormal observations are promptly\nreported to the attending veterinarian for evaluation so that an adequate treatment program can be started.\n***To be corrected from 11/18/2024 forward.\nNote: Licensee contacted the AV on 11/15/2024 and AV evaluated the affected puppy and initiated an appropriate\ntreatment plan before the end of the day.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
