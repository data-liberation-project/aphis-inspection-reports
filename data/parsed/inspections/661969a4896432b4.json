      "narrative": "*** An adult male coatimundi, Cody, was observed to be non-weight bearing on his right rear leg. When asked, the\nlicensee stated this animal was having climbing issues 2-3 years ago and was taken off exhibit due to possible\narthritic issues. This animal has not been recently evaluated by a veterinarian and the condition may have\nprogressed. Lameness can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical\nconditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the health and well-being of the animal.\n***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, had hair loss with red and inflamed skin on the knuckles of all four feet. This\nanimal was cited for this problem on the inspection report dated February 16, 2018. It is the APHIS inspector\u2019s\nopinion that the skin appears to be more red and inflamed than what was observed during the inspection on\nFebruary 6, 2018. The most recent veterinary exam occurred on February 11, 2018. The attending veterinarian\nrecommended in his documentation to commence a regiment of medication that will continue for 2-3 months. To\ndate this animal has not received this medication. A facility representative stated that he had noticed the animal\u2019s\ncondition getting worse and continues to itch at his feet. The fox also had excessively long nails that needed to be\ntrimmed.\n***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS\ninspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing on this limb. The\nmost recent veterinary exam occurred on May 27, 2017. The attending veterinarian recommended in his\ndocumentation that 1) more diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2)\nif the facility representatives do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the\nanimal. Currently, this animal is off exhibit but still has not received proper veterinary care for the further diagnostic\nworkup and treatment of his lameness. To date, the licensee has not followed the veterinary recommendations.\n***A male, adult Ibex hybrid, walked with an abnormal gate. The hooves on all legs were excessively long, to the\npoint that they were curling causing the toes to rotate up and out and the heel to drop. Failure to appropriately\nmaintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility\u2019s\nprogram of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail\ncare in a timely manner.\nIn addition, a few months ago the licensee wrapped this animals legs because they were bowing out and the wraps\nwere left on for too long and got wet, this caused open wounds on the legs, which are currently healing.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals\nat the facility. The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plans for the problems cited above. From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all\nanimals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the\nprogram of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries."
