While the thermostat in the room noted the temperature to be at 72.0F, the inspector\u2019s Kestrel 4000\nfound the ambient temperate to be at 79.2F and the humidity at 45%. During the inspection at 12:00 PM, the\nmajority of the floor was wet, and several small puddles of water were present in different areas of the room. There\nwas a large central drain that appeared to be functional, however the floor was covered in a layer of water. Facility\nstaff informed the inspectors that the floor had been cleaned with water and squeegeed at approximately 8:00 AM\nthat morning.\nStrong ammonia odors can cause irritation and discomfort to the animals housed in this room. Fresh air is\nnecessary to maintain the health and well-being of the guinea pigs and rabbits. Additionally, a lack of air flow can\ncontribute to moisture condensation. Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs shall be adequately ventilated to\nprovide for the health and comfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be ventilated so as to minimize\ndrafts, odors, and moisture condensation.\nTo be corrected by: October 11, 2017"
