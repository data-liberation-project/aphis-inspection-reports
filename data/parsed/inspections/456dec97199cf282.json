      "narrative": "The facility is not utilizing an effective mechanism to identify, convey, or document treatment of veterinary\nproblems with some of the animals.\n**A female Asian elephant, Nina, has been losing weight and in thin body condition since early 2013. This\nanimal lost 500 lbs during the 7-8 months leading up to the inspection, yet at the time of this inspection,\nthere was not a mechanism in place to provide timely and accurate information on this animal(cid:25)s health and\nwell-being to the consulting veterinarian in charge of her veterinary care.\n**A female pygmy hippo, Katie, was noted to be losing weight and not doing well while traveling for\nexhibition purposes in May 2014. The consulting veterinarian in charge of veterinary care for this animal\nwas contacted, and the animal was returned to the home facility and evaluated by the veterinarian on\n5/22/2014. Medication was prescribed, but there are no records to show if the treatment was given. The\nanimal was found dead on 11/14/2014 and it was determined on the necropsy that the animal was\nsuffering from chronic disease, likely related to cardiomyopathy. There is no documentation that weights\nwere obtained on the animal, and no documentation that the facility made daily observations of her\ncondition while her health was declining, and communicated those observations to the veterinarian.\nDocumentation of veterinary conditions, prescribed treatments, and chronic problems that are being\nmonitored is an important component of a functional program for adequate veterinary care as it provides a\nmechanism for communication between animal care staff and the veterinarians, and helps to ensure that\ncare is provided as directed and that the expected outcome is achieved.\n**A male llama, Bandit, was noted to have excessively overgrown hooves such that the toes, especially\nright front and left hind, were curving to the sides. The llama was under veterinary care for an eye problem\nbut there no indication or record that the overgrown hooves had been noted. Excessive growth of hooves\nchanges the angle of the toes, changes the gait, and can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs\nsuch as arthritis.\nDaily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being may be accomplished by someone\nother than the attending veterinarian, provided that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to\nconvey timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being to the\nattending veterinarian is in place.\nThe llama \"Bandit\" shall have his hooves trimmed by 1/10/2015.\nAn effective mechanism for communication of veterinary conditions, treatment, and daily observations shall\nbe established and maintained by 1/17/2015.\nInspection conducted with facility representatives and APHIS AC VMO's on 1/5-6/2014. Exit briefing\nconducted with facility representatives on 1/6/2014.\nAsian elephants inspected: Tommy, Oberto, Hugo, Rosie, Opal, Margaret, Nina, Viola, Kelly, Libby, Alta,\nLisa, Beckie, Tracy, Bunny, Suzy, Isa, Lily, Val, Zola, Lulu, Chang, Whimpy, DelRita, Isla.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCunningham Debbie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
