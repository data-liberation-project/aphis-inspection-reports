The lemur was\nwalking on three limbs and not bearing any weight on his right hindlimb. The lemur traveled the entire distance without\nextending the limb or bearing weight on it. The licensee stated that he did not know the lemur was limping and that the\nkeepers had not yet notified him of the lemurs condition. He could not say if the staff had already been to that enclosure\nfor the day but he does not require them to communicate this type of observation until they are through with their work at\nthe end of the day. Untimely communication of issues of animal health and wellbeing delays treatment that may be\nrequired and can lead to unnecessary suffering or worsening of conditions. An Adequate program of veterinary care\nrequires that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on\nproblems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian; A means of timely\ncommunication of problems concerning animal health and well being including the timely communication with the\nattending veterinarian shall be put in place to ensure the animals are provided veterinary care in a timely manner.\nCorrect by December 20, 2022."
