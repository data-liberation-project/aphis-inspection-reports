An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,\nhumidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as\nthe animal's age, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. From this day forward, all animals in\nresidence must be provided with appropriate acclimation periods and adequate shelter from weather conditions that\nmay impact their health.\nThe giraffe and lamb cited on last inspection have received veterinary care.\nThe facility had no patrons during the time of inspection.
