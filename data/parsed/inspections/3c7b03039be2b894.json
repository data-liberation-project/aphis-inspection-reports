The dog was noted scratching during\ninspection. The skin was reddened in many areas and there were multiple red bumps or lesions. The toenails were also\novergrown. ** A 2-year-old, female English Bulldog with microchip 956000013899933 was noted squinting with both eyes\nand with eyelids appearing wet. Upon closer examination both eyes had thick white-yellow discharge on the surface of the\neye and surrounding fur and the tissue around both eyes was red and swollen. The licensee has not consulted a\nveterinarian about either dog even though the problems had been noted prior to inspection. Failure to adequately assess\nand treat skin and eye problems can lead to increased and unnecessary pain and prolonged suffering. Squinting is a\nsignificant indicator of pain. Skin issues can be a result of problems such as but not limited to trauma, parasites, allergies,\nand other medical problems. The licensee must ensure that all animals showing signs of veterinary medical problems are\nevaluated in a timely manner by a veterinarian as part of the facility\u2019s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the\nfacility uses appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries. These dogs must be\nevaluated in person by a veterinarian. The outcome of this consultation including the diagnosis, treatment plan and how\nthe condition will be resolved must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.\nTo be corrected in 24 hours, by noon June 15th, 2023."
