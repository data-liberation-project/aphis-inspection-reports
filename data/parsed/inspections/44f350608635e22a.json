The fur is also long enough to cover the dog's eyes preventing it from being able to see clearly. There are\nclumps of matted fur in various sizes found on more than half of the dog's body. Around the tail and back legs there\nare clumps of dried fecal material approximately one inch by one inch matted in the hair coat. Larger areas of\nmatted fur approximately three inches by three inches are visible on the abdomen and along the neck and back.\nExcessive matting can cause pain and discomfort to the animal. In addition, matting can foster skin infections and\ncan hinder the animal's ability to move of defecate normally.\nThe licensee needs to remove the matted fur on the dog. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the\nlicensee must establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all of the dogs to prevent the\ndevelopment of excess matting.\nTo be corrected by: February 12, 2015.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative."
