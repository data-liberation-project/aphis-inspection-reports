Expired drugs\nshould be discarded appropriately and not used for the health of the animals.\n*** At least 50% of the dogs in the kennel had matted fur and long nails that need to be trimmed. Many of the mats\nwere underneath the neck and on the feet. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin which can be painful and\ncause skin irritations. In addition, long nails potentially get caught in the wire mesh. These dogs need to be groomed\non a routine basis to prevent this matting from occurring and for the comfort of the animals.\n*** A Maltese identified as # 093541339 was shaking its head and when observed closer the ears were very dirty\nwith a high potential of ear mites. Additionally this dog had a large accumulation of tarter along the teeth. This dog\nneeds to have its ears treated and a dental plan for this animal needs to be in place as appropriate methods for\npreventing and controlling these husbandry concerns.\n*** A pug with an id chip that could not be located had the beginning of a \"cherry eye\" in the left eye and the right\neye appeared to have a film on it.
