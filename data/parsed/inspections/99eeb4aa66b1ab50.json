A solid sheet metal panel in a currently-unoccupied enclosure had been raised slightly at the\nbottom, resulting in an exposed sharp end.\nThe damaged areas compromise the strength of the fencing and animals could become injured by any sharp edges,\nprotruding wires or loose nails. Additionally, an animal might escape through the gap under the fence or become\nentrapped or injured during such an attempt.\nThe facility promptly began repairing these issues during the inspection.\nA system of routine monitoring and preventative maintenance of buildings, fences and equipment must be\nestablished by the facility.\nCorrect from this point forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
