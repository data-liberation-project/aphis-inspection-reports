      "narrative": "-A female brown Poodle, \"Tiana\" (#0A02232648), was observed with significant generalized matting of the hair coat.\nThe matting was noted around the dog's face, around the eyes, along the legs, under the tail and over the dog's\nback and abdomen. A facility representative stated that the dog had been that way since they had acquired the dog\nabout three years ago. A firm large mat was noted over the dog's right shoulder. Upon closer observation, there\nwas an approximately 1.5 inch long lesion noted in the region under the firmly matted hair. The skin under the mat\nappeared smooth, and hairless with the lesion located in the middle. The lesion appeared moist and red and a wet\nmucous yellow-like material was located around the edges of the lesion. The edges of the lesion also appeared to\nbe folded inward. According to a facility representative, this dog's lesion had not been identified prior to the\ninspection and a veterinarian had not been contacted. The dog was not currently receiving any treatment. The dog's\nmatted hair could cause discomfort and can increase the risk of skin sores. The lesion on the skin over the dog's\nright shoulder could be due to injury or other veterinary condition, including matted hair, and could increase the risk\nof infection and/or discomfort.\n-A male chocolate and tan party Pomeranian, \"Rico\" (0A02171112), which was housed with three other dogs was\nconsistently holding up its left front leg when sitting and when walking. Upon closer observation of the dog's left\nfront carpal region, the skin under the hair appeared to be a darker red than compared to the dog's skin on the right\ncarpal region. The dog also pulled back when the area was touched with a gloved hand. The dog also had small\nspecks of black material throughout the hair coat on the abdomen and a few mats noted in some strands of the hair\non the abdomen. According to the licensee, the dog's limping had not been notice prior to an inspector pointing out\nthe dog's condition. The dog was not currently receiving any treatment for the lameness condition. The dog was\nalso observed to have a dental condition. The teeth had a large accumulation of yellow to dark tan/brown to black\nbuild up covering the majority of the teeth. This build up appeared heavier on both sides of the back teeth. The\ndog's gums were reddened and a greyish material was noted along the gumline along a couple of the right side of\nthe upper cheek teeth.The gums had receded along some of the teeth as well. According to a facility representative,\nthis dog's dental condition had not been identified prior to the inspection and a veterinarian had not been contacted.\nThe dog was not currently receiving any treatment. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause\ndamage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to\neat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal.\nThe licensee must remove the matted hair and communicate with a veterinarian regarding treatment for the skin\nlesion, lameness and dental condition in order to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for\nthese dogs' conditions. The licensee must ensure that the treatment plans are followed and that all animals receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by: September 6, 2019\nThis inspection was conducted with a facility representative and the exit interview was conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHeine William, Animal Care Inspector"
