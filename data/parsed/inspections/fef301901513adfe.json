  "narrative": "No animals were present at the time of inspection.\nNo non-compliant items were identified during this inspection. \n \nThe inspection and the exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nNote: There are cracks in the floor of the wet lab/teaching area that need to be repaired before animals are used in\nthe area. Surfaces need to be non-porous and able to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Also, improved pest control\nmeasures need to be implemented before the facility is used for animals - there have been wild birds accessing the\nmain animal area, and there are dead flies on the floor of the surgery room.",
