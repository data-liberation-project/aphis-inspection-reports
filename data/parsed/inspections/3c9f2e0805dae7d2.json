This wall is constructed of 8 foot high sections of wooden\nfencing and is 20 feet in width. The keeper access gate adjacent to this wall is made of a welded wire (cattle) panel\nwhich is 5 feet tall and 6 feet in width. This gate is bungee-corded to an adjacent animal enclosure and could\npotentially fail to contain the capybara.
