The dog was already out of his crate and was leashed and standing with his owner. The dog\nwas obviously too large for the crate he had just exited.\nThe crate measured 30\" long x 18\" wide x 27\" high, outside measure. The top of the dog's head, when he was\nseated in a fairly relaxed position, was approximately 32\" from the floor.\nA primary enclosure (crate, in this case) must be large enough that the animal contained in it has enough space to\nturn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position. This was not possible for\nthis dog.\nCorrect by ensuring that dogs and cats are only accepted for transport in primary enclosures that meet the\nrequirements in Section 3.14 of the regulations from now on.\nThe situation was discussed with the baggage area agent and the shift supervisor at the time of the inspection. The\ninspection included the passenger terminal and the cargo office of the airline."
