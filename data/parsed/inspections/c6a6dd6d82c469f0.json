The dog was observed to be circling his enclosure throughout the duration of the\ninspection process which can indicate psychological stress or boredom. There was no exercise plan available for\nreview at the time of the inspection. An exercise plan for the dogs at the facility needs to be developed and\ndocumented and the plan for this dog should encourage exercise through play or other similar activities to reduce\nthe amount of time circling the pen.
