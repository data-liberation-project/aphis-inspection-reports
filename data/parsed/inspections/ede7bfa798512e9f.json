There was a gap\nfound under the gate separating the enclosure from the neighboring one, which contained a Persian onager. The\nnecropsy report indicated death of the goral was due to trauma to the thorax and abdomen. According to the animal\nmanagement team, they had not believed that the gap was sufficiently large to easily accommodate an escape, and\nno report had been made in the daily observation logs stating that the gap had been identified and needed to be\nfilled in to prevent escape/entrapment. The staff immediately added more stone to fill in the gap and also placed\ncinder blocks to prevent the creation of another gap. As evident in this incident, enclosures that allow an animal to\nbecome entrapped and/or escape pose a risk of harm and injury. Enclosures must be constructed and maintained\nin good repair so as to prevent injury and to safely contain the animals housed therein.\nThis particular non-compliant item was self-identified and corrected by the facility prior to this inspection. Continue\nto correct by identifying, correcting, and documenting enclosures that are in need of repair.\nThis inspection was conducted on 4 October 2017 with the Vice President and the Director of Animal Management.\nAn exit interview was conducted on 5 October 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nNeafsey Michael, Assistant Director"
