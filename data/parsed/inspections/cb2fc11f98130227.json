However, up until August 2020, this door was kept unlocked. In August a member\nof the public was able to enter the capybara enclosure, by opening and walking through this door, in the absence of staff\npresence. This incident was confirmed by employees who reported that the animal was not injured because of this\nincident. The facility corrected this item by placing a lock on the door to prevent further entry by the public. The facility\nmust ensure that during exhibition, there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the viewing public.\nThis item has been corrected with the addition and implementation of the functioning locks that were present at the time of\nthis inspection\n2. An incident occurred in July 2020 when a small child was bitten by one of the otters during public feeding. The injury to\nthe child was minor as his/her skin was not broken. At the time, the otter was able to reach the child\u2019s fingers via the PVC\npipe that runs through the plexiglass wall. The facility has in place PVC pipe \u201celbows\u201d that run through the plexiglass\nbarrier between the otters and public. Those elbows have a 1\u2019 long PVC straight pipe that runs down the wall on the otter\nside. This straight pipe restricts the otters from gaining access to the elbow piece where they could fit through enough to\ncontact the visitor\u2019s fingers as they place food. At the time this incident occurred, one of those straight pipe pieces was\nmissing and the otter encounter was still conducted. The child placed their hand into the elbow piece and the otter was\nable to reach in and nip his fingers. The facility must ensure that during public exhibition, there is minimal risk of harm to\nthe animals and public with sufficient distance and /or barriers between the animals and public.\nThe facility has addressed this item by instructing all employees to ensure that the enclosure is secure before an\nencounter is conducted with the public."
