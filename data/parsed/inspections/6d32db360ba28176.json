However, encounters with the public\ndo not occur every day. Otters are aquatic animals and a normal behavior for them, and for which they are adapted,\nis to swim. The enclosure was not adequate to allow normal postural and social adjustments and freedom of\nmovement for this species. The licensee showed the inspectors another pen that she said they had plans to\nrenovate which had a pool. The lack of appropriate housing for this species can be detrimental to the health and\nwellbeing of the animals and could cause distress to animals. The primary enclosure needs to provide sufficient\nspace to allow an otter to make normal postural, behavioral and social adjustments with adequate freedom of\nmovement; including normal swimming behavior for the species.
