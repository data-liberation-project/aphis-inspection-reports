Goats that had been noted\nlame on prior daily observations had been removed from the display and had received treatment per the Attending\nVeterinarian (AV). Per phone conversation with the AV, the AV stated that she had not been notified of these five lame\nanimals and no corrective actions for these five animals had been initiated prior to this inspection.\nUpon observation by the owner during this inspection, the animals were removed from public display and placed in a\nheavily-bedded stall for AV consultation later that same day. Upon the inspectors\u2019 return to the facility on 3/31/2021, it\nwas confirmed that the AV had been consulted and treatment for all impacted animals had been initiated per the AV's\ndirection on 3/30/2021.\nThe lack of adequate daily observations and subsequent communications to the AV can result in increased periods of\npain and suffering in untreated animals.\nDaily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being and a mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication are required, so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-\nbeing is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
