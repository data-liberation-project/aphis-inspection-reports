We closely observed him to be walking and\neating and found him to be bright and alert but that a portion of his left hind leg was missing. The area where the\nleg would be was covered with wool so outward signs of infection or any existing wound could not be ascertained\nfrom the distance during inspection. The licensee reported that all hooves of the herd were trimmed this past\nNovember or December and that all sheep's legs were fine then, but that they were not aware that this sheep had\nlost a portion of its leg sometime between then and today. Adequate daily observations are needed to recognize\nanimal injuries such as this so that the problem could have been communicated to the attending veterinarian in a\ntimely manner.\nNon-critical:\n-An opossum's lower right gum line had a lesion. The licensee wasn't aware of this particular wound but reported\nthat it had been fighting with it's cagemate a while back. The wound is scabbed over and an area under two teeth in\nthe same area is pale in color. Observation reveals this wound is deeper than just a scratch and needs to be\nreported to the attending veterinarian so that a treatment plan can be developed.\nNote: The licensee called the attending veterinarian prior to the exit interview.\nDevelop and maintain routine daily observations so that health conditions can be communicated to the attending\nveterinarian in a timely manner.\nCorrect from this day forward."
