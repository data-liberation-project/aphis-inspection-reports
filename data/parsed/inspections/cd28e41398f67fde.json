The goat had been declining for some time, and the exhibitor had\nbeen providing additional feed and care, but the veterinarian had not been specifically consulted regarding the\nweight loss.\nThe exhibitor must ensure that all animals are observed every day, and that any problems or signs of decline are\nreported to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate diagnostics and care can be provided.\nThis goat must be evaluated by a veterinarian by the end of this day, and daily observation of all animals, with\nappropriate follow-up, should be conducted from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
