After leaving the zoo\ngrounds, the BHS was hit by a car but was able to travel to an adjoining neighborhood where it was darted and\ncaptured by zoo veterinarians and staff members. The animal died shortly after.\nFurther evaluation of the construction and layout of the exhibit and the walkway/balcony that overlooks the\nperimeter fence is needed.
