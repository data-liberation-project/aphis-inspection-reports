The ability to locate the facility's animals is important for disease monitoring.

The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2\ndays in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of\nany animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. If the exhibitor accepts an\nengagement for which travel will begin with less than 48 hours notice, the exhibitor shall immediately contact the AC\nRegional Director in writing with the required information. APHIS expects such situations to occur infrequently, and\nexhibitors who repeatedly provide less than 48 hours notice will, after notice by APHIS, be subject to increased\nscrutiny under the Act. Correct from this day forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
