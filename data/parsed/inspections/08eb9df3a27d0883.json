Upon inspection, female Cavalier #7000 was found to have hard,\nbrown-grey material encasing 60-99% of the crown of the teeth on the upper right and left sides of the mouth. The cheek\nteeth (premolars) were also found to be mobile (on both sides). The gum tissue directly above the first premolar on the\nright and left sides are red and swollen. On the upper left side of the mouth the gum tissue is receding. The licensee\nreports he was not aware of the dog\u2019s dental issues prior to today's inspection. Dental issues can cause pain and distress\nto dogs, as well as inhibit their ability to chew properly.\nThe facility also failed to adequately communicate a medical issue to the Attending Veterinarian (AV). Female Cocker\nSpaniel #8721 was observed by the facility to have a swelling on the head a few weeks ago. The swelling is located\napproximately 2 inches behind the left eyeball and is approximately 1\u201d x 1\u201d x 1\u201d. It is firm, haired, non-panful, and has a\nsmall scab on the front surface. At the time of the inspection, the facility had not sought out medical guidance by the AV\nfor this issue. The facility must establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care so that the dogs are closely\nobserved so that their health and wellness can be assessed, and have a mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication of any problems then conveyed to the AV. Correct by ensuring a veterinarian is contacted to evaluate both\ndogs. Correct by: end of business July 1, 2024."
