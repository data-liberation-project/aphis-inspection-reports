Health concerns aren't being communicated in a direct and\ntimely fashion and many of the animals' conditions are going unattended and are never addressed. There were three\ndogs at the time of the examination that needed immediate attention, not including a dog with a bite wound to the paw that\nwas identified a week prior but received veterinary care when inspectors arrived.\n\"Cotton\" is a 11 year old neutered yellow labrador retriever with an open wound to the left side of his face. The left ear\nwas also full of dark-colored debris completely covered and spilling out from beneath it. The dog was recognized by its\nexcessive head shaking. The Chair has been noting this for a while and he had not received any veterinary care.\nThe second dog was \"Daisey\" a 13 year old female pointer with her left lower canine tooth that had broken down to the\nbase of the gum leaving it exposed. She also had excessive tarter and reddened gums. This injury went unnoticed and\nthe AV had not seen the dog nor had it been reported to the IO/PI or the AV.\nThe third dog was \"Kiss\" a 12 year old female chocolate labrador retriever which had masses on the face, leg and\nbilateral masses on the abdomen area. There was a raised mass protruding from the left side of her face. On the left side\nof her body there was a subcutaneous mass about 3 in. in diameter. There was a subcutaneous mass near her right\nnipple in the abdominal area that was about 2 in. in diameter. Also a subcutaneous mass that was located on the left front\nleg that was about 2 in. in diameter. Under her neck there were several subcutaneous masses, nodular in shape, that\nwere smaller than the others noted. These masses had all been observed and reported by the Chair to the IO but there\nweren't any notes from the attending veterinarian.\nAdditionally, there was another dog, already identified by the facility, to be transported to the local veterinarian on August\n31, 2021 was \"Isa\" a female rottweiler had a bite wound to the right front paw. There were two visible puncture wounds on\nthe bottom of the paw and the skin and tissue around the wound was reddened and appeared raw and infected. The dog\nwas constantly licking the wound during the inspection.\nCotton, Daisey and Kiss were recognized by inspectors to need immediate care and they were transported to the AV\nSeptember 1, 2021 in the afternoon. Direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV. Correct immediately."
