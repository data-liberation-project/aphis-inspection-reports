Per the licensee, this animal was handled by three experienced trainers and maintained by a 5ft leather\nlead with a chain-type collar for control. The licensee confirmed that the barriers used at this event for the mountain lion\nconsisted of a mesh-type netting along sections of the back and sides of the exhibit. The front part of the exhibit included:\nsections of mesh netting, small sections with a rope and fabric cloth approximately 3-4 ft high, and a 3 ft high table with a\ndraped tablecloth. The licensee stated there were items such as boxes/crates placed under the table; however, she\nagreed that there were sections with no solid barriers placed in the front public viewing area of this exhibit. Although the\ntablecloth drapes over the table in the front part of the exhibit, there did appear to be gaps or openings under the table\npotentially large enough for an animal or small child to pass through. Members of the public appeared to be able to lean\nover the table barrier in the front as well as on occasion be within 5ft of the animal while standing directly next to the 3-4ft\nhigh rope and fabric barrier. It was noted that there were no incidents involving this animal reported at this event.\nConsidering the age, size, and strength of this species being in an unfamiliar environment and managed with a leash as\nan only barrier, this animal was handled without sufficient distance and/or barriers and posed a risk of harm to the animal\nand the public. A system of sufficient distance and/or barriers must be in place for all animals handled during public\nexhibition to assure the safety of the animals and the public. This includes all animals exhibited at public events outside of\nthe facility and at the facility including any animal interactions or experiences.\nCorrect from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nALEXANDRA ANDRICOS, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
