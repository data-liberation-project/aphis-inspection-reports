The tartar is dark brown to black\nin color and is covering the majority of the surface of both teeth. A grey line of material is located along the gum line\nof the upper right canine tooth. The licensee has a dental plan and had recently evaluated the condition of the teeth\nof all of the dogs, but had been under the impression that this particular older dog had no teeth, therefore, he had\nnot examined her.\nPoor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. The\nlicensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective\ntreatment plan.
