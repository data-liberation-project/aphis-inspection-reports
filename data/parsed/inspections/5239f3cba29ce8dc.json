The construction of the enclosures interferes\nwith the ability to effectively clean the solid walls of the enclosure. There are no exterior access points to the\nenclosures so all cleaning and sanitizing has to be done from the below the enclosures and through the wire mesh\nfloors.\nThe build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary\nenclosures, and food and water bowls daily and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to\nprevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee and ACI Bartels."
