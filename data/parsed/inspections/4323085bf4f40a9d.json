The attending veterinarian had examined the animal last fall after which the hair loss became\napparent. The veterinarian prescribed cosequin and meloxicam for lameness, but according to the director, did not\ndo bloodwork to further evaluate the animal. Bloodwork has not been done since that time, and records show that\nthe animal has had periodic episodes of vomiting since September 2015, in addition to developing hair loss. Failure\nto diagnose conditions or to followup when treatment does not correct issues can cause unnecessary discomfort,\npain or distress to the animals. Correct by having the animal examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis of hairloss\nand vomiting. Records from the veterinarian regarding diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for all animals with\nconditions (acute or chronic) must be maintained by the facility and available for review by USDA personnel. To be\ncorrected by: 27 June 2016.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility director."
