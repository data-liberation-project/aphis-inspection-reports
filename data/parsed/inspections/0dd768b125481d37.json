As this care has gone on for\nmonths, the AV must be communicated with about the continued condition of the eye for diagnosis and treatment options.\nThis communication is required to ensure the AV has adequate authority over the medical care of the birds.\n*** A male zebra \u201cZander\u201d was observed favoring and non weight bearing on his right front hoof. The facility stated that\nthe zebra has had occasional bouts of limping on this leg and was informed to just \u201cwatch and observe\u201d the animal in the\npast.
