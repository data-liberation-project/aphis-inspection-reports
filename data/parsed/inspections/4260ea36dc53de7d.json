The animal was seen ambulating on the knees and when attempting to\nweight bear on the front feet an obviously abnormal, exaggerated gait and weight shifting was apparent. The\nattending veterinarian did not diagnose the animal during a recent visit. Abnormal postures and gaits can indicate a\nserious, painful problem with the feet.\n*A mature Watusi bull, \u201cSteve\u201d exhibits a continuous dramatic head tilt or torticollis to the left side. The licensee\nstated the condition has been present for several years. The attending veterinarian was unable to make a diagnosis\nduring a recent visit. Steve also has a copious mucous discharge dripping from the left nostril. Head tilt and\ntorticollis can be indicative of infectious or non-infectious disease processes or trauma and may cause discomfort to\nthe animal.\n*A mature female dromedary camel \u201cCleo\u201d who is possibly older than 20 years, was dorsally recumbent in an open\npasture. Facility staff were requested to encourage Cleo to stand and were successful. However, the camel was\nslow to rise, appeared stiff, inflexible and when the animal attempted to walk it seemed to do so with difficulty. A\nround growth, approximately the size of a baseball, was observed at the base of her tail.\nCompromised ability to stand or walk can indicate pain, weakness or discomfort.\nThis was a focused inspection to address veterinary care noncompliances and noncompliances with expired\ncorrection dates listed in 8/3/2017 inspection. inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMoore Mary, Veterinary Medical Officer"
