Record reviews indicate that the numerical scoring system outlined in the protocol\nwas not used to assess the animals. Additionally, animals housed collectively were not individually identified in the\nrecords. Therefore it could not be verified that sequential observations were accurately recorded.\nThe facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care and use are appropriately qualified and trained.\nAnimal observations, record keeping and documentation are integral parts of humane animal use and necessary for\nassurance that animal distress will be minimized. The facility should review review personnel qualifications including\nresearch technicians and scientists. Training and instruction should be provided as needed to achieve compliance\nwith required AWA regulations and the facility protocol.\nCorrect by: October 29, 2015.\nThe inspection was conducted with the LAC manager.
