The facility must \nensure that the program of veterinary care addresses this risk.  \n \nCorrect by 27 February 2025 \n3.13(a)(4) \n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nThe program of veterinary care does not include reference to care for coats, eyes, ears, and skin. Research animals \nrequire evaluation and potentially cleaning of coats, eyes, ears and skin to ensure animal welfare and address any \npotential disease or injury. The facility must ensure that the program of veterinary care addresses care of coats, eyes, \nears and skin.  \n \nCorrect by 27 February 2025 \n3.13(b)(2) \n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nDog KOA1 (Koala) has treatment records for prednisone given for allergies starting (11/1/24) with no corresponding \nmedical records to document the examination findings or test results. While there was previously a diagnosis of allergies \nrelated to ear infections documented in medical records for this dog in 7/24, there is nothing that states what problem was \nidentified to warrant the addition of prednisone as a treatment.\n\nDog 2330467 (Pita) has documentation in his medical record of histopathology results dated 8/16/24. While there is a \nphysical exam documenting a diagnosis related to this problem 4/5/23, the medical record shows a plan of no treatment at \nthat time. There is no corresponding medical record to document this problem as it was observed in 8/24, or the change in \nthe treatment plan, or for the treatment procedure performed to collect this biopsy.  \n \nDog 2335892 (Bo) has small areas of darkened skin and hair loss on the tops of both front feet consistent with licking \nand/or a chronic skin irritation. This may indicate pain or stress. While the attending veterinarian (AV) stated he was \naware of this, the problem is not identified in the dog\u2019s medical records.  \n \nDog ZHB3 (Zeba) has multiple areas of circular hair loss with red skin on both front paws. This condition may be \nuncomfortable. While the AV is aware of this, the problem is not identified in the dog\u2019s medical record.  \n \nDog XQB3 (Qbert) has noticeable red conjunctivae (the \u201cwhites of the eye\u201d) in both eyes at the time of this inspection. \nThis dog\u2019s medical record has a diagnosis of \u201clow tear production\u201d and has an ongoing treatment plan of OptixPlus \nophthalmic ointment. Low tear production may lead to permanent eye damage and pain. However, there is no medical \nrecord entry to document that the eyes are currently red.  \n \nDog 2330815 (Randolf) has areas @ 1-2 inches in diameter of hair loss revealing red skin at or below the hock on the \noutside of each back leg. Those lesions may be painful. While the AV stated he was aware of this, the problem is not \nidentified in the dog\u2019s medical records.  \n \nDog 2330408 (Docker) has a test result history of declining thyroid levels below the normal range since 5/5/2020. This \nmay represent ongoing thyroid disease which could be distressing and affect overall health. There is no documentation of \nthe problem or the plan for treatment recorded in the dog\u2019s medical record.  \n \nCorrect and updated medical records allow the AV to monitor and effectively treat medical problems in dogs and allows all \ncaretakers of the dogs to follow plans for treatments and care. The registrant must ensure that when a problem is \nidentified (such as a disease, injury, or illness), the date and description of the problem, examination findings, test results, \nplan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed are all recorded in the dog\u2019s medical record. To be \ncorrected from this date forward: 21 February 2025. \n3.13(b)(3) \n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nDog KOA1 (Koala) has a documented exam on 7/9/24 at which time the AV recorded a plan of \u201cEars cleaned. Daily \ncleaning for 4 days\u201d. There is no corresponding medical record entry to document that treatment of ear cleaning.  \n \nDog WZP1 (Whazup) and dog APP1 (App) both have a medical record showing \u201cdebarking\u201d. The procedure was done on \n4/29/22 for WZAP1 and on 4/8/22 for APP1. The AV verbally confirmed to inspectors that he did administer analgesics to \nthe dog at the time of the procedure however, there is no documentation in the medical records to show that this was \nadministered.\n\nDog 2335892 (Bo) receives gabapentin on an ongoing basis. There is no documentation of the administration of the \ntreatment of gabapentin to this dog in the medical records during the month of 5/24. The AV stated this was because one \npage of the records is missing.  \n \nMedical records that correctly document treatments given to dogs enable both the animal caretakers and the AV to \nensure that treatments are being given as directed by the AV. The registrant must ensure that dog medical records \ndocument the names of all vaccines and treatments administered, and the dates of administration. To be corrected from \nthis date forward: 21 February 2025. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nSARA TOBIAS, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER \nMargaret Shaver, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n",
