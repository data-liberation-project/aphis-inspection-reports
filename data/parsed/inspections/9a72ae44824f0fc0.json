The dark female wolf/hybrid named\nKira had a deep laceration below her right eye and through the lower eyelid. These wounds were caused by the\naggression of each of these animals against each other while they were housed in the same enclosure. Veterinary care\nwas provided on July 20, 2020 for both animals. At the time of inspection, the wounds on both animals had healed. Luna\nand Kira are no longer housed together.\nDogs that are housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible.
