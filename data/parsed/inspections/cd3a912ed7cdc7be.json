Three\nRhesus macaques had surgical implants performed by the principal investigator and the surgical sites subsequently\nbecame infected despite daily cleaning of the site post-operatively. Samples of the implants and margins were taken, and\nlaboratory results revealed various environmental contaminates. Other study animals that had established head implants\nalso had a history of chronic implant infections.\nUpon further investigation by the IACUC and veterinary staff, it was determined that there was a consistent break in\naseptic technique when the surgeries were being performed. The principal investigator had an improper understanding of\nhow to maintain a sterile surgical field. This resulted in chronic antibiotic resistant infections of the surgical sites and\nsignificant neurological symptoms that required the animals to be euthanized.\nThe research facility did not have appropriate procedures in place to ensure the principal investigator was adequately\ntrained in aseptic surgical methods and procedures. The research facility must conduct training and reviews that provides\nguidance that will ensure all person conducting surgeries are able to appropriately perform aseptic technique.\nThe facility implemented an appropriate corrective action plan that included training of all study personnel on aseptic\ntechniques and suspending surgical privileges until demonstrated ability to perform such procedures.\nDuring the inspection of the Traylor Laboratory, expired compounds were noted. The compounds identified were\napproved for use in the protocol, but they were expired. There were two bottles of Heparin that expired in 2017 and 2018\nin a container on the workbench. There were also two bags sodium chloride on the workbench that expired in 2019. The\nlab technician voluntarily informed the inspector that the Heparin and the sodium chloride were currently being used for\nthe two study rabbits in the laboratory.\nThe use of expired compounds several years out of date should not be used. All expired drugs shall be discarded or\nmarked 'expired' and stored separately from in date drugs. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure all\nscientist, research technicians, animal technicians and other personnel involved in animal care are qualified to perform\ntheir duties. The research facility must conduct training and reviews that provides guidance that will ensure all person are\nable to appropriately use study compounds.\nCorrect by: August 31, 2021"
