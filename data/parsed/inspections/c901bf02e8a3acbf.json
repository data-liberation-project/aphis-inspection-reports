  "narrative": "This was a focused inspection on veterinary care issues.\nShih Tzu #10, previously identified on inspection on 7/7/14, was seen by the attending veterinarian on 7/11/14.  The\nwhiteness on both corneas was diagnosed as scarring that may not improve after 5 days treatment with a\nprescribed ophthalmic ointment.  Today, the corneas both have a small area of central whiteness with no other\nabnormalities noted in the eyes.  The licensee will continue to monitor the condition and maintain a record of all\ncommunications with the attending veterinarian regarding animals with chronic issues such as this.\nNo non-compliant items identified during this inspection. \n \nInspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.",
