      "narrative": "There is one female Mastiff (\"Sophie\", approximately 4 years old, Microchip #0A02130637) with a swollen muzzle.\nThe swelling is on the left side of her muzzle and includes both the upper and lower parts of her muzzle/jaw. On the\ntop portion of her muzzle the swelling is very firm and is approximately three to four inches in diameter. There is a\nsmall open area 1-2 cm in size that is red and the area surrounding that red area is moist with crusting and slight\nyellow/green discharge. The swelling on the lower jaw is large and takes up nearly the entire lower left side of the\njaw. The swollen area has multiple large, smooth lumps that are firm and pink in color.\nThere is one male Old English Sheepdog (\"Apollo\", approximately 7 years old, Microchip #0A02124940) that is\nlimping and barely putting weight on his left front leg. There are multiple red and swollen areas on the front part of\nthe leg and on the top of the foot. There is a scab over the red and swollen area on the front part of the upper leg.\nThe swelling on the top of the foot is red and firm. The licensee states that he had treated a wound on the leg with\nantibiotics, but stopped treating the animal four days ago. He stated he had not talked to the vet since he stopped\nthe treatment.\nThere is one male Standard Poodle (approximately 7 years old, Microchip #0A02124063) with two open skin\nlesions. One area is circular, approximately one inch in diameter and located on his lower back. The skin and\ntissues surrounding this lesion are moderately red and swollen. The second area is located on the left side of the\nrump, approximately half an inch in diameter, firm, and moderately red and swollen. The surface of the swelling is\nopen and there is debris stuck to the open area.\nVeterinary care issues such as those listed above can cause pain and discomfort to the animals and can lead to\nfurther health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian for proper diagnosis and an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be\ndocumented and made available to the inspectors upon request.\nThere is one cream colored, female, toy poodle (approximately 7 years old, Microchip #0A02127830) with matted\nhair and long nails. The matted hair covers nearly the entire face and body of the animal. Most of the mats on the\nface and head are tightly adhered to the skin and some of the skin under the mats is mild to moderately reddened.\nOne of the mats is tightly adhered to the skin just under the right eye and slightly crosses over the surface of the\nlower eyelid. Most of the mats on the muzzle, under the eyes, and on the top of the head are wet and dirty. There\nare superficial mats (not tightly adhered) covering nearly the entire rest of the body. The nails are excessively long\nwith sharp points that are starting to curl.\nMatted hair and long nails can be painful and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. All dogs need\nto have their hair coats and nails routinely maintained in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases\nassociated with excessive matting and long nails."
