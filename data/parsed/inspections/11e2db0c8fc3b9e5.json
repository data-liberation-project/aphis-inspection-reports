The perimeter fence must keep animals out of the facility\nin order to protect the animals within. The facility is currently looking into various ways to exclude predators. The\nfacility must ensure that predators are excluded in order to protect the animals from this time forward.\nThe inspection was conducted on site with facility representatives on 3/3/2020.\nThe inspection required follow-up with inventory review and consultation with parties involved, and an exit interview\noccurred by phone on 3/18/2020 with a facility representative."
