      "narrative": "A male hedgehog \"Bramborik\" was examined by the attending veterinarian on 11 October 2016, as the animal had\ndeveloped a growth in its groin that extended down the hind limb. The growth was inoperable, and the animal was\ndoing well at the time; thus, the licensee was instructed to monitor the animal. Over the next eight months, the\ngrowth enlarged until it encompassed three-quarters of the right hind limb. It appears discolored, bruised, swollen\nand significantly protrudes to the point where mobility is questionable. During that time period, no subsequent\nveterinary evaluations were sought by the licensee. The licensee stated that the animal had begun to slow down\nnear the end of May. The animal died on 27 June 2017 without veterinary care or analgesia.\nThe licensee must ensure that any medical conditions be evaluated and re-evaluated by the attending veterinarian\nto ensure that any pain and distress are minimized.\nCorrect from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative."
