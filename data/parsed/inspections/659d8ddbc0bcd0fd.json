      "narrative": "A mouse was on a study, did not receive veterinary care, and ultimately succumbed without the benefit of a veterinarian\nintervention. Protocol 21-002 discusses potential adverse events to animals on study, one of which is mice showing signs\nof discomfort and pain such as hunching over, dehydration, unkept coat, and malaise. If there are any signs of undue pain\nand discomfort in the animals, the protocol states the animal will be humanely euthanized. On May 4, 2022, at 10:45 AM,\nthe vivarium staff noticed one mouse currently on Protocol 21-002 that appeared hunched, lethargic, and dehydrated with\na sunken abdomen, squinting eyes, increased respiratory effort, and a rough hair coat. A mass was observed between\nthe left front and thoracic area. The PI and AV were both notified via email regarding the findings. At 11:00 AM, the\nveterinary technician went to evaluate the mouse and confirmed the earlier findings, recommending euthanasia as soon\nas possible. Although hydrogel and wet food were placed on the floor of the cage, no veterinarian provided a treatment\nplan or medical care. An additional email was sent to the PI and AV at 11:19 AM informing them of the veterinary\ntechnician\u2019s evaluation and seeking approval for euthanasia. The PI responded at 11:42 AM to the veterinary technician,\napproving euthanasia for the mouse. The email was not received by the veterinary technician until 12:48 PM. According to\nthe room logs, the veterinary technician returned to the mouse\u2019s enclosure at 1:00 PM, to euthanize the mouse. However,\nthe mouse was found deceased.\nFailing to provide medical care for animals on a study resulted in a mouse that endured undue stress and pain for over\ntwo hours without veterinarian intervention.\nCorrect by May 20, 2022 by ensuring that animal care staff follow the IACUC approved written protocol by providing\nmedical care for animals by a qualified veterinarian."

The facility did not contact a veterinarian until May 17, 2022. The animal caretaker told the inspector, earlier that\nday he determined the cow has a left displaced abomasum, prompting him to call the veterinarian. According to facility\nSOP \"Dairy Unit 2021 Treatments\", any cows that show signs of reduced feed intake should receive 8 gallons of water,\n1/2 gallon of mineral oil, and 6 Maglax boluses for three days. However, after speaking with the animal caretaker and\nreviewing daily medical logs, the cow did not receive the treatments listed out in the SOP and no veterinarian was\nconsulted until the cow had experienced 5 days of clinical signs. Following attending veterinarian approved SOPs or\nconsulting with the attending veterinarian for animal diseases or illnesses is critical to provide appropriate treatment and\navoid unnecessary pain and suffering.
