Upon\nbeing notified and in response to this information, the IACUC and AV looked into this incident.\nIt was determined that research staff had separated the 2 bats from the rest of the colony for an IACUC approved\nstudy activity scheduled to take place on 7/31/17. Per the institution\u2019s established feeding procedure for separated\nanimals, husbandry staff prepared that day\u2019s food ration for the 2 bats and left it for the research staff to give to the\nanimals after the study activity was concluded. However, research staff failed to provide the prepared food to the\nbats on 7/31/17 and the lack of food was the cause of death.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including research staff, should be\ndone as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm, behavioral stress, or unnecessary\ndiscomfort.\nThe research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to\nOLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nCorrective actions included but were not limited to implementing an expanded monitoring and husbandry plan for\nthe research laboratory and providing additional retraining of research staff on the expanded plan and the metabolic\nneeds of this species. No additional incidents have occurred.\nThis item has been appropriately addressed and corrected by the research facility.\nNOTE \u2013 Inspection conducted 12/5/17 and 12/6/17. Exit briefing held 12/6/17 on-site with facility representatives.\n*END OF REPORT*"
