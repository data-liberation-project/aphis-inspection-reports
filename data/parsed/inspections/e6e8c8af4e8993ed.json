A veterinarian was not contacted until the\nfollowing morning at which time the veterinarian recommended euthanasia.\n*A galago recovered from a craniotomy surgery and study procedure (over 12 hour duration total) conducted under\ngeneral anesthesia sooner than anticipated and prior to the administration of the postoperative analgesic. The\nresearchers did not give the analgesic injection as the animal became agitated and aggressive after another post\noperative medication injection. The researchers did not call a veterinarian for guidance. The following morning (8\nhrs later) the vet tech gave an analgesic injection and contacted the veterinarian. The veterinarian evaluated the\nanimal 1 3/4 hours later and stated there were no health or well-being issues.\nObservations regarding problems of animal health, behavior and well-being may be accomplished by someone\nother than the attending veterinarian but all such issues must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely\nmanner to ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care. The facility shall maintain a program of\nadequate veterinary care that includes a mechanism of direct and timely communication on problems of animal\nhealth, behavior and well being to the attending veterinarian.

Review of\nthe protocol shows that the intra-operative monitoring includes heart rate, respiratory rate and CO2 done every 10\nminutes. During the use of the NMBs a ventilator is used. One record, for galago 7-14-1, shows that the NMB and\nanesthetic were discontinued within the same 10 minute time block on the monitoring chart. There is no record of\nspecifically when the NMB was discontinued, the method used to confirm that the NMB was no longer effective prior\nto reducing the anesthesia, when the animal returned to spontaneous breathing and when the anesthetic was\ndiscontinued. Lab personnel stated that the discontinuation of the NMB and the waking of the animal occurred\nalmost simultaneously. They stated this happened so quickly that the personnel were not able to give the required\npost-operative analgesic. Further conversation elicited the information that the research personnel were monitoring\nanesthesia depth during NMB use with \"heart rate and withdrawal reflex\".\nThe appropriate use of NMB under anesthesia is critical to ensure that the animals do not feel any pain during the\nprocedure.
