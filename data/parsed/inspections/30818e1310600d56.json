Nowhere in the protocol is there any mention of doing the oral dosing under anesthesia. SOT # 946,\nwhich describes dosing, specifically calls for manually restraining the conscious animal, and the anesthetics table in\nthe protocol does not mention anesthetic use for this procedure. Whereas using anesthesia rather than manual\nrestraint may be advantageous in order to minimize distress during handling, this practice was not described in the\napproved protocol, and therefore represents a significant change from what was approved by the IACUC.\nMaking significant changes to animal use protocols without IACUC review and approval could be detrimental to the\nanimals, as the review process allows consideration of the best methods to minimize pain and distress, as well as\nensuring that staff is properly trained in techniques.\nTo be corrected on this protocol by 12/3/16, and on all protocols from this time forward."
