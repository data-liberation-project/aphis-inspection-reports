According\nto facility representatives based on video surveillance, the individual walked around the entire island for approximately 10-\n15 minutes including through the group of flamingos. And records state during this event, \u201cthe flamingos were moving very\nquickly trying to avoid her, running, slipping, sliding in the mud, jumping over large rocks to dodge her and falling all over\nthe place. Several times the flamingos were seen face planting into their shallow pond and on the dirt/grass areas.\u201d\nFollowing this incident, although the staff did not find any external injuries or wounds to the flamingos, records show they\nwere immediately found to be anxious, skittish, and acting unusual. The staff reported lots of flagging and alerting from\nthe group and pacing by one of the males. Overall, a majority of the flamingos continue to exhibit some abnormal and\nanxious behaviors according to staff. Also noted was one Whistler duck which was observed to be limping on its right foot\nfollowing the incident.\n-On 03/10/2024, a member of the public was able to access the Flamingo Island where a flock of 7 flamingos are housed.\nRecords show a morning keeper noticed that in the cave shelter were open containers, displaced items and supplies, and\nsome mirrors pulled down from the walls and onto the ground. According to the keepers, there were no physical injuries to\nthe flamingos observed following this incident, however they showed a decrease in appetite and evidence of stress and\nanxiety including increased flagging, searching, and calling behaviors.\nIneffective barriers which allow the public to gain access to animal housing areas does not assure the safety of the public\nor the animals. Members of the public may become injured if the animals become unexpectedly startled or stressed, and\nthe animals may experience severe behavioral stress, injury or death from encountering the public inside their enclosure.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safely of the\nanimals and the public.\nCorrect from this day, 03/06/2025, forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
