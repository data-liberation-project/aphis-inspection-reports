The hamster had\nopen wounds exposing the inflamed red/yellow flesh beneath on the inside of both his right arm and thigh. The area\nbeneath the tail was also covered with a large amount of brown, black fecal material. The facility representative had\nplaced this animal aside due to injuries but had not seen these more extensive wounds and fecal covered hind end area.\n- Four guinea pigs in one enclosure and seven in another were seen with crusty raised black and white lesions within\nhairless areas of either their ear, nose, eye, back or side of the body.\n- Three guinea pigs in one enclosure had an abnormal ear that was hairless. A tan, white and black guinea pig had a red\nswollen left ear with a small wound in the front section. A tan, white and gray guinea pig\u2019s right ear was red and swollen\nwith a black scab covering \u00bc of the front section. A tan and white guinea pig\u2019s right ear had a raised black scab protruding\nfrom the middle of the ear.\n- A brown guinea pig was found with a head tilt towards the right in the corner of an enclosure. The tilt remained at all\ntimes, even when moved.\n- A golden-faced parakeet was found on the floor of the enclosure seeming to be laying on his abdomen. When placed on\na perch, the bird shifted his body weight to his left leg and held the right one out, splayed to the side. The bird remained\nleaning to the left while standing.\nFailure to promptly identify medical issues delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in animals with such\nconditions.\nA gray and black djungarian hamster was seen balled up, head down and eyes closed with a very unkempt hair coat. The\nhamster was hunched in a corner of the enclosure and appeared severely lethargic. A facility representative had placed\nthis animal aside and was planning on notifying the next manager that came by of this finding. In waiting for a manager,\nthis condition was not communicated to the veterinarian for timely diagnosis and treatment which prolongs this animal\u2019s\npain and distress.\nA more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented to properly assess their health and well-\nbeing. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and adequate\nmedical attention. All the above identified animals need to be provided care per the attending veterinarian\u2019s guidance.\nCorrected at the time of inspection."
