      "narrative": "**The teeth of three dogs were examined during this inspection as well as the previous inspection. No treatment had\nbeen provided since the last inspection. A male Yorkshire terrier (m/c#494-151-7460) had few teeth remaining, but\nthere was a buildup of a hard, brown substance on the teeth he did have. A female Maltese (m/c# 095 627 602)\nhad a buildup of a hard, greenish-brown substance on her teeth that was so thick that all the individual teeth could\nnot be seen. A female Yorkshire terrier (m/c# 091 312 883) had a severe buildup of hard brown material on her\nteeth; her gums were reddened along her teeth. Teeth and gum problems can be painful, can affect the animal's\nability to eat, and can result in tooth loss. The licensee stated that none of the dogs had received dental care in\ntwo years even though the Attending Veterinarian had noted that 42 dogs needed dental cleaning on his last visit to\nthe facility. The licensee must establish an effective program of dental maintenance and care. The licensee shall\nprovide adequate veterinary care and by having these animals evaluated and treated accordingly by a licensed\nveterinarian.\n***Several dogs were noted during the last inspection for excessively long toenails. While it appeared that a portion\nof the long nails had been removed, each of the dogs still had excessively long nails on a portion of their digits: a\nfemale Beagle (m/c# 4812710C39), a female Beagle named Biscuit (no other ID), a female Maltese (m/c# 095 627\n602), and a female Maltese (m/c# 050304787). Excessively long toenails can become entrapped and torn or can\nresult in abnormally positioned toes, which is painful. The licensee must establish an effective program of toenail\nmaintenance.\nA focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and VMO Konnie Plumlee on August 25,\n2015. This inspection was limited to both direct and indirect non-compliant items 2.40(b)(2), 3.3 (c) , and 3.11 (c)\nfound during a routine inspection on August 3,2015. The adult female Beagle (m/c# 4812710C39) had been seen\nby a veterinarian, treated and her condition was improving. Both lights in the sheltered building were working and\nthe licensee had removed the tall grass and weeds in the outdoor enclosures.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPlumlee Konnie, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
