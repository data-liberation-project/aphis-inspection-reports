Failure to remove excreta from the top\nof the aviary as often as necessary may cause birds housed within to become soiled or exposed to disease hazards from\nparticulates that fall through the wire mesh roof (approximately 0.5-inch square openings). Excreta and food waste must\nbe removed from primary enclosures and from under and around primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent\nexcessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the soiling of the birds contained in the primary enclosures,\nand to reduce disease hazards.\nCorrect by 15 November 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nn"
