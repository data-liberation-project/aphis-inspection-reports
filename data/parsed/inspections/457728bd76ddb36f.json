The new AV has not performed a site visit and has not completed a new written program of veterinary\ncare (PVC). The written PVC should contain enough detail to reflect what is actually being conducted on the\npremises. Routine preventative medications and other routine approved treatments that the veterinarian has\nauthorized must be included in sufficient detail to ensure that adequate veterinary care is being provided and that it\nis at the direction of the new attending veterinarian. The lack of details on preventatives and/or treatments could\nlead to inadequate veterinary care.\nThe attending veterinarian needs to be employed under formal arrangements with a written program of veterinary\ncare and needs to conduct regularly scheduled visits to the premises.\nTo be corrected by: February 28, 2018\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Lead Animal Caretaker."
