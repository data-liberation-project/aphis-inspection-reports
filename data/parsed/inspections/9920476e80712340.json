On August 5, 2016\nit is documented that five bats died after animal care workers accidentally fed the wrong food. According to a facility\nrepresentative, laboratory personnel had not labeled the nectar containers and an incorrect food was given to the\nbats. On November 18, 2016 it is documented that three bats died after the PI and graduate student forgot to\nreopen the tunnel between the two animal enclosures which did not allow the bats access to their food for the last\nhalf of the night. Properly trained personnel and instruction related to animal care, treatment and use are vital to\nensure that the animals receive proper care and optimal welfare. The research facility needs to ensure that all\npersonnel involved in animal care and use are qualified and appropriately trained and instructed on how to perform\ntheir duties at all times. To be corrected from this date, June 22, 2017, forward.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
