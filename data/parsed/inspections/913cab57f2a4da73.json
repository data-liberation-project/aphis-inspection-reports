      "narrative": "On today's inspection, there were two enclosures that were measured to determine the adequacy of space for the\npuppies contained therein.\nThe first enclosure measured was 31\"x22\" or 4.74 sq ft. This enclosure contained 3 puppies of alike size. The\npuppy measured was 15\" when it was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail. According to the\nAWA, this puppy and the other two puppies of alike size housed with her would require 3.06 sq ft each or a total of\n9.18 sq ft total.\nThe second enclosure measured was 36\"x24\" or 6 sq ft. This enclosure contained 4 puppies of alike size. The\npuppy measured was 11\" when it was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail. According to the\nAWA, this puppy and the other three puppies of alike size housed with him would require 2.01 sq ft each or a total of\n8.04 sq ft total.\nThe puppies housed within the enclosure identified above do not have an adequate amount of space. Each dog\nhoused in a primary enclosure (including weaned puppies) must be provided a minimum amount of floor space,\ncalculated as follows: Find the mathematical square of the sum of the length of the dog in inches (measured from\nthe tip of its nose to the base of its tail) plus 6 inches; then divide the product by 144. The calculation is: (length of\ndog in inches + 6) x (length of dog in inches + 6) = required floor space in square inches. Required floor space in\ninches/144 = required floor space in square feet. This facility must ensure that each puppy within each of their\nenclosures have an adequate amount of floor space using the calculations listed above.\nCorrect By: 9/21/2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
