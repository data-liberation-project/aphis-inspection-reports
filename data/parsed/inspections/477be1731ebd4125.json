The chain link fence between the zebra and kangaroo pen had been reinforced with a fence panel with a\nsolid bar across the top by the time of inspection.\nThe fence containing a juvenile dromedary camel was composed of welded wire cattle panels and was observed to be\nbent over along the entire east side where the camel had been reaching to graze on weeds outside of the pen. The height\nof the fence was reduced, and the bent welded wire could result in injury to the camel.\nThe bottom rail along the west edge of the fenced enclosure containing 3 adult camels (2 dromedary and 1 Bactrian) was\nbroken and not attached to the fence poles. This could lead to entrapment of a camel causing injury or death.\nA male red fox escaped his enclosure and was not recovered in October 2022. It was not apparent where or how the\nanimal escaped. This enclosure is no longer being used to house animals.\nAll enclosures or facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals\ninvolved. Facilities must be structurally sound, free from sharp, protruding points or edges, and must be maintained in\ngood repair to protect the animals from injury and to properly contain them. A system of timely identification, maintenance,\nand repair of facilities must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of all animals."
