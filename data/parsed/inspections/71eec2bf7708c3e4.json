When\nasked, the licensee approximated the weights of the rabbits at 6-8 pounds. The regulation requires 3 ft square of\nspace for each rabbit within the weight range of 4.4-8.8 lbs, therefore a total of 6 sq ft of space is required as the\nminimum amount of floor space for two rabbits of this size.\nEnclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the animals being maintained there. A sufficient\namount of floor space for rabbits is necessary in order to ensure that the animals have enough space to make\nnormal postural adjustments and adequate freedom of movement. The facility should ensure that the cages housing\ntheir rabbits meet the required minimum floor space set forth in the regulations.\nCorrection Date: 30 September 2015\nExit Interview was conducted with facility personnel."
