Expired drugs\nneed to be discarded in a timely manner so they are not accidentally used in the kennel. In addition a few\nmedications have been put into smaller bottles but their label information was not transferred. When medications\nare put into containers different from their original one, pertinent information such as the drug, dosage and\nexpiration should also be labeled.
