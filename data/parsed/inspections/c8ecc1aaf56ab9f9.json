      "narrative": "***The facility did not perform adequate daily observations of a beagle and failed to identify a swelling on the dog\u2019s\nforelimb.\nDuring a walkthrough of the indoor kennel, APHIS inspectors discovered a mass on the right forelimb of a 9 year old\nmale beagle, ID #1680C, on April 11, 2017. The swelling was on the back of the right forelimb, above the carpal\npad. The skin, visible through the hair, was reddened, inflamed and contained at least two visibly erosive areas with\na small amount of blood-tinged discharge. The area of swelling/redness was approximately three centimeters in\ndiameter. Upon digital palpation by APHIS inspectors, a movable mass approximately the size of a grape was felt\nunder the skin. The swelling appeared to be painful to the touch and the beagle attempted to pull his leg away\nduring examination of the swelling.\nThe beagle underwent an unrelated surgical procedure on March 27, 2017 and although this animal has\nbeen receiving daily follow up care for that condition, there is no documentation or record indicating the forelimb\nswelling was noticed prior to the APHIS inspection. As a result, veterinary care for the forelimb had not been\nprovided.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and\nthe increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily\nobservations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and\nappropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nAfter the inspection, the facility provided immediate veterinary care and performed diagnostics for the swelling on\nthe beagle\u2019s forelimb."
