I\ncalled Mr. Roy's primary phone number at 10:55 AM, and I left a message, then waited at the site for several\nminutes. I located and then called another phone number listed for Mr. Wilbur, left a message, and then spoke with\nhim when he returned my call. Mr. Wilbur was unable to meet me at the facility. I inquired whether a neighbor, a\nfamily member, or a person living in the on-site home could potentially accompany me for an inspection, yet Mr.\nWilbur conveyed none of those options were feasible at this time. We discussed the value of identifying optimal\nhours for conducting inspections. After our call, I left the facility."
