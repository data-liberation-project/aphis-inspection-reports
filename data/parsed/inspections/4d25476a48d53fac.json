The juvenile lion was separated from the female but was not assessed by the vet to determine the extent\nof his injury. The facility did contact the vet and it was determined that a course of antibiotics were appropriate.\nThere is not enough lighting to determine if the injury is healing well or facilitate additional inspection.\n***The adult female bear was reluctant to walk on her front left leg, while gathering food she crawled using her\nelbow. The facility indicated that the animal was approximately 15 years in age and has seemed arthritic for a while.\nThey were unable to give an approximation on the length of time that she has had difficulty walking. She was\nobserved walking on all four legs and appeared to be slow at first and then eventually showed very little sign of\ndiscomfort. The facility did not contact the veterinarian to determine the cause or to develop a treatment plan.\n*** The adult male capybara was seen to be limping on his left hind leg. The musculature of the leg showed a\nmoderate amount of atrophy associated with the limited use. The facility did not contact the veterinarian to\ndetermine the cause or to develop a treatment plan.\nLameness and disuse of legs as shown are indicators of painful conditions. Signs of pain, discomfort, and ill-health\nneed to be addressed by the licensee as soon as they are identified to prevent unnecessary suffering.
