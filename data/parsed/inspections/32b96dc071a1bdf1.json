One employee would be present while the\ntwo coati were allowed free physical contact with the seated guests within the enclosure. This single employee was\nresponsible for both coati, treats and targets, photos, and the guests.\nCoatimundi are relatives of the raccoon and have strong teeth and claws. They have the potential to cause serious\ninjury to a person.\nDuring public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.\nSome of the ways this can be achieved are by a barrier between the public and the animal, a harness on the\nanimal, or training that requires the animal to respond immediately to commands.\nCorrections implemented and demonstrated by the time of the inspection include adding a second employee\npresent in the enclosure during the interaction sessions, increasing target training, and refraining from use of \"Gus\"\nin interactions until after his scheduled neutering.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative."
