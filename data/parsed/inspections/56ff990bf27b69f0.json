Also, there were three\nplaces along the west and south sides of the perimeter fence with gaps at the base of the fence that show evidence\nof animal activity through the gap. Perimeter fences with gaps at the base or of insufficient height can allow\nunauthorized people and animals access through or under the fence and may not function as secondary\ncontainment for animals inside the facility. Given the types of animals present, this facility must ensure that the\nperimeter fence is at least 8 feet high in all places. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the\nanimals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going though it or under it and having\ncontact with the animals in the facility and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals\nin the facility. To be corrected by 23 November 2016.\nThe inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information\nmanagement system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was\ndeployed, the \u201cprepared by\u201d date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the\noriginal inspection report, which occurred on 23 August 2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLundy Kendall, Animal Care Inspector"
