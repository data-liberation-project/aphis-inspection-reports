      "narrative": "A 6-year-old female Jacob sheep, ID #207, was visualized walking on only three of its limbs, holding its right\nhindlimb up completely and demonstrating pain. The licensee indicated that the sheep had caught its limb in the\nfence upon attempting to jump over it, thereby breaking the limb. The licensee also indicated his attending\nveterinarian evaluated the sheep\u2019s injury and discussed the acceptability of the licensee selling the sheep for\nfood/fiber, which the licensee had planned to do but had not yet done so. Via phone call, the attending veterinarian\nrelayed to the USDA that the sheep with the broken limb was evaluated several weeks ago, and also confirmed the\nlicensee was planning to sell the sheep promptly for processing. The licensee had not followed the veterinarian\u2019s\ninstructions.\nAppropriate methods for prevention, control, diagnoses, and treatments of diseases and injuries must be employed\nas part of a program of veterinary care, in order to ensure sheep health and well-being. The lack of appropriate\nmethods for treatment of limb injuries can create pain, stress, and more advanced disease conditions for the sheep.\nThe licensee must follow treatment recommendations from the attending veterinarian of record for Sheep #207.\nCorrect by close of business November 20, 2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
