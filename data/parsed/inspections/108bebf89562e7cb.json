      "narrative": "***There was a male English Bulldog (#0A01651705) with a raised, reddened, nodule-like lesion between two of the\ntoes on the left front paw. The lesion was approximately 3/4 inch by 1/4 inch in size. While trying to more closely\nobserve the paw, the dog would frequently pull its leg back towards his body. According to the licensee, she was\nnot aware of the lesion until the inspector pointed it out. The lesion between the toes could be the result of an injury,\ninfection, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may cause discomfort. The licensee must consult with a\nlicensed veterinarian regarding this animal's condition no later than April 21, 2014 in order to obtain an accurate\ndiagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.\n***There was an approximately 7 1/2 year old male Yorkshire Terrier, \"Harley\", (#095*097*779) with a dental\ncondition. Many of the dog's teeth appeared to be missing. On the remaining teeth, there was a very heavy\nbuild-up of yellowish-brown to green material covering their surface. The gums had receded along some of the\nteeth and the root of the upper left canine tooth was visible.\n***There was an approximately 9 year old male Maltese, \"Cracker Box\", (#093010823) that was rubbing the right\nside of its face along the front door of its enclosure. On closer observation, there was a yellowish-brown material\ncovering the surface of most of the teeth that were present. Some of the dog's teeth were missing. The gums had\nreceded along some of the cheek teeth and both upper canine teeth; the roots of these teeth were visible. The\ninside flap of the dog(cid:25)s left ear also appeared thickened near the canal which was difficult to visualize. The\nthickened skin in the ear flap could indicate an infection, allergy or other veterinary condition which may cause\ndiscomfort.\n***There was an approximately 4 year old female Yorkshire Terrier (#0A01317168) that was standing but not as\nactive or walking around as much as the other two dogs that shared its enclosure. The dog would also frequently\nlick. When the dog walked it appeared to have a stiff gait in the back legs. The dog also had a pronounced curved\nappearance to its middle to lower back. On observation of the dog(cid:25)s mouth, there was a heavy build-up of yellowish\nbrown material on the majority of the teeth. There was a whitish gray creamy material observed at the gum line of\nthe upper cheek teeth. This dog(cid:25)s abnormal gait and stance could indicate an injury, illness, or other veterinary\nmedical condition which could be painful.\n***There was an approximately 7 year old female Shih Tzu (#145532122A) that had its tongue hanging out and wet\nfur around its mouth. Also, there were two areas of hair loss noted along the dog(cid:25)s back right side. Most of the\nteeth had a heavy build-up of yellowish brown material on their surface. This abnormal build-up of material covered\nthe majority of the cheek teeth and extended into the gum line. The gums appeared reddened, swollen and had\nreceded along some of these teeth. An upper right cheek tooth was observed to move very easily upon lifting the\ndog's upper lip. According to the licensee, she thought the areas of hair loss were due to grooming the dog\nrecently. On closer observation of one of the areas of hair loss, the surrounding fur was wet and an approximately\n1/2 inch open skin lesion was noted. A thick, yellowish-green, mucoid-like material was noted within the lesion.\nAlso a pinpoint sized hole through the tissue was noted centrally within the lesion. The skin lesion could be the\nresult of injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could negatively affect the health of the animal.\nThe abnormal build-up of material on the dogs' teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures.\nThese dogs' dental conditions could be painful, may decrease the dogs' ability to eat normally and negatively impact\nthe overall health of the animals.\nNone of the animals mentioned above had been examined by a veterinarian for their current conditions nor were\nthey under any type of treatment at the time of inspection. The licensee must have the male Yorkshire Terrier\n(#095*097*779), male Maltese (#093010823), female Yorkshire Terrier (#0A01317168) and female Shih Tzu\n(#145532122A) examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than April 21, 2014 in order to ensure that accurate\ndiagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must develop and\nfollow an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the\nfacility."
