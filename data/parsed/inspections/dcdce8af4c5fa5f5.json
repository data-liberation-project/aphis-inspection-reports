The two sheep have overgrown hooves that are beginning to curve inwards, primarily on the rear feet. Five\nllamas also have long hooves that are beginning to curve inwards. The rear feet seem to be primarily affected. As the\nnails become too long and curve inwards, there is uneven pressure put on the bones and soft tissues which can lead to\ndiscomfort, pain, and further medical conditions. Correct by August 11, 2021 by appropriately trimming the affected\nhooves and maintaining hoof care to prevent overgrowth.\n*** A brown, female, adult llama was found with hair/fiber loss on the inside portion of both hind limbs. The exposed skin\nappears thickened, rough, and flaky. Hair loss in animals can be attributed to different underlying conditions and should\nbe evaluated to ensure the comfort and well-being of the animal.
