The retaining\nwall from the side of the bear enclosure is 8 feet 9 inches in height however it is only 3 feet 3 inches in height from the\npublic side of the wall. According to facility officials the retaining wall acts as the \u201cbear perimeter fence\u201d while a 6 foot\nchain-link perimeter fence around the greater park boundary acts as the perimeter fence for the remainder of the facility.\nThe perimeter fence must meet the minimum required height on both sides of the fence: 8 feet for dangerous animals\nincluding black bear. Correct by ensuring the perimeter fence is in good repair and of sufficient height to restrict access by\nunwanted animals and unauthorized people and to also act as an effective secondary containment system for animals in\nthe event they escape their primary enclosure. Also ensure that the perimeter fence is no less than 3 feet away from the\nprimary enclosure as described in section 3.127 of the AWA.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Senior Manager of Zoology and the Director of Facilities and\nOperations.\nn"
