The placement of these items or materials next to stored, animal food supplies may allow the harborage\nof vermin or pests which may contaminate the food supplies. Additionally, the wind has blown several of the\nsmaller pieces of foam from the piles into the inside of the structure and next to the hay/straw bales. This poses the\npotential risk of the small foam pieces being mixed within the hay and consumed by the animals.\n- In a food storage shed adjacent to the Clinic Building there were two open, uncovered bags of animal grain feed.\nOpen bags of feed may attract vermin or other pests and potentially contaminate the food sources. Also, in one\ncorner of the ceiling of this shed were loose, torn pieces of fiberglass insulation material located directly above an\nopen container of straw. Any torn or loose fiberglass material located above animal feed or bedding poses a\npotential health risk of this material falling into the bedding or feed and possibly being ingested.\nAll supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner which adequately protects such supplies against\ndeterioration, molding or sources of contamination to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. A system\nwhich adequately and safely protects all animal food and bedding supplies must be in place.\nCorrect by 04/22/2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBolinger Jean, Compliance Specialist"
