      "narrative": "A review of water quality records since late August 2020 until present day identified numerous total chlorine readings\nwhere the levels in several pool systems actively containing animals were above 1.0PPM. The highest readings were\ndocumented at Discovery Cove in DC-1, DC-2, DC-3 and DC Support. At the time of the inspection, the facility was taking\nwater samples every three hours. The 8am and 1pm samples were being collected by animal trainers at various\ninconsistent locations along the pool sides. The samples taken throughout the rest of the day were being collected by life\nsupport staff at consistent locations and depths opposite the inflow valves. Furthermore, the facility\u2019s acceptable total\nchlorine parameters were set between 0.8PPM and 1.2PPM with 1.0PPM being the optimal level. DC-Support pool had\n107 readings and DC-1 pool had 554 readings that were above 1.0PPM over the two-year period.\nAt the time of inspection, there was at least one animal receiving treatment for varying states of eye conditions. Roxy, a\n24yr old female Bottlenose dolphin, was under active treatment for an ocular condition. Furthermore, Calli a 24yr old\nfemale Bottlenose dolphin received treatment in October 2022 after trainers noted her left eye was squinting. Her\nveterinary journal indicates that she was seen squinting on October 12th, 2022. The chlorine readings for her pool (Key\nWest) three days prior to the observation were as follows; October 9th 8am: 1.1PPM & 1pm: 1.2PPM; October 10th 8am:\n1.2PPM & 1pm: 0.9PPM; October 11th 8am: 1.1PPM & 1pm: 0.8PPM.\nIndustry standards set the maximum level of total chlorine at 1.0PPM. Total chlorine is a measurement of both free\nchlorine and chloramines. Chloramines are much more irritating to an animal\u2019s skin, eyes and lungs than free chlorine.\nIncreasing chlorine to levels above industry standards in pools that actively contain animals in order to maintain coliform\nlevels below 1000 MPN per 100ml of water is not an acceptable method of disinfection. Total chlorine levels above\n1.0PPM over extended periods of time can cause marine mammals skin, respiratory, and eye issues. Constant\nmanagement and maintaining chlorine levels below 1.0PPM is necessary to maintain the health and welfare of the marine\nmammals. The facility shall ensure that the primary enclosure shall not contain water which would be detrimental to the\nhealth of the marine mammal contained therein.\nCorrect prior to scheduling your next relicense inspection.\nThis is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class \u201cC\u201d license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the\napplicant.\nAll items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by February 5, 2023, or the applicant will forfeit the license\nfee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.\nRegulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nCharles Palmer, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
