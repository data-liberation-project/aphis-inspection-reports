The inspector called the\nnumber on file for the facility and spoke with a facility representative. The representative told the inspector that this\nsite is no longer used by the facility and they have vacated the premises. If the licensee does not make APHIS\naware that a site is no longer active, then APHIS will waste time and resources when sending an inspector to the\nsite for an inspection. Therefore APHIS will have less time and resources to ensure animal welfare at other facilities.\nThe licensee shall notify APHIS by certified mail that this site is no longer active and needs to be cancelled. The\nletter shall be mailed to:\nUSDA/APHIS/AC\n2150 Centre Ave.\nBuilding B, Mailstop 3W11\nFort Collins, CO 80526-8117\nCORRECT BY: 12 December 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted by phone with a facility representative."
