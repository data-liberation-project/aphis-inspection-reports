      "narrative": "At a previous exhibit on July 7, 2017, there were not an adequate number of attendants to prevent a member of the\npublic to gain entry behind the barrier fence. Upon entry this person was able to get through another partial fence to\nget close enough to the primate enclosure to make contact with the animal, and get bitten on the finger. While there\nwere two attendants in the tent working with the public, there were not enough present to be watching the entire\nexhibit in order to see a person untie a gate, and walk past other enclosures, and make their way to the other side\nof the primates. This member of the public was then bitten, and walked back out from behind the barrier and left the\ntent. The entire interaction had not been observed by the two attendants working the exhibit.\nThe lack of an appropriate number of attendants to be able to fully observe an exhibit with live animals, can be a\nsource of possible contact and injury, if the public is able to go about the exhibit unnoticed.\nThere must be enough attendants working an exhibit that can observe all of the animal-human interactions, during\nexhibition hours.\nCorrections made: Since the incident, there is one attendant that is assigned to stand behind the barrier fence next\nto the primates, to ensure that no members of the public gain entry behind or around the barrier fence. The tied off\nends of the fence have been improved, and more distance has been added between the barrier fence and front of\nthe enclosures.\nThe corrections must be maintained and updated as needed to prevent public contact with the primates from this\nday forward.\nThe inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee at the DuQuoin Fair, in Southern Illinois."
