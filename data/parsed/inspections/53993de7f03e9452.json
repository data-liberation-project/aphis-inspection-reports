The protocol does not state if or how anesthesia will be monitored. An IACUC-approved SOP exists for\nanesthesia, but is not referenced in protocol #208 and was not included as part of the protocol review process.\nProtocol #205 states that paralytics are needed, but does not describe specific drugs or methods used to include\nparalysis.

The protocol states that \u201canimals will be\nanesthetized\u201d but does not include information about anesthetic monitoring, intubation, or intra-operative thermal support\n(all of which the facility does provide for animals on the protocol). Surgical preparation is not described.\nProtocol #191 and #210 do not include information about intubation, surgical preparation, surgical technique, or aseptic\ntechnique. Facility personnel stated that intubation, surgical preparation, and aseptic technique are used.\nThe facility\u2019s \u201cMERI Veterinary Standard Operating Procedure Manual\u201d (rev 4/9/19) states that Principal Investigator will\nprovide \u201ca detailed step-by-step description of the procedure to be performed\u201d.\nNone of these protocols mention the use of IV catheters or administration of IV fluids, but these procedures are described\nin the MERI Veterinary Standard Operating Procedure Manual (rev 4/9/19). It is unclear if these procedures are used in\nany given protocol.\nA full description of proposed activities involving animals (and any proposed changes to activities involving animals) is\nrequired for the IACUC to be able to make an informed determination whether the proposed activities ensure the humane\nand judicious use of animals in research.\nCorrect by ensuring proposals to conduct activities involving animals contain a complete description, in lay terms and in\ndetail, of the proposed use of the animals.
