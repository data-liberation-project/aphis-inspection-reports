      "narrative": "Adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care.\n**In February 2017, a dog was under general anesthesia as per IACUC approved protocol. According to the\nmedical record, the initial vital signs were recorded at 10:34 AM but when the vital signs were checked again 10\nminutes later the dog had expired. The AV was notified of the adverse event and conducted an investigation. It\nwas determined that the pre-procedural respiratory rate of the dog was elevated above normal but research staff did\nnot notify veterinary services of the problem and administered general anesthesia to the dog. Once the dog was\nunder general anesthesia, the research staff failed to recognize that the dog\u2019s oxygen saturation was below the\nrequired 90-95% and in addition the research staff left the dog unattended and failed to continuously monitor the\nanimal while under general anesthesia.\n*In October 2016, a rabbit was used in an IACUC approved protocol that included the weight loss of 20% from the\nbaseline weight as a study end point criteria. On 10/10/16 laboratory staff reported to veterinary services that a\nrabbit had a 27% weight loss from baseline; the AV directed research personnel to euthanize the rabbit. On\n10/12/16 veterinary staff discovered during rounds that the rabbit still had not been euthanized by research\npersonnel. Veterinary staff euthanized the rabbit.\nIn both of these incidents, the AV met with research personnel to provide additional re-training on facility standard\noperating procedures and guidelines.\n*During the inspection at 1:10 PM on 4/3/17, APHIS personnel identified 2 rabbits that were in ventral recumbency\nwith their rear legs fully extended backwards and 1 rabbit that was in right lateral recumbency. The 3 rabbits were\nunattended in the room and had their eyes closed. APHIS personnel requested that the rabbits be examined to\ndetermine their level of alertness. The rabbits did not respond when the doors of their enclosures were opened\n(unusual behavior for rabbits) and they needed to be touched in order to get a reaction. The 2 ventral recumbent\nrabbits lifted their heads, tried to move but their feet slid on the floor of the cage and they could not become upright.\nThe lateral recumbent rabbit was able to get into sternal recumbency.\nIt was determined during a review of the animals\u2019 medical records that that the 3 rabbits had undergone an IACUC\napproved procedure involving the administration of injectable anesthesia at approximately 10:10 AM that morning.\nNotations in the records made by research personnel indicated that the animals had recovered approximately 1 \u00bd\nhrs after the anesthesia was administered and were returned to their enclosures. The condition of the 3 rabbits and\ntheir reactions to external stimuli indicated that the animals had not sufficiently recovered from anesthesia to be left\nunattended.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate\nveterinary care that includes adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care in accordance with current\nestablished veterinary medical and nursing procedures.\nAnimals under general anesthesia need to be continuously monitored so that any changes in vital signs are\npromptly identified and addressed. Animals that have met endpoint criteria must be humanely euthanized as soon\nas possible to minimize discomfort, pain, or distress. Animals recovering from anesthesia need to be observed until\nfully recovered. These guidelines are important to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.\nThe research facility needs to ensure that all personnel involved in the care and use of animals are appropriately\ntrained in and follow the components of the facility\u2019s program of veterinary care.\nCorrect from this date 4/5/17 forward."
