Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was\ndeployed, the \u201cprepared by\u201d and \"received by\" date on this inspection report are different than the date the inspector\nprepared and delivered the original inspection report, which both occurred on 8/19/16.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGage Laurie, Big Cat Specialist\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer",
