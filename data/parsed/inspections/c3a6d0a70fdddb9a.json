Both animals were recaptured and evaluated by veterinary staff. The female\nwho had escaped was uninjured but the male who had escaped fought with a male that was contained in another\nprimary enclosure. Both of the male marmosets sustained injuries of both forearms, received immediate veterinary\ncare and made a full recovery.\nUpon being notified of the escape of the marmosets, Laboratory Animal Resources immediately conducted an\ninvestigation. Although it could not be determined exactly how the marmosets were able to escape from their\nenclosure, it was believed that it most likely happened because the Plexiglas panel door on the front of the\nenclosure was not fully secured thereby leaving a gap large enough to allow the marmosets to escape.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain\nthe nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.\nThe research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and\nUSDA, and implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions included\nbut were not limited to modifying standard operating procedures (SOPs) pertaining to transfer and recapture of\nmarmosets and re-training of personnel on the modified SOPs, replacement of all marmoset caging at the institution\nwith a type of caging that has a different door panel design, and implementing new safeguards for use with the\nPlexiglas panels until the new caging is delivered in summer 2015.\nThis item has been corrected.\nNOTE - Inspection conducted 5/4/15 thru 5/5/15. Exit interview held 5/5/15 with facility personnel.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGladue Paula, Veterinary Medical Officer"
