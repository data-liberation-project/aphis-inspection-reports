The two pair housed female cats are in\none room and the six males are individually housed in the adjacent room. The temperatures in these rooms have\nconsistently been over 85 degrees for the last two months ranging from 88 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The\ntemperature at 11:00 today was 88 degrees in the room, with 56% humidity and a heat index of 95 degrees.\nOutdoor temperatures for the last two months have consistently been in the 90s and 100s. The caretakers tried air\nconditioners in both rooms but due to the lack of insulation of the building the rooms were hotter than the multiple\nfans now in use. They have a sprinkler system which cools the roof at 14:00 each day. The caretakers report the\ncats showed signs of being hot when the air conditioners were trying to cool and the ventilation was low. They\nreport the cats have not shown signs of being hot with the fans turned on them. The cats are not showing any signs\nof heat stress during this inspection.\nAlthough the caretakers at this point have done several things to bring the air temperature down in these cat rooms,\nit is still exceeding 85 degrees for more than 4 hours during these long hot summer days. Ambient temperatures in\nindoor and sheltered housing facilities are not to exceed 85 degrees for more than 4 hours when cats are present.\nAdditional measures need to be taken to keep the temperatures lower. Plans are to make this an outdoor shelter\nand this will increase the ventilation further. To be corrected by 8-12-16."
