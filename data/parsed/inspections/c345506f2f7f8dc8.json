There was insufficient room in the enclosures for the puppies to turn\naround normally or simultaneously lie flat in the enclosures. Each enclosure measured 21 in. L x 15 in. H x 15 in.W\nand the puppies contained in each enclosure collectively weighed 25 lbs.\nPrimary enclosures used to transport live dogs must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained in the\nenclosure has enough space to turn around normally while standing and to lie in a natural position. These space\nrequirements during transportation are in place to allow the dogs to make normal postural adjustments during\nextended periods of confinement thereby reducing potential discomfort, injury and anxiety during travel.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with assistant cargo operations managers."
