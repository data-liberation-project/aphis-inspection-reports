While the raccoon was being fed the raccoon bit the boy around the finger area causing\npuncture wounds. It was stated the boy was taken for medical treatment but did not require sutures. The raccoon\nwas required to be euthanized.\nThis raccoon was not being exhibited so there was minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public. There was\nnot sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and this child so as to assure their safety. This injured\nchild should not have been brought behind the chain-link barrier and allowed to hand feed this raccoon.\nThe Curator stated that this facilities employees have been instructed not to take any members of the public /\nemployee's friends and relatives behind animal barriers including no hand feeding. Also during this inspection there\nwas no public exhibiting or feeding behind any animal barriers therefore this non compliance appears to be\ncorrected.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the curator."
