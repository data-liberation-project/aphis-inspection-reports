According to the facility incident report the NHPs (adult male macaques)\nopened the divider and were found injured when staff returned to the room approximately 20 minutes after shifting\nanimals. Both NHPs received prompt veterinary treatment. One was treated for minor wounds and has since\nrecovered. The second had a significant injury and was promptly euthanized. The staff member involved in the\nincident has been re-trained. The facility self-reported the incident to APHIS officials.\nAnimals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar\nproblems from occurring in the future.\nThe inspection was focused on paperwork review.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
