An adult, male Egyptian Mau named\nJasper (#27) had an area on the left side of his head about 1 inch in diameter that was missing all of its hair and had\nreddened skin. A 5-week-old female Egyptian Mau had a thick, gray discharge in both eyes, had a watery\ndischarge from the nose, and was sneezing. An 8-week-old male Egyptian Mau had a thick, gray discharge in both\neyes and a watery discharge from the nose. A litter of five 10-day-old Russian Blue kittens had a thick, gray\ndischarge coming from their eyes as well as dried, crusted discharge around their eyes. The licensee had not\nnoticed any of these conditions and none of the animals were being treated. Untreated veterinary conditions can be\npainful, can worsen, and can be contagious to other animals. The licensee must have the 5-week-old and\n8-week-old kittens examined and diagnosed by a veterinarian, must follow treatment recommendations, and must\nprovide written records of treatment upon request by the inspector. The licensee must consult the veterinarian\nabout whether or not to bring the 10-day-old kittens in for examination.\n****A bottle of Pyrantel pamoate had an expiration date of March, 2016. Expired medications or vaccines can lose\ntheir effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all\nmedications and vaccines are within their expiration dates at all times.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 7, 2016.\nThe inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and with a Student Intern."
