The three adult brown\nbears are still housed in separate metal barrels that measure 4\u2019 wide by 5-6\u2019 long. The female black bear is still housed in\na metal barrel that measures 4\u2019 wide and 5-6\u2019 long. All four of these bears remain locked into these metal barrels with no\nability to move out of the barrels if desired. The 4-6 year old Female adult brown bear that is locked in a barrel (not\nattached to an enclosure) now has an unknown number of cubs inside the barrel with her. These cubs could be heard\nvocalizing, but could not be visualized in the barrel during inspection. When asked the licensee stated he did not know\nthe number of cubs inside the barrel. At the time of inspection, these bears were awake in their barrels with no access to\nfood or water. Additionally, the climatic temperatures was 32 degrees F.\nBears that are awake and locked into these metal barrels are in a state of unrelieved suffering as they have no ability to\nmove out of the barrels, no access to food and water and have limited ability to self-regulate temperature during winter\nweather conditions. Bears that are awake during their hibernation period and housed in metal barrels are susceptible to\nhypothermia as the metal barrels are not insulated and provide no warmth.\nHandling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nAll animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Appropriate\nspace, housing, food, and water must be provided to these bears to relieve undue suffering."
