The small brown hamster had the most severe fur loss.\nThis hamster was partially or completely missing fur on the majority of its body. The other hamsters had patches of\npartial and complete fur loss. Facility staff observed the hamsters' conditions, but didn't notify the veterinarian. Fur\nloss can be the result of underlying veterinary care issues.\nNotify the veterinarian of the hamsters' conditions. Follow through with all prescribed treatments and/or instructions.\nTo be corrected: All of the affected hamsters were taken to the veterinarian between the time of inspection and the\nexit briefing.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the secretary."
