The facility identified a problem with the\ncity's sewage lift system which was corrected. The otter was in temporary housing at the time of this backup. On August\n2, 2025, sewage once again backed up out of the drain in indoor otter holding but was remedied within several hours. The\notter was not inside at the time and was kept outside until the situation was corrected. Sewage that backs-up out of a\ndrain into an indoor holding facility for animals can expose animals to increased disease risks and increased ammonia\nlevels in the air. Correct by 28 August 2025 by ensuring that all indoor housing facilities are constructed in a manner to\navoid foul odors and installed so as to prevent any backup of sewage.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian and facilities manager.\nn"
