  "narrative": "No non-compliant items identified during this inspection. \nThis was a focused inspection on the NCIs' from the inspection on September 25, 2014.\nBoth dogs #103 M Pekingese and #168 F Shihtzu that had right eye issues have been seen by the attending\nveterinarian who properly diagnosed and prescribed treatment for both dogs. On this date the eyes on both dogs\nhave improved and look like they are healing well. The licensee has increased their daily observations and is\nkeeping a detailed and updated treatment log of all animals in the facility and providing timely treatment by the\nattending veterinarian as needed. \nThe licensee has reduced the number of dogs in each primary enclosure that was too small for 3 dogs down to 2\ndogs per pen. Currently the spacing requirements are being met at this facility according to AWA regulations and\nstandards.\n \nExit interview conducted with facility representative.",
