Since it's a short, open, straight entrance into the\nshelters, with no flaps or doors, the dogs are not adequately protected from the elements. The dogs need effective\nwind and rain breaks on their outdoor shelter units to protect them from the elements and help keep them dry. The\nlicensee must provide adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrances of all the outdoor shelter units."
