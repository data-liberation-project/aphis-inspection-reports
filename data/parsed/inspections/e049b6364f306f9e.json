As we started the inspection he called the lead zookeeper up to relieve him. During the inspection there was\nan attendant that stood watch in the center of the larger petting zoo area. There were several large groups of people\nas well as a group down by the llamas enclosure. These llamas were out of the public attendants viewing range and\nthe public interactions were not being monitored. This area has been blocked off from public contact but the llama\nwere still able to stick their heads through the gate to be fed by the public. If there was one other attendant in that\narea then the facility would have had an adequate number of attendants to properly monitor all the animals during\npublic contact in the petting zoo. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must\nbe present at all times during periods of public contact for the safety and well-being of the animals and the public.\nBy the end of the inspection the gate was pushed back to achieve enough distance to keep the public from feeding\nthe animals."

When they were let out they\nquickly ran to the water and they were bone dry. The outside temperature was 78 degrees F without the tin roofs so\nin that space with tin roofs you could assume they were higher.
