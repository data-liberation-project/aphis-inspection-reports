Excessively long hooves can cause the animals to stand in abnormal positions,\ncan cause pain, and can affect the gait.

There were 6 vials of Feline\nRhino-Calici-Panleuk killed vaccine with an expiration date of August 13, 2015. The Curator stated that she was\naware that the vaccine was expired, but was having difficulty locating this product for purchase. She stated that she\nwas planning to use the expired vaccine in her exotic cats if she didn't find additional product. There was also a\nbottle of Dura-Pen with an expiration date of November, 2015. Expired medications or vaccines can lose their\neffectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease. The licensee must ensure that all medications and\nvaccines are within their expiration dates at all times.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY DECEMBER 9, 2015.\nThe inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative and Kelly Roberts-ACI.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRoberts Kelly, Animal Care Inspector"
