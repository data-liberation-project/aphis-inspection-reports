There is a public barrier approximately 10 feet from the stage that is about 4\nfeet high. During the show the leopard jumps upon a platform that sits about 3 feet from the front left corner and is\nabout 6 feet high. Leashes/chains and handlers are not considered adequate public barriers for large felids. If the\nleopard decided to leap from the platform it is doubtful that the handler could restrain the animal to prevent it from\ngoing close to or contacting the viewing public. An additional form of restraint must be used to continue exhibiting\nthe animal in this manner to assure the safety of the animal and the public.\nTo be corrected by: 5-13-16 .\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted by Dr. Pannill - USDA at The Texas Zoo, Victoria, Tx with the\nowner."
