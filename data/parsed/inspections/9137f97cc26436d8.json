      "narrative": "A 4 year old female Amur Leopard escaped from the outdoor portion of her enclosure the morning of 7 June 2016.\nShe was recaptured successfully and returned to the enclosure. The staff determined that the leopard had climbed\nthe enclosure wall and was able to squeeze out through an opening of the mesh on the top of the enclosure. She\nhad been observed in her outdoor enclosure by the staff at 7:15 am but was spotted by a zoo patron on an\noverhanging beam adjacent to her enclosure at about 9:30 am. She was darted successfully and returned safely to\nthe leopards indoor enclosure. The escape put this leopard at risk for the use of lethal gunshot if the recapture had\nnot been safe and successful as well as for injury during the recapture process. The escape also put patrons of the\nzoo at risk for injury by the leopard. The licensee must ensure that all facilities must be constructed of such material\nand of such strength as appropriated for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be\nstructurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the\nanimals. The leopards are currently housed in the indoor portion of the exhibit. The leopards outdoor enclosure\nmust be corrected by 5 July 2016\nThis was a focused inspection to asses the leopard escape, medical records, and shade/temperature concerns in\nanimal enclosures.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and Margaret A Shaver, VMO in\nattendance."
