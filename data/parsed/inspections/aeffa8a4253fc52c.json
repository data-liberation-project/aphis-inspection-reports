The licensee is near completion of constructing a\nsecond, heated barn since the one does not have enough space to house all the licensee's birds and primates.\nDue to space constraints in the barn, the licensee housed one pair of adult ring-tailed lemurs in a medium-sized dog\ntravel crate and another pair of ring-tailed lemurs (with an infant) in a large dog travel crate. The medium crate was\n21 inches tall and provided 2.9 square feet of floor space. The large crate provided 5.1 square feet of floor space\nand was 30 inches tall. Adult lemurs are required to be housed in enclosures which are at least 30 inches tall and\nprovide each adult with at least 3 square feet of floor space. Therefore, the medium crate was too small and too\nshort for even one ring-tailed lemur. The large crate provided the minimum amount of space required for one lemur,\nbut did not provide adequate space for the two adults housed in it. Primates require sufficient space to allow them\nto make normal postural adjustments for their health and well-being.\n** The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures provide each nonhuman primate with the minimum floor space\nand height required by the regulations. Specifically, each ring-tailed lemur must have at least 3.0 square feet of\nfloor space (6.0 square feet if there are two adults) and at least 30 inches of height in their primary enclosures.
