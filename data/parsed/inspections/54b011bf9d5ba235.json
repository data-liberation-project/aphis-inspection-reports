He instructed the equine supervisor to feed this mare and 2 others separate from the rest of the\nherd to ensure they were receiving an appropriate amount of feed.\nOn June 15, 2016 \u201cLily\u201d was due for a prescribed monthly injection of arthritis medicine. The veterinary care\nmanager responsible for administering that injection noted at that time the mare was a 2/9 body condition and was\nsuffering from hives. According to IACUC documents, when the veterinary care manager consulted the farm\nmanager about calling the clinical veterinarian about the hives the farm manager would not allow the clinical\nveterinarian to be contacted. When daily care sheets were reviewed it was noted the equine manager did not begin\nto feed \u201cLily\u201d separately until June 9, 2016. This was a month after the attending veterinarian gave direct\ninstructions to begin separate feeding immediately.\nOn June 24, 2016 the veterinary care manager and the farm manager were alerted to a problem with a stallion\nnamed \u201cWimpy\u201d. According to IACUC documents when the veterinary care manager requested contact information\nfor Wimpy\u2019 s owner/caretaker the equine manager informed her that she had already contacted the owner/caretaker\nand they had refused treatment for Wimpy. The veterinary care manager contacted the owner/caretaker anyway\nand discovered they had not been contacted about Wimpy\u2019s condition and in fact wanted the horse treated.\nA consistent method for daily observations and treatments of all animals\u2019 needs to be implemented and a method\nfor direct and timely communication with the attending veterinarian needs to be enforced.\nTo be corrected immediately.\nThis inspection was conducted with a facility representatives.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the IO over the phone."
