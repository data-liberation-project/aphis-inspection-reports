One live rat was observed in each of the following field enclosures: R25A, R16D, R16C (all enclosures contain\nmacaques). Another live rat was observed in building Z (which houses macaques). The majority of field enclosures\ncontained rodent burrow holes along the edges of the enclosure walls, both inside and outside the enclosures. A large\namount of rodent feces was present on concrete slabs throughout the outdoor housing enclosure spaces. Multiple bait\nboxes contained dried grass or hay. On the morning of 12/7/23 in the Z and Y buildings there were many rodent\ndroppings between and behind enclosures containing Rhesus macaques, and a live rat in a nest was present in the\ncorner of the Z building (the nest was located in the narrow space between the wire mesh wall of the building and an\nexterior wind break panel. This rodent was removed. The \u201cRodent control program report Fall 2023\u201d shows that there\nwere increased numbers of dead rats removed in October and November and that as a result service to active bait\nstations was increased.
