An IACUC approved protocol involving cynomolgus macaques called for an initial\ndose of a test article to be given at 30 mg/kg and lowered to 15 mg/kg on day 15; however, on day 15 of the study, four\ncynomolgus macaques were given the original 30 mg/kg dose rather than the intended reduced dose amount of 15\nmg/kg. The animals were given the incorrect dose due to a technician error. The dosing error was immediately\ndiscovered, and a veterinarian was notified. Due to the potential adverse effects of the high dose, veterinary staff elected\nto euthanize the four animals to prevent unnecessary pain and discomfort. The animals were euthanized and sent to\nnecropsy on day 18.\nDeviations from a protocol can result in unnecessary pain or death. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure\nthat all personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties to preclude such\nadverse events.\nCorrect from this time forward."

On 21 Oct 2020 a 1-year old female\nYorkshire pig (#1111), weighing 44.57 kg, was found not bearing weight on her left hindlimb. Staff reported the animal\npreferred to be in a recumbent position and was reluctant to stand. The initial veterinary exam confirmed the lameness but\nfound no wounds, bruising, or apparent trauma. The animal was placed on pain medication and when lameness didn\u2019t\nimprove, the pain medication was increased 2 days later. On 26 Oct 2020 the animal was still non-weight bearing and\nthere was mild swelling of the limb; moderate inflammation above the stifle was observed 4 days later. On 4 Nov 2020, a\nComputed Tomography (CT) scan revealed an \"oblique fracture to the left femur with bony callus formation\". It took 15\ndays to obtain imaging diagnostics on this animal. The pig remained on the study until it was completed and was\neuthanized on 11 Nov 2020.\nThe research facility must maintain a program of veterinary care that provides adequate staffing, facilities, equipment, and\nservices to ensure proper monitoring and diagnostics of animals and immediate intervention is required to prevent a\nserious animal welfare issue. Failure to provide adequate personnel and resources could negatively impact animal\nwelfare.\nCorrect from this time forward by ensuring that there is adequate staffing, facilities, equipment, and services so that all\nanimals utilized in study procedures are adequately diagnosed and treated."

The fracture occurred on 5 Mar 2021 while positioning the animal within the procedure cage. The employee\nmanually restrained the non-sedated animal by grasping the macaque by the right forearm to position the animal. The\nanimal struggled during the physical restraint, which resulted in a mid-diaphyseal fracture of the radius and ulna.\nAccording to the facility, the torque applied by the employee to the animal\u2019s limb during positioning most likely resulted in\nthis injury.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrective and preventative actions have been instituted by the facility. These include modification of the procedure to\nprohibit grasping of the animal\u2019s arm below the elbow.
