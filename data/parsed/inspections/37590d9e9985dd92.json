He is on joint supplements, however his\narthritis seems to have progressed enough to require more aggressive treatment to promote his comfort. His stiff\nmovement and resulting gait abnormalities can cause abnormal nail wear or overgrowth. This can also affect his\ngait, resulting in a vicious cycle. This wolf needs to be evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) to determine if\nadditional treatment can help him to be more comfortable. Correct by contacting the AV immediately to request that\nshe evaluate this animal within 10 days, by April 21, 2017.\nThe Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was written nearly five years ago (7/23/2012) and hasn't been updated.\nSome provisions are not being followed, such as annual fecal exams and sedating animals routinely every three\nyears for a full physical exam. The PVC should be rewritten with the AV and licensee in collaboration. It should be\nreviewed regularly to ensure that routine husbandry and veterinary care procedures are fully addressed and that the\nplan is being followed as written. Correct within 30 days, by May 11, 2017."
