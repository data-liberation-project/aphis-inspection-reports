During the inspection two goats were noted outside of\nthe enclosure. One goat was seen reentering the enclosure through one of the openings.\n*The shelter structure for the deer has sustained damage to the wood floor at the entrance of the structure. There is a\nloose section of wood and a missing piece of wood that the deer may injure their feet/legs on if they step in the affected\narea while entering or exiting the structure.\n*The alpaca and llama currently have access to a stall in the large barn. Along the side of the barn in this enclosure the\nground has eroded away leaving a steep dropoff. There is sunlight visible between the dirt ground and the lowest board of\nthe wall of the barn. In addition, there is a piece of wood on the ground with a sharp exposed corner. One llama was lying\nin this area when the inspector entered the barn. The animals may injure themselves if they get a body part such as a\nlimb caught between the wood and the ground or get wedged into this area.\n*There are currently two main outdoor pastures that open off of the large barn. The larger pasture/outdoor enclosure\nconsists of an older standard four foot livestock fence. This fence is not strong enough/secure enough to house the zebra\nwhich currently has access to this enclosure along with a zedonk and donkeys. Zebra are strong animals with a natural\nflight response and can test fences and jump fences if stressed which may lead to injury and/or escape.\nThe outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury and to contain the animals."
