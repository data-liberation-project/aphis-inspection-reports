For this enclosure, water is usually provided by a water bottle lixit attached to the exterior of the enclosure, but\nupon inspection, the lixit was identified by the inspector as not working properly and therefore not dispensing water. The\ninspector requested water be provided so the licensee attached a new one to provide water access. After the new lixit\nwas attached, all four ferrets drank water vigorously. Two additional lixits were added by the licensee (for a total of three)\nto provide even more access to water. All four ferrets drank vigorously from all three lixits for a period of 15 minutes\nindicating extreme thirst. After the first 15 minutes, two of the ferrets continued to drink vigorously for approximately an\nadditional 5 minutes while the other two occasionally sipped water during that time. In total, two ferrets drank water\ncontinuously for 15 minutes while the other two drank for about 20 continuous minutes.\nAdequate hydration is important for the health and wellbeing of the ferrets as well as to prevent dehydration. A\nmechanism must be in place to provide and verify access to potable water at a frequency that considers the age, species,\ncondition, and size of the animal in order to provide water as often as necessary for not only their health but also their\ncomfort.\nThe facility provided water for these specific animals at the time of inspection. This is to be corrected by September 10,\n2025, or prior to the next licensing inspection, whichever occurs first.\nThis is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class \u201cA\u201d license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the\napplicant.\nAll items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by NOVEMBER 7, 2025, or the applicant will forfeit the\nlicense fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License\nInspection.\nRegulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.\nn"
