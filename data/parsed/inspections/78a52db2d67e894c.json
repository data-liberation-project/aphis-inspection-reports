Many animals are housed in \"box cages\"\ndefined here as a cage measuring 7' tall x 8' wide X 14' long. While waiting outside of the perimeter fence prior to the start\nof the inspection, inspectors were able to see a limited number of enclosures. From this vantage point, inspectors\nobserved at least 6 big cats pacing in their enclosures. This was not in response to our presence or the presence of the\ntractor as we were still outside the perimeter fence and the tractor was not present in the animal area.\nDuring the actual inspection, inspectors observed at least six of the big cats, two bobcats, a wolf and a coyote pacing\nback and forth in their enclosure. Inspectors noted that the facility representatives were driving the tractor around the\nareas of the enclosures during most of the inspection. This equipment could be exacerbating the pacing, however, the\npacing also occurred when the equipment was not in the animal areas.\n\u2022 One adult coyote (Coca) housed in one 7\u2019 tall x 8\u2019 wide x 14\u2019 long enclosure (box cage). The coyote was observed\npacing.\n\u2022 One adult wolf (Shanoah) housed in one box cage. The wolf was observed pacing.\n\u2022 One adult tiger (Brutus) housed in one box cage.
