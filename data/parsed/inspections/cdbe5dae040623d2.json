Approximately two feet from the floor up, in all enclosures, the wire\nwas beginning to rust. On the outdoor portion of the north side, there was an enclosure that had chain link frame\nwork that was rusted completely through on the bottom rail of the fence and the corner of the gate. This enclosure\nalso had a piece of angle iron up against the bottom of the building that was rusted completely through and created\nsharp edges. The sheet metal against the angle iron was beginning to rust through also. Excessive rust cannot be\ncleaned and sanitized as required. It increases the risk for disease by creating a harboring place, can cause sharp\nedges that can injure the animals and can cause damage to the structural strength of the enclosure.
