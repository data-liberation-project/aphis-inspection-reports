      "narrative": "Based on a necropsy report, a 6 day-old piglet died from starvation and emaciation due to the facility\u2019s failure to ensure it\nreceived a sufficient amount of food to maintain proper body condition and health. The piglet had been removed from its\nmother per a research protocol. The standard feeding protocol for these piglets is to teach the pig to drink milk provided\nin a bowl. Milk was provided to this piglet in a bowl and several attempts were made to teach the pig to drink from it, such\nas by dipping it\u2019s snout into the milk and using fingers to try to lure the piglet to the bowl however, the facility\u2019s notes\nindicate that the piglet did not learn to eat from the bowl. Although the piglet had not learned to self-feed through the\nfacility\u2019s standard practice, the facility did not ensure the animal received sufficient feed through an alternate means\n(bottle, syringe, or other method) to maintain proper body condition and health. Supplemental milk was only occasionally\noffered by syringe feeding. In addition, the volumes of milk provided in this manner over each 24 hour period were\napproximately 10% of the animal\u2019s daily energy requirements. On day 4, the pig was described as sitting in the corner,\nquiet and with its head hanging down. When stimulated to move towards the milk bowl, the pig\u2019s snout fell into the bowl.\nAt no time in the 6 days were additional steps implemented such as calculating nutritional needs to maintain body weight,\nincreasing the food offered via syringe or other method, measuring glucose levels, measuring hydration levels and/or fluid\nintake, or conducting weight checks. On day 6, at 4 pm, the pig was found dead. On necropsy, the pig was described\nwith a body condition score of 1/9, emaciated and the death was attributed to prolonged starvation. The facility failed to\ntake the necessary steps to ensure that a sufficient quantity of food was provided to this piglet in a manner that\nconsidered it\u2019s age, condition, and inability to self-feed from a bowl.\nYoung neonatal animals that are removed from their dam require additional care to ensure that the food provided is of\nsufficient quantity and presented in a manner that they are able to consume. Failure to provide feed in an appropriate\nmanner and ensure adequate feed consumption can lead to unnecessary suffering, starvation, and death.\nCorrect by July 28, 2022 by ensuring all animals are provided a sufficient quantity of food to maintain good health and that\nall diets are prepared and presented with consideration given to the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.\nThis inspection was conducted with a facility veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted with the attending\nveterinarian, facility veterinarians, IACUC members, Principal Investigators, and ACUP staff.\nn"
