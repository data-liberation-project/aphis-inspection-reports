This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the teeth and\nextended into the gum line. Most of the gums were reddened and inflamed. There was a creamy, whitish material\nalong the gum line. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth\nstructures. This can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall\nhealth of the animal. The licensee must have this animal's mouth and teeth examined in order to ensure that an\naccurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate dental treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must\ndevelop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the\nanimals in the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nInspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Erika Leisner VMO, and Chad Proctor ACI.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLeisner Erika, Veterinary Medical Officer"
