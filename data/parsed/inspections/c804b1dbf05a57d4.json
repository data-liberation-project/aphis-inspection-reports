A facility representative informed the APHIS inspector that he had been feeding\nher alfalfa pellets separately from the herd, as she was very thin and her teeth were worn down. He stated that she\nhad not been seen by a veterinarian recently. On inspection, APHIS inspector observed that ewe #7070 was thin,\nand her spine and hip bones were protruding. The attending veterinarian stated that neither he nor the other\nveterinarian on staff had examined either of these sheep.\nAdequate daily observation of all animals and direct communication with the attending veterinarian is critical to\nensure that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being can be diagnosed and treated in a timely\nmanner. Injuries, diseases, and medical conditions that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may\nbe worsened and can lead to prolonged suffering.\nEach research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily\nobservations of all animals to assess their health and well-being; provided, however, that daily observation of\nanimals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and provided further, that a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of\nanimal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nTo be corrected from this date forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
