      "narrative": "The Raccoon Building has a high ambient temperature and humidity. The building is constructed of metal and is\nonly partially insulated. There are sixteen fans running throughout the building and there are windows that are open\nalong the sides. The temperatures taken in the building by the Kestrel at approximately 3:50 pm is 100 degrees F\nwith a heat index of 119 degrees F at the north end of the building and 100 degrees F with a heat index of 120\ndegrees F along the east enclosures in the middle of the building. At 4:32 pm the temperature taken is 100.4\ndegrees F with a heat index of 122.1 degrees F along the west enclosures in the middle of the building. At 4:24 pm\nnear the south end of the first room the temperature is 100.1 degrees F and 100.2 degrees F with a heat index of\n120.1 degrees F. Twenty-six raccoons are in severe heat distress and are suffering from the temperatures inside\nthe building.\nThe behaviors observed in these 26 raccoons include panting, drooling and increased respiratory rate.\nThe raccoons are lying on their sides, backs, and abdomens with their legs splayed out demonstrating they are\nuncomfortable with the temperature and are trying to cool off. These 26 raccoons are also reluctant to move,\nlethargic, and not alert to activity in the building around them. These signs are indicative of the elevated temperature\ninside the building not allowing the animals to regulate their core body temperature properly. The inability of these\n26 raccoons to cool off has caused them to suffer. There are approximately 290 raccoons housed in this building.\nThe high temperature and humidity is having a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals.\nThe following animals have been identified as suffering from severe heat stress:\nEnclosure #069: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #001: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #004: 2 raccoons\nEnclosure #005: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #007: 2 raccoons\nEnclosure #008: 2 raccoons\nEnclosure #009: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #014: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #016: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #017: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #019: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #033: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #035: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #040: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #041: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #043: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #061: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #064: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #072: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #174: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #180: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #181: 1 raccoon\nEnclosure #182: 1 raccoon\nWhen climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health and well-being, appropriate measures must be taken\nto alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,\nhumidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must reduce the temperature\nand humidity inside this building to a level that is comfortable for the raccoons in order to support their health and\nwell-being.\nThis inspection and exit interview was conducted with VMO Scott Welch, VMO Autumn Unck, SACS Heather Cole,\nACI Kelly Maxwell, a safety officer, an IES investigator, the attending veterinarian, local law enforcement, and the\nfacility representative.\nThis is a focused inspection concerning the non-compliant item listed on the previous inspection report dated July\n20, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nUnck Autumn, Veterinary Medical Officer\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist\nWelch Scott, Veterinary Medical Officer"
