      "narrative": "One female chimpanzee # 1216 has hairloss over her back, head and limbs. The haircoat appears thin/sparse in\ncoverage and fine in texture where it is present. No lesions/wounds were noted. The staff report that she is getting\nvitamins and flaxseed (given to all chimps) for her skin but is not currently on any other medications. Her medical\nrecord at the zoo states that on 10/20/15 she was noted \"losing more hair\" and the attending veterinarian examined\nher on 10/21/15 making a diagnosis of \"generalized hypotrichosis/alopecia. No skin lesions.\" There is no notation of\nany diagnostic or treatment plan prescribed for the zoo to follow. She arrived at the zoo on June 23, 2015. Review\nof records from the chimp's previous home facility noted that on 4/24/15 \"animal appears to have developed\ndiabetes mellitus. will focus on weight loss to help control\" based on an elevated blood glucose. Additional\nbloodwork at the previous home facility on 6/10/15 showed an even higher blood glucose and an elevated\nfructosamine level. Based on review of facility records available and a conversation with the attending veterinarian,\nno additional medical followup has been done at the Chattanooga Zoo regarding the diabetes with the exception of\ncontinuing on her weight loss plan. Endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus can lead to skin issues and\nhairloss. In addition, unmonitored and untreated diabetes can lead to other very serious medical consequences\nalong with discomfort to the chimp. The zoo shall ensure the use of appropriate methods to diagnose, treat and\nmonitor chimp #1216's hairloss and diabetes and any other related complications.\nThe attending veterinarian faxed a diagnostic plan for chimp #1216 to the zoo during the inspection.\nPreviously cited camel #1191 and chimp #1213 have been evaluated by a veterinarian and treated.\nExit conducted with undersigned facility representative."
