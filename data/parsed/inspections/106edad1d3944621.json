The Grivet monkey shelter was not heated. The\nRing-tailed lemur shelter had two heat lamps at the top of the south wall of the shelter. There was straw in both\nshelters. The ambient temperature inside the Grivet monkey shelter was 43.7 degrees F. The ambient temperature\ninside the Ring-tailed lemur shelter was 42.9 degrees F. All animals must be housed in appropriate conditions to\nprevent weather related injuries. All enclosures that house non-human primates must contain a shelter that\nprovides heat to the non-human primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 45 degrees F.\nThese animals must be housed in an enclosure that meets the temperature requirement stated above.
