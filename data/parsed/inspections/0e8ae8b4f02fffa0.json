The alleyway between the enclosure and perimeter fence\nhad dense grass, bushes, and trees growing in the area and gave the appearance it had not be maintained in\nmonths. The foliage not only blocked the view of the perimeter fence in certain areas but also misshaped the fence.\nMultiple bottom sections of the chain-link perimeter fence were bulging outward and had even caused the\nseparation of the metal pipe framework. There were several areas in the fence that were bent and had separated\nfrom the metal pipe framework. One drainage area under the perimeter fence had such significant erosion that an\napproximate 18 inch gap was present between the bottom of the perimeter fence and ground. The perimeter fence\nis next to a wooded area and walkway where families with small children commonly come. Since the other sides of\nthe perimeter fence were well kept, an employee was asked about the cause for this side(cid:25)s lack of maintenance.\nTheir response mentioned lack of manpower, resources, a small alleyway that would not fit their mower, and a\nbroken attachment often used to clear foliage in a narrow space. The perimeter fence is vital in protecting the\nenclosed animals from exposure to diseases in the wildlife and protecting the public from injury. The perimeter\nfence must also serve as a secondary containment system for the bison. The fence as is will not restrict animals or\nchildren from contact with the bison nor will it serve as a functional secondary containment system. Repair or\nreplace the perimeter fence so that it will restrict animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it\nand having contact with the bison.\nA work order from the Acting Park Supervisor was made available to the VMO as a good faith effort to show\nprogress will be made to correct this noncompliant item in a timely manner.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Acting Park Supervisor."
