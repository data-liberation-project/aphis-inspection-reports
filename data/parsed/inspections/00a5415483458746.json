      "narrative": "In building \"A\" there is a female Rat Terrier (Saturn, microchip #018 345 587) whose legs and feet have multiple\nhairless, red lesions on them. The skin on the inside of the dog's hind legs is also reddened. The left hind leg\nappeared to show some weakness and seemed the most sensitive to the dog. The dog's head and both ears are\nalso covered in hairless spots and patches. Initially, the inspector saw the dog standing on only its right hind leg\nand left front leg while holding the other two legs off the floor. The dog was very resistant to moving even when the\nother dogs ran into her. When she did walk she was very hesitant to place any of her feet on the ground or bear\nweight on them and moved with an abnormal, choppy gait.\nThe licensee had documented that the dog was evaluated by a licensed veterinarian on January 31, 2015 and had\ntreated the dog with Miconazole cream for two weeks and a tablet medication once a day until gone. During the\ninspection, the facility representative contacted the veterinarian's office by phone to acquire a statement about the\ndog but they could not confirm that the veterinarian had evaluated this dog.\nSkin conditions such as this can cause pain and discomfort to the dog. The facility representative was verbally\ninstructed to have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by 12:00 pm on Thursday, March 19, 2015 in order\nto ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and appropriate treatment plan is established. This information,\nincluding diagnosis, treatment plan and resolution of the condition, must be documented and available to the\ninspector upon request."
