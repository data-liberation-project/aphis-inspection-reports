(4)\n***There were at least three outdoor enclosures housing adult dogs (Pomeranians, Boston Terriers, Golden\nRetrievers and a Poodle) with shelters that did not contain adequate bedding. According to the National Weather\nService, the air temperature for the area at the time of inspection (approximately 11:00am) was 40 degrees F.\nThere was only a minimal amount of bedding material inside the shelters. Some of the shelters had most of the\nfloor exposed while others had a thin layer of bedding that was fairly evenly distributed on the floor with parts of the\nfloor easily seen. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing a sufficient source to keep them warm increases\nthe risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must contain clean, dry,\nbedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is\nrequired when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower. To be corrected by: immediately on January 26,\n2015 and from this point forward.\nNote: facility representatives provided bedding to these enclosures during the inspection.\nThe inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The exit interview was conducted with a facility\nrepresentative on January 26, 2015 during which the correction date was discussed."
