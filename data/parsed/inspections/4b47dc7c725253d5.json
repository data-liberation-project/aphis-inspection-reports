The\nanimal was on top of the students head and when she went to lift the animal off her, it reached around and bit her\nhand causing injury. Although there is a holding enclosure the animal can be shifted into, this animal was not locked\ndown. The holding enclosure is challenging to access without the proper equipment (specific screwdriver) and there\nare no protocols in place for proper handling while cleaning and feeding the animals. Handling of the animals must\nbe done in a manner that does not cause stress or physical harm. It is important that when inexperienced students\nare working with exotic animals that safeguards be put in place for the protection of the animals and students.\n*** The fox is still housed in an enclosure inside the main building that does not provide adequate space. In addition,\nthere is no shift area for this animal and currently the licensee is trying to catch the animal in a wire trap to move it\nto an outdoor enclosure. The wire trap has been in the current enclosure for the past three days with no success of\ncatching the animal. Keeping the trap in the animals enclosure and actively trying to bait and catch it for several\ndays is stressful for the animal and can lead to overheating and potential physical harm. This enclosure is not\ndesigned to facilitate daily husbandry care of the animal in a safe manner."
