The registrant stated that the\npuppy was found dead that morning after a 10 day illness of lethargy, nasal discharge, and hacking cough. The registrant\nstated that the puppy had been sick when she received it 10 days earlier. She said she had a veterinarian exam the\npuppy that day and he recommended treatment with the oral antibiotic doxycycline and nebulization with albuterol. The\nregistrant had no medical record. The bottle of medication simply said doxycycline 100mg; 50 count. There were no\ninstructions for this specific puppy. Further veterinary care was not sought despite the puppy's worsening condition.\nInadequately treated medical conditions can worsen, can be painful, and may be contagious to other dogs in the kennel.\nThe registrant must have sick or injured dogs evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis, must follow the\nveterinarian's treatment plan, and must follow-up with the veterinarian if the problem does not resolve in a timely manner.\n**Four dogs had excessive matting of the haircoat. A female Cockapoo (#21-32) had a large amount of dried feces matted\ninto the haircoat below her tail and down her back legs. A Maltese (no ID) had matted hair along its back. A poodle (no\nID) had matted hair on its back. A ShihTzu (no ID) had matted hair on its ears. Matted hair can result in skin and/or eye\nproblems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair\u2019s ability to provide protection from the heat or cold. The\nregistrant must remove the matted hair from this animal and must establish an effective program of haircoat maintenance.\nTo be corrected by March 2, 2021."
