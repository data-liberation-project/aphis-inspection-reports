      "narrative": "10 middle-school-aged children and 4 staff members were observed interacting and swimming with 3 adult Asian soft\nclawed otters for 30 minutes in an approximately 25 foot by 10 foot swimming pool which was approximately 4.5 feet\ndeep. At the beginning of the encounter, staff members instructed the children to stay near the edges of the pool, not to\ngrab or crowd the otters, and staff stated that the \u201cotters can bite but it\u2019s playful, like a dog or cat you have at home\u201d and\nwent on to instruct students to tell staff members if they were badly bitten or bleeding. The otters were brought out to the\npool and were observed to swim and interact with the children and staff in the pool.\nOne boy was sitting in the water on the steps at the end of the pool with 2-3 other boys and interacting with an otter. The\nboy said, \u201cOuch, he bit me!\u201d and then said, \u201che bit me on my leg, and there\u2019s a piece of skin hanging off!\u201d. Staff members\ndid not hear or did not respond to the boy\u2019s exclamations. A few minutes later the boy lifted his right leg out of the water\nand pointed to an area on his calf, and said, \u201cone bit me right here\u201d and tried to show a male staff member, but the staff\nmember began talking to another adult and moved away. The boy soon resumed swimming and was not heard to\ncomplain any further about the otter bite. USDA personnel did not note any bite marks, broken skin, or blood from the\naffected child.\nAt the end of the encounter the children sat along the deck and placed their towels on their laps. The otters came onto the\nchildren\u2019s laps and rubbed themselves against the towels to dry off. The children were petting and scratching the otters\nwhile they were drying off, often 2-3 children touching one otter at the same time. One tall shirtless boy with brown hair\nsaid, \u201cOw! He bit me on my finger!\u201d and held up his left index finger. He repeated, \u201cHe bit me on my finger!\u201d and looked at\nhis finger again, then looked at a staff member. The staff did not hear or did not respond to the boy\u2019s exclamations. The\nboy held his finger for a while and then appeared to resume the animal encounter. After he exited the area, USDA\npersonnel asked the boy if his finger was okay and he stated that it was fine. USDA personnel did not notice any evidence\nof bite marks or broken skin on the affected children.\nThe otters were then loaded into a pet carrier with a wire door, and the children were told to give the otters a \u201chigh five\u201d by\nsticking one finger in through the door of the crate. One boy stepped back after sticking his finger in the crate and said,\n\u201couch, it bit me! It gave me a bite-five!\u201d. Many children and staff were moving and talking in the area and it was not clear if\nstaff acknowledged the boy\u2019s exclamation.\nWhile the observed bites to people did not appear to break skin or show any bite marks, the occurrence of animal bites\ndoes demonstrate a dangerous behavior and therefore shows that the animals were not handled in a manner that\nminimizes the risk of harm to the public. People who are bitten by animals may suffer from stress, pain, discomfort, or\ninfection. Animals who bite humans may be injured or stressed if the person is startled or reacts suddenly. Public health\nauthorities may require animals who have bitten humans to undergo quarantine or euthanasia for rabies testing.\nCorrect by handling animals so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public, to assure the safety of\nanimals and the public."
