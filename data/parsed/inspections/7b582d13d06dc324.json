The caretaker observed the water bottle had been\nimproperly placed in the cage which restricted the animal's access to water. Based on an internal investigation by\nthe Division of Animal Resources, it was determined that the animal likely had no access to water for at least 5\ndays. If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the\nhealth and comfort of the animal. The internal investigation also resulted in corrective actions taken by the\ninstitution to mitigate further recurrences.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
