The primary material of the\nenclosure is wire mesh. This enclosure houses approximately 36 zebra finches. Also observed in this enclosure were 2\nnests made by birds outside of the nestboxes provided. One nest with eggs was situated on the platform designed to hold\na water dish and the other was built on the ground in a corner with no shelter and had 3 fledglings present. An inspector\nobserved that at least one of the fledglings had feather loss at the base of the neck and relayed this information to facility\nrepresentatives who alerted the attending veterinarian promptly. During daily observations, the facility missed dead birds\nin the enclosure, abnormal behavior for the species (nesting on ground) and feather loss in fledglings.\nFailure to conduct adequate daily observations to identify changes in normal behavior, signs of overcrowding or dead\nanimals can result in unnecessary loss of life or detrimental impact to health and psychological welfare of animals. Each\nexhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observation of all animals to\nassess their health and well-being.
