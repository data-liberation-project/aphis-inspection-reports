      "narrative": "- In the sheltered facility, \"Ziggy,\"(cid:29) an 8 year old dappled Dachshund male (ID # 0A01705230 ) had an excessive\nbuildup of a dark brown material on the teeth extending up into the gum line. Most of the teeth could not be\nvisualized. The gums were swollen and reddened. There was a yellow, creamy material along the gum line near\none of the large cheek teeth on the right side (the large carnassial tooth). The buildup of abnormal material on teeth\nwith a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of\nthe animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n- In the sheltered portion located behind the licensee'(cid:25)s home a red female Chow Chow named, \"Pearl\" (cid:28)had a\nclear discharge surrounding and draining from both eyes and down her face. The discharge completely circled\neach eye and ran down her face toward the muzzle. The licensee stated that Pearl's(cid:29) eyes had been that way since\nshe was a puppy but no documentation could be provided from the attending veterinarian indicating a pre-existing\ncondition. Eye discharge can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could\nbe painful. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n- One outdoor enclosure contained three adult Scottish Terriers, two females and one male. One black female\nnamed, \"(cid:28)Teddy Bear\"(cid:29) appeared to be very sore and stiff when trying to walk. This could be an indication of an\naltercation between one or more of the other dogs in the enclosure or be an indication of health issues. (cid:28)Teddy\nBear(cid:29) also had fecal material coating her bottom area indicating a quick release of feces associated with fear or\nintimidation from another dog or diarrhea. The stiff, sore posture indicates a health issue and the underlying cause\nmust be determined and addressed. If the diagnosis is soreness due to fighting then the social hierarchy of this\ngroup does not accommodate these two particular females with this particular male. The licensee must take this\nanimal to a veterinarian and determine the underlying problem and observe and establish appropriate compatibility\nbetween mating pairs in order to prevent future injury and maintain compatible groups at all times."

The licensee stated that the solid waste had been\nremoved four days prior to the inspection. Fecal waste buildup reduces available floor surface area that the dogs\nhave access to. Animal waste collecting under and around dogs creates an unsanitary condition and could lead to\npotential disease or health risks for the dogs. The potential for increased insect and pest infestation exists when\nanimal waste is not removed in a timely manner. The potential for respiratory problems exist when the dogs are\nsubjected to the continual smell of animal waste that is collecting under and around them. Removal of animal\nwaste from the runs and inside the sheltered facility must occur daily to prevent an excessive accumulation that\ncould cause soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests,\nand odors. The licensee must ensure that all excreta is removed from the primary enclosures on a daily basis.\nCorrected by: 20 February 2015\nAdditional Inspectors\nLight Brittany, Animal Care Inspector"
