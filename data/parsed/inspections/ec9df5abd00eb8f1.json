This is the result of the goats chewing on it. This can be\nhazardous to animals because animal limbs could get caught in these openings. Within the outdoor section of\nenclosure #9, housing a young llama and several kids, there was metal wire covering the wood fencing surrounding\nbig tree within that area had several parts were broken leaving sharp, pointy edges that were in direct contact with\nthe animals. Four goats were chewing on this wiring at time of inspection. Sharp points and jagged edges can\ninjure the animals.\n***Aoudad primary enclosure entrance gate was hard to open due to the gate interlocking mechanism being bent\nand worn down. In the rear of the enclosure, the large climbing rock was a missing patch outer covering material, at\nthe base of the structure. Since the animals actively climb this structure, exposed jagged edges could be injurious\nthem.\nThe licensee must ensure that enclosures and their contents are maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury.\nThis inspection was conducted on October 1 and 2 with facility representatives.
