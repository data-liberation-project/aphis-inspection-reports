The animals did not currently show any obvious signs of heat related issues. The pens are located at the\nedge of a three sided roofed structure and will be in the shade in the afternoons. Due to the angle of the sun the\nanimals are not able to get out of the sun until mid afternoon. Temperatures today was already 86 deg F (Kestral) at\n11:30 am. Adequate shade is necessary to provide protection from sunlight and to help prevent overheating stress\nespecially for the young animals. Correct by ensuring that all animals have sufficient shade to protect themselves\nfrom direct sunlight at all times.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative."
