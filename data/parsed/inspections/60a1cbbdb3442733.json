In these enclosures it was not yet to the point of breaking but enough to be concerned about\nstructural integrity. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury and contain the animals. The doors must be repaired or replace. The door of the enclosure housing\n\u201cThelma\u201d and \u201cLouise\u201d was repaired by the time of the exit interview.\nCorrect by: Feb. 3, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and two other employees."
