This must be done to ensure that the\nstructural integrity is not compromised and that the animals are protected from injury due to broken wires. The\nbottom support pipes for these wire panels where rusty, need to be painted to prevent further rusting and\ndeterioration. To be corrected by 10-30-14.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative."
