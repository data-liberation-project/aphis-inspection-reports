      "narrative": "Two handling incidents occurred resulting in Animal death:\n- On February 3, 2022, Yorkshire pig # 7418, died due to a significant amount of air entering the heart during a procedure\nunder anesthesia. The pig was being administered intravenous fluids during a procedure from a fluid bag encased in a\npressure sheath. Unnoticed, the bag ran out of fluid, filled with air and introduced air into the pig\u2019s vasculature resulting in\ndeath.\n- On February 15, 2022, Yorkshire pig # 397 part of study LV15P, died from having been administered an excessive\namount of intravenous fluids. During the procedure, both the veterinary team and the researchers administered\nintravenous fluids to the pig without coordinating with each other resulting in fluid overload. An attempt was made to\ncorrect fluid abnormalities detected during the procedure but the pig died shortly into recovery. Findings on necropsy were\nconsistent with fluid overload being the cause of death.\nMistakes in handling, mainly involving fluid administration and monitoring, during these procedures contributed to the\ndeath of these pigs. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time of inspection."

Pig #\n7592 had a large amount of red lines dispersed throughout both the left and right sides of the body, extending from the\nneck to the hindquarters. There was a cluster of red scratches on the left and right shoulder areas, but some scratches\ncould also be seen on the outside of both ears and on the face. In addition, there was a small wound on the right\neyebrow. Pig # 7591 had less scratches with the red lines mainly on his left and right shoulder areas. A facility\nrepresentative explained that the scratches were caused by the pigs interacting with one another since being housed\ntogether 3 days ago. The current group housing situation has resulted in mild injuries and may be causing stress as well\nas discomfort to both these pigs. Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere with their health or cause them\ndiscomfort. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible.
