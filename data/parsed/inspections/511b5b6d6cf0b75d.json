      "narrative": "-There is insufficient evidence to determine that the tiger named \"Sarabi\" received adequate veterinary care prior to\nher death. On 7-4-2015 the AV observed Sarabi exhibiting a left head tilt and breathing heavier than usual. The AV\ndiagnosed otitis and an upper respiratory infection. There was no indication a physical examination was performed\nand it appears that only a visual examination occurred. No treatment was administered for this neurological\ncondition until 7-6-15. Public concern with Sarabi exhibiting neurological symptoms was noted. On 7-6-2015 the\nAV prescribed Cephalexin 1500 mg. po, q8h. An entry on 7-24-2015 by the AV states meds were given without\nincident and on AV visual examination, the tiger did not have a head tilt and breathing was assessed to be back to\nnormal. There is no park treatment log or record that the prescribed medication was administered to Sarabi.\nAn entry record from the AV on 8-24-2015 states drooling was observed from the right side of the mouth and no\ntreatment, diagnosis, or plan was noted. Eight days later on the morning of 9-1-2015 the AV made an entry that the\ntiger was (cid:28)down(cid:29) the previous evening; panting heavy and not eating. She described the tiger as depressed, still\ndrooling, clear nasal discharge and walking to water but not drinking. The AV diagnosis was abscessed tooth. The\nAV plan included return later in evening to sedate the tiger and performed a physical examination, collect blood, and\nperform a dental extraction. After sedation, her physical examination findings included (cid:28)sloppy heart sounds(cid:29), clear\nnasal discharge, possible cloudy left eye, no wheezing or crackle, but lung sounds were (cid:28)not crisp(cid:29), teeth (cid:28)looked\ngreat(cid:29), a tiny tear was noted in the upper gum line at left canine; a piece of bone was noted to be wedged in the\narea and was removed. No obvious abdominal masses were palpated, no external parasites were observed, and\npossible mild dehydration was noted. The tiger was awake and walking after anesthetic reversal administered. On\n9-2-2015 an entry was made that in the AV medical notes that Sarabi was ambulatory and eating. On the morning\nof 9-6-2015 Sarabi was found dead in her enclosure. From the records complied by the inspectors from the AV and\nthe facility it appears Sarabi has been unhealthy starting in July 2015 until her death September 6, 2015. During this\nperiod of time she received one round of antibiotics and one physical examination. No other treatment was\nadministered or prescribed. The only diagnostic tested preformed on Sarabi were a CBC and chemistry profile two\ndays prior to her death. The chronological order of events and documentation were difficult to determine because\nthe AV facility walk through notes are the only records maintained by the facility. Multiple areas regarding this\nanimal's condition were missing, poorly recorded, or not provided to the inspectors in a reasonable time period after\nthe actual inspection. Sarabi had drooling and other medical issues including mild dehydration, clear nasal\ndischarge, \"(cid:28)sloppy cardiac sounds(cid:29) \", and abnormal lung sounds. These issues were not immediately addressed\nand no other treatment was administered. Documentation of the examination, diagnostic testing performed,\ntreatment prescribed, and plan for continued evaluation and follow-up needs to be maintained by the facility and be\navailable for review by APHIS inspectors. All relevant medical records must be provided at the time of inspection,\nor within a reasonable time period. Documentation must be maintained for any health related problems and it must\ninclude the following information:\n- Identity of the animal.\n- Descriptions of the illness or injury.\n- Dates, details, and results of examinations, tests, and other such procedures.\n- Dates and other details of all treatments, including the name, dose, route, frequency, and duration of treatment\nwith drugs or other medications.\n- Follow-up exams to determine resolution of problem.\nTo be corrected 30 October 2015"

The animal was able to\nreach an area that extended beyond the existing public barrier making it possible for public contact to occur with this\nnonhuman primate.\nIn two enclosures at the back of the park the enclosure walls contain plexi-glass partitions to allow clear viewing of\nthe animals. There were 1/2 inch diameter holes in these partitions in front of the river otter as well as the other\nblack and white lemur named \"Yin\". These holes are large enough to allow a finger to pass through, which could\npermit contact with the enclosed animals. This is a potential hazard to park guests, and could negatively impact the\nanimals as well.\nIn any area where the public is allowed to feed or is able to physically contact enclosed animals there must be either\nan easily identifiable park employee, or a public barrier sufficient to keep the public at least 3 feet away from the\nenclosure wall. The facility must provide public barriers in all areas of the park. In areas where the facility will allow\ncontact and/or feeding of the animals, there must be an easily identifiable park employee present to supervise the\ninteraction with the animals."
