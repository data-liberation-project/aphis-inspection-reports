      "narrative": "During this inspection, the following animals and conditions were observed:\n- In the top enclosure of stack 8A, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with moderate hair loss on it\u2019s back. The\nunderlying skin is crusty with mild ulceration.\n- In the 3rd enclosure of stack 7A, there is a brown, black, and white guinea pig with missing hair and crusty skin on the\nright side of it\u2019s nose.\n- In the top enclosure of stack 6A, there is a brown and white guinea pig with missing hair, crusty skin, and mild ulceration\nunder it\u2019s right eye and over the top of it\u2019s nose.\n- Also in the top enclosure of stack 6A, there is a brown and tan guinea pig with missing hair and crusty skin between it\u2019s\nright eye and right ear.\n- Also in the top enclosure of stack 6A, there is another brown and white guinea pig with missing hair, crusty skin, and\nulceration around it\u2019s right eye.\n- In the 5th enclosure of stack 6A, there is a white and black guinea pig with missing hair around it\u2019s right eye and leading\ndown toward the nose. The underlying skin is crusty with moderate amounts of dried blood present.\n- In the top enclosure of stack 5A, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with a markedly smaller left eye that is\nsealed shut with crusting green mucous. The right eye of this same animal is missing hair around it with the underlying\nskin also being crusty with mild ulceration present. This animal also has missing hair with the underlying skin being\nreddened and crusty on it\u2019s back.\n- In the 3rd enclosure of stack 5A, there is a brown and white guinea pig missing hair on both it\u2019s back and nose with\ncrusting present on the underlying skin.\n- In the top enclosure of stack 4A, there is a black, brown, and white guinea pig with missing hair on the left side of it\u2019s\nface between the nose and the eye. The underlying skin is also crusting and ulcerated.\n- In the top enclosure of stack 3A, there is a tan and white guinea pig with a left eye that is yellow/white/green in color with\na brown center. The eye is outlined in red and thick, green mucous is noted around the eye.\n- Also in the top enclosure of stack 3A, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig that is missing hair on it\u2019s back.\n- In the 2nd enclosure of stack 2A, there is a black, brown, and white guinea pig missing hair on it\u2019s back and both sides\nwith mild scabbing present on the underlying skin.\n- In the top enclosure of stack 1A, there is a tan and white guinea pig missing hair on it\u2019s back with crusting noted on the\nunderlying skin.\n- In the 4th enclosure of stack 7B, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with missing hair on the right side of it\u2019s\nnose.\n- In the 4th enclosure of stack 5B there is a black and white guinea pig squinting it\u2019s right eye and marked ulceration is\nobserved on the skin surrounding the eye. There is also green mucoid discharge noted from the eye.\n- In the 5th enclosure of stack 5B, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig missing hair around it\u2019s left eye with the\nunderlying skin being crusty as well.\n- In the bottom enclosure of stack 5B, there is a black and white guinea pig with missing hair and ulcerated skin between\nit\u2019s nose and left eye.\n- In the 4th enclosure of stack 2B, there is a tan and white guinea pig with a moderate right-sided head tilt.\n- In the top enclosure of stack 1B, there is a black guinea pig with missing hair and crusting skin around it\u2019s left eye.\n- In the 3rd enclosure of stack 1B, there is a brown and white guinea pig with missing hair around it\u2019s left eye with crusting\nand mildly ulcerated skin underneath.\nAll of these animals were still in their original enclosures at the time of inspection and had not been identified by the\nlicensee. Animals with missing hair were not separated as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care and the Attending\nVeterinarian had not been contacted about any of the animals with skin issues, eye issues, or a head tilt.\nThe licensee was also asked about the animals identified on the USDA Inspection Report dated November 23, 2021. The\nlicensee stated that none of those animals were examined by the Attending Veterinarian. The guinea pig with the rectal\nprolapse was found dead in it\u2019s enclosure and the animals with skin issues were treated with Ivermec, not the Miconazole\nNitrate recommended by the Attending Veterinarian for animals with possible ringworm. The licensee stated that guinea\npigs whose condition improved with the Ivermec were returned to their enclosures while the remaining guinea pigs were\nsold at auction, including the guinea pigs noted to have the safety pins in their ears.\nA failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the Attending Veterinarian can result in delay of\ncare, worsening of health issues, and further spread of disease. Instructions provided by the Attending Veterinarian must\nbe followed to prevent further pain and distress to the animals as well as limiting the spread of disease.\nCorrect by observing all animals on a daily basis, following the instructions provided in the Program of Veterinary Care,\nand having all of the aforementioned animals examined by the Attending Veterinarian."
