      "narrative": "A facility employee transported by air from Florida to Oregon, via Chicago, two 3-week-old bobcats in-cabin with\nhim. He is experienced in the care of young animals, including non-domestic felids. The CVI issued 5/19/2016\ndocumented their age at 3 weeks. They were transported in a crate with blankets and a Snuggle Safe disc\n(warmer), and were fed every three hours for the duration. At the time of this focused inspection, the bobcats were\nabout 4 weeks old, and held in a transport-type crate with blankets and a Snuggle Safe disc. Surface temperature of\nthe bedding in the crate was 76.5 degrees. The cubs were bright and alert and moving around normally.\nIt has been determined that transporting neonatal (<4 weeks old) nondomestic cats is not consistent with safe\nhandling and protecting them from harm. The moving of the enclosure and the noise of the planes and the crowds\ncan cause behavioral stress and discomfort. In addition, neonatal animals are not considered to have competent\nimmune systems until they have had a series of vaccinations. They were potentially exposed to pathogens from\nother animals and people on the planes and in the airports.\nCorrect by no longer transporting neonatal animals, from this point on.\nThis focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensees and facility personnel.\nA revised exit briefing was conducted by telephone."
