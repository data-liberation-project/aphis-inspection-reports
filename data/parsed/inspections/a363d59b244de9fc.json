The veterinary staff directed the\ninvestigator to have the animal removed from water regulation. Upon review of the animal\u2019s records, it was noted that the\nlaboratory staff failed to follow the water regulation section of the approved protocol because they had not weighed the\nanimal \u201cat least weekly\u201d while the animal was \u201con a water schedule\u201d. Prior to the dehydration incident this animal had last\nbeen weighed on 3/18/22 and ten days previous to that on 3/8/22. After this incident, laboratory staff were retrained by\nveterinary staff on methods to monitor general health and dehydration. Despite being retrained, a second incident\noccurred in this lab on May 2, 2022 when the clinical veterinary staff diagnosed dehydration on two macaques sharing the\nsame enclosure, ID #s 45483 and 43901. Animal # 45483 in particular was found to be recumbent, not eating, and had\nsunken eyes. Both animals had dry, pellet-like feces and scant urine, and both drank readily when offered water.\nIn the approved protocol the section titled \u201cWater Regulation\u201d specifies \u201cWhenever an animal is on a water schedule,\ndetailed records of fluid intake are maintained. During this period animals are also weighed at least weekly, and usually\nseveral times per week\u2026. Supplementary hydration is provided, and veterinary staff are notified if the animal's weight falls\nbelow 90% of the current baseline weight, if it appears listless or unduly distressed, if the skin is loose and inelastic, or if\nstools are hard and dry or if the animal is constipated.\u201d Despite the previous incidence of dehydration with Animal # 47533\nafter which the veterinary staff provided the lab with additional training, the lab failed to ensure that the animals under\ntheir care received adequate hydration.\nFailure to follow the research protocol that has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\n(IACUC) can put the animals at risk of harm. This incident was self-reported by the attending veterinarian to USDA APHIS\nAnimal Care, and the veterinary staff and IACUC are taking steps to ensure that the water regulation guidelines described\nin the protocol are appropriate, and that the investigator and lab personnel adhere to the approved protocol from this time\nforward."
