The whelping kennel had one small window\n(approx. 6in x 12) open and there were no fans turned on to move air. The temperature inside of the second kennel\nwas 93 deg F, with a Heat Index of 108 deg F. There was no air moving in this second kennel. There was one fan\nfacing the inside of one primary enclosure containing one dog. The fan was on low, and neither inspector could feel\nair movement when they placed their hands in front of the fan. This second kennel had only 1 small window open\n(approx. 6in x 12in). The dogs in both sheltered kennels, were panting heavily throughout the inspection. This is a\n\u2018short nosed\u2019 breed that has difficulty moving air and are very susceptible to respiratory distress from heat stress\nwhen environmental temperatures are high. There was a female nursing her pups, who was lying flat out and\npanting heavily (signs of heat stress). The neighboring enclosure contained 8 pups that were lying on their back and\nside, separated from each other and panting, so they were also showing signs of heat stress.\nThere were no temperature measuring devices located in either kennel to monitor and keep the temperatures at\ntheir required levels in a sheltered facility according to AWA standards and regulations.\nThe temperatures for the past several days have been in the upper 80s, low 90s, and will continue to be in the low\n90's for the next 7-8 days. We were at the facility at 1130am where the ambient temperature was 92 deg F, no one\nwas home. When we returned at 4pm, the ambient temperature was still 92 deg F, with no one home until 5pm\nwhen we conducted the inspection.\nHigh temperatures can be a source of discomfort and possible health issues, especially in short nosed breeds, if left\nuncontrolled. It is important to have temperature measuring devices in order to monitor the heat/cold in the kennels\nfor proper regulation of the temperatures.\nThe sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to\nprotect the dogs from temperature or humidity extremes and to provide for their health and well-being. The ambient\ntemperature must not rise above 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs are present\nin a sheltered housing facility. There should be a temperature measuring device available to monitor the kennel\ntemperatures.\nTo be corrected by: September 24, 2017"
