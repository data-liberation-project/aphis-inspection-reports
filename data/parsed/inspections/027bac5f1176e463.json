This\nwas corrected by the facility representative at the time of the inspection.\n- In the Serengeti area, there is a large shelter which is in poor repair. There are numerous exposed nails, and\nmultiple sharp edges of sheet metal in this enclosure. This poses a risk of injury to any animals using the shelter.\nThe shelter must be repaired or replaced, and maintained appropriately.\n- The tiger enclosure is composed of fencing with kick-ins at the top. In several places, gaps are present between\nthe kick-ins and the underlying fence. These gaps are a potential avenue of escape for enclosed animals, and must\nbe secured to help ensure the tiger is adequately contained.\n- The area just north of the pond has a cross fence that is down. This down fence is in the enclosure with the\nPrezwalski horses. This is a potential soucre of injury to these animals.
