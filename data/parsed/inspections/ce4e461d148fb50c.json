There were no animals seen or heard, the inside of all windows\nwas covered, and there was Tyvek sheeting covering several doors and the siding and, to the inspector, gave the\nappearance that no one was currently living at the location. The inspector asked a neighbor if the property in question\nhad been correctly identified as the licensee's property. The neighbor reported to the inspector that the licensee had\nmoved out of state approximately one month ago. Licensees shall notify Animal Care no fewer than 90 days prior to a\nchange in the business address. Failure to notify APHIS in advance of a change in address prevents Officials from\nensuring adherence to the AWA Standards. The licensee must correct this by applying for and obtaining a new license,\nwith the new address listed, prior to conducting any regulated activity. Correct by: April 28, 2023."
