The mats vary in size from 2 to 6 inches in width and are pulling\ntight against the skin on the legs. Some of the mats under the tail contain dry fecal material and small gray debris.\nMatting can be painful and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. A program of routine hair coat\nmaintenance must be established and maintained for all dogs at this facility in order to prevent diseases associated\nwith excessive matting.
