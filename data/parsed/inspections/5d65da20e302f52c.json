At the Pacific Beach site, the\nsecurity guard informed me that there is vivarium space at that site, but the offices had moved last September. He\nwas able to reach the company and they provided the new address for the offices and vivarium space.\nA research facility shall notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name, address, or\nownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as a research facility, within 10 days after making such\nchange.
