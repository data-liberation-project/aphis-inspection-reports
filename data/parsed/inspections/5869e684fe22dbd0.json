The animals were not pair housed with one another and were not intended to have\ncontact. These types of enclosures have a grid-style floor panel above a solid barrier that prevents contact when another\nanimal is housed in an enclosure below. At the time of the incident, the solid barrier below an enclosure housing a non-\nhuman primate had been removed during husbandry activities, leaving only a grid separating the animal from the other\nenclosure, allowing some physical contact. The empty lower enclosure had been secured with a padlock by husbandry\nstaff.\nThe investigator, who did not recognize the vertical access between the two enclosures, unlocked the lower enclosure\nand secured an animal inside. Once in that enclosure, the animal was able to bite and fracture the tail and cause a\nlaceration to the skin beneath the tail base of the animal housed above.\nTwo animals were handled in a manner that resulted in injuries when an investigator placed a primate into the lower\nenclosure beneath another primate in error. Handling of all animals must be done as carefully as possible and in a\nmanner that does not cause behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThis incident was self reported by the facility and corrective measures had been implemented prior to inspection. To\nremain corrected from February 28th, 2024 forward."
