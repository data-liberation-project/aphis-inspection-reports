The closing keeper confirmed seeing five of the six birds (all but the Violaceous euphonia)\nthe night before at closing and the line keeper confirmed seeing all six birds several times while working in/around the\nexhibit in days before. The staff made corrective actions by breaking down the exhibit, but no evidence of bird or pest\nactivity was found. As documented on the letter to the AZA Accreditation Committee, on August 6, 2025, a Turquoise\ntanager was found dead in the neighboring exhibit while another was missing. The facility immediately pulled all birds in\nthe south building and broke down the exhibit where they located a black rat snake. Radiographs of the snake confirmed\na collection bird that had been eaten (presence of band on the leg) and another band seen further down in the snake\u2019s\ndigestive track. A sizable shed was discovered near the snake\u2019s hiding place as well as several fecal that contained\nfeathers and bands from the first exhibit\u2019s residence. Since removing the snake, the south tunnel of the bird house has\nbeen left vacant, and staff are systematically stripping and reframing the top of each exhibit in order to replace lumber and\nmesh and minimize any gapping that could allow future pests to gain egress. Birds that disappear from their primary\nenclosure or that are not protected from predation may suffer from stress, injury, or death. Correct by ensuring that bird\nenclosures are maintained in good repair, protect the birds from injury, contain the birds, and restrict other animals from\nentering who may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within.
