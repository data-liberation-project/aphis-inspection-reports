A brown and white adult guinea pig in pen 2 had a\nfirm movable mass approximately 2 inches in size under its chin. The facility had not observed the condition, had\nnot contacted the attending veterinarian, and had not administered any treatments. The attending veterinarian was\ncontacted and was not comfortable with the fact that the facility did not consult with her regarding this animal's\ncondition and was not treating it according to the program of veterinary care.\nSwellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being\nof the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and\ntreatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to\nadditional animals if the condition is contagious.\nThe facility must contact the attending veterinarian to have the animal evaluated in order to determine an\nappropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.\nCorrect by: February 14, 2020"
