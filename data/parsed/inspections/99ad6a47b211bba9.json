      "narrative": "The inspectors observed a juvenile raccoon that was entrapped in the wire panel of its enclosure. The animal has slid its\nleft foreleg through an opening in the panel and then angled the leg upward as it came into contact with the exterior water\nline and could not withdraw the leg back into the enclosure. The licensee worked on cutting the wire apart for nearly one\nminute and was able to free the raccoon's leg. A bloody laceration is located on the anterior surface of the foreleg. This\nenclosure is constructed of material that allows the leg of the juvenile raccoon to pass through openings and has resulted\nin an injury to the animal.\nThe facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor\nand outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must ensure the enclosures are constructed of such material that\neliminates the risk of injury to the animals.\nOne enclosure, containing one skunk, has damaged wire flooring. The wire has broken resulting in several sharp points\nand in a hole large enough for the skunk's foot to pass through. The licensee moved the skunk to a compliant enclosure\nat the time of the inspection.\nOne nest box, accessed by at least four ferrets, has damaged wire flooring. The wire has broken resulting in sharp points\nand in a hole large enough for a ferret's foot to pass through. The licensee provided the ferrets with a new compliant nest\nbox at the time of the inspection.\nAt least seven enclosures, containing an approximate total of seven skunks, have sharp points located along the bottom\nof the nest box opening. The skunks could come into contact with the sharp points each time they enter and exit the nest\nbox. The licensee removed the sharp points at the time of the inspection.\nSharp points and holes in the flooring could cause injury to the animals.\nThe indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the\nanimals from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must ensure the enclosures are free of sharp points and\nmaintained in good repair at all times in order to support the well-being of the animals.\nTwo enclosure, containing an approximate total of two ferrets, have a loose section of wire floor lying directly on top of the\noriginal flooring. In one of the these enclosures the loose section of flooring is severely bowed upward in the corner of the\nenclosure. The loose section of flooring in the other affected enclosure is bowing upward in front of the nest box opening\nand the animals could potentially crawl out of the nest box and beneath the loose section. Loose, bent and/or damaged\nflooring could cause injury to the animals.\nThe indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the\nanimals from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must alter the bowed flooring in a manner that eliminates the\nrisk of injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure the flooring is maintained in good repair at all times in order to\nsupport the well-being of the animals. The licensee corrected the non-compliant flooring at the time of the inspection.\nOne enclosure, containing one skunk, has a large gap between the nest box and the wire flooring. The gap is large\nenough to allow the skunk's foot to pass through. One enclosure containing one ferret has one inch gaps between the\nnest box and the wire panels of the enclosure. The gaps are large enough that a ferret could potential pass its leg or\nhead through. Gaps that are large enough to allow an animal to pass part of its body through could cause the animal to\nbecome entrapped or injured.\nThe indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the\nanimals from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must ensure the enclosures are maintained in good repair\nand safe for the animals at all times in order to support their well-being. The licensee eliminated the gaps at the time of\nthe inspection."
