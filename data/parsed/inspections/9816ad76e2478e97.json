Upon closer observation, that dog (JB's Joy III, m/c 105-888-606) had a very long and curled toenail on\nthe dewclaw. The pad was reddened, swollen and sensitive to pressure. The toenail was pressing on the skin,\ncausing a dent in the skin, but not yet piercing through. The nail can continue to grow and cause injury to the skin,\nand become more painful. The dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian and the treatment directions must be\nfollowed.
