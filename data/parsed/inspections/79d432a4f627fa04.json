Then the dog that took a break\ncame back and drank for another 30 seconds. The owner stated that the dogs had been given water earlier that morning\n(approximately 5 hours ago). The owner also stated that the dogs always turn their bowl over but has not worked on a\nplan to prevent this from occurring. Failure to provide continual access to water can result in discomfort and serious\ndehydration. The facility must ensure that potable water is made continuously available to all dogs.\nThis was corrected at the time of inspection and must continue from this day forward (6 December 2024).\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative at the facility and followed up with a phone\ncall to discuss the category of a direct nci. The facility representative acknowledged this. A plan was made to deliver the\nreport to the facility representative on the morning of 9 December 2024.\nn"
