The male appeared fine for four days after the female vervet died, then he died on the 4th day\ndue to unknown reasons. The licensee stated he tried to call several veterinarians including the person he said serves as\nhis primate vet and advised no one would let him bring in the animals as they did not see vervet monkeys, or they did not\nhave time, and the primate vet could not examine the female until 4 days later. The licensee did not contact his attending\nvet due to assuming they would not work with his primates. There was no additional planning or research on other\nveterinary clinics for emergency care for the primates if the primate veterinarian was not available.\nThe lack of formal arrangements with specialists or the attending veterinarian can cause the lack of timely vet care to be\nprovided which can cause the animal to be in unnecessary pain and discomfort. The lack of vet care could be fatal in an\nemergency situation. There must be a formal arrangement with a veterinarian for every regulated species that the\nlicensee owns.\nEach dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time\nattending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary\ncare and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor."

      "narrative": "There is a cougar male approximately 5 months old (Mercury) that was observed to be extremely thin with all ribs, hips,\nshoulders and spine protruding. The flanks were sunken in. The animal appeared very sick and uncomfortable as shown\nby his tensed abdomen and arched back. The skin was pulled upward (tented) to check for dehydration, and the skin\nstayed up in the pinched position until he moved forward, indicating a serious level of dehydration. The cub was very quiet\nand moved very little even with people there. During the observation, the cougar passed brownish, liquid diarrhea with\nflatulence. The smell was very strong and pungent, and the feces was light brown with mucus. The cougar took several\ndrinks of water and had a bowl full of meat that was not being eaten. The licensee advised the cougar was sick a month\nprior with something similar and had looked worse than on this date. A fecal sample was performed at a veterinarian\u2019s on\nMarch 24, 2021, although the cub had not been taken in for an exam. The fecal revealed coccidia, and rare amounts of\ntritrichomonas and strongyloides. The licensee stated that the cub was treated and seemed better, however he felt the\ncougar started to get sick again approximately 3-4 days before this inspection, losing weight and not eating well. The\ncougar had not been taken to a veterinarian or treated according to veterinary directions on this second episode of illness.\nThe licensee advised he was waiting for a friend that works at the clinic to be available in the next week to go with him to\nthe veterinary clinic.\nThe lack of appropriate veterinary care in a timely manner can cause a treatable condition to become chronic or fatal if not\nattended to as soon as the symptoms begin to appear.
