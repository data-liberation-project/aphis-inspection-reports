This barrel is to serve as shelter for the animals.\nInside the barrel there was a large pile of excreta. The pile of excreta was approximately a foot wide and at least six\ninches tall. The straw bedding in the enclosure appeared wet and soiled. The zookeeper reported the enclosure\nhad not been cleaned since spring because the fishers are aggressive. Excessive animal excreta/waste and soiled\nbedding in enclosures increases the risk of disease in the animals. Enclosures must be cleaned regularly and\nfrequently to protect the health and wellbeing of the animals. Appropriate animal handling methods must be\nemployed and practiced to allow regular and frequent cleaning of enclosures.\nCorrect By: August 18, 2014\nInspection and exit briefing conducted with the zookeeper."
