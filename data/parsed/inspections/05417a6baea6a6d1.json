The hair around the ear appears to be wet.\nThe licensee stated that this dog was older and was not easy to handle. The licensee did attempt to touch the dog,\nbut the dog growled at her so she was not able to catch the dog, therefore, the inspectors were not able to examine\nthe ear more closely. Poor ear health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.\nThis dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment\nplan. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, ACI Corbin Ranslem, and the facility representative.\nFemale Shih tzu (#104076110) cited on the previous inspection report under 2.40 (b)(2) has been evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian and received treatment."
