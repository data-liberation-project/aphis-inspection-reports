When the inspection was completed, this animal was noted to have died.\n- In the bottom enclosure of stack 8A, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig who is in left lateral recumbency. When\nthe licensee segregated the animal for further observation, it fell to it's left side again with spastic movements of all four\nlimbs and appeared unable to stand on it's own. Upon completion of inspection, this animal was also noted to have died.\n- In the bottom enclosure of stack 5A, there is a male guinea pig with approx. 1cm of red and brown crusted tissue\nprotruding from it's rectum.\n- Also in the bottom enclosure of stack 5A, there is a black and tan guinea pig with hair loss on it's back and crusting of\nthe underlying skin.\n- Also in stack 5A, in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a black and white guinea pig with crusting skin and hair\nloss around it's right eye.\n- In stack 3A, in the enclosure fifth from the top, there is a male guinea pig with safety pins pushed through both of the\nears. The licensee explains that he does this to identify his boars. Two additional male guinea pigs in other enclosures\nwere identified as having safety pins placed in their ears as well.\n- In stack 1A, in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with crusting, hair loss, and\nfresh areas of blood around the right eye.\n- Also in stack 1A,in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a black and white guinea pig with missing hair on it's left\nflank and the underlying skin appears thickened.\n- In stack 8B, in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a tan and white guinea pig with missing hair on the right side of\nit's nose.\n- In stack 7B, in the enclosure third from the top, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with hair loss and crusting skin\non the left side of it's nose.\n- In stack 6B, in the enclosure third from the top, there is a black and white guinea pig hair loss on it's nose.\n- In stack 1B, in the enclosure fifth from the top, there is a dead black and white guinea pig that the other guinea pigs are\nhuddled on top of.\nThere were no observation or treatment records for any of the animals identified above. The licensee stated that he did\nnot observe these conditions prior to today's inspection. According to the facility's Program of Veterinary Care, animals\nwith hair loss are to be segregated immediately but all of the aforementioned guinea pigs were still in their enclosures at\nthe time of inspection. The Attending Veterinarian had also not been contacted regarding the animals who were found to\nbe recumbent or the animal with the tissue protruding from it's rectum. Additionally, during a discussion with the Attending\nVeterinarian, she was unaware that the licensee was inserting safety pins through the ears of the boars and stated that\nthis was not a procedure she authorized.\nA failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the Attending Veterinary can result in delay of care\nand worsening of health issues. Additionally, performing procedures such as the insertion of safety pins through the ears\nof male guinea pigs can cause pain and distress to the animals. Finally, instructions already provided by the Attending\nVeterinarian, such as those outlined for animals missing hair, must be followed to prevent further spread of potential\ninfectious diseases.\nCorrect by observing all animals on a daily basis, following the Program of Veterinary Care, and having all of the\naforementioned animals examined by the Attending Veterinarian."
