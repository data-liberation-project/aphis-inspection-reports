The crate she was in measured 25 inches tall x 38\ninches long.\nOne dog (Raleigh) measured to be 30 inches tall x 43 inches long. The crate he was in measured 25 inches tall x 38\ninches long.\nOne dog (Lady Mary) measured to be 22 inches tall x 18 inches long. The crate she was in measured 19 inches tall\nx 24 inches long.\nOne dog (Fenway / Jetter) measured to be 31 inches tall x 30 inches long. The crate he was in measured 29 inches\ntall x 22 inches long.\nIt is obvious that these crates were too small to allow for the dogs to be able to stand up, turn around, and make\nnormal postural movements. More care will need to be taken to ensure that all the dogs / puppies being transported\nare in crates that have sufficient space."

When the owner needed to gain\naccess to those crates he needed to dislodge the bungie cords and take the other crates down first. This put 4\npuppies in danger of not being able to be removed in a timely manner should there have been an emergency.\nThese 4 crates need to be repositioned so that all doors are easily accessible."
