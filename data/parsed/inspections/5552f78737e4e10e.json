The staff member did not replace the bottles to their\nnormal position. During daily observations of the animals on January 9th and 10th, the facility staff did not identify\nthe mistake and did not correct these flipped water bottles. On the morning of January 11, facility staff discovered\nthe dead vole and the flipped water bottles. The voles in the enclosure did not have access to water for at least two\nfull days. APHIS inspector learned of the incident while going through facility documentation during an inspection.\nLack of access to potable water can cause an animal to experience dehydration and lead to other medical issues,\nincluding death. The facility must ensure that if potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be\nprovided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.\nTo be corrected from this date forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
