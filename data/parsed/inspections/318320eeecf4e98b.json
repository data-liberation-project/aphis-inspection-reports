Although no veterinary documentation\ncould be provided, staff indicates that the attending veterinarian (AV) was contacted and a picture was sent via text.\nAntibiotic treatment and tincture of time was reported to be AVs proposed treatment plan, which was reportedly\nfollowed. No direct veterinary examination has been performed to date, 6 days after reported injury and no\ndiagnostics, treatment plan or follow-up plan is provided. This is a direct noncompliant item. This animal requires\nimmediate veterinary examination.\n**Logan, a young male li-liger, has significant hair loss over approximately 40% of his body. The tops of the\npaws appear reddened and the skin appears thickened. Staff reports that topical miconazole is being applied, but\nno veterinary documentation could be provided regarding veterinary examination, diagnostics, treatment plan and\nfollow-up plan.\n**Zara, a very young female white tiger cub, has significant swelling around her eyes and yellow ocular\ndischarge, with staining of surrounding fur. She also has at least two quarter-sized patches of hairloss on her rear\nquarters. Staff reports that some medications have been used, but no veterinary documentation could be provided\nregarding veterinary examination, diagnostics, medications prescribed, treatment plan or follow-up treatment plan.\nProvision of adequate veterinary care, along with appropriate documentation, is required to assure that the\nanimals are receiving proper, timely veterinary care, in both chronic and acute medical situations. All three of these\nanimals must be provided proper veterinary care by July 8, 2016.\n--In the medications/treatment room, 4 expired medical products are located in the in-use treatment area (Eye wash\nexp 3/13, Albon exp 2/15, Tylenol exp 12/15, Oxytetracycline exp 4/16). Using expired medications can yield\nunanticipated and potentially detrimental results in the treatment of animals. Correct by July 8, 2016.\n--Approximately 25 llamas and alpacas and 14 domestic sheep are noted to have long, heavy, and/or matted coats.\nUnshorn animals exposed to extreme temperatures with high humidity may not be able to thermoregulate\nappropriately and may overheat. Correct by having all llamas, alpacas, and domestic sheep sheared by August 3,\n2016, and by developing and implementing a program to have them sheared annually in April/May."
