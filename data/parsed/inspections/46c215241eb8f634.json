The Mini Pig was observed to be slightly limping on her left front leg and the outer\ntoe of her left front hoof was enlarged. The facility representative stated the Min Pig did not have gait abnormalities\non 10-5-19 when taken to a private exhibiting event. Lameness can be caused by a variety of problems including\ninfection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the health and well-being\nof the animal.\nThis particular condition had not been documented by facility.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and\nthe increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily\nobservations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and\nappropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nDate to be Corrected: October 11, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
