After weighing, the kits were separated from the doe.\nEach rabbit must be provided a minimum amount of floor space. Overcrowding prevents animals from moving freely and\ngetting adequate exercise, can cause stress and lead to incompatibility, and encourages the spread of disease. After the\nkits reach weaning, they must be provided floor space consistent with the space requirements set forth in 3.53(c)(2).\nCorrected at the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
