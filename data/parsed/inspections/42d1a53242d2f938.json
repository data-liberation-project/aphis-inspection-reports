According to the licensee, one of five untrained\nvolunteers, under his direct supervision, fed a tiger during the visit. According to the licensee, the individual was\nasked to wear gloves and stand alongside the licensee at approximately 2 1/2 feet from the tiger's primary\nenclosure, which was a chain-link fence. The individual was then allowed to toss the meat into the tiger's enclosure\nthrough an approximately 3 1/2 inch gap between the vertical pole of the gate and the wall of the enclosure. The\nlicensee gestured that the individual's hand came within approximately 1 foot from the animal's primary enclosure\nwhile tossing the tiger its food. These distances between the animal's primary enclosure and the member of the\ngeneral public increase the risk of injury to the animal or the individual. The licensee must establish a program to\nensure that there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general public at all times in\norder to assure the safety of the animals and the public. To be corrected by: immediately and from this point\nforward."

There were several\nsections where the netting and panels were not securely fastened to the horizontal metal support poles of the\nenclosure. For example, on the north side of the enclosure there was an area, approximately 3 feet in length, where\nthe wire panel covering was not securely attached to the support pole and an approximately 2 1/2 inch gap was\npresent. Also, within the middle of the enclosure, there was a gap between the netting and wire panel coverings\nand the horizontal support pole. These unsecured sections of hardware netting and wire panels which cover the\nservals' enclosure may not allow for the safe containment of the animals and could increase the risk of injury to the\nanimals. The licensee must ensure that all sections of fencing in these enclosures are securely fastened in order to\nmaintain the structural integrity of the enclosures.

According to the licensee, the bedding was wood chips which\nhad not been changed or cleaned out in at least one to two months. Also, there was another igloo-style shelter\nwithin the same enclosure, with a build-up of dirt, debris and several strands of straw. The cougar was initially\nobserved lying within one of the shelters and later the animal's fur appeared to have matted, moist-looking,\ndiscolored darkened fur on its back and along its right rear leg. Failure to properly clean the enclosures and employ\ntimely removal and disposal of animal bedding increases the risk of disease hazards.

For example, on the north side of the facility, a region of the fence measured 95 inches in\nheight; on the east side of the facility, a region of the fence measured 90 inches in height; on the southeast side of\nthe facility, regions of the perimeter fence only measured 88 to 90 inches in height; on the south side of the facility,\na region of the fence measured 90 1/2 inches in height; on the west side of the facility, a region of the fence\nmeasured 89 inches in height. The perimeter fence must be of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized\npersons out. The licensee must ensure that the perimeter fence is at least 8 feet high in order to protect the type of\nanimals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons and having contact with the animals in the\nfacility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facilitly at all times.\nIn addition to the perimeter fence not being of sufficient height, the inspectors noted several areas along the bottom\nof the perimeter fence and areas in between the gates and the posts that had areas large enough to allow for\npotential access (both entry and exit) of animals. For example; on the north side there is a 12 ft. gate that had a\nmeasured 6 3/4 inch gap between the post and the gate. On the east side there were at least 2 sections along the\nbottom, measured at 4 1/2 in x 12 in, and 30 in x 16 in. The larger gap appeared to have had recent animal activity,\nwith freshly exposed earth material in and around a cavity next to a large rock. On the south east side there is a 6\nin x 9 in gap of the chain link fencing material being bent upward. On the south side there is a 12 ft. gate that has a\ngap measured of at least 4 in. between the post and the gate with a gap along the bottom measured of at least 5\n1/2 in. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals\nand unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so\nthat it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility at all times.
