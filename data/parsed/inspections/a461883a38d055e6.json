The macaque again stuck her finger into the\nsqueeze mechanism hole and at this time her finger was injured. She received immediate veterinary care and finger\namputation was necessary. The IACUC and the USDA were promptly notified of this event. The IACUC formed a\nsubcommittee to investigate this incident . Correction action was taken and sixteen additional enclosures were\nmodified to use in this area. Only modified enclosures are now available during change outs.
