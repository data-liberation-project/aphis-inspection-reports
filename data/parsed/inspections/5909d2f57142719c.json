Prior to his death the facility stated this animal did not appear unhealthy and was active\nwith a healthy hair coat. After the animal\u2019s death the facility raised potential compatibility issues between this same\ngroup of macaques.\nAccording to the necropsy report, the animal was found to have marked dehydration, little to no visceral fat, and an\noverall thin body condition. Observations for compatibility within primate groups is necessary to prevent situations\nwhere individual animals are not allowed access to food, water, or shelter by other animals.\nObservations regarding problems of animal health, behavior and well-being may be accomplished by someone\nother than the attending veterinarian but all such issues must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely\nmanner to ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care.\nTo be corrected by November 28, 2019"

      "narrative": "A 2.5 year old male cynomolgus macaque died unexpectedly during a face-mask inhalation to test the effects of a\nsubstance. During this procedure one animal technician was monitoring the 5 cynomolgus macaques. It was stated\nthat this was beyond the usual number of animals monitored per technician. It was stated that during the procedure,\nthe arm restraints on the chairs where the animals were held were too large for some of these animals. This allowed\nthe animals to maneuver their arms to bypass the arm restraints and move around in the chair and get entangled in\nthe equipment. In addition, according to the technician, the monitoring equipment was producing many false error\nalarms making it difficult to monitor the animal\u2019s condition. Near the end of the procedure, the technician found this\nanimal to be non-responsive. The incident was immediately reported to a veterinary technician who examined the\nanimal but was unable to resuscitate it and the animal died.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected by November 28, 2019\nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives on November 19-20 and the exit interview was\nconducted with facility representatives on November 20th."
