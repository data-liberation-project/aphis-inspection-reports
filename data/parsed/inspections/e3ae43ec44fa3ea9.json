      "narrative": "* One black, tan and white adult male Papillion ( microchip number 0A01487051 ) was observed placing no weight\non the right front foot. The dog was observed holding the foot up 100 percent over a two to three minute period.\nThe right front foot was painful when touched. The foot was slightly swollen and has a circular hairless area on the\ntop of the foot by the toes. This area is reddened and has a moist appearance. The licensee stated that this was\nthe first time the limp had been noticed. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been\nconsulted. Foot problems can be painful when the dog has to place weight on the foot which affects the mobility\nand daily activity of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate\ntreatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by\nend of business 6/11/15.\n*********************************\n* One white colored Bichon ( Microchip number 097 343 820 ) has a crusted surface with a cream colored fluid\ndischarge on the right side area where the ear would be located. No odor was detected coming from the ear at time\nof inspection. The licensee stated that she had noticed the condition and had treated the area with peroxide and\nNeosporin. At that time of inspection the attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment\nbeen provided at the time of inspection. Ear infections can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to\npotential health issues, tissue damage or inflammation of the ear canal.\nThe upper muzzle was offset to the left of the lower jaw of the same Bichon listed above. The dog was repeatedly\nlicking the side of its mouth. The dog displayed signs of pain by being non cooperative, head-shy and refused or\nwas unable to open its mouth when the inspector and owner tried to examine the mouth. At that time of inspection\nthe attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection.\nMouth issues can be painful affecting the ability of the animal to consume feed, water and be able to vocalize. The\nlicensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The\noutcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must\nensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by end of business 6/11/15.\n********************************\n* The following medication available to treat the dogs at the facility was past the labeled expiration date. The\nrecorded expiration date on one 169 fluid ounce container of Vetrimec was 11/2014. This medication was\nintermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and is therefore ready for use. The\nusage of expired drugs on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not\nconstitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired\ndrugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure\nthat all medications used on the dogs have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 6/15/15."
