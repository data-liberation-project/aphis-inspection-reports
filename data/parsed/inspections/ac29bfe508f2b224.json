      "narrative": "A 7 year old female Borzoi named \"Princess\" was holding her right front foot up while standing. Her posture was\nhunched, and she appeared uncomfortable. There was swelling of her right carpal joint, and upon palpation it felt as\nthough there was fluid under the skin. Additionally, she had a moderate accumulation of brown tartar on her teeth,\nand excessively long toenails. Two other dogs, had dental issues: \"Barzoi\", a 6 year old male Borzoi had some\ntartar accumulation, and the licensee stated that he has broken some teeth, and \"Apache\", a 3 year old male Border\nCollie, also had a significant tartar build up on his premolars / molars.\nThe exhibitor should promptly report any health problems to the attending veterinarian, or an alternate if\nunavailable. There should be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to a veterinarian. Failure to\nrecognize and report problems can result in unnecessary suffering and /or a poor medical outcome.\nThe exhibitor should have \"Princess\" examined by a veterinarian within 48 hours, and the other affected dogs\nexamined by a veterinarian within the next two weeks."
