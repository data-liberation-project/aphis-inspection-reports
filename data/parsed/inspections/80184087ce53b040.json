The inspectors observed one enclosure where two\ndogs were able to stick their entire heads through the hole at the same time. There are at least four dogs housed in\nthese enclosures.\nAt least two enclosures have partitions between adjacent enclosures that have become detached from the back wall\nand are falling down into the enclosure. There are at least four dogs housed in these enclosures.\nFailure to maintain structurally sound enclosures can lead to animal injury or escape. Housing facilities for dogs\nmust be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. The licensee must repair or alter the affected\nenclosures in a manner that keeps them safe for the dogs and structurally sound.
