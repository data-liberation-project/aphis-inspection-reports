Temperature on or about 2 am in Phoenix was 90 degrees with day time highs reported to be 112 \u2013 114\ndegrees. Day time temperature in 29 Palms California was reported to be 103 degrees. With outside temperatures\nranging between 90 - 103 degrees, it can be expected that the temperature inside the transport vehicle rose to\ngreater than 85 degrees for more than 4 hours during the 7 hour trip.\nTransporter stated to the USDA Inspector that the mechanic helped driver cool the dogs off when they arrived for\nvehicle repairs around 9 am. At approximately 4 pm, the transport vehicle arrived at a veterinary clinic in 29 Palms\nCalifornia and the vet office manager stated to the USDA inspector that she entered the transport vehicle and\nbegan to sweat and found all the dogs on the transport vehicle were dangerously over heating and instructed the\ndriver to immediately go to a nearby animal control facility to get the dogs cooled down.\nTransporting dogs without adequate methods of cooling may result in distress , injury and even death.During\nsurface transportation auxiliary ventilation must be used when ambient temperatures reach 85 degrees in cargo\nspace and must not be allowed to exceed 85 degrees for more than 4 hours. CORRECT BY : 8/14/19\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the registrant."
