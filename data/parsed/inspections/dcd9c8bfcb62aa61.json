The animal was never treated for a cut that subsequently healed with a large raised pink lesion that\nappears to be scar tissue.\nFacility records show that the attending veterinarian was called on January 18, 2017 regarding a cut under the\nanimal's chin. According to staff at the facility no veterinarian ever examined the animal and the only treatment\nprovided for the cut was isolating the animal and cleaning the wound at the direction of the veterinarian. The\nattending veterinarian was contacted on the day of the inspection and stated that he intended to examine the animal\nbut was very busy and was never able to make a trip to the facility. The licensee never contacted a different\nveterinarian to provide care for the animal.\nAnimals with health concerns should receive prompt veterinary care that is appropriate for their circumstances. In\nthis case, one attempt was made to obtain care but the animal was never seen by a veterinarian. Appropriate\ntreatment in this case may have prevented the development of scar tissue. The facility should ensure that prompt\nand appropriate veterinary care is provided for the animals."
