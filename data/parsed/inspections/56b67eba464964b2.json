They must be kept in good repair, and contain the animals. A\nsystem should be in place to ensure locks used to secure animal enclosures are constructed of materials and\nstrength appropriate for the age and species of animal.\nThe facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation and implementing corrective\nactions to prevent future occurrences.\nThis incident was self-reported and has been corrected by the facility\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nFields Tyler, Veterinary Medical Officer"
