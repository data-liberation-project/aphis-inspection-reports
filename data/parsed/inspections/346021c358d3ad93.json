In addition, a large gelatinous bloody clump of\ndischarge was noted hanging from the opening to her right nostril. Around the rim/edge of the right nostril was noted\ndried dark black crusty material.\n*One black and white goat has a 3/8 in round lesion on the top left side of its nose. The center 1/4in diameter\nportion is raised and dark red in color. The encircling 1/8in wide band around this red center is flat and light grey in\ncolor. There is some brown black dried material at the lower corner of the left nostril.\n*One female lemur with a short tail (she had lost part of the tail to frostbite last winter) was noted sitting outside in\nher sheltered enclosure holding her tail. She looked at the tail frequently and occasionally was noted licking at it.\nThis is not her normal behavior.\n*The caretaker who feeds and waters the animals was asked by the inspectors about a baby oryx that is not at the\nfacility during today(cid:25)'s inspection. The caretaker responded that it had died-was found dead in its shelter one\nmorning this past fall. She stated that the oryx had been losing weight before its death and that she had tried\ndeworming it a couple of times. When asked if the veterinarian had been out to see this oryx or been called about it,\nshe responded no.\nReview of records available and conversations with staff, a veterinarian has not been contacted about the zebra, the\ngoat or the lemur. A veterinarian needs to be consulted to ensure the use of appropriate methods to diagnose and\ntreat diseases and injuries. The facility shall contact their veterinarian in order to have the zebra, the goat and the\nlemur examined for diagnosis and treatment."

      "narrative": "The inspectors pointed out three animals with veterinary care issues (zebra, goat, and lemur) to staff during this\ninspection. Conversation with staff about these animals elicited the information that the staff was unaware of these\nissues. The staff stated that they look at animals while feeding and watering but there is no one dedicating time\nspecifically to observing the animals on a daily basis. Since these issues are not being observed and identified, the\nattending veterinarian has not been notified of the issues. There also appears to be an issue with which staff\nmember has responsibility for communicating with the veterinarian. Different staff members and the owner gave the\ninspectors inconsistent answers to the question of who at the facility is responsible for contacting the veterinarian.\nLack of adequate daily observation and direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian will lead to issues\nwith the animal(cid:25)s health and well-being not being addressed in a timely and appropriate manner. The facility shall\nensure that there is daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being and that there is a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication to convey problems of animal health, behavior and well-being to\nthe attending veterinarian."
