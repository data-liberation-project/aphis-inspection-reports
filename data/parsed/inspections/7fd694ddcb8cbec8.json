Part of the wall is painted, and edges of the painted wall are missing. The dolphins have\naccess the this deteriorating section of wall. Debris falling into the water could introduce contaminants, pieces that\ncould be ingested, and also makes adequate cleaning of surfaces difficult.\nAll surfaces in a primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning, and\ndisinfection as appropriate, sufficient to maintain acceptable water quality. All surfaces must be maintained in good\nrepair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program.\nTo be corrected by 7/1/15.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives."
