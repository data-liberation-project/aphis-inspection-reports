Some feathers were located beside a gap under the wooden fence along the back of the primary enclosure\nand could be one of the areas the possible mink could have entered/exited. The bird carcass was gone, and there were\nno tracks or other clues to identify what predator came into the enclosure and killed the Tawny Frogmouth. The zoo has\nhad problems with mink this year and currently has been trying to remove them from the property.\nThe primary enclosure has housed these birds for several years and have not had any previous issues, however the mink\nproblem this year is new. The enclosure was originally used to house other mammals in the past, and was updated to\nhouse birds. However there were several areas within the primary enclosure that could allow for entry of a small, narrow\npredator like a mink that can be dangerous for bird species in captivity that can not fly away from the danger. There were\nareas around the rocks bordered by the wooden wall and areas along the ground level at the base of the wooden wall and\nan open knot hole at the front wooden wall that allowed spaces of over 2 to 3 inches wide or long where an animal like a\nmink could gain access into the enclosure.\nWhile the birds had been safe for several years in this type of enclosure that was modified from mammals to birds, it did\nnot account for the gaps around the rock feature or between the wooden wall base along the ground that were wide\nenough to allow smaller predators access to the regulated animals.\nThe lack of secure predator proof enclosures for bird species can cause possible stress to the animals by allowing\npredators to enter the primary enclosures to harass, injure or kill the regulated species.\nHousing facilities for birds must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of bird\nhoused in them. They must be kept in good repair, protect the birds from injury, and restrict other animals from entering\nthat may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within.\nTo be corrected by: This was corrected on October 21, 2024 before the inspection with the remaining birds being moved\ninto their indoor winter primary enclosures.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nn"
