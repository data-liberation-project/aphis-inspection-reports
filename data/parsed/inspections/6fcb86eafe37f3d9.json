This was a daily routine.\nOn the morning of April 13, 2014, the juvenile zebra was injured by a pony or ponies that were housed with him in a\npaddock near the main barn. According to the owner, the animals are fed in the morning and then returned to a\npaddock for the afternoon. The animals were not returned to their stalls at the usual time.\nSince the animal handlers did not follow the usual feeding routine in a timely manner, the cause of the trauma to the\nzebra could have possibly been avoided.\nThe handling of the animals housed in the paddock was not done expeditiously as possible thus resulting in the\ninjury and subsequent death of the zebra.\nHANDLING PROCEDURES SHOULD BE CORRECTED TO PREVENT TRAUMA AND PRIOR TO OBTAINING\nANY NEW ANIMALS.\nThe exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative."
