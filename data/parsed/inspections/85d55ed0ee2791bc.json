      "narrative": "***The following animals were cited on the Jan-13-2016 inspection report and were not examined by a veterinarian:\n***A female, adult brown and white gobex (Ibex x domestic goat cross) walked with an abnormal gait. On today's\ninspection the gobex still walked with a slightly abnormal gait and still has long hooves. The hooves on both front\nlegs were excessively long, to the point that they were curling causing the toes to rotate up and out and the heel to\ndrop. The licensee stated the animal had been pregnant, so they had waited to trim the hooves. Failure to\nappropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of\nthe facility s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate\nhoof and nail care in a timely manner.\n*** The right eye of adult male coati mundi appeared abnormal. On today's inspection, approximately half of the iris,\nin the right eye, had a milky-white, thickened opaque area. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems\nincluding infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing.\nFurthermore, not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting the health and well-being of the animal and has\nthe potential for injury.\n***The camel calf has an abnormal swelling on its left hind hock. The swelling and condition of this animal has not\nchanged since the Jan-13-2016 inspection. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis,\ntreatment and re-evaluation can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.\n***The male ferret has generalized alopecia. Although some hair has regrown, the area from the shoulders to the\nhips on the animals back is still hairless. Alopecia is often an indicator of disease. It can result from numerous\ncauses including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the\ndiagnosis and treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.\n***A newborn (24 hrs. old) male lamb appeared weak and was wheezing during the Jan 13-2016 inspection. The\nlamb appeared normal during today's inspection. The licensee stated she suspected the animal had aspirated\nduring feeding and that had caused its wheezing and weakness. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian\nregarding the diagnosis and treatment of weak and sick animals can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong\nsuffering of the animal.\nThe licensee stated she has called the veterinarian several times regarding the above animals, but they were never\nexamined, as described in the Jan-13-2016 inspection report.\n***On today's inspection, one black goat was noted to have an abnormal swelling of its left knee. The animal\ncaretaker stated he first noticed the hard swelling a couple of days ago. The caretaker stated he told the facility\nowner about the knee and to contact the veterinarian. The facility owner stated she did not know about the goat's\ncondition and has not contacted the veterinarian regarding this animal. Swelling is an indicator of disease and can\noften be painful. It can result from numerous causes including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact\nthe attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and\nprolong suffering of the animal.\nThe licensee must have all of the above mentioned animals (coati, camel calf, ferret, lamb, goats) examined by a\nveterinarian, to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome\nof this consultation must be provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the\nveterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian,\nany medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal\nhealth record that list when the medication is administered to the animals."
