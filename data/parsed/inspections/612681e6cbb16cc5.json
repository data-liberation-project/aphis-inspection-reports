The guidance included in the written program of\nveterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods\nto prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written\nPVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended\ntreatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of\nadministration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no\nmanufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding\nfrequency of administration the written PVC says (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) for the majority of the species. There is no guidance\nelsewhere clarifying what (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) means. During this inspection, several drugs were found in various storage\nareas (including ivermectin, gentamycin, LA-200, and Resflor Gold) that are not labeled for all of the species that\nthese drugs can potentially be used in. Additional guidance for the use of these drugs must be provided in the\nwritten PVC for all species for which these drugs are intended to be used. A written program of veterinary care is\nrequired when attending veterinarians are employed on a part time basis to ensure that the licensee and facility staff\nunderstand the direction of the Attending Veterinarian and provide a mechanism by which APHIS Officials can\ndetermine their compliance with those directions. Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these\ntopics does not ensure good welfare of the animals maintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to\nfailure to provide measures for prevention, control, and treatment of disease.

      "narrative": "DIRECT: There was a female Aoudad observed limping in the drive-through area near the water buffalo pond.\nWhen standing she was toe-touching lame, and at the walk and run she appeared to be three-legged lame,\nresistant to put any weight on the right forelimb. There is no written documentation that this animal has been\nexamined by a veterinarian or has received treatment for this condition. The farm manager stated that this animal\nwas observed to be limping on Saturday (4/23) by farm personnel and that he had talked to the attending\nveterinarian about this animal. At the time of the inspection, treatment had not been administered to this animal.\nFailure to provide adequate veterinary care to control and treat illness and injury results in prolonged animal pain\nand suffering. Additionally, an animal limping on hilly, rocky terrain is at risk to further injure itself simply trying to\nget around. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated according to his or her\ninstructions. Documentation of this exam and treatment must be maintained by the licensee and made available for\ninspection by USDA officials.\nCorrected at the time of exit interview, the farm manager treated the animal according to the phone conversation\ninstructions by the veterinarian.\n*** The current program of veterinary care still authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for\n(cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority\nof species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai,\nFallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. During this inspection, the Farm Manager stated that no changes to the written\nProgram of Veterinary Care have been made in regards to the use of this drug.\nSuccinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this\ndrug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered\ndistressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug\ncan also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated\nthey can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,\nor training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis\nof respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available\nwhich are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.\nBecause of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or\nneuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of\ngeneral anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.\nThe licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care\nas required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and\nis likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your\nattending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides\nadequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of\nadministration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all\nchanges or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must\nmaintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED"
