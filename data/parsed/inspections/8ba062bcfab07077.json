      "narrative": "* One cream colored adult male Pomeranian (microchip number 0A01276616) has a heavy coating of dark brown\nmatter on the both sides of the cheek teeth extending up into the gum line. The gums were reddened and inflamed.\nThe abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. These signs\nare consistent with the presence of dental disease. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth\nand mouth structures, be painful, lead to a decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth affecting the health and\nwell-being of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment\nplan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon\nrequest. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by 1/9/20.\n* The following medications used to treat the dogs at the facility have gone past their labeled expiration dates. The\nrecorded expiration date on one 100 ml bottle of Oxytocin was 03/19. The recorded expiration date on one 100 ml\nbottle of Bactracillin G Benzathine was 09/19. In addition, there were no written dosage instructions on the Oxytocin\nbottle. These medications are intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are\ntherefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated\nanimals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care.\nThe effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could\nbe drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals\nmay experience pain, distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms or unexpected side effects. Failure to\nproperly label medications or other medical products as being expired and storing them with unexpired medical\nmaterials could lead to the unintentional use on regulated animals. The licensee must either dispose of all such\nexpired medical drugs and materials or segregate them in an appropriately labeled, physically separate location\nfrom non-expired medical drugs and materials. Correct by 1/9/20."
