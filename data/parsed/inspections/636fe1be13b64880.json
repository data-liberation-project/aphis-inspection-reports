      "narrative": "A female Yorkshire terrier (ID #69) is observed rubbing both sides of her body against the enclosure wall and\nchewing on her flanks. Closer examination of the dog revealed hair loss along the spine on both sides of the body\nand between her shoulder blades. There are multiple areas of brown, scabby material on the skin within the\nhairless areas and matted, crusty hair around the hairless areas.\nA female Yorkshire terrier (ID #79) is observed to be non-weight bearing on her left hind leg. Closer examination of\nthe foot revealed that the entire foot is swollen to approximately twice its normal size. The excessive swelling of the\nfoot has caused the toes to be splayed apart.\nA female Maltese puppy (DOB November 2016) is observed to have redness around the right eye. Closer\nobservation revealed that the upper and lower eyelid are swollen and a large amount of yellow discharge is caked in\nthe hair in front of the eye and extending onto the nose. Dark colored dried material was also caked within the hair\nin front of the eye and the skin beneath the discharge is wet.\nA female poodle (ID #189) has a thick buildup of dark colored tartar coating the entire surface of the cheek teeth on\nthe right side of the mouth and the majority of the surface of the right upper canine and front teeth. A yellow\ndischarge is found along the gum line of the cheek teeth. The gums are moderately reddened and receded from the\nteeth.\nA female Yorkshire terrier (ID #187) has overgrown toenails on the front left foot. The toenails have developed a\nsevere curve and are beginning to grow towards the bottom of the foot. This dog also has tan colored tartar buildup\non the teeth on both the left and right side of her mouth.\nA female Bichon (ID #162) has an open wound on the underside of her neck. The open wound was moist and the\nsurrounding area is hairless and is thickened and scabby. This affected area of the neck is located under the dog\u2019s\ncollar.\nOpen wounds, poor dental, eye, and skin conditions, as well as, swollen feet could cause pain and discomfort to the\nanimals and could lead to further health problems. The above listed dogs must be evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. Diagnosis and treatment plan must\nbe documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.\nOvergrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort, as well as, affect the dog\u2019s natural gait. Female Yorkshire\nterrier (ID # 187) must also have her toenails trimmed to an acceptable length. The licensee trimmed this dog\u2019s\ntoenails at the time of the inspection.\nThe licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
