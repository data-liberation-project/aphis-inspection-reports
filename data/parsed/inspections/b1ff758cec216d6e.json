      "narrative": "One female albino hedgehog was found deceased in her enclosure during this inspection. The facility representative\nreported that she was observed yesterday evening and appeared to be moving around at that time. Looking in her\nenclosure however, it was noted that there were three distinct areas of food remaining on the bottom of the\nenclosure. The facility representative states that food is typically placed on top of the bedding in the corners or\nalong the sides of the enclosures each evening. During the inspection this morning none of the other enclosures\nhad food remaining from last night's feeding. The daily observation for this hedgehog did not include the\nidentification of poor/decreased appetite for this hedgehog. All animals must be observed daily and the facility must\nestablish a mechanism of direct and timely communication with the attending veterinarian so that all problems of\nanimal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. Correct by\n10/31/19."

There was a distinct ammonia\nodor in the hedgehog room despite the new Power fan system and the timer on the exhaust fan added since the last\ninspection. The shavings in about five enclosures were wet/soiled to the extent that clean and dry shavings were not\navailable for the hedgehogs to move around on. All feeding is done on the shavings so in these enclosures the feed\nis contaminated by the wet/soiled shavings. Excreta including urine and fecal contaminated shavings must be\nremoved from the enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination, minimize disease hazards and\nreduce odors. Correct by 11/1/19.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative."
