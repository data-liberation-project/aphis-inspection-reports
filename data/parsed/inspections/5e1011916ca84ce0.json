      "narrative": "On July 1, 2016 nineteen Big Brown Bats were transferred between two rolling flight cages with opaque nest boxes\nso that the primary enclosure could be cleaned. At that time the animals were counted and their health was\nassessed. The enclosure in which the animals originated was cleaned first by being hosed down then by passing\nthrough a cage-washing system. Based on IACUC investigation results, one 3 year old female Big Brown Bat was\nleft in the opaque nest box and was found dead on August 4, 2016. This bat was missed by the animal care staff\nand the cage wash staff and was sent through the cage wash. At the time the animal was found the carcass was\ndesiccated and a necropsy would not have provided a time or cause of death. Since the time of this incident, the\nIACUC has conducted a full and thorough investigation. The USDA inspector was notified of this incident soon after\nthe Attending veterinarian was notified. The investigator and animal care staff have responded by creating a new\nidentification system for the animals as well as implementing multiple Standard Operating Procedures to prevent\nre-occurrence.\nInappropriate handling of animals can lead to unnecessary pain or distress. Handling of all animals shall be done as\nexpeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect from this time forward.\nThis inspection was conducted January 10-11th the exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on\nJanuary 11, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCampitelli D.V.M Kathryn, Veterinary Medical Officer"
