I introduced myself to the licensee and\nthat I was there to conduct a routine inspection. The licensee did not want to allow an inspection. The licensee\nmade it clear that this was not a good time and that she did not have the time to conduct an inspection today and\nwas busy with other work. I asked the licensee \" are you refusing to allow the inspection?\" She stated yes she was\ntoo busy this week and I was welcome to return next week. I asked her if her father who was on the grounds could\naccompany me on the inspection and she stated that he was not on the license. I stated to the licensee that a\nrefusal to allow inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act, and will be cited on the inspection."
