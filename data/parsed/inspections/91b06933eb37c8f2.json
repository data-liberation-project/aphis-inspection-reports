      "narrative": "Two tigers (Binky & Terry) have paralysis of both rear legs. This condition has existed for a couple of years and\nthey have had veterinary examinations, tests, and prescribed treatments for several years without any apparent\nobservable improvements.\nBoth of these cats drag their hind quarters and legs along the ground surface. Terry's enclosure and pool has now\ncreated or contributed to pressure ulcers, wounds & scrapes with resulting skin irritations and exposure of muscle\nmass that were observed today. This is partly due to the substrate of his enclosure that he lives in as he drags his\nbody around or rubs it along the rough pool walls.\nTerry's enclosure is also wet and muddy. The present condition and construction of this enclosure does not\nminimize dirt & bacteria from entering these open wounds/ulcers/scrapes which can also attract feeding flies (as\nwell as) cause infections, irritation, pain, or distress.\nBinky also has a small bright red oval wound on his shoulder and a generalized reddish-pink area on his inner thigh.\nHis enclosure consists of a wood floor.\nThe last veterinary examination of Terry occurred on February 12, 2017. Binky's last examination was on 5/16/17\nConsidering the chronic, ongoing nature of this condition of these two cats these animals shall be examined more\nfrequently to evaluate their quality of life, effectiveness (or non effectiveness) of ongoing prescribed treatments, as\nwell as the suitability of the enclosures that they are presently living in. Your veterinarian shall develop & document\na schedule of timely examinations, evaluations & inspections of their enclosures to ensure that these animals have\nthe proper type of enclosure for these medical conditions; and are having a quality of life and are not in\npain/distress, or suffering.\nCorrect by August 11, 2017"
