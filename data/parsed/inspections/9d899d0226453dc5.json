The dogs were handled in a\nfenced-in outdoor area while in transition to indoor primary enclosures. The handlers used leashes to move the dogs from\ntheir transport enclosures into the building. Several dogs were reluctant to move on a leash and ended up being pulled by\nthe leash into the facility. Three dogs managed to escape their leashes. The gates to the fence were being opened and\nclosed while these animals were loose. No animals escaped the fenced area. Dogs that are handled in a manner that\nexacerbates their distress during a stressful event can lead to increased aggression, refusal to move, and accidental\nescape from their leash due to pulling backwards. All dogs were safely recaptured.\nDuring transportation animals must be moved quickly and efficiently to avoid causing physical harm, additional behavioral\ndistress, and unnecessary discomfort.
