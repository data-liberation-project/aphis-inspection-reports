The gap is intended for personnel to reach the latch,\nand it is atypical for the facility to house young animals. Gaps may cause injury to the animals such as entrapment\nof a body part such as a head, or escape of the animal from the primary enclosure.\nAll primary enclosures must be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from\ninjury and contain them safely.
