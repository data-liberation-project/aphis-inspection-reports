      "narrative": "An adult white and black colored male Border Collie mix with no identification is carrying its right front leg in an\nabnormal manner. There is an open lesion on top of the dog's paw. It appears moist and reddish-pink in color. The\nskin is pulled back far enough to observe underlying tissues. It is circular in shape and covers most of the top\nportion of the dog's paw. Along the inside area of the dog's right front leg there is an open lesion. This runs along\napproximately 70 percent of the length of the dog's leg. The widest area of the lesion is approximately the width of\nthe dog's leg. This affected area also has a moist appearance in the deeper portion of the wound. There is dried\nbrown crusty matter around the edges of the lesion located on the middle area of the leg. A yellowish colored\nunderlying tissue is also observed in the more severe area of the wound located near the top of the leg.\nThe licensee stated the injury was first observed on February 7, 2015. The licensee also stated she has been\ntreating the dog with penicillin. However, a veterinarian has not yet been contacted regarding the injury.\nOpen wounds can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health\nand well being of the dog.\nThe dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate diagnosis and treatment administrated and\ndocumented. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments must be made\navailable to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all\ntimes.\nTo be corrected by: 5:00 PM February 13, 2015."
