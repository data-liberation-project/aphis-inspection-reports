      "narrative": "The licensee was found on the premises of the home site preparing to leave for approximately 7 days for a traveling\nanimal exhibition in Lewiston, Idaho. The APHIS AC VMO had contacted the Animal Welfare Operations office on\nFriday, 9/18/2015 to determine if any itineraries had been submitted in recent months for this licensee but none had\nbeen received as of that date. According to the licensee, there had been at least one previous traveling animal\nexhibition in Utah lasting for several days that occurred within the last month. She stated that she had forgotten to\nsend in itineraries for that exhibition as well as this upcoming exhibition in Idaho. This AC VMO has explained this\nrequirement to the license on at least 3 different occasions since the regulatory requirement was made for itinerary\nsubmissions for regulated traveling exhibition.\nItineraries for licensed exhibitors that travel overnight with their regulated animals need to be submitted to Animal\nCare at least 48 hours prior to travel and must include all of the required information in order to facilitate inspections\nof these exhibitions during travel and to minimize the risk of not having a responsible adult available at the home\nsite for inspection by APHIS.\nAny person who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at any location\nother than the person's approved site (including, but not limited to, circuses, traveling educational exhibits, animal\nacts, and petting zoos), except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a written itinerary to the AC\nRegional Director. The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of\nany travel and shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended\nfor exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. If the exhibitor accepts an engagement for which\ntravel will begin with less than 48 hours notice, the exhibitor shall immediately contact the AC Regional Director in\nwriting with the required information. APHIS expects such situations to occur infrequently, and exhibitors who\nrepeatedly provide less than 48 hours notice will, after notice by APHIS, be subject to increased scrutiny under the\nAct.\nTo be corrected by 9/21/2015.\nExit interview conducted with the licensee and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM by telephone."
