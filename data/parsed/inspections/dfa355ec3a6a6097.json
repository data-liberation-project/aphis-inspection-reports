Temperatures\nreached a maximum of 87.85 degrees F on July 21st at 3pm and 88.49 degrees F on July 22nd at 4pm.\nThe facility manager informed me that an alarm should go off when temperatures are above 83 degrees F for greater than\n20 minutes, however the alarm was not working and he was unsure when it stopped working. When the temperature\ndeviation was identified on July 22nd, animal technicians opened inside doors and placed fans to provide increased air\ncirculation. The HVAC unit was reset and functioned normally after the reset.\nHigh temperatures can be uncomfortable to non-human primates and may lead to overheating and other medical issues if\nprolonged. The indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently cooled when necessary to protect the non-human primates'\nhealth and well-being and must not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours when non-human\nprimates are present.\nCorrect from this date forward."
