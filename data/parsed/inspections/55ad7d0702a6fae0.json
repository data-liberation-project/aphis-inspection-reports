      "narrative": "***One adult female Nubian ibex is observed to be non-weight bearing on her left front leg. The animal is reluctant to\nmove; when standing she touches her left forefoot on the ground or raises it outward in front of her. When walking, she\ncarries that leg out in front and the gait is affected as she heaves her left forequarter forward. Lameness can be caused\nby a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and\naffect the health and well-being of the animal.\nThe veterinarian evaluated the animal on Aug 27, 2021. She prescribed meloxicam daily for two weeks. She advised the\nlicensee to come to her clinic to discuss weights of the animal so that the correct dose could be prescribed. The licensee\npicked up the medications on September 2, 2021; however, as of September 3, 2021, the licensee has not begun\nadministration and is therefore not following the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation. The licensee needs to begin\nadministration of the medications as prescribed by the veterinarian.\n***Three adult female and two adult male white-tailed deer were observed to be thin to emaciated, with protruding hip\nbones, spine, and ribs. The bones of their spines, hips, and long bones were visible, and each rib was easily seen by both\nAPHIS inspectors upon inspection. They have rough, unthrifty hair coats and overgrown hooves that are affecting the\nangle of their feet.\nThe veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended increasing protein and fat in their diets,\ndeworming with ivermectin, and contacting a farrier to address the hoof problems. As of September 3, 2021, the\ndeworming has been started, but a farrier has not been contacted about the feet problems. The licensee has not followed\nthe veterinarian\u2019s recommendations. Failure to begin all the veterinarian's directions delays the treatment, prolongs\nmedical issues, and can lead to worsened condition of the animals. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause\ngait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries.\n*** At least five adult Nubian Ibex have overgrown hooves affecting the angles of their feet due to a lack of hoof trimming\nand inappropriate substrate.\nThe veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended contacting a farrier to address the hoof\nproblems. A farrier has not been contacted, therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation.\nFailure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries. The licensee\nneeds to follow the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation.\n***There is an oryx that has a dark, spherical growth on its brisket area measuring ~5-6\u201d in diameter. The veterinarian\nrecommended this animal be started on meloxicam and antibiotics. She advised the licensee to come to her clinic to\ndiscuss weights of the animal so that the correct doses could be prescribed. The licensee picked up the medications on\nSeptember 2, 2021; however, as of September 3, 2021, the licensee has not yet started administering it, therefore the\nlicensee has not followed the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation. The licensee needs to administer the medication as\nprescribed by the veterinarian."
