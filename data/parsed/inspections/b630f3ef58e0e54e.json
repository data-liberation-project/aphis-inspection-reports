In addition, a\npermanent solution for the drainage issue has been scheduled for October 22, 2016. At that time, a local group will\nbe providing personnel to help place 120 tons of rock to resurface the facility enclosures. The licensee must\nensure that all enclosures have a suitable and effective method to prevent the accumulation of water or an effective\nmethod to rapidly eliminate the excess water.\nCorrect by: 11/13/16\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative."
