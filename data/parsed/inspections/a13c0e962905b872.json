The tip of the right ear\nwas missing. Black crusty material could be seen inside both ears. Discharge was seen draining from the left ear creating\na wet track leading to his jaw.\n- A Peach-faced lovebird in the large cockatiel aviary had many of the feathers on the right side of his face and neck\nplucked off. The skin underneath appeared reddened. The right eye was abnormal and all that could be seen was a small\nblack dot where the eye should be.\n- A marmoset housed in the primate indoor housing/kitchen area was seen once pulling hair from his tail. There was an\napproximately 2-inch-long section on the inside of his tail that was missing hair.\nThe licensee had not identified the conditions affecting these animals, therefore had not contacted the veterinarian for\nguidance on care. Failure to promptly identify animal conditions delays treatment and may cause undue pain or distress in\nsituations such as these. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented to properly\nassess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for\ntimely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. The currently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an\nappropriate diagnosis and treatment plan."
