Licensee could not recall the name\nof the ophthalmologist when asked by the inspectors. Documentation for this care and treatment was requested by\nthe inspectors and as of 9/26/14 none has been recieved. Guidance for this animal was given on the last inspection\nand if it has been carried out documentation should be available to confirm treatment. It is evident by visual\nobservation that the porblem with the eye still persists and further evaluation and treatment is needed.\nAt time of inspection the lion known as Batman displayed no signs of ataxia. But the condition having been\npreviously identified by the attending veterinarians still has not been evaluated and diagnosed for possible causes\nwhich can in some cases be treated. The licensee is responsible for ensuring appropriate methods are used to\nadequately prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee needs to provide adequate\ndiagnostics and treatment for this lion'(cid:25)s eye and ataxia in order to alleviate the pain and suffering he has endured\nfor the past several months."
