      "narrative": "An approximately 2 year old red female long haired dachshund with no official identification was noticed limping\nwhile moving in her enclosure. Upon closer observation inspectors discovered the dog was missing most of her right\nhind leg. Several inches of a large, dry, yellow-brown bone protruded from the red colored tissue at approximately\nmid-leg. It appears that all the skin, hair and muscle tissue have been stripped from the bone. The licensee\nexplained that the dog had gotten into a fight with another dog resulting in the loss of the lower part of the right leg.\nIt was not clear how long ago this occurred but based on the appearance of the wound we would estimate several\nweeks, at a minimum. The licensee also stated that the dog had not been seen or treated by a licensed\nveterinarian. The licensee has failed to provide adequate veterinary care for this animal. The licensee called for an\nappointment to their attending veterinarian while inspectors were present, and was directed by the veterinarian to\nbring the dog in right away. A wound or injury severe enough to cause the extensive damage and tissue loss\nsuffered by this dog would result in severe pain, distress, and the possibility of death due to shock or secondary\ninfections. Licensee must ensure that all the dogs at the facility are observed daily and that adequate veterinary\ncare is provided as needed. The licensee is directed to take this animal to the attending veterinarian by close of\nbusiness today, and to follow the veterinarian(cid:25)s treatment recommendations."
