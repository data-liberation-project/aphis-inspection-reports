The improper\nuse of handling techniques, including inappropriate equipment and its proximity to the animal directly caused this\ninjury.\nThe facility took measures to prevent recurrence throughout the facility, and will continue to ensure that any heat\nlamps are clearly labelled and staff are made aware of this risk.\nCorrected prior to the inspection.\nThis inspection was a focused one to reinspect for non-compliant items from the previous inspection and to inspect\nthe facilities for non-human primate and the new species obtained since the last inspection.
