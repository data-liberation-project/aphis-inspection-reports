The tops of her lumbar vertebra were visible, and the pelvic bones were becoming prominent\nand were easily felt with a gloved hand. The licensee also stated that he noticed her losing weight gradually over the past\ncouple of weeks and that this sometimes happens with his bigger litters but once the puppies are weaned the dam always\nbounces back. The program of veterinary care did not instruct the licensee on how to address this dog\u2019s condition nor had\nhe communicated this dog\u2019s condition with a veterinarian. Poor body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition,\nparasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee must communicate with a veterinarian in order to obtain an\naccurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for this dog\u2019s condition. The licensee must ensure that the\ntreatment plan is followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 8-11-2021"
