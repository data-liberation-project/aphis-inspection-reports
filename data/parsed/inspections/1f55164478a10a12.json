The protocol, as\napproved, includes a surgical procedure to implant an eye coil. The approved protocol states that the non-human primate\nis to be given a dexamethasone injection IM prior to and just after the surgery along with a third dose if needed (total of\nthree doses) and that if any additional doses of dexamethasone need to be administered then the lab staff should contact\na member of the veterinary staff. On October 23-24, 2023 one pigtail macaque underwent an eye coil surgery and\nreceived a total of 7 doses of dexamethasone related to the surgery. The lab staff did not reach out to any of the vet staff\nprior to the administration of the additional doses of dexamethasone nor did they submit a change to increase\ndexamethasone treatment doses to the IACUC.\nIf the investigators and lab staff wish to make changes to an approved protocol they must first give the IACUC the\nopportunity to approve all proposed significant changes in ongoing protocol activities in order to ensure that the proposed\nactivities are in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. The IACUC shall review and approve, require\nmodifications in or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing\nactivities.

He has areas of complete hairloss on\nthe front side of both upper front limbs. No documentation was noted in the animal's record of the problem and the animal\nwas not under the medical care of the veterinary staff.\n*A tree shrew (ID: 22120) was noted exhibiting repetitive flipping in circles (stereotypic behavior) and no documentation\nwas noted in the animal's record of a medical evaluation or treatment/response plan. No medical evaluation has been\ndone to rule out medical causes or to develop a treatment/behavior plan as no records were available to review\ndocumenting such.\n*A tree shrew (ID: 2045) contained patchy hair loss along his entire tail. There was a sticker on his cage card that noted\n\u201chair loss\u201d but there was no medical record to review.\nFailure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a veterinarian can result in prolonged\nmedical conditions and ongoing pain/distress. A facility representative must observe all animals daily and then ensure a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information\non problems of health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed.

The five ferrets were treated and fully recovered. The cause of the problem was determined to be insufficient\nairflow reaching the exposure chambers because of the internal conduits of the exposure plenum being mostly or fully\nblocked by tar residue from the cigarette smoke. The lab has added additional cleaning procedures and new guidelines to\ntest airflow prior to beginning exposures to prevent recurrences.\n*On October 6, 2023 a rhesus macaque was sedated and positioned on a commercially available warming pad for a\nroutine imaging procedure. On October 10, 2023 thermal injuries was noted on the macaque\u2019s dorsal side of the right foot\nand tail. The warming pad was inspected and found to be working properly. It was determined that the warming pad may\nhave been folded and the protective blankets between the animal and pad moved during positioning of the animal\ncreating a hot spot and allowing direct contact with the macaque\u2019s skin. Necrosis of tissue necessitated the amputation of\nthree digits, the tip of an additional digit and the tip of the tail.\n*On October 24, 2023 during a routine cage change one cynomolgus macaque escaped through a space between the\ntwo cages and attacked another cynomolgus macaque in a different cage. Both macaques were injured. The escaped\nmacaque sustained injuries to one hand that has healed but may lead to limited use of the hand. The attacked macaque\nreceived injuries to his lip and tongue.
