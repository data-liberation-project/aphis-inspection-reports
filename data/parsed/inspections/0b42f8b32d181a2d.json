The bear cub was then able to pull itself\nup onto the cinder block wall separating the bear and cougar enclosures, walk along the length of the wall, and gain\naccess to the roof area over the bear enclosure. Appropriate structural and/or procedural modifications must be\nmade in order to prevent injury to the bear cubs and to safely contain the animals. The facility also must develop a\nsystem to monitor enclosure security and train employees to ensure that animals are securely contained. To be\ncorrected by: April 27, 2014."
