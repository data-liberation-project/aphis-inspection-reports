Another female has swelling below the right eye and will not open her eye. The manager has not\nmade health checks this week due to being out except for some quick facility checks, and the other caretaker did\nnot notice these eyes, as the gliders are not always out of their sleeping cups when the food and water are being\nchanged out.\nEye issues and facial swellings can have numerous causes, some of which may be painful, therefore these medical\nissues need to be noted and evaluated as soon as possible.\nThese gliders need to be evaluated for a diagnosis and treatment by the Attending Veterinarian. The veterinarian's\noffice was called during this inspection and the veterinarian can see these gliders tonight.\nTo be corrected by 8-2-17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager."
