In the case of the tiger and wolf enclosures, the facility had two\nfences in place; the first made up of electrified wire while the second was a black chain link fence. However, the first fence\nin both instances was not sufficient to truly contain the animals as a primary enclosure.\n- The first fence in the wolf enclosure was made up of a single electrified wire, approximately 2 to 3 feet from the ground\ndepending on the location. The wire was held up by approximately 4 feet tall thin plastic poles evenly dispersed\nthroughout the enclosure which were about 2 feet away from the second fence (black chain link with two electric wires at\nthe top). The second fence, black chain link, was approximately 8 feet in height including the two electric wires attached to\nthe top. The first fence alone cannot contain the wolves who could jump above or crawl below it and therefore is not a\nsufficient primary enclosure.\n- The first fence in the tiger enclosure, approximately 2.5 feet tall, was made of 3 electrified wires held together by about\n3-foot-tall wooden cylindrical poles evenly dispersed throughout the enclosure. The first fence was at least 3 feet away\nfrom the second fence (black chain link). The second fence (black chain link) is approximately 9 feet 7 inches tall with a 3-\nfoot kick in. The first fence was about the same height or even slightly shorter than the tigers contained within. This first\nshorter fence, therefore, is not a sufficient primary containment for the tigers that could jump over it.\n-In these two enclosures, the two fences together make up the primary enclosure, and there is no perimeter fence\nsurrounding either of them.\n\u2022 Also, not only was the juvenile bears\u2019 outdoor enclosure\u2019s perimeter fence not tall enough (7 \u00bd feet in height) but it also\nwas not continuous on all sides since the perimeter fence facing the road did not continue around the other three sides to\ncompletely enclose the primary enclosure.\nThe lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn\u2019t an\nadequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier\nto keep animals and unauthorized persons out.
