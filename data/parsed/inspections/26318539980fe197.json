Instead of releasing the deer immediately, the decision was made to complete the procedure prior to\nreleasing the animal from the chute. Upon release, his gait was noted to be wobbly, but he walked on his own to his\nholding enclosure. Approximately, thirty minutes later, he was found down with signs of a possible neurological injury and\nwas euthanized.
