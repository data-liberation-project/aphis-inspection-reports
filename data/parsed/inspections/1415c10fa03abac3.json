The licensee lives about one hour away from the site and will\nvisit a minimum of once per week. When the licensee is not there, the owner of the property is the only individual\nresponsible for the daily husbandry of these animals and is the facility representative. When the facility\nrepresentative was asked about what to do if the co-housed bears were to ever get into a fight, he did not know\nwhat to do nor did he have any equipment to properly handle the situation. Additionally, the facility representative\ndoes not appear to understand proper safety procedures around potentially dangerous animals. The facility\nrepresentative stood within a few inches multiple times with his back facing the bear enclosure. On one occasion\nwhen the facility representative had his back facing the enclosure, a grizzly bear was facing him with its claws\nsticking through the enclosure a few inches from the facility representative. The facility representative seemed\nunconcerned. Furthermore, the office in Raleigh, NC has not approved the facility representative\u2019s training. Failure\nto have adequate experience, knowledge and training in maintaining large carnivores increases the risk of harm to\nthe animal husbandry staff, animals and to the public, if an escape occurs. The licensee must demonstrate the\nfacility representative has adequate experience and knowledge by submitting documentation detailing the\nexperience, knowledge, and training of the facility representative to the office located in Raleigh, NC for final\napproval."

Afterwards, it was noticed there was a hole in the receptacle on the side\nwhich only allowed the water receptacle to be filled approximately 25% (approximately 1 gallon). The licensee and\nfacility representative were not aware of the defective water receptacle and informed us they would replace the\nwater receptacle that day. This water receptacle was the only source of water for this animal. Although the bear did\nnot appear to be dehydrated and only drank water for 15 seconds when offered, failure to maintain the water\nreceptacle in good repair puts the animal in risk of dehydration or death.

      "narrative": "The 4 bears and one cougar have insufficient space and no climbing structures which prevents expression of\nnatural behaviors. The three adult bears are housed together in a divided cage, the small side measuring about 8\u2019 x\n12\u2019 and the larger side measuring about 16\u2019 x 12\u2019. During the inspection, the adult bears were seen predominantly\nlaying down (approximately 80-90% during the inspection) without much movement and appeared only motivated by\nfood. This is an aberrant behavior for bears. The juvenile female grizzly bear was singly housed in an enclosure\napproximately 9\u2019 x 9\u2019 square. When the water receptacle used for providing drinking water was filled, the juvenile\nbear immediately began to splash around with its two front feet. Black bears are biologically designed to be smaller\nand slimmer to have the mobility to climb trees, so excess weight on this species of bear can cause additional\nhealth and behavioral issues. The bear enclosures has insufficient space and furnishings (such as climbing\nstructures, and a water feature suitable for swimming) to promote exercise. Additionally, there are no visual barriers\nfor bears to remove themselves from unwanted social contact. The cougar is housed in a round pen at one level\nthat is approximately 20\u2019 in diameter with no climbing structures. The cougar stayed in its den box for the majority of\nthe inspection. The lack of climbing structures and elevated platform prevents the cougar from jumping and\nclimbing, which is a normal natural behavior. Inadequate space may lead to stress, poor condition and abnormal\nbehavior patterns. Ensure all enclosures permit normal social and postural adjustments for the species in question."
