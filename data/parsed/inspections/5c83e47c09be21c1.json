However; \nthe licensee was unable to provide any form of written document or verbal conformation to indicate that the treatment plan \nis being followed.  Several of the puppies have been sold and are no longer at the facility.  There is no documentation to \nindicate that these puppies received proper treatment or were Giardia or Coccidiosis free prior to their sale.\n\nFailure to create and maintain medical records interferes with APHIS official\u2019s ability to determine if the dogs are receiving \nadequate veterinary care.  The consistent need for treatment for re-occurring issues and the lack of documentation to \nconfirm treatments are being followed, combined with the insufficient cleaning of the overall facility are detrimental to the \nhealth and well-being of all of the animals being housed at this facility.  These animals are suffering with chronic issues as \na direct result of the facilities inability to follow their veterinarian\u2019s guidance and treatment protocols. \nDealers must keep medical records for dogs documenting all required information including the date and identification of \nanimals treated, fully detailed treatment plans, and results of examinations conducted by licensed veterinarians. The \nlicensee must ensure medical records are created and maintained and fully document all procedures, treatments, and \nexaminations for each adult dog and puppy. \nThe licensee must have documentation for Tobi Mac\u2019s eye condition and Shelby\u2019s eye condition. The licensee must have \ndocumentation of any dogs under medical treatment. In addition the licensee must demonstrate that all veterinary \nguidance for all diagnosis and treatment of illness are being followed. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nSHANNON SEBERA, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOREnd Section",
