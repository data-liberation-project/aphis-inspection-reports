The netting was to be removed from the animal by\nnoon on March 19. At the current inspection on March 22, 2016, the male elk still has the netting attached to his\nantlers and drapped across his face. The facility representative said that she has contacted the attending\nveterinarian and he plans come to the facility and evaluate the elk at a future time. The netting attached to the face\nof the elk could cause damage to the eyes, interfere with his field of vision, and affect his ability to eat and drink.\nPremises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and facilitate husbandry\npractices. Trash and unused materials shall be placed in appropriate areas and cleared from the animal enclosures\nto protect the health of the animals. The facility must remove the hay netting from the animal for his safety and\nwell-being and ensure that all animal enclosures remain free of trash and unused materials at all times.\nThis is a focused inspection limited to only the condition of the male elk cited under 3.131(c) on inspection report\ndated March 16, 2016.\nExit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
