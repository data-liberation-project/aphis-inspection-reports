During this inspection this cub was also observed to be\ncontinually scratching himself.\nAccording to the owner, Barney has been seen by the attending veterinarian and skin scrapings were performed.\nResults and recommendations were made however, there is no documentation available to verify this information.\nThe APHIS official spoke with the attending veterinarian and was informed that the cub was seen and treated back\nin November 2014. At that time, the patch of hair loss was small. As of the January 30, 2015 inspection, the hair\nloss has increased and the bare patches are much larger. The significant amount of hair loss and scratching, since\nNovember 2014, indicates that direct and frequent communication on the cub's condition has not been conveyed to\nthe attending veterinarian in a timely manner.\nBarney must be seen by the attending veterinarian to determine the underlying reason(s) for the hair loss and\nitchiness. Additionally, records of animal health, treatments and recommendations should be maintained.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: FEBRUARY 12, 2015"
