The licensee stated the last time young tigers\nwere on her property was back in October. The licensee failed to identify possession of a female juvenile tiger\nnamed \"Lilly\" also known as Obie. When visiting with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) of the licensee off site, he\nconfirmed that his clinic treated an injured juvenile tiger on 12/2/2014 at the licensee(cid:25)s facility. Additionally, the AV\nasked how the tiger was currently doing demonstrating that he was under the impression the juvenile tiger was still\non the licensee(cid:25)s property recovering from surgery. In order to confirm the presence of this tiger, the APHIS\ninspectors returned to the property of the licensee to attempt to locate and inspect this animal. When the\ninformation concerning the tiger was brought to the attention of the licensee, she did confirm that the tiger known as\n(cid:28)Lilly(cid:29) was recently returned to her possession from another licensed facility, had been injured after its return, was\ntreated by the AV 12/2/14, and was still on the property. The licensee claimed that she had \"(cid:28)forgotten\"(cid:29) about this\ntiger because it was housed in another enclosure on the property which was located away from where the other big\ncats were housed, in order to minimize contamination and stress while the animal recovered from her injuries.\nAPHIS officials were led by the licensee to a building called (cid:28)\"peacock house\"(cid:29) that was located near some aviaries\nand away from the other large carnivores.

      "narrative": "** A juvenile female tiger named Lilly was injured in its primary enclosure prior to inspection. The injury resulted in a\nwound on the inside of the left front leg that required treatment by the attending veterinarian including multiple\nsutures and the amputation of one toe. The licensee admitted that the tiger had been in at least two primary\nenclosures while on her property. One enclosure, which the licensee stated that the tiger had only been in for a\nshort time was located between another enclosure housing an adult lion and a second enclosure housing one adult\ntiger. The separation between the juvenile and adult tigers while in this enclosure consisted only of wire fencing with\nholes approximately 4(cid:29)x4(cid:29). These holes are large enough to allow either the juvenile tiger to reach into the adults or\nthe adults to reach into the enclosure containing the juvenile which could have resulted in serious injury of the\njuvenile tiger. According to the licensee, the tiger was actually injured earlier in the week while housed in the\nenclosure known as the (cid:28)peacock house(cid:29) area. She stated that while in that area, its left front paw was caught in\nbetween metal piping used for the framework of the chain-link fencing and the chain-link fence itself. The licensee\nstated that she believed the injury resulted from the tiger chewing on its own paw and leg in order to free itself.\nAccording to the attending veterinarian and medical records, the left front leg was torn and a toenail was (cid:28)ripped off(cid:29).\nThe veterinarian sutured the wounds and provided antibiotics, fluids, and analgesics for the injuries. On inspection,\nthe juvenile tiger was bright, alert, and responsive. One toe (digit 3) from the left front leg had been amputated and\nproperly sutured closed, and the inside of the same leg was shaved. There was a 4-5 inch long cut in the shaved\narea of the left front leg with multiple sutures along the cut. It is clear from the injuries sustained by this tiger that the\nprimary enclosure failed to adequately protect it from injury. Injuries not only decrease animal welfare, but those that\nlead to disfigurement of the paw also may lead to chronic pain. Correct this day forward.\n**The enclosure housing two adult white tigers had a hole underneath the metal chain link fencing of the primary\nenclosure that measured 7 inches in depth and approximately 1 foot across. There is no underground fencing.\nHoles underneath the primary enclosure fence line can not only result in an escape but also be a danger to the\nanimal if a foot, leg, or head gets trapped underneath the fence. The licensee said the tigers do dig sometimes and\ngravel will be used to fill in the hole at the end of the day. The guillotine door used to permit access to others\nsections of the enclosure was determined to be in disrepair and does not protect the two adult white tigers from\npotential injury. The clip used to securely keep the metal guillotine door in the open position was broken and the\nmetal cable attached to the guillotine door was tied to the chain link fencing of the primary enclosure to keep the\ndoor open. One tiger could easily cause the metal cable to become unraveled which could result in injury to the\nother tiger. The weight of the metal door could easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an\nanimal. There is no counterweight or secondary mechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force.\nThe licensee untied the cable and closed the door. The licensee stated the guillotine door will be left in the down\nposition until the clip is repaired. Stone gravel was used to fill in the hole, and the clip for the guillotine door had\nbeen replaced at time of exit. Continue to ensure primary enclosures are in good repair and protect the animals\nfrom possible injuries.\n**The enclosure of a young male kangaroo does not protect the animal from injury. There is a black electric cord\nused to provide heat that is in reach of the kangaroo. Electric cords in reach of an animal represent both a risk of\nentanglement and an electrical hazard which can cause burns or electrocution if the cord is chewed on. Additionally,\na wooden door on the inside of the enclosure is in disrepair and has sharp edges. The door has a missing wood\nplank, but the nails used to attach the plank are still present. These nails protrude out approximately 1 inch and are\nat the level of the animal. The nails and deteriorating, splintering wood are sharp objects in the enclosure that could\ncause injury to an animal. The electric cord was fixed in a higher position, and the nails in the door had been bent\ndown to eliminate sharp protrusions. The wood of the door is still splintered and is slated to be replaced according\nto the licensee. Correct by 12/13/2014.\n** The enclosure with one adult fox has an area where feet could go through chain link fencing. The fox enclosure\nhas chain link fencing underneath the enclosure to prevent escape from digging; however, as water has been\ndumped (daily) for cleaning purposes it has eroded the soil underneath the water bucket and surrounding area. The\neroded soil has created an area approximately 3 square feet surrounding the water bowl in which the foxes(cid:25) feet\neasily pass through the chain link fencing to stand on the ground below. Since this area in surrounding the water\nbowl, animals must walk over this area frequently in order to access water. Feet or legs can become injured if an\nanimal becomes entangled in the chain link fencing. Stone gravel was placed to fill in the hole underneath the\nfencing at the time of exit. Correct by 12/10/2014.\n**The plastic white igloo used in the young male grizzly bear(cid:25)s enclosure as a den is in disrepair. The entrance in\nthe igloo has been significantly chewed on and a 3 inch piece has been broken off at the entranceway. Objects in\nthe primary enclosure that are in disrepair are unable to be properly cleaned and may serve as a route to spread\ninfection to the bear in the enclosure. Correct by 12/25/2014.\n**In the field comprising part of the primary enclosure for one donkey, 8 goats, and one sheep there is an\napproximately 5 inch diameter white plastic pipe sticking out of the ground near a fence line that contains several\nanimals on the other side . The pipe has a jagged edge and rose approximately 6-7 inches out of the ground.\nAnimals were seen walking in the area of the pipe and the donkey was observed repeatedly running in this area as\nit interacted with animals on the other side of the fence. The licensee stated the pipe was a clean out port for\ndrainage. As it is currently situated this pipe is a hazard to the animals in the enclosure. A foot could easily become\ntrapped or cut by the pipe and cause serious injury. Correct by 12/22/2014.\nThe licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals\nfrom injury and to contain the animals."

Although an\n8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, there were eight large mature trees within 3 feet of the\nperimeter fence that had no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the perimeter\nfence. Additionally, there were piles of building material and animal husbandry items leaned up against or near the\nperimeter fence that could be used as elevated platform to jump over the perimeter fence. The presence of these\nmaterials against the fencing effectively reduces the height of the perimeter fence. A substantial perimeter fence\nthat is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that\ncontain potentially dangerous animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event\nof an accidental escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the\nproperty and endangering public safety thereby placing the animal(cid:25)s life in jeopardy.

The ambient temperature during the inspection was\n38-39 degrees Fahrenheit according to readings from the ambient thermometer in the inspector(cid:25)s vehicle and recent\ntemperatures at night and on several days have been below 35 degrees F.  The licensee must provide clean, dry\nbedding when the ambient temperature is below 50F.  Additional bedding is required when temperatures are below\n50F. Failure to provide clean, dry bedding can lead to contamination of the animal, compromise the animal(cid:25)s ability\nto keep warm, and pose disease risk if no alternative bedding is available for the animal to nestle in.  Correct by\nensuring that adequate clean dry bedding is provided as required and that this bedding is changed or replaced as\noften as necessary.  Fresh, clean bedding was provided at the time of exit. Correct by 12/8/2014.\n3.6(a)(9)\nPRIMARY ENCLOSURES.\nThe two igloo shelters in the wolf-dog hybrid enclosure have significant chew damage around the entrances, as well\nas brown staining and a layer of grime on the top.  The roughened surface created by the chew damage creates an\nideal surface for organic debris and bacteria to accumulate and are not able to be cleaned and sanitized properly. \nFailure to repair these areas of damage or replace these shelters poses a risk of disease and contamination which\ncan negatively affect the animals contained therein.   All surfaces of primary enclosures must be readily cleaned\nand sanitized as required and must be replaced when worn or soiled.  Correct by 12/12/2014.\n3.8\nEXERCISE FOR DOGS.\nThere is no documented exercise plan for the wolf-dog hybrid.  The enclosure housing the dog is of sufficient size to\nmeet minimum space requirement to not require removal from the primary enclosure for exercise; however, no plan\nhas been approved by the attending veterinarian.  Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate\nplan according to their attending veterinarian to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise.  Correct by\ndeveloping a written exercise plan including standard procedures for providing exercise and having it approved by\nthe Attending Veterinarian.  Additionally, this plan must be maintained by the licensee and provided to APHIS\nofficials on future inspections upon request. Correct by 12/15/2014.\n3.11(b)(2)\nCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.\nThe igloo dog houses provided in the wolf and wolf-dog hybrid enclosure both have dark staining and a layer of\nbrown film on the top and the sides.  The licensee stated that these are power washed every 2 weeks, but no\nsanitization protocol is being followed.  Lack of cleaning and sanitization allows organic material and bacteria to\nproliferate and contaminate the enclosure.  Correct by cleaning and sanitizing primary enclosures at least once\nevery 2 weeks using one of the methods in section 3.11(b)(3), or as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of\ndirt, debris, excreta, and other disease hazards. The shelters had been power-washed and sanitized with bleach at\ntime of exit. Continue to use cleaning and sanitization as often as necessary from this day forward.\n\n3.56(b)(1)\nSANITATION. \nThe licensee stated that the wooden rabbit enclosures are cleaned with a power washer every 6 months and soiled\nbedding is removed and replaced with new bedding every 2-3 days or as often as the licensee believes is\nnecessary.  No sanitization protocol is followed currently.  Also, the entrance to the sheltered portion of one of the\nrabbit enclosures is significantly chewed on the edges.  Failure to properly clean and sanitize primary enclosures\ncan allow bacteria to proliferate and therefore poses a risk of both disease and contamination to the animals\ncontained therein.  Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures for rabbits are cleaned and sanitized at least once\nevery 30 days through one of the methods prescribed in section 3.56(b)(3) such as cleaning with an appropriate\ndetergent followed by the application of a safe, effective disinfectant solution .  Additionally, all bedding must be\nremoved and replaced at least weekly or as often as necessary as required by section 3.56(a)(2).  Wooden surfaces\nthat have significant chew damage cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and should be repaired or replaced to\nfacilitate adequate cleaning and sanitation.  All rabbit enclosures had been cleaned and sanitized with an\nappropriate disinfectant at the time of exit.  Continue to follow proper cleaning and sanitization from this day\nforward.\n3.75(c)(1)(2)\nHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. \nThe adult female Sulawesi Crested Macaque enclosure has several sharp points from a section of wire mesh that\nwas cut to hang a water bottle on the outside.  Surfaces in the housing facilities of non-human primates must be\nfree of jagged edges and sharp points that may injure the animals.  Correct by ensuring that these sharp edges are\nremoved or made inaccessible to the animal so they do not protrude into the enclosure and pose a risk of injury to\nthe animal. Corrected at time of exit interview.\n3.125(a)\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \n** A juvenile female tiger named Lilly was injured in its primary enclosure prior to inspection. The injury resulted in a\nwound on the inside of the left front leg that required treatment by the attending veterinarian including multiple\nsutures and the amputation of one toe. The licensee admitted that the tiger had been in at least two primary\nenclosures while on her property. One enclosure, which the licensee stated that the tiger had only been in for a\nshort time was located between another enclosure housing an adult lion and a second enclosure housing one adult\ntiger. The separation between the juvenile and adult tigers while in this enclosure consisted only of wire fencing with\nholes approximately 4(cid:29)x4(cid:29). These holes are large enough to allow either the juvenile tiger to reach into the adults or\nthe adults to reach into the enclosure containing the juvenile which could have resulted in serious injury of the\njuvenile tiger. According to the licensee, the tiger was actually injured earlier in the week while housed in the\nenclosure known as the (cid:28)peacock house(cid:29) area. She stated that while in that area, its left front paw was caught in\n\nbetween metal piping used for the framework of the chain-link fencing and the chain-link fence itself. The licensee\nstated that she believed the injury resulted from the tiger chewing on its own paw and leg in order to free itself.\nAccording to the attending veterinarian and medical records, the left front leg was torn and a toenail was (cid:28)ripped off(cid:29).\nThe veterinarian sutured the wounds and provided antibiotics, fluids, and analgesics for the injuries. On inspection,\nthe juvenile tiger was bright, alert, and responsive.  One toe (digit 3) from the left front leg had been amputated and\nproperly sutured closed, and the inside of the same leg was shaved. There was a 4-5 inch long cut in the shaved\narea of the left front leg with multiple sutures along the cut. It is clear from the injuries sustained by this tiger that the\nprimary enclosure failed to adequately protect it from injury. Injuries not only decrease animal welfare, but those that\nlead to disfigurement of the paw also may lead to chronic pain. Correct this day forward.\n**The enclosure housing two adult white tigers had a hole underneath the metal chain link fencing of the primary\nenclosure that measured 7 inches in depth and approximately 1 foot across. There is no underground fencing.\nHoles underneath the primary enclosure fence line can not only result in an escape but also be a danger to the\nanimal if a foot, leg, or head gets trapped underneath the fence. The licensee said the tigers do dig sometimes and\ngravel will be used to fill in the hole at the end of the day. The guillotine door used to permit access to others\nsections of the enclosure was determined to be in disrepair and does not protect the two adult white tigers from\npotential injury. The clip used to securely keep the metal guillotine door in the open position was broken and the\nmetal cable attached to the guillotine door was tied to the chain link fencing of the primary enclosure to keep the\ndoor open. One tiger could easily cause the metal cable to become unraveled which could result in injury to the\nother tiger. The weight of the metal door could easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an\nanimal. There is no counterweight or secondary mechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force.\nThe licensee untied the cable and closed the door. The licensee stated the guillotine door will be left in the down\nposition until the clip is repaired. Stone gravel was used to fill in the hole, and the clip for the guillotine door had\nbeen replaced at time of exit.  Continue to ensure primary enclosures are in good repair and protect the animals\nfrom possible injuries.\n**The enclosure of a young male kangaroo does not protect the animal from injury. There is a black electric cord\nused to provide heat that is in reach of the kangaroo. Electric cords in reach of an animal represent both a risk of\nentanglement and an electrical hazard which can cause burns or electrocution if the cord is chewed on. Additionally,\na wooden door on the inside of the enclosure is in disrepair and has sharp edges. The door has a missing wood\nplank, but the nails used to attach the plank are still present. These nails protrude out approximately 1 inch and are\nat the level of the animal. The nails and deteriorating, splintering wood are sharp objects in the enclosure that could\ncause injury to an animal. The electric cord was fixed in a higher position, and the nails in the door had been bent\ndown to eliminate sharp protrusions.  The wood of the door is still splintered and is slated to be replaced according\nto the licensee.  Correct by 12/13/2014.\n** The enclosure with one adult fox has an area where feet could go through chain link fencing. The fox enclosure\nhas chain link fencing underneath the enclosure to prevent escape from digging; however, as water has been\ndumped (daily) for cleaning purposes it has eroded the soil underneath the water bucket and surrounding area. The\n\neroded soil has created an area approximately 3 square feet surrounding the water bowl in which the foxes(cid:25) feet\neasily pass through the chain link fencing to stand on the ground below. Since this area in surrounding the water\nbowl, animals must walk over this area frequently in order to access water.  Feet or legs can become injured if an\nanimal becomes entangled in the chain link fencing. Stone gravel was placed to fill in the hole underneath the\nfencing at the time of exit.  Correct by 12/10/2014.\n**The plastic white igloo used in the young male grizzly bear(cid:25)s enclosure as a den is in disrepair. The entrance in\nthe igloo has been significantly chewed on and a 3 inch piece has been broken off at the entranceway. Objects in\nthe primary enclosure that are in disrepair are unable to be properly cleaned and may serve as a route to spread\ninfection to the bear in the enclosure. Correct by 12/25/2014.\n**In the field comprising part of the primary enclosure for one donkey, 8 goats, and one sheep there is an\napproximately 5 inch diameter white plastic pipe sticking out of the ground near a fence line that contains several\nanimals on the other side . The pipe has a jagged edge and rose approximately 6-7 inches out of the ground.\nAnimals were seen walking in the area of the pipe and the donkey was observed repeatedly running in this area as\nit interacted with animals on the other side of the fence. The licensee stated the pipe was a clean out port for\ndrainage. As it is currently situated this pipe is a hazard to the animals in the enclosure. A foot could easily become\ntrapped or cut by the pipe and cause serious injury. Correct by 12/22/2014.\nThe licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals\nfrom injury and to contain the animals.\n3.127(d)\nFACILITIES, OUTDOOR. \nThe perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although an\n8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, there were eight large mature trees within 3 feet of the\nperimeter fence that had no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the perimeter\nfence. Additionally, there were piles of building material and animal husbandry items leaned up against or near the\nperimeter fence that could be used as elevated platform to jump over the perimeter fence. The presence of these\nmaterials against the fencing effectively reduces the height of the perimeter fence.  A substantial perimeter fence\nthat is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that\ncontain potentially dangerous animals.  Perimeter fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event\nof an accidental escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the\nproperty and endangering public safety thereby placing the animal(cid:25)s life in jeopardy.  Correct by removing all\nbuilding materials and other debris that are in close proximity to the perimeter fence and altering trees in a manner\nto ensuring the perimeter fence can adequately function as a secondary containment system. Some but not all of\nthe items listed above were removed at the time of exit.  Correct by 12/31/2014.\n\n3.129(a)\nFEEDING.    \nMultiple loaves of bread found in the pantry had significant amounts of dark green to white material on the outside\nsurface of the bread and had the overall appearance of mold. Some loaves were more than 50 percent covered in\nthis material. All bread was wrapped in plastic. While no bread seen in any of the enclosures had the appearance of\nmold growth, items stored in the pantry will be considered food for the intention of feeding to the animals.\nContaminated food items can be toxic and may harm animals if fed. The licensee must ensure that all food is\nwholesome, palatable, free from contamination, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals\nin good health.  Correct by ensuring that any food items which are spoiled or otherwise contaminated are promptly\nremoved from food storage so that they do not contaminate remaining food supplies and by ensuring that all food\nfed to animals is otherwise wholesome and palatable. All spoiled food had been removed at the time of exit.\nContinue to remove moldy and other spoiled food from the main feed storage area from this day forward.\n3.131(a)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \nThe enclosure containing the 2 red fox have plastic igloo shelters that are covered with urine, feces, dirt and grime.\nThe elevated perch the foxes utilize is positioned directly above the two igloos and the licensee stated that they will\nsit on the perch and urinate/defecate and it drips on top of the igloos.  The igloos must be cleaned and maintained\non a more frequent basis to ensure the animals can remain clean and to reduce disease hazards.  The licensee\nmust ensure that all excreta is removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of\nthe animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.  Correct by ensuring that the primary enclosures for all\nanimals are cleaned as often as necessary.  Shelters had been cleaned and sanitized at the time of exit.  Continue\nto follow proper protocols as often as necessary from this day forward.\n3.131(d)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \nAt least six rodent holes were noted throughout the facility, both inside and outside the animal enclosures. \nSpecifically, one very large hole, (approximately 6 inches in diameter) was found inside the black leopard enclosure\nbehind the den box.  The licensee stated that she believed this hole may have been created by a groundhog,\nwhereas the smaller holes were created by rats that had been noted on the premises.  The licensee has bait boxes\npositioned in multiple locations on the property, and stated that poison was put down the holes in the past week, but\nthat new holes appear on a regular basis.  The continued occurrence of new rat holes is an indicator that the current\nmethods used for pest control are insufficient. Wild animals, including mammalian pests, can carry and transmit\ndisease to animals maintained by the licensee. A safe and effective pest control program must be established and\nmaintained by the licensee to minimize the presence of mammalian pests, which pose a risk of disease to the\nregulated animals.  The licensee contacted a professional pest control consultant and has moved bait boxes and\n\nplaced poison according to their instructions. Continue to maintain an effective pest control program from this day\nforward.\nThe inspection was conducted on 12/5/2014 with the facility president and a verbal exit interview pointing out all\nareas of concern was conducted at that time.  The formal exit interview and written report delivery was completed\non 12/8/2014 with the facility president.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCampitelli D.V.M Kathryn, Veterinary Medical Officer",
