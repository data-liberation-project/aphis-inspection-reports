The pig was in a pen that is next to another pen that houses a calf that is currently\nbeing treated for ringworm. The licensee stated that she believed the hair loss on the pig was from rubbing up\nagainst things in the enclosure, however no veterinary care had been sought for the pig.\nThe second animal with hair loss on its side was a black rabbit. The rabbit had hair loss on both sides. The\nlicensee had observed the hair loss on the rabbit, but had not sought veterinary care for it.\nHair loss can indicate underlying health issues and can also potentially be caused from a variety of conditions that\nare contagious to other animals.\nThe Attending Veterinarian must examine both animals. Correct by 3-10-16.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative.\nEnd of report."
