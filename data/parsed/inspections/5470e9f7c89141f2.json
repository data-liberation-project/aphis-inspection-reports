The curator was notified who said to continue the eye medication. The veterinarian\nwas not notified. The drops continued to be administered and on 2/5 one of the caretakers noted that the fox(cid:25)s eye\nlooked enlarged and asked the curator to look at the eye. The same concern was noted on 2/7 and the curator was\nemailed.

Staff was told\nby management to clean the wounds and administer antibiotics. The curator examined the animal the following day\nand ordered wound cleaning and pain medication. Staff stated that the animal was very sore. On 5/17 no\nimprovement was noted in the animal(cid:25)s walking and staff stated they were waiting for the veterinarian to return a call\nregarding a different pain medication.\nFailure to observe animals on a daily basis and failure to communicate promptly with the attending veterinarian can\nbe detrimental to the health of the animals and cause unnecessary pain and distress. Daily observation of all the\nanimals to assess their well-being and direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding\nhealth issues is necessary to ensure that the animals receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should\nbe in place to ensure that all animals are observed daily and the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary.\nCorrect immediately for all regulated species housed at the facility."
