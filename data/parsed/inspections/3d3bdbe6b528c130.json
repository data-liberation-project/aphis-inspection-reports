There are breed types listed on the facility's records that do not accurately reflect the\ninformation provided by the sellers.\nA record of disposition form APHIS 7006, was used to document a transaction that occurred between the broker\nand a Class 'A' licensee on 2/15/2016. The broker purchased nine puppies from the seller. Seven Bichon/Poodle\nmixes and two Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso mixes are listed on the seller's APHIS 7006 copy. The broker\u2019s copy of the\nAPHIS 7006 indicates a change was made to the breed type for two Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso puppies after the\ntransaction was completed.\nThe puppy identified by seller\u2019s ID number (21BM16) on the APHIS 7006, has had its breed type changed to\nShih-Tzu/Havanese by facility representative(s). The health certificate issued by the broker\u2019s veterinarian lists the\npuppy as a \u2018Shih/Hava\u2019. The other Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso puppy identified by ID number (22BM16) on the APHIS\n7006, was changed to \u2018Shihmalt\u2019 (Shih-Tzu/Maltese). This puppy is also listed as a Shih/Malt on the health\ncertificate.\nA focused inspection was conducted on April 20, 2016 at the seller's facility. The seller stated that he has not owned\nor sold any Havanese type dogs. The seller also stated he was unaware of any dog breed/type information being\nchanged on the APHIS 7006 during or after the transaction.\nThe APHIS 7006 was used to document a transaction that occurred between the broker and a Class 'A' licensee on\n3/25/16. The record lists two Bichon and two Chihuahua puppies identified with numbers provided by the seller. On\nthe broker's copy the male Bichon (#PP-16-49), has had its breed name changed to Bichon/Maltese. The female\nBichon (#PP-16-50), has also been changed and is listed as a \u2018Bichonpoo\u2019. The broker's acquisition and disposition\nrecords list the male Bichon (#PP-16-49) as a Bichon/Maltese and the female Bichon (#PP-16-50) as a\nBichon/Poodle. A health certificate issued on 3/29/16 by the broker\u2019s veterinarian, lists the female as a \u2018Bich/Poo\u2019.\nThe male is listed as a \u2018Bich/Malt\u2019 on a health certificate dated 3/30/16; also provided by the broker\u2019s veterinarian.\nA hobby breeder documented the sale of seven Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso puppies on an APHIS 7006 dated 3/11/16.\nThe broker changed the breed name of six puppies from Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso to Shih-Tzu/Cavalier. The seller\nused the identification numbers: #1, #2, #4, #5, #6 and #7. The male Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso (#3) was changed to\n\u2018Cavachon\u2019. The altered breed names were wrote on the broker's copy of the APHIS 7006 in section 'F' by a facility\nrepresentative. The broker\u2019s acquisition/disposition records and health certificates show six of the puppies listed as\nShih-Tzu/Cavalier King. The other puppy is listed as a Cavalier King/Bichon.\nA facility representative stated that records are changed if they believe the puppies do not fit the conformation\nand/or color of the breed listed on the sellers\u2019 copy. When records are altered and not consistent with records\nprovided by the breeder/seller, it can mislead the purchaser of the true breed of the aforementioned puppies,\nimpede the ability for APHIS officials to track and verify the dogs being purchased and increase the risk of disease\ntransmission to both animals and humans in the event of an outbreak (brucellosis, parvovirus etc).\nTo be corrected by: May 6, 2016.\nInspection conducted with the licensee, facility employees, Corbin Ranslem, ACI, Stephanie Osborne, ACI and\nAngela Depoe, ACI.\nExit briefing conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nDepoe Angela, Animal Care Inspector\nOsborne Stephanie, Animal Care Inspector"
