Protocol # 4274, involving woodchucks, was approved by the IACUC in\napproximately June 2019. The PI and veterinary technician both separately stated that in the summer of 2020, they had a\ndiscussion with the attending veterinarian which led to significant changes in the protocol. These were based on previous\nexperience with animals in the study and would ultimately improve animal welfare. The changes made include: 1)\nswitching from an injectable sedative to a strictly inhalant anesthetic for imaging and blood sampling; 2) changing the\nvascular access location for obtaining blood; 3) removing intubation in favor of masking during longer procedures or\naltogether for very short procedures such as imaging; and 4) discontinuing the use of an injectable medication in favor of\nan oral drug. According to the PI, vet tech and animal medical records, the modified protocol was implemented soon after\nthe discussion. However, the current approved protocol on record with the IACUC and reviewed during this inspection\ndoes not reflect these changes.\nMaking changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC to perform adequate\noversight into the use of animals for medical research.\nCorrect by allowing the IACUC to review and either approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval of proposed\nsignificant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities. The institution immediately took steps to\nmake the appropriate modifications to the protocol and allow review by the IACUC at the time of the exit interview.\nCorrect by: May 27, 2021."
