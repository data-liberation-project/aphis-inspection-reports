Photographs of the incident show the animal being held off\nthe ground by a standing individual who grasped the lion(cid:25)s chest under the front legs. There was no harness or\nleash on the lion. In one photograph the lion appeared to be struggling and pushing away from the individual holding\nhim. A gate into the facility from the public, two-lane road was open at the time of the incident with the gate being\napproximately 140 feet from the porch and the road approximately 30 feet beyond the gate.\nDuring public exhibition animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.\nThe sixteen week old lion Atlas was of sufficient size and strength during the May 18, 2016 inspection to cause\nharm to, or escape from, a member of the public. Animals of this size and age should have sufficient distance\nand/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the safety of both the animal and the\npublic.\nCorrect immediately for all future public exhibitions.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.\nAccompanied by Dr. Michael Schnell.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
