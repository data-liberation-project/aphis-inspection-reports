The failure of\nthe laboratory staff to accurately calculate and prepare the dose of the anesthetic agent prior to administration of the\nmedication to the bats resulted in an overdose and the death of the two animals.\nThe Attending Veterinarian and research facility acted promptly to address this incident by investigating and implementing\ncorrective actions to prevent future incidents. Corrective actions included but were not limited to refresher training of the\nlaboratory staff on drug calculation and administration with the veterinary staff, and the veterinary staff will review all drug\ncalculations with the laboratory staff prior to administration to the animals. There have not been any additional incidents\nafter the implementation of these corrective actions.\nThis item was corrected by the research facility prior to the inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives on 7/12/23 and 7/13/23, and the exit briefing was held with\nfacility representatives on 7/13/23.\n*END OF REPORT*\nn"
