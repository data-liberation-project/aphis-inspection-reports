On the gate to the same enclosure, there was chicken wire that\nhad been attached to the gate, but is now hanging loose and dangling off the gate. The greyhounds were jumping\nup around the gate and there is a potential for injury if they get a paw or a limb tangled in the chicken wire.\n-In the cat (cid:28)Taj(cid:25)s(cid:29) enclosure, the plywood board floors are warping on one edge and lifting up, which is starting to\nexpose rusty screws/nails. The junction /gap in the floor makes it difficult for the floor to be readily cleaned and\nsanitized. An elevated platform in the enclosure has a loose board with 3 rusty nails sticking out where the cat can\nrub on the sharp points.\nPrimary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could\ninjure the dogs or cats, protect the dogs and cats from injury, and enable all surfaces in contact with the dogs and\ncats to be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with 3.11b, or be replaced when worn or soiled. There must\nbe a system of maintenance in place to ensure that primary enclosures are kept in good repair.\nOriginal Correction date 30 July 2014\nInspection conducted by Jeanne Lorang ACI and Dr. Katharine Frank, VMO\nExit Interview conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLorang Jeanne, Animal Care Inspector"
