      "narrative": "There is an approximately 3 week old female Boston Terrier puppy that is observed to be much smaller than its litter\nmate. The puppy is observed to have thick, opaque white discharge on the right eye and she was not holding the eye\nopen all the way. She also has a very large head, a continuous head tremor, open, red, raw sores on her hind paws, and\nwas not walking nearly as well as her litter mate. The inspectors observed the litter mate frequently step on this puppy.\nThe licensee had the Attending Veterinarian (AV) examine this puppy on 23-Febuary-2023 and the licensee was\ninstructed to monitor her. APHIS officials spoke to the AV and they report that they did instruct the licensee to monitor the\npuppy. She also reports that the puppy did not have discharge from the right eye, nor did it have sores on the paws when\nexamined on 23-February-2023. The AV notes that last week, when the puppies were 2 weeks old, it was harder to tell\nhow much behind the puppy was from her litter mate as they were not very mobile yet. The licensee has noticed that the\npuppy was much smaller than the litter mate and had not contacted the AV regarding the changes in this puppy\u2019s health\nincluding the tremors, feet sores and lack of overall improvement. Daily observation of dogs is required so that timely and\naccurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to the AV with direct and frequent\ncommunication. Failure to convey accurately the status of the puppy to the AV may result in delay in treatment and\npossible pain and distress. Correct by ensuring that daily observations, especially if worsening of a condition is noted, is\nconveyed to the AV in a timely manner. Correct by having a licensed veterinarian assess the Boston Terrier puppy and\nmaintain records of treatment for APHIS inspection.\nTo be corrected by: This dog was taken to the AV during inspection for evaluation and treatment.\nA male Shih Tzu (microchip # 933000320069010) has significant matting at the inside corners of his eyes, so much so\nthat the inspectors could not readily see his eyes. This dog is also seen to have a significant build up of hard, brown\nmaterial on right upper cheek teeth and the gum tissue is pulled back from the tooth roots on right upper cheek teeth.\nWhen examined by the inspectors, the two upper right cheek teeth were loose. The licensee attempted to shave the dog\u2019s\nface during the inspection and accidently cut the skin below the left eye creating a large, flapping, red, open wound. Daily\nobservation of all dogs is required. Failure to observe the dogs for matting and dental issues can cause a delay in\nconveyance of information to the AV regarding the animals\u2019 health, behavior, and well-being. Correct by ensuring that\ndaily observations are made to check the hair coat, teeth, ears, and eyes of the dogs and by having a licensed\nveterinarian assess the male Shih Tzu listed above and maintain records of treatment for APHIS inspection.\nCorrect by: This dog was taken to the AV during inspection for evaluation and treatment.\nThe inspector\u2019s identified a dead puppy underneath the elevated enclosures in the adult side of the kennel. The licensee\nreports that a female Bichon (microchip # 933000320452590) was moved from that enclosure to the whelping side of the\nfacility that morning because he saw what he thought was blood. The licensee had not noticed the puppy on the floor. He\ndid state that he didn\u2019t think she was close to whelping yet. The female Bichon was noted to have dark green-black dried\ndischarge on her hair on the back legs and around her vulva. Her abdomen was tense when palpated by the inspector\nand was not observed to have active contractions. Daily observations of all dogs to assess changes in their health and\nwell-being is required so that accurate and timely conveyance of information can be given to the AV. Failure to observe\nand convey a change in a dog\u2019s health or behavior could cause injury, illness, pain, or distress.

Daily observation of all dogs is required to accurately and timely diagnose diseases and injuries that may\ncause pain or distress to the dog. Correct by conducting adequate daily observations and having frequent and direct\ncommunication with the AV concerning any medical issues. The Bichon listed above must be evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian and maintain records of treatment for APHIS inspection.\nTo be corrected by: End of business 1-March-2023.\nA Bichon (microchip # 933000320069011) is matted throughout the body\u2019s haircoat, has long front toenails and has poor\ndental health. There is an excessive build up of hard, brown-grey material on all the teeth. The gum tissue of the upper\nleft side of the mouth is recessed away from the tooth roots of the upper cheek teeth and at least 2 upper cheek teeth\nwere loose when examined by the inspector. The licensee was not aware of the poor dental health, they did acknowledge\nthis dog needed to be groomed and have a nail trim but they have not had time to complete spring grooming.
