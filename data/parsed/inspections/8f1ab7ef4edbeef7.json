Litter was provided in the form of a towel/blanket or sheets of paper (similar to ink\nfree newsprint). Two enclosures, each housing one dog, were noted with a wet bundle of the paper in the enclosure and\nno remaining clean litter. Several other enclosures were noted with minimal supply of the paper litter which would not be\nenough to absorb and cover excreta especially for the large breed dogs. Enough clean litter is necessary to absorb and\ncover excreta so the dogs do not get contaminated. The primary enclosures for dogs with solid bottoms must contain\nenough safe, nontoxic absorbent litter material to absorb and cover excreta.\nThe enclosures for the two dogs with the wet paper litter were corrected during the inspection. Correct by 11/29/21.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.\nThis inspection was done on the road at a scheduled stop in Dickson, TN.\nEnd Section"
