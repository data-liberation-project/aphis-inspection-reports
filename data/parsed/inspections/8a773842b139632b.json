There is no specific guidance for the parasite control of various species, only a list\nof drugs. Species specific dosing and route is not included for any species or drug in either PVC. There is no\nspecific clinic or veterinarian specified for emergency care. For capture and restraint method there is listed only\nchemical restraint with no species specific drugs, dosing or route. Additionally there is no guidance for anesthesia\nmonitoring, recovery or other pre or post procedural care where specific guidance is required. The method of\neuthanasia lists injectable euthanasia solution but does not provide any species specific drugs, dose or route for the\nlicensee to use. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee.\nTreatment records provided by the facility document that animals have been treated without written attending\nveterinarian guidance such as goats treated for lameness.\nAdditional specific guidance is required for the Programs of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate\nguidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does\nnot ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by\ndeveloping and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.\nCorrect by October 31, 2015."

The alpaca may be injured by the protruding piece of rebar and/or the jagged edge of the\nconcrete if it steps into the hole. The floor must be repaired to prevent injury to the animal.\n3) The ground has eroded away from the front of the pool creating a significant gap/space between the ground and\nthe side of the pool in the enclosure housing one wolf. The wolf may be injured by the exposed rough concrete and\nwire from the underside of the pool. The gap/space between the ground and the side of the pool must be filled to\nprevent injury to the animal.\nFacilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.\nHousing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.\nThis inspection was conducted on September 29, 2015.
