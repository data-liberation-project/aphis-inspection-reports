The right eye was being held partially\nclosed and had brown crusty debris on the upper and lower lid accumulating in the corner of the eye closest to the\nnose.\n2. One white and tan guinea pig was present in pen #31. The left eye was being held partially closed and had brown\ncrusty debris on the hair surrounding the entire eye.\n3. One black and white guinea pig was in pen #32. This guinea pig had an area on the back end near the tail that\nhad blood on it. The hair was matted down with a pink - bloody discharge, and there was blood observed on some\nof the shavings inside the pen.\n4. One white and brown guinea pig was in pen #22. There was two golf ball sized lumps observed under and\nextending out on both sides of its chin.\n5. One white and tan guinea pig with a black face was housed in pen #16.

There was a golf ball sized lump observed under\nits chin.\n7. One tank and black female guinea pig was housed in pen #10. There was a golf ball sized lump observed under\nboth sides of its chin.\nThe clinical signs of abnormal lumps/masses, wounds, and eye abnormalities are all indicators of ill-health or\ndisease. These conditions can result from multiple causes including traumatic injury an infectious diseases, or other\ncauses. Depending on the underlying cause, left untreated these conditions may progress leading to additional\nunnecessary animal suffering. All licensees are required to implement appropriate methods for adequate veterinary\ncare including the use of methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease\nfor all animals. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these animals is necessary to ensure humane care.\nCorrect by having these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and the development of an\nappropriate treatment plan for animal each condition. Documentation of this examination, the treatment plan,\nimplementation of the treatments, and recommendations for prevention / control of disease spread to the remaining\nanimals shall be maintained by the licensee for examination by APHIS Officials upon request.\nTo be completed by: 28 January 2017\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the licensee."
