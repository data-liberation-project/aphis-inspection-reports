One female identified as \u201cYoko\u201d was injured\nduring the introduction and sustained more injuries overnight according to keeper records. The animal was\nobserved to have additional injuries on April 27 and on April 28 she was observed huddling in a corner and did not\neat her mid-day or pm diet. There were no daily observations made for this animal the next two days and on May 1,\n2016 she had wounds apparent, her eyes were closed and she was shaking. On May 3, 2016 she was examined by\nthe vet and humanely euthanized due to extent of her injuries. There is no indication in the records that \u201cYoko\u2019s\u201d\ncondition was communicated to the vet in a timely manner. The facility stated that the veterinarian can access the\ndaily keeper logs for all animals and is sent a report for these issues but there is no follow up information indicating\nthe vet was aware of the extent of injuries. Given the number of animals at the facility and the severity of these\ninjuries reliance on checking daily logs is not considered adequate communication. Additionally there are no records\nfor three days when the animal was showing visible signs that she was in pain and potential distress. The facility\nneeds to address the mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that accurate and timely information for\nproblems on animal health and behavior is conveyed to the attending vet.\nCorrect by: Dec 2, 2016"

One female identified as \u201cYoko\u201d was injured\nduring the introduction and sustained more injuries over the next several days, went off feed and began to separate\nfrom the troupe. This lasted for a period of 9 days until she was examined by the vet and then euthanized due to\ninjuries. Records noted the animal was following the troupe but also staying away from the other animals. Two\nanimals in particular \u201cKathy\u201d and \u201cDebbi\u201d were noted to be aggressive to \u201cYoko\u201d. Despite observations that the\nintroduction with \u201cYoko\u201d was going poorly and resulted in multiple injuries over the entire period, the facility made no\nalterations to the introduction plan that could have minimized additional injury and stress. Additionally there were\nmultiple days for which no observations were recorded despite the seriousness of this issue. It is recognized that\nnon-human primate introductions can be challenging due to the nature of the animals, however the handling of\nthese animals during introductions needs to minimize physical harm and unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect by: Dec 1, 2016"
