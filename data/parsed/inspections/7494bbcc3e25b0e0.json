There are two main doors to the barn. One of the doors\ncurrently used for the giraffes to enter the barn is propped open by large rocks which the giraffes may stumble on\nand become injured. The door is tilted and leans in at the top making it not structurally sound. There are two stalls in\nthe barn and the giraffes are separated and locked in them during extreme cold weather. The second door which\nwould be necessary for access to the giraffe when locked in on that side, is not functioning and has to remain\nclosed. The aluminum or tin panels on the doors and outside walls of the barn have exposed sharp edges and\nsharp points which may allow the giraffes to get cut or become injured.\nInside the barn there are exposed electrical wires joined with caps in an open electrical box. The light switches are\nalso in open electrical boxes. The electrical boxes, wiring, and light fixture are dusty, dirty, and covered in spider\nwebs creating a fire hazard. This areas needs to be cleaned and repairs made to create a safe environment for the\nanimals.\nThere is chain link fencing separating the Capybara and Alpacas. The bottom support of the fence is bent\noutwardly, creating a hole underneath. This hole, could allow for the Capybaras to enter the adjoining enclosure, or\ncreate an area for injury by getting caught under the wiring.\nA wooden patch has been applied to the ceiling in the corner of the giraffe/camel barn to repair a leak. The wood\nhas warped and partially separated from the ceiling which could allow it to fall and injure animals below. It appears\nthat the repair is ineffective and the leak still present.\nThere is chain link fencing separating the Capybara and Alpacas. The bottom support of the fence is bent\noutwardly, creating a hole underneath. This hole, could allow for the Capybaras to enter the adjoining enclosure, or\ncreate an area for injury by getting caught under the wiring.\nThe metal fencing, composing the primary enclosure for the Rhino, is old, rusting, and has multiple areas of\ncorrosion.\nThere is hog wire fencing attached to the metal fence posts and railings. This hog wire is bent, broken, and in\ndisrepair creating sharp points and areas large enough for the Rhino to become caught and or injured in the gaping\nholes.\nThere is a portion, near the bottom of the fencing, of the Camel enclosure that has been significantly damaged. It is\npushed out, raised, and has broken areas creating sharp points. The condition of the fence could allow the Camel,\nas well as other smaller animals to become entangled within the mangled wire. The sharp points can result in injury\nto the camel or other animals exposed.\nThe elevated metal rack, designed to hold the water trough for the Camel, is extremely rusted and has large areas\nof corrosion. It is not structurally sound and the corrosion has left jagged edges that may allow the camel to\nbecome injured.\nOn April 17, 2015 an older female Patagonian cavy was injured when a New Guinea singing dog housed in an\nadjoining enclosure jumped over the fence and into the cavy's enclosure. The enclosure is not constructed in a\nmanner that will securely contain the singing dogs. Housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained to protect\nthe animals from injury and securely contain them.\nThe gate in the divider fence of the lion enclosure is not secured. Although the lions are currently allowed access to\nboth enclosures, the gate is used to separate the lions when needed. The welded lever used to open and close it\nhas broken off leaving the gate swinging freely. We observed the male lion swing the gate open to access the\nadjoining pen.
