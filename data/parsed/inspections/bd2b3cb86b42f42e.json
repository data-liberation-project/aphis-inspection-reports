The licensee said the attending veterinarian\nmight have observed this in the spring but it isn't currently under treatment.\n-Grey and white F Shih-tzu (no tag, housed on south side) had a burr matted in the hair above her left eye. The burr was\nremoved and the surface of the eye appeared slightly hazy. It is unclear if it had a previous injury or if the burr had\ncontributed to the left eye's abnormality.\nNot observing animal health problems promptly can cause animals to go untreated, be in discomfort, and the health\nproblem could get worse.
