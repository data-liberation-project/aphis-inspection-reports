All four feet show\nexcessive pad overgrowth with built up areas and flaps present that can allow foreign objects to lodge under them\nand penetrate the sole. One nail on the left front foot appears chipped/broken. The elephant keeper reported that\nthis occurred recently on a rock and that he is addressing this nail. Several other nails appear long and irregular in\nshape. Toenails need to be trimmed so that the elephant is not putting weight or pressure on the nails. The keeper\nindicated that he does footwork only as needed and does not currently have a routine footcare program in place. No\ndocumentation of footcare was available for review.\nThe skin of the female African elephant, Asha, appears dry and thickened with a cracked looking appearance\nespecially over her back and on her head. The keeper indicated that he does do baths with water and uses a small\nwire brush on her skin occasionally. There is a container of Zafari, commonly used to bathe elephants with dry skin,\npresent at the facility but the amount of dirt on the container and the difficulty of opening the lid indicate that it has\nnot been used recently or regularly. The elephant enclosure does not have a pond or pool available for her to soak\nin.\nHealthy skin and feet are important to the overall health of the elephant.\nThe feet and skin of the elephant Asha should be evaluated by a veterinarian and a written foot and skin care\nmaintenance program needs to be established by June 21, 2015. The program shall meet current professionally\naccepted standards. Ongoing maintenance of the feet and skin of the elephant should be documented and available\nfor inspection.\n*The approximately 15 year old male serval appears thin. The serval has a tucked up/tucked in appearance with the\nvertebral bodies (spine) and hip bones slightly showing. His cheek/face bone structure also appears more\npronounced than normal. The facility representative stated that he has been like this for a while and that they are\nfeeding him more than the other serval. There is no documentation available to show that the attending veterinarian\nwas contacted to evaluate the serval prior to the start of this inspection.\nLoss of weight can be associated with old age however it can also be an indication of illness, disease, or nutritional\nimbalance.\nThe facility needs to have the serval evaluated by a veterinarian and a medical workup done to determine if there is\nan underlying cause and to determine the best feeding/nutritional plan for this animal. A licensed veterinarian met\nwith APHIS officials during the inspection process on May 20, 2015 and stated that she had just looked at the serval\nand was establishing a veterinary care plan for him.\nThis is a repeat non-compliant item based on section and subsection numbers.

      "narrative": "The facility(cid:25)'s current program for hand rearing tiger cubs is not adequate. Four tiger cubs were born on 9 April 2015\nand were removed from the dam within one hour of birth. Each cub was fed reconstituted commercially available\ncattle colostrum (Bovine IgG Calf'(cid:25)s Choice Total) for the first two days before being transitioned to formula. The\nfacility is currently using Fox Valley Day One 32/40 Formula to comprise the bulk of the cub diet. Directions on the\nformula recommend reconstitution by mixing 1 part powder to 2 parts water. The keeper responsible for care of the\ntiger cubs stated that the formula is currently being made by mixing 1/4 cup of formula powder with 1/4 cup goat(cid:25)'s\nmilk and then diluting the mixture to approximately 1000 ml with water. This represents approximately a 1:15\ndilution of formula (seven and a half times more dilute than recommended) with the small addition of goats milk.\nFormula is refrigerated until feeding at which time it is transferred to a bottle which is then microwaved for\napproximately one minute to warm. Currently the facility is feeding dilute formula ad libitum 4 - 5 times per day. The\nfeeding plan states that meat is added to the formula diet at 8 weeks of age. When meat is introduced, the current\ndiet plan calls for a (cid:28)small amount of Feline T-Oasis Vitamin supplement(cid:29) to be sprinkled on beef. According to the\nkeeper, there are no other dietary supplements given prior to feeding meat.\nOne tiger cub remains at the facility at this time. In the week preceding inspection, facility records indicate the cub\nhad an average weight of 4.6 kg (10 lbs) and consumed a daily average of over 2 liters of dilute formula. Based on\nexpected nutritional intake, this cub is currently consuming approximately 30% less than required. In order to take in\nenough nutrition a cub of this size would need to consume approximately 3 liters of dilute formula/goat milk mix per\nday. At the time of inspection this cub was bright and alert but had a rough hair coat, a prominent pelvis, and a\npot-bellied appearance.\nThe current feeding practices in use by the facility are not appropriate for the age, species and size of this animal.\nBovine colostrum has not been demonstrated to provide immune protection to exotic felines such as tigers and the\nfacility is not currently addressing passive transfer of immunity to the cubs in any other manner. Failure to ensure\nthat cubs receive adequate immunity from their dam or an alternate source places cubs at increased risk of disease.\nThe extreme dilution of the formula by the facility requires the cub to drink an excessive volume of dilute\nformula/goat's milk mix and therefore, as it is currently being prepared, is not of sufficient nutritive value to\nappropriately maintain the health and allow for normal growth of this cub. Additionally, microwaving formula for\nexcessive periods of time is not consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations for preparing the formula.\nThis may lead to additional health complications.\nAlthough meat is not currently being added to the diet, the approved feeding plan fails to provide specific guidance\nregarding measuring the amount of supplement (Feline T-Oasis Vitamin supplement) and meat to which it is added\nand is therefore inconsistent with manufacturer(cid:25)'s recommendations. Failure to properly supplement meat fed to\ngrowing cubs may lead to health complications such as the development of metabolic bone disease. Additionally,\nthe accepted industry standard includes introduction of meat products as early as 2-3 weeks old (added to the\nformula) and a gradual increase in meat consumption until weaning.\nCorrection of this noncompliance shall involve three steps. First, the facility must contact the attending veterinarian\nto develop a plan for this cub to immediately transition her to a diet that is wholesome, palatable and of sufficient\nnutritive value. Complete by 5:00 pm on 23 May 2015. Second, a cub feeding plan which meets all nutritional needs\nfor cubs throughout all their growth stages and meets currently accepted industry standards must be developed and\napproved by the attending veterinarian no later than 30 May 2015. Third, the facility must seek guidance from the\nattending veterinarian regarding developing a hand rearing protocol for tigers that is in accordance with generally\naccepted industry standards for all aspects of care prior to any future hand rearing of tiger cubs."
