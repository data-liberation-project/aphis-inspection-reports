      "narrative": "***The facility did not use appropriate means to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries of two\nrabbits with medical issues.\nThree white rabbits were being housed in a single enclosure. One of the rabbits had a raised, circular area of hair\nloss on its head, between the eyes, that was 2cm in diameter. The visible skin was pink/red in color with dried blood\nand purulent discharge on the surface. A second rabbit in the enclosure had swelling on the head, above the right\neye and the visible skin appeared pink in color with dry, rough crust on the surface.\nThe facility received these rabbits together approximately three days ago and they were placed in the same primary\nenclosure. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible and should not be housed with other\nanimals that interfere with their health or cause them discomfort. The licensee informed the two Veterinary Medical\nOfficers that these animals\u2019 conditions had not been noticed by the staff and that no veterinarian had been\ncontacted regarding the wounds.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead\nto prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care health problems. The facility must use appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nAfter the inspection, the facility separated the two rabbits that had wounds.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY SEPTEMBER 20, 2019."
