      "narrative": "There were several animals throughout the facility that were observed to have other veterinary care related\nproblems as documented below:\n* A female pot-bellied pig, \"Tilly,\" roaming free near the barn, was observed to have difficulty walking. She was slow\nmoving. Her rear legs did not move properly. When she attempted to move forward her hind end side-stepped and\nher rear feet crossed each other. She moved in a staggering motion and was observed falling down on multiple\noccasions when she tried to turn around.\n* A sheep, \"Baby Sheep,\" was housed with \"Marshmallow\" in a stall in the barn. The animal care taker stated that\nthe sheep was observed to be throwing up green liquid. Depending on who was asked, the veterinarian was or was\nnot contacted. A document was provided showing that Baytril was to be administered to the sheep twice a day. The\nattending veterinarian's office did not have any record for \"Baby Sheep.\"\n* A female goat has a hard mass on its right ear. The mass is round and slightly larger than a golf ball. It was firm,\ncovered with thinning hair and mildly red to purple in color.\n* A male dog, \"Skippy,\" housed with the coyote was observed to have an open wound under his right eye. The\nwound is closely located to the outside corner of the eye and is approximately 2-3 cm in size. The wound itself is\nmoderately red and swollen with brown to black crusting around the open area.\n* A male mountain lion, \"Turbo,\" was observed to have a sore right front leg and is unable to get around his\nenclosure easily. The animal is missing it's left front leg so when it stands it relies solely on its right front leg. When\nthe animal attempted to stand it did not put its foot flat on the ground and its right front leg was not fully extended.\nAs a result, he stood in a \"hunched over\" position. When the animal attempted to walk he still did not place the\nbottom of his foot on the ground or fully extend his front right leg. He walked hunched over, in a \"crawling\" motion,\nwith his head down. The facility representative stated that the animal has a pressure sore on its right front leg. The\nvet records show that the animal was assessed by the attending veterinarian on December 15, 2015 and\nrecommended euthanasia and then again on August 22, 2016 where euthanasia was recommended once again."

      "narrative": "There were a number of animals throughout the sanctuary that were observed to be extremely thin:\n* A female wolf hybrid, \"Macey,\" housed down by the cabin was observed to be extremely thin (BCS 0.5/5) with her\nhip bones and spine showing. The hip bones and spine were prominent. The ribs were moderately visible. The\nabdomen had a \"tucked up\" appearance and appeared sunken in behind the ribs.\n* A female hog, \"Gertrude,\" housed by the barn was observed to have open sores on her sides. The size of the\nsores varied in size from pinpoint to 2-3 cm. Some of the smaller sores were scabbed over but the majority of the\nlarger sores were open with brown to black crusting around the open areas. Some of the sores were oozing a\nyellow-green discharge while others were bleeding. The hog was also extremely thin (BCS 0.5) with her back bone\nand hips protruding. When the hog got up, she walked over to the fencing and started rubbing/itching her sides\nalong the fencing causing the sores to bleed/ooze more.\n* A female sheep, \"Marshmellow,\" housed in one of the stalls in the barn was observed to be emaciated (BCS 0.5/5)\nwith every bone in its body clearly visible. The ribs, hips, back-bone and head bones were protruding greatly and\nthe abdomen was sunken in behind the ribs. The sheep moves very little and spends a good deal of time standing\nin place with its head in the corner. The sheep was evaluated on August 22nd, 2016 and the veterinarian diagnosed\nmoderate arthritis, vision loss, and generalized muscle loss. The veterinarian recommended deworming with\nFenbendazole and a diet increase/change. There are no records showing that the recommendations were followed.\nThere are no records showing that the veterinarian has been contacted since the evaluation in August.\n* A male Grizzly bear, \"Kody,\" was observed pacing non-stop in his enclosure. He appears thin (BCS 1.5/5) and his\nhair coat appears poor. His hip bones, shoulders and spine were mildly protruding and his haircoat is dull and rough\nin appearance.\n* \"Benny\" and \"Kiwani,\" two Syrian bears housed next to the other bears appear thin (BCS 2/5) with mildly\nprotruding hip bones, shoulders and spine.\n* The female black bear, \"Lilly,\" and the male black bear, \"Grunt,\" were observed to be thin (BCS 2/5) with poor hair\ncoats. Their hip bones, shoulders and spine were mildly protruding and their haircoats were dull and rough in\nappearance. Their flank appears to be sunken in.\n* A male white tiger, \"Raphael,\" was observed to be thin (BCS 2.5/5) with prominent hip bones and back bone.\n* A female Bengal tiger, \"Shula,\" was observed to be thin (BCS 2.5/5) with prominent hip bones and back bone. She\nwas also observed dribbling urine when she exited her shelter. Her food from the feeding from September 28, 2016\nwas still on the ground in her enclosure and had not all been consumed. The attending veterinarian assessed the\ntiger on August 22nd and recommended metacam be administered every other day. There was no metacam on the\nproperty and the animal care takers present were not made aware that she should be getting medication.\nVeterinary care issues, such as all those listed above can be painful or distressful to the animal and can lead to\nfurther health complications. The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian by 5:00 pm on\nSeptember 29, 2016 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an\nappropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.

      "narrative": "It is evident by the number and type of non-compliant items that there is an inadequate number of knowledgeable\nemployees to carry out the level of husbandry and care required by the Animal Welfare regulations. During the\nday-long inspection at the facility, numerous animals were observed to need veterinary care. Animals were\nobserved to be thin indicating they are not getting a sufficient diet and there are animals intermingled with animals\nthat are not compatible with each other. There were areas in the facility that needed maintenance and upkeep. In\naddition, the animal caretakers who accompanied the inspector on inspection indicated that the \"reliable people\"\nwho were assigned to the different areas of the sanctuary had not shown up at the sanctuary to care for the animals\nthey were assigned to care for. Some of the people who were assigned to the areas were not showing up until later\nin the day or even in the dark of night to feed the big cats and bears.\nThe volunteers who are currently at the sanctuary have little to no experience with large exotic animals and there is\nnot a program in place to train the volunteers who are helping or who will be helping in the future. In addition, the\nturn over at the facility continues to be extremely high making it difficult to maintain sufficiently trained employees.\nFailure to provide a sufficient number of adequately trained employees does not ensure that problems at the facility,\nincluding veterinary care and husbandry issues, are identified and corrected which could be detrimental to the\nwelfare of the animals.\nThe sanctuary needs to employ a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professionally\nacceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices shall be under a supervisor who has\na background in animal care.\nTo be corrected by October 30, 2016.\nThis inspection was conducted with Sanctuary volunteers. An exit interview, conducted on September 29, 2016,\nwas conducted with a Sanctuary volunteer and Animal Care VMO, Dr. Ann Goplen."

The diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.\nAnimals shall be fed at least once a day except as dictated by hibernation, veterinary treatment, normal fasts, or\nother professionally accepted practices.\nThe diets for the above mentioned animals need to be assessed by the veterinarian and the operators of the facility.\nAn appropriate written diet and feeding schedule needs to be implemented to include detailed records on what is\nbeing fed (including food item and weight), what time it is being fed, and who is providing the feed. These records\n\nneed to be maintained at the facility and made available for inspection upon next inspection.\nTo be corrected by noon, September 30, 2016.\n3.132           DIRECT\nEMPLOYEES. \nIt is evident by the number and type of non-compliant items that there is an inadequate number of knowledgeable\nemployees to carry out the level of husbandry and care required by the Animal Welfare regulations. During the\nday-long inspection at the facility, numerous animals were observed to need veterinary care. Animals were\nobserved to be thin indicating they are not getting a sufficient diet and there are animals intermingled with animals\nthat are not compatible with each other. There were areas in the facility that needed maintenance and upkeep. In\naddition, the animal caretakers who accompanied the inspector on inspection indicated that the \"reliable people\"\nwho were assigned to the different areas of the sanctuary had not shown up at the sanctuary to care for the animals\nthey were assigned to care for. Some of the people who were assigned to the areas were not showing up until later\nin the day or even in the dark of night to feed the big cats and bears. \nThe volunteers who are currently at the sanctuary have little to no experience with large exotic animals and there is\nnot a program in place to train the volunteers who are helping or who will be helping in the future.  In addition, the\nturn over at the facility continues to be extremely high making it difficult to maintain sufficiently trained employees.\nFailure to provide a sufficient number of adequately trained employees does not ensure that problems at the facility,\nincluding veterinary care and husbandry issues, are identified and corrected which could be detrimental to the\nwelfare of the animals. \nThe sanctuary needs to employ a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professionally\nacceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices shall be under a supervisor who has\na background in animal care.\nTo be corrected by October 30, 2016.\nThis inspection was conducted with Sanctuary volunteers. An exit interview, conducted on September 29, 2016,\nwas conducted with a Sanctuary volunteer and Animal Care VMO, Dr. Ann Goplen.",
