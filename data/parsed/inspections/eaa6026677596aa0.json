The jesses attached to a leash broke and the kestrel flew to the top of a light pole. Multiple capture\nmethods were implemented over a 8.5hour period, but the bird evaded capture with each attempt and flew away. Park\nRangers and a falconer set-up baited traps and searched for the kestrel for a week as witnesses reported seeing and\nhearing the bird. Despite these efforts, the kestrel was not recovered. Search efforts ceased on August 19, 2024.\nAt the time of inspection, the kestrel had not been seen or heard from for weeks. The bird was never captured. Improper\nhandling of animals increases the risk of escape. The facility must reassess their tethering process to ensure birds are\nhandled as carefully as possible to minimize trauma and unnecessary discomfort during public exhibition. Correct by\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nn"
