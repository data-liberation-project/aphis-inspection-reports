      "narrative": "***On May 23, 2017 during a previous inspection conducted by other APHIS inspectors, a female Ibex, Pixie, was\nobserved to have a patchy, dull haircoat. She appeared to be underweight, as evidenced by protruding hip bones\nand a prominent spine. The facility representative stated that she had always been like that. At that time Pixie had\nnot been examined by a veterinarian. On the current inspection conducted on August 17, 2017, we saw paperwork\nby the current veterinarian that Pixie was seen on May 27, 2017. In the veterinarian's report it was recorded that\nPixie had a low body condition score and was thin and not thriving, it was the veterinarian's recommendation to cull\nthe animal. The licensee did not cull the animal and the animal was found dead in her pen 2 weeks later.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by\nthe attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care\nshall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries and\nprovide a method for humane euthanasia. The licensee is required to follow the guidance of their attending\nveterinarian."
