Along\nthe fence lines of the enclosure there is visible mud and in some places the mud is so wet the birds' feet are sinking into\nthe mud. The rhea's legs are wet and muddy in both enclosures. The rheas must go through the wet muddy area to get to\ntheir water and feed receptacles. The inadequate drainage can lead to discomfort, decreased body temperature\nregulation and potential spread of disease. Housing facilities for birds must have drainage systems that are constructed\nand maintained so that water is rapidly eliminated and animals remain can remain dry.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
