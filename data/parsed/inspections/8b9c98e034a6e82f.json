A\ncrack in the hoof of a giraffe can become a serious issue should the crack become infected or further damaged\nresulting in an inability to walk.\nTwo adult female giraffes had excessively overgrown hooves on both front feet. Overgrown hooves when left\nuncorrected can potentially lead to foot and joint problems that can cause gait abnormalities. For the comfort and\nhealth of the animals trimming must occur frequently enough to prevent this condition.\nA female nyala was observed standing with a hunched posture in the outdoor pasture area. She appeared to have\nan adequate body condition however her coat was not smooth similar to the other nyalas in the pasture area. The\nfront of her body did not coordinate with the rear part of her body when she was walking resulting in a swaying\nmotion. When she attempted to run down the slope of the pasture her gait was uncoordinated with her front legs\ncrossing each other as she moved. This instability in her gait caused her to wobble in attempt to regain her balance\nwithout falling over. The licensee stated the nyala was eating well and in good body condition with no change in\nher condition since it was first observed on 8/24/16. There is no documentation to indicate that any veterinary\nevaluation of this animal has been performed.\nAll daily observations of problems in animal health need to be communicated to the veterinarian to ensure that an\nappropriate diagnosis is made and a treatment plan can be instituted to ensure the health of the animals and the\nsafety of the public that has contact with the animals. A veterinarian needs to examine the giraffes for their hooves\nand nyala for her hunched posture and uncoordinated gait to determine a diagnosis and set up a treatment plan."
