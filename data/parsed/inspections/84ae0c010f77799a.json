Because the ramp was not adequately secured, one fennec fox sustained a compound leg fracture.\nThe fox was taken to a local veterinary hospital for treatment.\nThe enclosure for the fennec fox led to a serious injury in this animal. Housing facilities must be structurally sound\nand in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nThe facility instituted corrective action for this incident prior to this inspection by removing the ramp in the enclosure.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHallberg Gwynn, Veterinary Medical Officer"
