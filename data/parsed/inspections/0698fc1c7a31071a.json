      "narrative": "***In September 2016 the facility self-reported an incident to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) and\nUSDA. The facility suspended a protocol as a result of inadequate intraoperative monitoring, as approved in the\nstudy protocol, and subsequent failure to identify a malfunctioning heating pad that may have contributed to the\nunexpected death of a rabbit undergoing a non-survival surgical procedure. According to anesthesia records, there\nwas a period of approximately 4 hours in which no temperature was recorded while the animal was under\nanesthesia for this procedure. This is contrary to the approved protocol which states that a rectal temperature will be\nmonitored and recorded every 15 minutes. Written records indicate that the animal died while under anesthesia and\nit is recorded that the animal\u2019s blood pressure dropped due to hypothermia and hemodilution. It was also noted in\nthe records that the water-heated mat under the animal had turned off, leading to hypothermia.The veterinary staff\nwas not immediately notified of intraoperative problems or of the animal\u2019s death. A necropsy was not performed on\nthe rabbit. By monitoring the temperature at more frequent intervals, changes in temperature may be identified and\naddressed sooner. The facility identified that proper steps to ensure the health and welfare of the animal may not\nhave been taken because records to substantiate those efforts were inadequately maintained. The facility must\nensure that proper guidance is provided to principal investigators and their personnel involved in the care and use of\nanimals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia at all times. The\nresearch facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to\nOLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Corrective\nactions taken include, but are not limited to, retraining of all personnel involved, a submitted plan to ensure\nadequate expertise of the research team performing procedures and amending the protocol to include contacting\nveterinary staff immediately if complications occur. This item has been corrected by the facility.\nThe inspection was conducted on March 7-9, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on March 9, 2017 with\nfacility representatives."
