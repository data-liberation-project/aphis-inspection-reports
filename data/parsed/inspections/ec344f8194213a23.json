The tartar on the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth is extremely thick and is encasing the\nentire surface of the teeth. The gums have become moderately reddened. The licensee presented documentation\nthat the attending veterinarian had been at the facility on April 12, 2017 to evaluate the facility and animals, but\nthere is no documentation from the attending veterinarian concerning the condition of this dog\u2019s teeth.\nPoor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues.\nThis beagle must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective\ntreatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nFemale beagle (No ID) identified under 2.40 (b)(2) on the last full inspection of the facility is no longer at the facility.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
