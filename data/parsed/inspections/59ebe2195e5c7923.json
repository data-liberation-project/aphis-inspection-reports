The feces were throughout the enclosures and the dogs\ncould not avoid walking through them, as evidenced by multiple fecal piles smashed into the concrete floor. Several\nfeces had a white mold-like discoloration and there was a strong odor of excrement that could be smelled from\nseveral feet away. Accumulations of excreta within animal enclosures creates an unhealthy environment and can\ncause health hazards for dogs. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is removed from the primary\nenclosures daily, as required, to prevent soiling of dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.\nCorrect from this day forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
