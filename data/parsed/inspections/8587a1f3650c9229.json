      "narrative": "The care of two animals involved inadequate daily observation and/or insufficient communication with the Attending\nVeterinarian (AV).\n--The male raccoon (DOB 10/1/2010) was first noticed to have hair loss on his tail on 12/20/2022. The facility\ncommunicated with the AV on both 12/20 and 12/21. Instructions to the facility from the AV were to check for fleas and\nuse a cortisone cream on the skin. There were no daily observations recorded to assess this medical problem (including\nwhether the cream was applied) noted in daily care sheets from 12/22 to 12/27. On 12/28 the daily care sheets noted that\nthe problem was progressing because the area of hair loss had doubled, and the skin was deep red. The AV saw the\nracoon on 12/28 and directed oral medications be started and scheduled an exam with sedation for 1/3. From 12/29 to\n1/3, daily care noted that the oral medications were given every day, but daily observations were only noted twice. On\n1/3/2023, the instructions from the AV were to continue the oral medications until finished and to continue to monitor the\nraccoon\u2019s condition. Daily care sheets documented that daily observation of the problem had occurred on 10 days\nbetween 1/3 and 1/30 despite progression of the problem as noted by increased hair loss and fresh blood seen\noccasionally during this time. The facility communicated with the AV regarding the animal\u2019s condition again on 1/30/2023.\nSince then, daily observations were inconsistently recorded but do show evidence of improvement. However, an entry on\n2/8/2023 noted the tail was still raw and red and an entry on 3/21/2023 noted a flare-up of the tail\u2019s condition. The AV was\nnot notified when the condition deteriorated or that the overall condition was persisting this long after initial onset. The\ndaily care sheets also noted daily observation of limping with this same raccoon on 4/12 to 4/14/2023 and on 4/18/2023.\n(No daily observations noted on 4/15 to 4/17). The AV was not contacted about this animal\u2019s limping.\n--The male cougar (DOB 9/20/2013) was noted in the daily care sheets to have either decreased or no food consumption\non 10 of the 16 days between 2/22/23 and 3/10/23. Regurgitation of food was also noted on 3/2/2023. The facility did not\ncommunicate with the AV about this cougar\u2019s decreased appetite or regurgitation.\n--Failure to communicate medical problems to a veterinarian can result in unresolved medical issues and prolonged\ndiscomfort or pain. Inconsistent daily observations of animals undergoing medical treatment make it challenging for the\nentire caretaker team and veterinarian to evaluate the treatment plan. The facility representative must observe all animals\ndaily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed. To be corrected 26 May 2023.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
