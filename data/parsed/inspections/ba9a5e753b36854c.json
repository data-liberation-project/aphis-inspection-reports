The animals currently being exhibited are one\nAfrican Crested Porcupine, one Mountain Coati, two Dromedary Camels, one Brama, one Sheep, six Pigs, and 26 goats.\nAuction records indicate that Mr. Degasperi sold one African Crested Porcupine at the Mount Hope exotics sale under the\nfraudulent USDA license number 54-C-0044 on 16-August-2022. Auction records also indicate that Ms.Pursely sold two\nAfrican crested porcupines under the fraudulent license number 44-C-0044 on 03-November-2022. Both sales records\nlisted the same address for the consignment. Neither of these license numbers is a valid license.\nMr. DeGasperi and Ms.Pursely stated to an non-uniformed inspector during the exhibition event on 01-July-2023 that they\nwere licensed. The inspector then attempted to locate license number of the individuals and determined they were not\nlicensed. Upon the return of the inspector in uniform, the individuals stated that they will be applying for a USDA license\nonce their moving process is completed but they are not currently licensed. Operating without a valid license impedes the\nability of APHIS officials to ensure adequate welfare for the animals in the facility. No person shall operate as a dealer,\nexhibitor, or operator of an auction sale, without a valid license.\nNo regulated activity, to include the exhibition or sale of regulated animals, can be conducted until a USDA license has\nbeen obtained."
