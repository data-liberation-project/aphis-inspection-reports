The lowest temperature reading was measured adjacent to the guinea pig enclosures on the north\nside of the building and the highest temperature was recorded adjacent to the enclosures near the wood stove.

The\npropane wall mounted heater on the north side of the building was turned off during the inspection.\nAnimals may become ill if temperature is not closely monitored and kept between 60-85 degrees Fahrenheit. The\nlicensee must ensure that the temperature is maintained at acceptable levels throughout the entire facility\nregardless of changing conditions outside. Continued monitoring of the temperature in the guinea pig building is\nnecessary with changing weather. Adjustments to the heaters and vents must be made to keep the ambient\ntemperature from falling\nbelow 60 degrees F. or exceeding 85 degrees F. when guinea pigs are present. Correct from this day forward.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the owner."
