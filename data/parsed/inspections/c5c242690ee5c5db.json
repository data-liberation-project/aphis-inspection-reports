The facility has been unable to\nrecover the animal. Inspector was informed the keeper who closed the evening of 5/31/2020 had not secured the gate\nwith the padlock to the outside area of the enclosure. Due to a windstorm that evening, and the gate not secured with the\npadlock it had opened. The facility has since implemented a new color-code double locking system and conducted re-\ntraining with the keepers. Animals escaping from primary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm from surrounding\npredatory animals and further injury when they are not safely contained.
