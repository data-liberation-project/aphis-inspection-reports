A treatment sheet for a 6 year old, neutered, hound mix named Bubba indicated that he had been\nprescribed Rimadyl to be given orally twice a day beginning on 09/22/17 and ending when the medication had\nfinished. On 09/23/17 the treatment sheet indicated that Bubba had only received the medication once that day. It\nwas not until the time of inspection that facility staff realized that the treatment plan had not been properly adhered\nto.\nInjuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead to\nprolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care health problems. The facility must use appropriate methods\nto prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Any change by the facility staff or students to\nprescribed veterinary treatments should be discussed with and approved by the veterinarian.\nTo be corrected by October 4, 2017\nThis inspection was conducted with the Veterinary Technology Program Director and the exit interview was\nconducted with the program director and two facility representatives."
