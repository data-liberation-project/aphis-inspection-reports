The eye is cloudy with a blue color and has a small \"bubble-like\" bulge in the center. The licensee had\nnot noticed the eye prior to inspection. The abnormal appearance of the eye could be an indication of injury,\ninfection, or other medical issues.\nFrontline Plus used monthly during April-November is listed on the ectoparasites section of the program of\nveterinary care. The licensee stated she is not currently using this product. The licensee is mixing ivermectin with\nalcohol and administering the medication by wiping it on the back of adult dogs monthly. The bottle of Ivermax (5mg\nivermectin per ml) being used does not list directions for use on dogs. The licensee stated that she has not\nconsulted the attending veterinarian about using the mixture.\nFailure to have proper authorization and specific instructions for use from a veterinarian does not ensure that proper\ndosing and administration of products is being accomplished. Further, it does not ensure that dogs are receiving\nappropriate veterinary care within currently accepted veterinary practices.\nThe licensee must have proper authorization, labels and instructions for use from a veterinarian. The licensee must\nhave the dog listed above examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment\nplan. Documentation should be available for all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment\nmust be part of the documentation. The licensee must also ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at\nall times.\nTo be corrected by: October 13, 2015.\nExit briefing conducted with licensee."
