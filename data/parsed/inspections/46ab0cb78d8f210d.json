The study protocol specified an allowable range of volume by weight of the\ninduction drugs, but the amount administered was above the upper limit of the range. In addition, the amount given\nfor all 6 rabbits were the same volume, rather than a volume adjusted by individual rabbit weight which was\nspecified in the protocol.\nDeviations from a protocol can result in unanticipated pain or death. The facility must ensure proper use of\nanesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers for any species of animals used by the facility. It is the responsibility of the\nresearch facility to provide continued training and instruction to all personnel with sufficient frequency to fulfill the\nresearch facility\u2019s responsibilities.\nCorrections were made soon after the incident happened.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
