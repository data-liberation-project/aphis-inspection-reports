This area is behind secondary fencing which has\nposted signs stating, \u201cplease keep hands out of pens,\u201d and \u201cdanger very aggressive animals\u201d. Despite the signs, once\nwithin the secondary area, there were no additional barriers to keep members of the public a significant distance away\nfrom the animals. In addition to members of the public getting very close to enclosures and having direct contact with the\nskunks and foxes, the animals inside the cages were acting very stressed by the proximity of the public. A few foxes were\ncircling in a repetitive abnormal behavior pattern that was a clear indicator of stress. The raccoons were stressed and\nrocking back and forth repetitively against the far side of the cage as people leaned over their cage. A bobcat was also\nstressed as it was observed loudly vocalizing and unable to get away from a member of the public who leaned down\ntowards the animal and was only a few inches away. Animals must be exhibited so there is minimal risk of harm to the\nanimal and public and the facility must ensure that there are barriers with sufficient distance to assure the safety of both."
