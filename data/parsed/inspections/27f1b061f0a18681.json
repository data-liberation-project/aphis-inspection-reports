This includes, but is not limited to, daily blood draws during the following time\nperiods: Jan 27th through January 30th, February 6th through Feb 11th, March 3rd through March 6th, 2023.\n- In 2021, the daily treatment records for 16-year-old #26876 \u201cJemma\u201d show that she underwent blood draws at daily\nintervals during multiple time periods. This includes, but is not limited to, daily blood draws during the following time\nperiods: May 12th through 15th, May 17th through 20th, May 23rd through 30th, June 10th through 13th.\nIncreased blood draw frequency can have potential impacts on animal health and well-being and is a significant change to\nthe current IACUC-approved protocol.\n** The protocol states that all animals (adult female baboons) will be weighed monthly when they are on study. The\nprotocol later states that animal weight is monitored weekly while the animal is on study when sedated. Records of 5\nfemale baboons (ID #s: 26741, 26876, 27320, 07105, 03105) on the current protocol only have weights documented\nduring their semi-annual physical and TB test, or during a surgical procedure. Upon request, no further documentation of\nanimal weights during this study period could be provided by the facility. Monitoring the animal\u2019s weight weekly is\ndescribed in the protocol as a clinical parameter to be monitored to indicate adverse effects, pain, and/or distress to the\nanimals. Failing to follow the protocol and significantly decreasing the frequency of weigh-ins without IACUC approval\ndoes not allow the IACUC to review a change in the study procedure, especially one that is directly related to monitoring\nanimal health and welfare.\n** The protocol describes an anticipated adverse event (\u201cseizures\u201d) in approximately 10% of animals receiving a study\ndrug from days 100-170 gestation. Due to this known adverse event, the protocol documents steps that will be taken for\nanimals found non-responsive, actively seizing, or unconscious which includes removing the animal from the cage,\nperforming a blood gas analysis and glucose level, catheter placement and potential supplementation of dextrose\ndepending on the blood glucose result. A 16-year-old female Olive Baboon #26876, \u201cJemma,\u201d while receiving the study\ndrug, was found unresponsive at 6 am by a technician on June 16, 2021. There are no records indicating treatment was\nprovided as outlined in the protocol. The only entry is from the attending veterinarian (AV) stating that she was found\nunresponsive at 6 am but by the time the AV arrived she had consumed some apples and was up and quiet, alert, and\nresponsive.\nFailing to follow the protocol and significantly changing the procedures performed on animals without IACUC approval\ndoes not allow the IACUC to review and either approve, require modifications in, or deny the proposed changes.
