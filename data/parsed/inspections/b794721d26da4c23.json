Animals\nwere also kept on study far beyond the 22-week timeline described in the protocol.\n***Four female chinchillas were not removed from protocol 19-015 in accordance with the protocol\u2019s humane endpoint.\nProtocol 19-015 states, \u201cAny animal that experiences more than 20% weight loss will also be removed from the study.\u201d All\nof the animals were placed on study upon arrival at the facility, and the program manager stated that none of the animals\nwere transferred off the study.\n1. Female chinchilla #2665L was received by the facility on 2/19/20 and weighed 404 grams upon intake. On July 29,\n2020 the animal weighed 317 grams, a loss of 21.5% body weight. On August 6, 2020 the animal weighed 291 grams, a\nloss of 27.9% body weight, at which time the animal was euthanized.\n2. Female chinchilla #2658R was received by the facility on 2/19/20 weighed 468 grams. On 4/30/20 the animal weighed\n328 grams, a loss of 29.9% body weight. On 5/6/20 the animal weighed 324 grams, a loss of 30.7% body weight. On\n5/11/20 the animal weighed 343 grams, a loss of 26.7% body weight. The animal was euthanized on 5/13/20.\n3. Female chinchilla #2668R was received by the facility on 2/19/20, and weighed 686 grams. On 1/27/21 the animal\nweighed 534 grams (22.1% weight loss). On 8/23/21 the animal weighed 511 grams (25.5% weight loss). The animal was\neuthanized on 10/18/21.\n4. Female chinchilla #2667L weighed 668 grams upon intake. Study records show that on 8/31/20 the animal weighed\n500 grams, a loss of 25.1% body weight. Despite veterinary care, the animal died on 9/7/20.\nThe procedure states that animals will be weighed weekly. However, review of medical and study records showed that\nanimals were not consistently weighed on a weekly basis.\n*** The protocol states that animals will be on study for 22 weeks, during which time they will undergo potentially painful\nprocedures with anesthesia and analgesia provided. Review of records and discussion with the program manager show\nthat animals were kept on this protocol for longer than 22 weeks, some animals remained on the protocol from March\n2020 to November 2021 (21 months).\nIn the second protocol (20-018), changes were made to animal selection, procedures, and care of rhesus macaques\nwithout IACUC review and approval and/or appropriate handling and documentation of administrative changes.\n***The age of animals used on study was changed without IACUC approval. According to health records, two male\nanimals (\u201cHHA\u201d and \u201cAB67\u201d) were used on study despite being older than the maximum age of 23 years described in the\nprotocol.\n***The weight of animals used on study was changed without IACUC approval. The protocol states that animals will weigh\n8-22 kg. Five female animals (DN96, CX48, 6-191, 07U011, and EB74) received on March 21st, 2022 and placed on\nstudy were below the minimum weight required. The animals underwent physical exams shortly after intake and their\nbody weights ranged from 4.9 kilograms to 7.3 kilograms.\n***The amount of sweetened beverage provided to the animals was increased without IACUC approval. An amendment\napproved June 7, 2021 added 500 mL of a sweetened beverage to the monkey\u2019s diet. Two monkeys (\u201cHHA\u201d and \u201c35R\u201d)\nbegan this procedure on September 13, 2021, and records show that they consumed 1,000 mL of sweetened beverage\non many days. The Program Manager stated that the monkeys were given refills of the sweetened beverage after\nconsuming the first 500 mLs.\n***The duration of time that monkeys were given a sweetened beverage was lengthened without IACUC review or\napproval. Study records provided to USDA officials show that 2 animals (\u201cHHA\u201d and \u201c35R\u201d) were given this sweetened\nbeverage from September 13, 2021 until April 25th, 2022 (7.5 months), but the protocol stated that the sweetened\nbeverage would only be provided for 3-6 months.\n***As part of recovering from an anesthetic event on study, animals were subjected to additional monitoring procedures\nwhich are not documented in the approved protocol. On September 22nd, 2022, 6 macaques underwent an insulin\nadministration procedure and during recovery all of these animals were given dextrose injections and repeated blood\ndraws. These procedures were not submitted to or reviewed by the IACUC.\nFor the above changes, these were not reviewed and approved by the IACUC or documented as administrative changes.\nMaking significant changes to protocols without IACUC review and approval deprives the IACUC of the opportunity to\nprovide oversight of animal activities and compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect by February 16, 2023 by ensuring that animal activities are accurately and completely described so that the\nIACUC can have oversight as required by the Animal Welfare Act regulations. At the time of the inspection, these\nprotocols were closed and no longer active."

      "narrative": "The facility failed to utilize appropriate methods to prevent, control, and diagnose medical issues that arose from the\nadministration of IV insulin, ultimately leading to the death of an animal and hours of unresolved, low blood glucose levels\nin others.\nMedical records show multiple rhesus macaques experienced severe low blood sugar and prolonged anesthesia recovery\ntimes after a procedure where intravenous insulin was administered under anesthesia. After insulin administration, blood\nsamples were taken at set intervals to monitor blood sugar for 30 minutes. Neither the protocol, nor an associated\namendment, addressed low blood sugar as a potential side effect of insulin administration nor did they include any\ninterventions to take should blood sugar fall to dangerously low levels.\nIn June 2022, a male rhesus macaque, \u201cDA9J,\u201d experienced an adverse event while on protocol receiving intravenous\ninsulin. According to his surgery/anesthesia monitoring record, he remained in \u201cStage 3\u201d of anesthesia, defined by the\nfacility as \u201canimals are unconscious or semi-conscious,\u201d for over 4 hours until recordings cease. During this time, he\nreceived no medical care or monitoring of blood glucose, despite being hypoglycemic at the end of the 30-minute study.\nBased on medical records, he did not receive medical intervention until more than 7 hours after the end of the procedure,\nalthough he remained barely responsive and did not \u201cfully recover\u201d from the procedure. Ultimately, the animal did not\nimprove and was euthanized on 6/28/22 with the medical note that he did not \u201cwake up\u201d from the procedure and was\n\u201cparalyzed, tonic/clonic\u201d. The current AV and program manager were unable to provide any additional information about\nthe provision of care for this animal.\nAn additional 11 rhesus macaques underwent this same procedure and also received no monitoring of their blood glucose\nor medical interventions for low blood sugar despite having blood glucose levels that were so low they were undetectable\nby the handheld glucometer (less than 20 mg/dL) at the end of the procedure. These animals all took an excessive\namount of time to recover from their anesthesia, some over 5 hours. Per medical record review, prior documented\nrecovery times for these same animals after other anesthetic events ranged from about 45 minutes to 1 hour.\nIn September 2022 the procedure was performed again on 6 of the same animals. Despite the addition of a minimal and\nineffective intervention (sugar (dextrose) injections) and repeated blood sugar measurements, records show multiple\nanimals had blood glucose levels that were so low they were undetectable by the handheld glucometer (less than 20\nmg/dL) for prolonged lengths of time. This led to multiple animals suffering from incredibly low blood sugar without\ncontinuous medical intervention to resolve the issue.\nAnimals exposed to anesthesia and insulin require special attention and care to prevent low blood sugar, low body\ntemperature, injury, and death. Animals with very low blood sugar may experience serious consequences including brain\ndamage, loss of consciousness, and seizures.\nCorrect by February 16, 2023 by ensuring that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\nmedical issues in animals, including the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care. At the time of the\ninspection, this protocol was closed and no longer active.\nThis inspection was conducted with the CompMed Program Manager and IACUC representatives from the Office of\nResearch.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the CompMed Program Manager, Director of Research Compliance, IACUC Chair,\nInstitutional Official and IACUC representatives from the Office of Research.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nDIANA CARE, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
