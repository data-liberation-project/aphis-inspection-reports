The registrant continued to use a loud tone and had a\ntense body posture while the inspector was attempting to discuss cage size for rabbits. The licensee used an\nexpletive to describe the USDA and said the regulations were hard to understand. Other issues discussed during\nthe inspection such as the frequency of the IACUC meetings and a past citation resulted in the licensee being\nverbally abusive to the inspector and at one point suddenly leaving the building slamming the door leaving the\nUSDA inspector in the building alone and unable to open the door. The USDA inspector stated to the licensee that\nthey could see he was upset and the inspection could be stopped and a supervisor would come to conduct the\ninspection with the registrant. The registrant \u201cstated that he did not want another government employee to come on\nto his property that one from the government was enough and that no one else should come on the inspection.\u201d The\nregistrant continued to act in an intimidating manner (making abrupt movements, storming away from the\ninspection, and raising his voice) towards the inspector throughout the inspection despite numerous attempts by the\ninspector to defuse the situation. He walked away during the animal inspection and repeatedly told the inspector\nshe was interrupting him when she was trying to ask him pertinent questions related to the inspection. The fact that\nthe registrant continued to appear so agitated and irritated with the inspector made it impossible for the inspector to\nget answers from questions and complete the inspection process. Additionally, the threatening behavior (slamming\nthe building door , and maintaining a tense jaw and body posture and suddenly not talking to the inspector)\ndisplayed by the registrant made me feel afraid and intimidated and I decided it best to leave the facility.\nNo research facility shall interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS official who\nis in the course of carrying out his or her duties.\nThe inspection was not completed."
