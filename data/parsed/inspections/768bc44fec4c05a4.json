Several of the dogs\nhad a raspy sound associated with their breathing.\nIn both the sheltered housing building and the large whelping building the majority of puppies under the age of 7 weeks\nwere observed showing signs of heat stress such as open mouth breathing, high respiration rates, and tongues extended\nout of the mouths. Puppies were also observed spread out across the enclosure floor with their legs sprawled out.\nIn an outdoor enclosure containing approximately 8 dogs, the dogs were showing signs of stress from the heat and 4\ndogs were observed lying down in a muddy area where there is an accumulation of liquid waste that overflows or leaks\nfrom a drainpipe running parallel to the enclosure. This muddy area is also in the shade, so the dogs were sitting in the\nwaste as they sought relief from the extreme temperatures. These dogs, soiled with contaminated mud, are at increased\nrisk of disease.\nThe temperatures taken throughout the facility by the inspectors Kestrel ranged from 91-97 degrees F with a heat index\nup to 125 degrees F. On the day of the inspection, The National Weather Service had issued a heat advisory for the\narea.\nHeat stress can be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals and can even result in death.\nWhen climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to\nalleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,\nand time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must alter the temperature to a level that is\ncomfortable for the dogs. The licensee must ensure the dogs are maintained in appropriate climatic conditions at all times."
