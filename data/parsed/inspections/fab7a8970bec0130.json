The attending veterinarian was\nnotified.\nThe entrapment had resulted in a laceration and swelling of the muzzle of the animal, causing narrowing of the animal's\nairway leading to respiratory distress. On exam, the animal was cyanotic and had lost 27% of its body weight. Facility\nrepresentatives note that the extent of the injury and the weight loss was such that it was unlikely to have occurred in the\n82 minutes between clinical observation by designated research staff and observation of the animal in distress by the\nveterinary staff. Accurate information about the condition of the animal at the time of the initial observation was not\nrecorded or conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nDaily observation of animals to assess their health and well-being may be conducted by someone other than the\nattending veterinarian provided that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian.\nThis incident was identified by the facility and corrective measures had been implemented prior to this inspection.
