      "narrative": "The 14 year old male Bactrian camel is thin and has projectile liquid green diarrhea, demonstrated during the\ninspection. All of the feces in the enclosure and barn were of liquid consistency. Several of his ribs and his pelvic\nbones are visible, and his two humps are thin. His entire rear end and both rear legs are covered in green feces\nand dirt. The fur on his rump is thickly matted with fecal matter and dirt. The caretaker states he developed diarrhea\nwhen he was moved to a new paddock with long fresh grass and that they have given him Koapectate. Chronic\ndiarrhea can lead to dehydration and can cause serious illness or death. This animal needs to be cleaned of the\nfeces caking the rump and covering the legs. This is a Direct citation.\nTwo female aoudads are excessively thin. They are each nursing a single baby. Their ribs, scapula, and pelvic\nbones are easily visible. The caretaker states they were darted and dewormed with 4ccs of ivermectin on August\n28, 2015, but the only medical record is a note on the appointments calendar saying (cid:28)aoudad shot.(cid:29) The attending\nveterinarian has not been contacted to re-evaluate these animals to obtain a diagnosis and provide additional\ntreatments as needed.\nThe attending veterinarian also needs to be consulted about the following behaviors observed in the capuchin.\nThe caretaker stated she feeds the non-human primates a few biscuits in the morning as she starts hoof stock\nrounds, then feeds their meal normally around 11:00 -12:00. The capuchin was exhibiting repetitive frantic\nstereotypic behaviors as he sat on a top perch peering in the direction in which the food would arrive. He was biting\nat the cage bars, clapping his hands, biting at his hands and feet, clutching his head, sticking his tongue out and\nsticking his hands in his mouth. Then he would walk the perch past the hanging white bucket where food is\ndispensed and look into it every time. He also went to the ground and appeared to be looking for food. He took a\nblack object out of the pvc half pipe feeder and stuck it in his mouth, but then spit it out. He continued these\nbehaviors for at least 15 minutes.\nThe stereotypic behavior of the capuchin ceased once the capuchin was fed. The veterinarian needs to be\nconsulted as to the quantities and nutritional value of the food, to see if additional changes to diet would alleviate\nthe excessive behaviors.\nDocumentation of all veterinary examinations, consultations, and treatments must be maintained for future review\nby APHIS officials. Owner-given medical treatments provided to the animals need to be documented (e.g. drug\nnames, dosages, routes of administration, species to be treated etc.) to show the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations,\nthat the written Program of Veterinary Care is being followed, and that animals are being provided adequate\nveterinary care.\nTo be corrected by 9-23-15."
