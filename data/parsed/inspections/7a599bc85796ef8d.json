Some repairs have been initiated,\nincluding temporary measures to ensure that the floor is not peeling, and is impervious to moisture. Further repairs\nare planned for spring when the weather will facilitate painting.\nThe fencing between the small and large yards has sections with chipped, peeling, missing paint and rust, such as\non the gate. Also the ceiling above the enclosure in the small yard has peeling paint, and the wood appears to be\ndeteriorating, and this could allow particles to fall into the enclosure. An estimate for making these repairs has been\nobtained from a contractor, and repair planning is in progress.\nAll surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces can\nimpede cleaning, create hazards, and otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.\nRepeat citation, previosuly cited in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 3/26/15, and 6/17/15.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
