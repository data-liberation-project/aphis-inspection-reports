Dried blood was present on the enclosure bars,\nthe fabric nestbox and the wall behind the enclosure.\nA veterinarian needs to examine the wound to determine the treatment necessary. Correct by 12/3/16.\n*2) The male red-handed tamarin appears thin overall and through his face. The hair is missing from his entire tail.\nThe facility representative reports that he was extremely thin when acquired at an auction in Sept. 2015 and has\ngained some weight since. The facility took a stool sample to the vet for a fecal check but has not had the tamarin\nexamined. A discussion about the current feeding plan shows many varied food items are being fed. The tamarin\nwas observed eating during the inspection.\nA veterinarian needs to examine the tamarin to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan for the thin body\ncondition. The tamarin's diet shall also be reviewed as part of the examination by a veterinarian to verify that it is\nnutritionally complete. Correct by 12/10/16."

The pouches in which the gliders were sleeping took up most of the cage space leaving no\nroom for normal sugar glider social adjustments or movements such as climbing or gliding.
