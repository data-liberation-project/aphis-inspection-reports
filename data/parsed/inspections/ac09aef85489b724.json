One enclosure had 6 large guinea pigs, and the other had 7 large guinea\npigs, exceeding the four animals that fit in that space by regulation. Since they are sharing the enclosure, they only\nhave 68-80 square inches of floor space per animal.\nThe animals should be provided with adequate floor space so as to facilitate adequate freedom of movement.\nFailure to provide adequate floor space could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals. A\nsystem must be in place to house the guinea pigs in enclosures appropriate to their size.\nCorrection date: 22 December 2018\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
