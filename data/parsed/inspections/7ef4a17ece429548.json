      "narrative": "Three adult female deer appear very thin with ribs showing. One of these doe is emaciated with ribs, hip bones and\nspine visible. This doe was drooling from its mouth during this inspection. These three deer are over 10 years of\nage, currently shedding their summer coat and had fawns in June and early July. The co-owner called the attending\nveterinarian about the three deer on Tuesday (9/18/18), at which time he recommended the deer be dewormed by\nputting Strongid C in the feed. Treatment for the thin deer was started on Friday (9/21/18).\nThe co-owner of the facility stated she knew about the three deer being thin this summer, but did not call the\nattending veterinarian until Tuesday (9/18/18). The written Program of Veterinary Care on file states that the deer\nwill be dewormed yearly and more often if necessary. There were no records present to determine when the deer\nwere last dewormed, observation records, or treatments given to the deer as of Wednesday (9/19/18).\nDaily observations must be done on the animals to assess their health and well-being. The attending veterinarian\nmust be consulted when there are problems with animal health, behavior, and well-being. Failure to call the\nattending veterinarian when there are problems with animal health may result in worsening of the condition and\nprevent treatment from being started in a timely manner. The licensee must ensure that the attending veterinarian\nis consulted when there are problems with animal health, behavior and well being. Correct from this day forward.\nThis inspection was conducted with the caretaker and exit interview was conducted with the co-owner."
