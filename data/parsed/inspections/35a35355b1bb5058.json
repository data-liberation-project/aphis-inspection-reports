On\nSaturday, September 28, 2024, the facility observed a male wallaby named Chubs with torn claws on the back left middle\ntoe and right front 4th digit toe. A male wallaby named Cisco had a torn claw on the right rear outside toe. The facility\nattempted to contact the attending veterinarian on the September 28, 2024, but did not receive a response. The facility\nhas been treating the injured toes with saline and silver sulfadiazine cream. Upon examination, the torn areas appear to\nbe tender, with the wallabies withdrawing their paws when examination is attempted. The remaining nailbeds are\nextremely short and beginning to scab over. Many overgrown claws on other toes are curved and shift to the side when\nweight is applied.\nAppropriate and timely veterinary care is required to provide assessment and treatment, and to prevent additional\nunnecessary pain and distress in animals. The licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries. This includes the availability to provide emergency, weekend, and holiday veterinary care.\nAppropriate veterinary care in this situation also includes methods to ensure the nails are kept at the proper length to\nprevent future injuries. The attending veterinarian must evaluate the wallabies and determine an appropriate plan for\ndiagnosis and treatment.\nCorrect by October 2, 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
