The stalls inside the barn had no bedding and\ndid not provide a wind-break for the animals. According to the owner the reason for the lack of bedding was due to\ncleaning the night before and that bedding was going to be put in that day. There was a tarp in one of the stalls but\nit did not adequately provide a windbreak and was only available to half of the animals. The majority of the goats\nwere observed huddled together and shivering. Numerous goats had varying degrees of nasal discharge. According\nto the temperature gun, it was 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit inside the barn with a light wind. Snow covered the pasture.\nAnimals need to be housed in a manner to prevent discomfort and stress. Cold stress severely decreases the\nimmune system of goats and can contribute to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Correct by ensuring the\ngoats are housed in a manner to prevent discomfort. The owner says there will be an effective wind-break put in\nplace that all animals will have access to later that day. Bedding was provided to the goats at the time of inspection.\nContinue to monitor the goats for cold stress and provide an effective means that prevents the discomfort of the\nanimals. Corrected at time of exit.\nThis is a focus inspection of the direct non-compliances.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and multiple representatives of the facility."
