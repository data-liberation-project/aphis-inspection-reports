All roof damaged areas exhibit sharp\npoints/edges which the gibbons could easily reach and/or grab. Also, several metal hose clamps attached to\nprimary enclosures have exposed sharp ends that are in need of repair/adjustment. Damaged metal components\nwith sharp points/edges identified on primary enclosures might injure regulated animals. Housing facilities for\nNHP's must be kept in good repair, and must be free of jagged edges; protecting regulated animals from injury, and\ncontaining the animals securely. All damaged and deteriorating metal components at primary enclosures must be\nrepaired and/or replaced to prevent/eliminate the potential of an injury to regulated animals.\nTo be completed by: February 11, 2018\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
