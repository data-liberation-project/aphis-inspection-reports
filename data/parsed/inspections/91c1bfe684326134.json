This sheep needs to be examined by a veterinarian to ensure that a diagnosis\nfor the limp and a treatment plan are instituted. Correct by Mar. 12, 2017.\n*Both alpacas are in need of hoof trimming. The white alpaca has very long hooves on all four feet that are curling\nunder and outwards. The black and white alpaca's hooves are also starting to show signs of curling. Overly long\nhooves can lead to stresses on the joints of the leg and pain to the animals. The alpacas hooves need to be\ntrimmed. Correct by Mar. 31, 2017."
