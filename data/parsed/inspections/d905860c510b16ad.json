Excessive matting can cause pain and discomfort. The\nlicensee needs to remove the matted fur. As part of the facility(cid:25)s program of veterinary care, the licensee must\nestablish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all the dogs to prevent the development of excessive\nmatting. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
