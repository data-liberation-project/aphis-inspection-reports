      "narrative": "-An adult female Boston Terrier (OAO2617666/OAO2057825), housed by herself, was holding her left rear leg up\nand not bearing any weight on it. According to the licensee, he had noticed the dog\u2019s condition on Monday (20 Mar\n17). On closer observation, one of the middle digital pads on the dog\u2019s left rear foot had a lesion on it. The pad\nappeared to be lacerated in a linear fashion (approximately \u00be inch in length) near its edge and the affected area\nwas reddened. According to the licensee, the dog was under observation but the dog had not been examined by a\nveterinarian nor was the dog receiving any treatment. This dog\u2019s condition could be due to injury, infection and/or\nother veterinary medical condition which could be painful.\n-An adult female chocolate Labrador Retriever (4B5D1F5F16) had an approximately 1 \u00bd inch diameter region of\nhair loss on its left side. The skin in this area appeared dry and flakey with reddened regions. According to a facility\nrepresentative, the dog\u2019s area of hair loss had been larger and had appeared after the dog whelped which was\napproximately 2 months ago. The facility representative stated that a treatment had been given to the dog when the\ncondition was initially identified but could not remember what the treatment was that was given. No treatment was\nbeing given for the current skin condition. The licensee stated that the dog did receive routine monthly ivermectin.\nThere was no written documentation regarding this dog\u2019s condition at the facility. The hair loss and skin condition\ncould be due to parasites, allergies or other veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort.\n-An adult female chocolate Labrador Retriever (4B613887116) had an abnormal eye condition. The dog\u2019s left eye\nappeared slightly larger than the right eye. The left eye appeared mostly dilated with very little of the iris visible. A\nline of clear discharge was observed in the corner of the dog\u2019s left eye extending down the dog\u2019s nose toward the\nmouth. The part of the eye that is normally white was slightly reddened with several vessels compared to the right\neye. There appeared to be a portion of a large spherical-like object (possibly a displaced lens) within the eye and a\nsmall section of a bright reflection visible from within the top portion of the eye. According to the licensee, a\nveterinarian had last examined the dog around November 2016. There was no written documentation of the dog\u2019s\ncurrent eye condition. This dog\u2019s eye condition could be due to injury, mass and/or other veterinary medical\ncondition which could be painful and/or lead to blindness.\nThe licensee must have the female Boston Terrier (OAO2617666/OAO2057825) and the female chocolate Labrador\nRetriever (4B613887116) examined by a veterinarian. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian\nregarding the condition of the female chocolate Labrador Retriever (4B5D1F5F16). These veterinary examinations\nand the consultation are in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and that appropriate treatment plans\nare developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and provide it to the inspector upon\nrequest. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
