      "narrative": "Female, tan and white Corgi (\"Montana\" DOB 1-04) with chip number 070 156 111 was lying quietly in the\nenclosure and appeared reluctant to move. Her body condition is very thin with the vertebrae, spines of the\nscapulae, and points of the hips easily palpated. The spine is visually protruding and the abdominal tuck is\nexcessive. There is thick, creamy discharge on the left side of her mouth and lips. There is a coating of dental\ncalculus on the canine tooth and the \"cheek teeth\" (premolars and molars) on the left upper side and the upper and\nlower canine teeth of the right side. The gums of the canine teeth on the right side and the molars of the left side\nhave receded up from the surface of the teeth. Thin body condition can indicate underlying medical problems and\ninadequate nutrition. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone\nof the jaw supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the\noverall health of the animal.\nFemale, cream colored Pekingese (\"Blondie\" DOB 12-09) with chip number OAO2223563 has thickened ear tissue\nobscuring the opening of both ear canals. There is a mild amount of moist debris in the left ear. The licensee has\ndocumentation showing that this dog was last evaluated by the attending veterinarian on 2-20-2017. The directions\nfor care given at that time state: \"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca - artificial tears 4 times daily. Otitis externa - needs\nsurgical ear canal ablation. Gentacin ear mix will be palliative.\" The licensee reports they have not pursued surgery\nfor this dog and are cleaning the ears with hydrogen peroxide. They are not currently using the Gentacin ear mix as\ndirected. They are also using the artifical tears in the dog's eye twice a day instead of the 4 times as directed.\nFailure to follow the directions for medical care from the attending veterinarian can result in unresolved medical\nproblems and prolonged illness. The licensee must follow the directions for medical care provided by the\nveterinarian.\nAdult, male red Shih Tzu (\"Red\" DOB 5-06) was observed to have a wet chin and lips. The dog resisted having his\nmouth examined and pulled his head away quickly. Inspectors were able to see a thick coating of dental tartar on\nthe few remaining \"cheek teeth\". Inspectors were unable to get a complete view of the dental condition of this dog\nbut these signs suggest that dental disease and mouth pain are likely problems and should be evaluated by the\nveterinarian. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of the\njaw supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the overall\nhealth of the animal.\nThe animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis\nis obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,\ntreatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\nAdult, female fawn pug (\"Roxie\" DOB 8-03) with chip number 062 578 296 has overgrown toe nails on her front feet.\nLong toenails can result in gait problems and can be painful. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the\nlicensee must develop and follow a program of toenail maintenance to ensure that animals' toenails are not too\nlong."
