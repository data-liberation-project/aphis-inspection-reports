Although no visual contact can be made\nwhen the animals are in their primary enclosure, both species can smell one another and hear the near constant\nvocalizations made by the other species housed so closely. The hyena was heard vocalizing a low growling noise almost\ncontinuously by the inspector while the kinkajou were constantly hissing while pacing continuously. These behaviors are\nsignificant signs of distress for these species. Additionally, the enclosures are located adjacent to one another and are\nclose enough that the kinkajou could easily reach out of their enclosure and into the hyena enclosure.\n-The facility is housing a red fox (white colored variant with grey on its ears and head) in the public area of the pet store.\nThis animal is housed in a pen on the ground that is approximately 4 feet by 5 feet and 4 feet tall. This enclosure is open\ntopped and located at the end of a row of enclosures. Members of the public and the free-roaming dogs are able to (and\nwere observed) approaching from three sides of this enclosure functionally surrounding the fox. There are no visual\nbarriers or areas for this fox to hide. During the inspection this fox was seen pacing while partially crouched and holding\nits ears down and laid back. It also was observed defecating, which can be a stress behavior. The pacing behavior\nbecame more frantic as the fox was approached by a dog, children, and an adult member of the public, and particularly\nwhen approached from multiple sides. The behavior of this animal indicated significant distress resulting from its inability\nto hide.\n-The two coati are housed in the public area of the pet store. There are no visual barriers and no areas for these animals\nto hide. There are numerous dogs that are allowed to freely roam throughout the store and are able to approach the\nenclosures. Additionally, the younger coati is house between an enclosure housing a fox and one housing a puppy with\nonly the wire of their two enclosures separating the coati from either animal. In the wild, coati are frequently predated by\nlarger animals and therefore, they are attuned to the presence of predators and may become easily distressed by the\nsights, sounds, and smells of potential predators when they are unable to hide. These coati were both observed exhibiting\nstress behaviors such as continuous pacing during the inspection. Additionally, like raccoons, coati frequently manipulate\nobjects and food with their hands, and there is nothing that prevents this animal from reaching into the dog or fox\u2019s\nenclosure presenting additional risk.\nThe environments provided to the kinkajous and coatis lack any opportunities for seclusion, such as dens, hide boxes,\npouches, or places to feel secure in their surroundings. All four animals exhibited observable and obvious signs of stress\nand abnormal behaviors such as pacing and hissing.\nHandling of all animals, including placement and housing, shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a\nmanner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The animals must be\nprovided opportunities for seclusion from prey species and members of the public.\nCorrect by 11:59 PM local time on August 16, 2024."

The enclosure is so small that the hyena touches both the back and front wall when attempting to\nturn. The hyena is in constant motion without purpose with various vocalizations being heard including what sounded like\na growling noise. The facility representative initially stated that the hyena had not been out of the enclosure for two weeks\nwhen asked by the inspector. The representative then modified that period of time to last week and later daily. The\nlicensee has not consulted an attending veterinarian for routine care and husbandry, including space requirements. This\nenclosure is not large enough to allow for the development of proper musculature for a growing animal. Additionally, the\nrestricted size of the enclosure does not allow for evaluation of gait abnormalities, like limping, or other health concerns,\nas normal postural adjustments and movements are not possible. There are no additional or larger enclosures at the\nfacility that are appropriate for the hyena to provide sufficient space for normal behavior and movement or assessment of\ngait abnormalities.\n-The kinkajous housed in the holding area are in an enclosure which is smaller than the animals are with their tails\nextended. This enclosure is approximately 33 inches by 26 inches. This enclosure is two levels high, but the floor space\non each level is insufficient to allow two animals to make species typical postural and social adjustments.

According to the facility\nrepresentative, the approximately four to five-month-old hyena is being fed a diet consisting solely of 3 or 4 chicken thighs\nand a bone-in pork chop once or twice daily. One portion is offered in the morning and if the hyena eats it, a second\nequal-sized portion is offered in the evening. The facility representative confirmed that they are not providing nutritional\nsupplements, such as calcium or a multi-vitamin. When asked about this animal, and specifically the diet, the facility\nrepresentative stated that it is their first hyena and that they learned about the care from books and google. The\nveterinarian that was reported as the Attending Veterinarian (but was not acting in that capacity) confirmed that they were\nnot consulted regarding the diet for this animal. The diet is lacking essential vitamins and minerals for for a young,\ngrowing hyena. Diets fed to young, growing animals that are deficient in calcium or have an imbalance in the calcium -to-\nphosphorus ratio are known to lead to metabolic bone disease, a condition that is severely painful and debilitating, and\ncan lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Deficiencies in other nutrients may lead to many other metabolic\nconditions. The evaluation of the overall health status of this animal is significantly compromised by the small size of the\nprimary enclosure that prevents normal postural adjustments, including locomotion. Potential signs of lameness including\napparent lameness in the right front leg and hindlimbs were noted by the inspectors, but further evaluation by a\nveterinarian is needed. The hyena has not been evaluated by a veterinarian since it\u2019s acquisition.\n- According to the facility representative the diet for the juvenile kinkajou consists of \u00bd of a mashed banana, 3.4 oz.\nGerber fruit baby food, and 1-2 mashed monkey biscuits (Exotic Nutrition brand, high energy \u201cStandard\u201d formulation). The\ndiet for the adult Kinkajou consists of approximately 3 oz. sweet potatoes, 2 bananas, and 5 old world monkey biscuits.\nKinkajous primarily consume a wide variety of seasonally-available fruits throughout the year, as well as some additional\nprotein sources. Fruits consumed in the wild are lower in sugar, starch, and moisture content, while being higher in\nprotein, fiber, and vitamin/mineral content than those commercially available. To avoid feeding unbalanced diets, the food\nprovided to kinkajous should include varied fruit, an appropriate protein source, and be relatively low in simple sugars,\nand total caloric intake to prevent obesity and diabetes mellitus (which this species is prone to). The diet being presented\nto these animals appears high in simple sugars and is not sufficiently varied to ensure that they are meeting all of their\nnutritional needs.\nCorrect by ensuring that the diet fed to this hyena, the five kinkajous and all animals at the facility is nutritionally complete,\nwholesome, palatable and prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of animal.\nCorrect by 11:59 PM local time on August 16, 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted on August 14-15, 2024.
