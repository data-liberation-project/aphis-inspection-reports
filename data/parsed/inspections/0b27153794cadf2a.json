A portion of an old deer carcass, straw and other organic material was\nobserved under the access ramp inside the animals' enclosure. According to the licensee, the straw used for\nanimal bedding inside the shelter had been cleaned out approximately 1 week ago. According to the licensee, the\nwaste trough drains by gravity and the excess waste in the trough, on the concrete and under the ramp is manually\nscooped up with the last time being at least 2 weeks ago. This accumulation of animal bedding, food waste, dirt\nand debris increases the risk of odors and disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that the removal and\ndisposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, trash and debris are provided as necessary to minimize\nvermin infestation, odors and disease hazards.
