Evidence of rodent nests were located in different areas\nof the kennel. Rodent droppings were found in at least one water bowl. Rodent droppings were found next to multiple food\nreceptacles located in dog enclosures. One puppy was observed lying next to a heavy accumulation of rodent droppings.\nNumerous rodent travel paths were identified in various kennels. There are numerous rusted holes in the outer wall of the\nkennel building which could be used as access points by rodents. There is an overgrowth of vegetation in some spots\naround the kennel building which serves as potential harborage for rodents. There is a heavy accumulation of feces in the\noutside drainage system which could also serve as an attractant to pests.\nExposure to rodents and rodent waste can have a severe impact on the health and well being of all animals, but in\nparticular vulnerable animals such as puppies and nursing mothers.\nThe facility is using different types of rodent bait stations in an effort to control the problem, but these methods are clearly\nnot adequate. Adequate pest control requires a systemic approach and includes thorough cleaning and sanitization of all\nareas of the kennel, appropriate storage of food and supplies, and preventing rodent access to the facility as much as\npossible. Bait stations alone are not sufficient for the current situation.\nThe facility has an appointment scheduled for their exterminator on 1 April 2025. However, the facility must implement a\nthorough cleaning, decluttering, and repair effort throughout the kennel area in order to begin to address this problem.\nThe facility corrected a few of these areas of concern during the inspection but there must be significant progress toward\ncorrecting the rodent infestation by 14 April 2025.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted starting on 31 March 2025. This inspection report is limited to the Direct\nnon-compliances identified during that inspection. An additional inspection report will be delivered with the other issues\nidentified during this inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nMICHAEL TYGART, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
