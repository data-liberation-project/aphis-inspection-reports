  "narrative": "No non-compliant items identified during this inspection. \n \nExit interview conducted with facility representative.\nThis was a focused inspection dealing with a predator attack (three mountain lions) resulting in the death of two\nreindeer.\nThe perimeter fence has been raised from 10' to 14' and brush cleared back 10' all around the perimeter fence.  The\nreindeer are now being housed inside the barn at night.  The barn has been fortified with additional stock panels\nand fencing to make the barn secure and prevent outside enter, if the predators return.  Security cameras and\nmotion detecting lighting has also been installed and updated.\nWildlife services and Oregon fish and wildlife have been contacted and this resulted in the killing of at least one of\nthe mountain lions.  It is believed they have moved out of the area and no longer a threat at the present time.",
