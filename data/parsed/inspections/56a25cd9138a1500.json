At time of inspection, there was one adult Kangaroo being\nhoused in this enclosure. Sharp, points or edges could potentially cause injury to the animals.\n-Coatimundi Enclosure: There was an exposed and unprotected electrical cord leading to a heat source inside of a\nplastic crate. The location of the cord was within potential reach of the animals and poses the risk of serious injury\nfrom electrical hazards.\nAll enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other hazards in order to\nprotect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals.
