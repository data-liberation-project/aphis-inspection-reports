The\nstudent did not notify the laboratory manager or the attending veterinarian on 6/1/14 about the animal's condition.\nOn 6/2/14, the student notified the laboratory manager about the animal's condition. Upon examination of the\nanimal, the manager noted the following: a swollen tongue, lethargic, not eating, very dehydrated, emitting a foul\nodor, and no fresh urine or fecal material in the tray. The manager elected to euthanize the animal, with consultation\nof the attending veterinarian, due to poor prognosis.\nOn 6/1/14, there was no communication to the veterinarian about the animal's condition when it was noted as being\nabnormal. When observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must be conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. Failure to properly observe\nand communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and the increase risk of development\nof serious medical conditions. Correct by ensuring that all injuries or disease are found and are appropriately\ncommunicated with the attending veterinarian in a timely manner.\nTo be corrected by 10/30/14.\nInspection conducted with facility manager and IACUC members.\nExit interview conducted with facility representatives."
