The facility has made corrective measures to the juvenile black bear enclosure. They have added a\nportion of non-climbable fence and two additional hot wire strands to the enclosure\u2019s primary fence. The enclosure\ncontained two juvenile bears at the time of this inspection, and according to one of the bear keepers, the bears have\nshown no interest in attempting to climb the fence.\nElephants inspected include: Connie, 42; Phoebe, 29; Hank, 27; and Beco, 7.\nThe inspection was conducted with the Senior Vice President of Animal Care and Conservation, Vice President of\nAnimal Care, staff members, Animal Care Inspector Shannon Sebera and Veterinary Medical Officer Kathy\nCampitelli on 8/16/2016-8/18/2016.\nThe Exit interview was with the Senior Vice President of Animal Care and Conservation, Animal Care Inspector\nShannon Sebera and Veterinary Medical Officer Kathy Campitelli.\nThe inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information\nmanagement system.
