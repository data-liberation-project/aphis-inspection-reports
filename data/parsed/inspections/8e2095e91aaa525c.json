All of her ribs and spinal column can be\neasily felt with very little mass over these areas.\nIrina had her last physical exam by the attending veterinarian on May 31, 2016. At that time she weighed 66 lbs\nand her medical record indicated that her weight was normal for her age, size, & breed. On today's inspection she\nweighed 52.8 lbs.\nSince the fleece/hair of animals can mask weight loss visually, the keepers should either touch the goats to\ndetermine if they are becoming thin and/or periodically weigh them to determine if there is any weight loss. This\nwould then then be reported in a timely manner to management and the veterinarian so that treatment may be\ninstituted quickly to reduce further weight loss and suffering.\nHave your veterinarian re-examine Irina and treat her accordingly based upon his examination.\nCorrect by December 4, 2016\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Supervisor of the Animal Care Dept."
