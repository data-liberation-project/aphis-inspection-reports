This mesh wire is detached and curled at the bottom creating an area which is unsafe for the enclosed\nanimal. This is an entrapment risk and the sharp points may cause injury to the enclosed rabbit and must be\ncorrected. All sharp points and loose wires must be eliminated, and all gaps repaired to minimize the risk of injury\nto the animal.\nTo be corrected by: 2 April 2016."

This enclosure is located in the front area of the gift shop.\nThere is a small public barrier around the NHPs. The licensee's representative stated that the lemurs had not been\nmoved to another enclosure for the last 30 days at least.

The primates must be provided a secure, appropriately sized shelter or be moved to an\noutside enclosure appropriate for spring and summer weather.\nTo be corrected by: 2 April 2016.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the facility representative, USDA APHIS VMO Debbie Cunningham,\nand ACI Brittany Light.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLight Brittany, Animal Care Inspector"
