This accumulation was covering what few teeth she had left. The buildup of abnormal material\non teeth can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal. Dental\ndisease can be painful and eventually lead to a decrease in appetite. It can also lead to infection in the mouth as\nwell as the potential spread of infection to other organs in the body. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a\nveterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must document the follow\nup care as directed by the veterinarian and ensure that all animals receive veterinary care when needed at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 12-22-14.\nInspection and exit interview was conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCunningham Debbie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
