The licensee immediately called the veterinarian by telephone. The veterinarian was not available to\ncome to the facility but referred her to another veterinarian who was on call at the practice. That veterinarian\ninformed the licensee that she was not sure what she would do if she came out (she may have not had experience\nwith primates).\nThe licensee was in frequent contact by telephone with the veterinarians trying to get someone to come out to\nexamine the lemur. The lemur eventually stopped convulsing and the licensee then told the veterinarian during one\nof the calls not to come because she thought the lemur was recovering. The lemur died the next morning.\nThe licensee's program of veterinary care indicates that the emergency care will be handled by the attending\nveterinarian's hospital. In this case, the hospital's veterinarian was not able to either immediately come out to treat\nthis primate, or would not know what to do, as soon as symptoms developed which may have provided life saving\ntreatment.\nA program of emergency care shall be developed and formalized to ensure that emergency care can be quickly\ngiven to any species of animal that you have at any hour by a veterinarian who has knowledge of the species in\nquestion. This may be accomplished (but not limited to) having your veterinarian's assurances that he will provide\nemergency services by himself or another veterinarian in the practice, or recommending another hospital (or\nemergency clinic) who can provide the required emergency services.\nCorrect by September 3, 2016"
