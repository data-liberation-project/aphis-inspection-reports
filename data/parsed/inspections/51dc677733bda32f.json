The cat was held at the clinic and returned to the facility on 2/23/23. A few days later, a maintenance worker\nnoticed that the cat seemed very ill and was struggling to breathe. This individual notified the animal caretaker and others\nthat the cat was not doing well; however, the cat was not euthanized until 2/28/23. On the day she was euthanized, her\nmedical record at the clinic stated that she continued to cough and vomit after being taken back to the ranch. The page for\nFebruary in the daily observation notebook has been torn out and there is no other record of communication regarding the\ncat\u2019s condition between 2/23/23 and 2/28/23.\n- One adult goat \u201cAcorn\u201d was seen limping on 5/9/23 but the veterinarian was not contacted until 5/12/23 about the\ncondition. There is no information regarding lameness in the Program of Veterinary Care.\n- Two adult beagles (\u201cRyder\u201d and \u201cBraveheart\u201d) got into a fight that resulted in injuries to one of the dogs. Staff said that\npart of Ryder\u2019s ear had been torn off, he was limping, and there were also two punctures or scratches on his front leg. The\nstaff cleaned the wounds and administered 50mg of Rimadyl. This was done without contacting the veterinarian and there\nare no instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care. When the director spoke with the veterinarian a few weeks after the\nfight, the veterinarian stated that he would have wanted to clean the wounds himself and place the animal on antibiotics.\nFailure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a veterinarian can result in prolonged\nmedical conditions and ongoing pain. A facility representative must observe all animals daily and then ensure a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems\nof health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed.\nTo be corrected by 6/10/2023."
