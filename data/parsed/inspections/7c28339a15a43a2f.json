This resulted in some pigs\nreceiving doses up to 4 times higher than would have been calculated. Multiple pigs were also administered injections of\nthe antibiotic directly into surgical sites in addition to IACUC-approved administration routes. This further increases the\nadministered dose and increases risk of adverse effects, though none were seen in any pig.
