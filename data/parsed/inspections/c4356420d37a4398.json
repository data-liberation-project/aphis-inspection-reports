Kick-ins are an important part of the enclosure fence that keep animals from\nclimbing out and escaping. All kick-ins must be maintained in good condition to ensure the animals can be securely\ncontained.\n***Cougar enclosure (cid:19)has an approximately 12'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is damaged and instead of protruding\ninto the enclosure, it is bent downwards. Red fox enclosure (cid:19)has an approximately 15'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is\nbent over and part of it is no longer connected to the support bars. Also, a significant amount of ground wire is\nexposed along the bottom of the west side of the enclosure fence line due to erosion and shifting of the ground.\nCorrect by: July 27, 2019\n***J hooks above ground in animal enclosures. The J hooks are used to secure the ground line that keeps the\nanimals from digging out. These hooks are protruding anywhere from 6(cid:29)\" to 12\"(cid:29) above the ground. An animal can\neasily be injured by these protrusions by catching or trapping a paw. The cougar, coyote, bear and red fox\nenclosures have numerous exposed J hooks. All J hooks must be placed below the ground line or removed.\nCorrect by: April 30, 2019\n***Many ground lines (the chain link buried under the ground to keep animals from digging out) were exposed.\nExposure in these enclosures ranged from 2'(cid:25) to more than 15(cid:25)'. Injury could occur if an animal got a paw trapped\nor caught in the ground line. The cougar, bobcat and coyote enclosures have exposed ground line. All ground lines\nshould be covered to prevent animal injury.\nCorrect by: April 30, 2019\n***An enclosure containing one adult male black bear does not have a hot wire that is working. The hot wire in the\nenclosure was hanging and not connected to the fencing around the enclosure. The lack of hot wire may\ncompromise the ability of the enclosure to maintain the animals, allowing them to escape. A system in which the hot\nwire can be maintained and checked for function needs to be established.\nCorrect by: April 15, 2019\n***The guide wire at the top of the fencing in the bobcat enclosure was attached with black zip ties and loosely\nwrapped around posts supporting the fence.\nCorrect by: May 5, 2019\n***Cracked flooring in enclosure. The cement flooring in the bear shift area has multiple cracks resulting in an\nuneven surface causing difficulty when opening the doors to the caging and outside area. The flooring and walls\nwere wet due to flooding. Water was seen dripping from inside the electrical breaker resulting in an electrical short\ncausing damage to the lighting. Cracked and uneven surfaces poses a potential risk to the animal and doesn't\nallow for proper cleaning/sanitation of flooring.\nCorrect by: May 15, 2019\nInspection and exit briefing conducted with the Educational Programming Director, Lead Animal Keeper and\nExecutive Director."
