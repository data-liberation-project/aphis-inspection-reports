      "narrative": "A female German Shepherd (Bridget, m/c# 991001000502337) who was nursing 6 puppies (approximately 7 weeks\nold) was extremely thin. Her shoulders, ribs and hip bones could easily be felt and there was a distinctive abdominal\ntuck. At the time of the inspection, she was in an enclosure directly next to the enclosure with the puppies. She had\nbeen moved there a short time prior to the inspection. There were 5 areas of diarrhea (one area was very shiny and\nwatery) in the enclosure with the puppies and the facility representative stated that it was from the female. The dog\nwas observed to have diarrhea for at least a day. The facility representative stated that the dog had not been given\nsupplemental foods or any treatment to prevent the weight loss and a veterinarian had not been consulted about the\nweight loss and the diarrhea. Significant weight loss and the watery diarrhea can indicate an underlying medical\ncondition such as stress, illness, parasites and poor quality of food. The dog must be examined by a veterinarian for\nappropriate diagnosis and treatment.\nTo be corrected by close of business on August 14, 2019."

Shelters are necessary to protect the animals\nfrom the elements. While the enclosures have a roof and a solid wall at the rear of the enclosure, there must be a\nshelter that has a roof, four sides, and a floor. The owner must provide and maintain one or more shelters in each\noutdoor enclosure that are large enough to contain all the animals at one time and allow them to sit, stand, lie, and\nturn about freely.\nTo be corrected by close of business on August 13, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
