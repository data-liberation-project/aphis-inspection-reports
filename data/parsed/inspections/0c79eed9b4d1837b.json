The inspector utilized binoculars but was unable\nto confirm overt lameness or a need for hoof trimming within the running, closely grouped herd in the very large, grassy\npen.

The veterinarians traveled to the site to inspect the animals that afternoon following the inspection and\ndetermined: \"No evidence of aggression, fighting, limping or bleeding noted. No treatment necessary\". However, the\nfailure to report potential issues of animal health or behavior to the veterinarian can result in delayed provision of care and\nprolonged pain and discomfort from issues that may be present.
