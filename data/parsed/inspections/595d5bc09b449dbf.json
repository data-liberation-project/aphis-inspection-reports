In contrast, during the\ntimeframe 10/9/21 to 7/18/22 there were only 4 deaths in DMRs in the same room. On 7/19/22 an employee identified a\nDamaraland mole rat with a \u201cmissing rear leg from a fight with other mole rats.\u201d The animal was euthanized in consultation\nwith the attending veterinarian. On 8/1/22 an employee identified two Damaraland mole rats with problems- the first had a\nback rear leg that was broken, and the other had a rear leg that was swollen and red and the animal was unable to bear\nweight or walk normally. The second animal also had an eye that was swollen shut. The animals were euthanized after\nprompt consultation with the attending veterinarian. On 8/22/22, two additional DMRs were euthanized per the instruction\nof the attending veterinarian due to fight wounds on the head and face.\nAn animal care technician stated that subjectively, the animals had recently appeared to be agitated, and there had been\nincrease bullying and fighting between the animals. The Associate Director stated that the recent deaths were most likely\nattributable to fighting between animals due to some environmental source of stress, and that they had done an\ninvestigation and found that the most likely cause of stress for the animals was the addition of a dehumidifier to the room\nwhich was generating a soft noise that might be bothering the animals. The Associate Director also recently discovered\nthat the light cycle for the room had been malfunctioning, resulting in 24-hours of continuous light in the room. Both of\nthese issues have now been corrected. Continuous light without periods of dark can cause increased stress and disrupted\nsleep for animals, which may result in abnormal behaviors such as increased aggression. Noises and blowing air/wind\ncan be disturbing or disruptive to animals. Animals housed socially are especially susceptible to the aggression or bullying\ncaused by other animals as a result of stress from environmental sources. Correct by 9/1/22 by handling animals as\nexpeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort."
