There are several animals that have pre-existing or new conditions needing care or ongoing monitoring.\nAt least two members of the board at the head of the facility believe the previous attending veterinarian continues to have\nauthority over the care of the animals. At least three other members believe the previous attending veterinarian no longer\nholds that position and have been seeking veterinary guidance from other veterinarians. When asked, the previous\nattending veterinarian was not sure either if she still held the position and described situations over the last month, where\nshe encountered resistance as well as interference from the facility in allowing her to visit the grounds and care for the\nanimals.\nPer a facility representative, a tiger \u201cSheila\u201d who was observed with an abnormal gait has arthritis and a bear \u201cTuffy\u201d has\nanxiety problems. Both conditions require ongoing veterinary monitoring to adapt treatment so as to maintain animal well-\nbeing. During inspection, a snow macaque \u201cKyoka\u201d was seen with a wet and dirty hind end. A consulting veterinarian\nprovided guidance on treatment.\nReliable and consistent veterinary care cannot be guaranteed without a clearly identified attending veterinarian that is\ngranted complete authority over the care of the animals. Consulting veterinarians cannot provide the level of constant\ndedication needed for such a facility with so many exotic, dangerous and aging animals. The facility must employ an\nattending veterinarian under formal arrangements which shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly\nscheduled visits to the premises.
