To date her address has not been updated with the regional office. Not\nupdating the address of her business with the regional office doesn't allow APHIS officials at the regional office\nknow where she is conducting her business activities. The registrant must notify the regional office within ten days\nas to what her new address is. Correct by 6/29/17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.\nNote: As of today, the registrant has not conducted any regulated activity, but she plans on starting to conduct\nregulated activity by the end of the calendar year.\nEnd of report."
