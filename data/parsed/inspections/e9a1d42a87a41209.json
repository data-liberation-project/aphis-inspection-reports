The licensee stated the dog was\ntreated with an antibiotic spray. The veterinarian was not contacted and no record of treatment was available at the time\nof inspection. The dog was found dead two days after this incident. The licensee stated that the dog was found with a\nrawhide bone lodged in its mouth and was assumed to have choked on the bone.\nDiscussion with the attending veterinarian revealed no record of contact from the licensee concerning this incident. The\nattending veterinarian stated that she does not recommend the use of rawhide bones to address dental care and that she\ndid not approve the use of antibiotic spray under these circumstances.\nMasterpiece, an eight year old male Siberian Husky/Pomeranian with identification number 7E10036772, became ill in\nAugust of 2025. The licensee reports the dog was \"down in the back end\" and had diarrhea. According to the licensee,\nthe attending veterinarian was not available to treat or euthanize the dog so the licensee proceeded to use a method of\neuthanasia that was not approved by the attending veterinarian. In addition, the method did not meet the regulatory\ndefinition of euthanasia.\nDiscussion with the attending veterinarian revealed no record of contact from the licensee concerning this incident. The\nveterinarian reported that she does not recommend a method of euthanasia other than as outlined in the program of\nveterinary care.\nWhen appropriate methods are not used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries of the animals it can\nlead to unnecessary pain, discomfort or death of the animal.
