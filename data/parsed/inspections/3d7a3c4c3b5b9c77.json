      "narrative": "There were several dogs with inadequately treated medical conditions. Banjo, a brindle male French Bulldog (last 4 digits\nof microchip #8000), had a procedure done by the veterinarian in June 2021 to treat his ears. However, at the inspection,\nhis ears were red, thickened, full of dark brown debris, and he was shaking his head as if his ears bothered him. The\nlicensee had finished all prescribed medications in June but had not contacted the vet nor scheduled a follow-up\nexamination to address his continued discomfort.\nIsaac, a cream male French Bulldog (last 4 digits of microchip #2359), had 2 spots of hairloss with reddened, thickened\nskin--one on his left neck/shoulder and one on the inner side of his right elbow, measuring approximately 2in x 1in. The\nlicensee had not previously noticed nor treated these spots.\nBlue Raven, a blue brindle female French Bulldog (last 4 digits of microchip #0097), had a right ear that was red,\nthickened, full of dark brown debris, and she kept shaking her head as if her ear bothered her. The licensee had not\npreviously noticed nor treated her ear.\nSandi, a cream female French Bulldog (last 4 digits of microchip #5797), had an ear condition that the licensee had\ntreated that morning. However, she also had hairloss with red thickened skin on her left rear foot and toes that the\nlicensee had not previously noticed nor treated.\nSkin and ear conditions can be painful and itchy and can lead to self-injurious behaviors. If treated inadequately, the\ninfections can create long-term damage and changes to the normal skin and ears, leading to further pain and suffering.\nThe licensee must consult with their veterinarian to provide appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\ndisease and follow-up with their veterinarian when previously prescribed methods are no longer preventing chronic\nconditions from developing. Correct by 8/26/21"
