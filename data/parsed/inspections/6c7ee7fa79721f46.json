She returned to the enclosure on her own about 10 minutes later\nand was secured without further incident. The escape put this orangutan at risk for injury or death if the recapture\nhad not been safe. The escape also put patrons of the zoo at risk for injury by the orangutan. Housing facilities for\nnonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of\nnonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from\ninjury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. To be corrected from this point\nforward.\nThis was a focused inspection of the lion and orangutan facilities.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
