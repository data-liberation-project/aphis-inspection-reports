While the facility reports that wing-clipping and additional provisions were in place to\nprevent the birds from leaving their enclosures, they later determined that the wings had grown enough to enable flight.\nAnimals escaping from primary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm and further injury when they are not safely\ncontained. They also pose a threat to other people and animals if they are not effectively held in their designated\nenclosures as needed to complete routine responsibilities. Housing facilities for birds shall be designed and constructed\nappropriately for the species of birds housed in them, remain in good repair, and protect the birds from injury.\nCorrective actions were already taken by the facility.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nn"
