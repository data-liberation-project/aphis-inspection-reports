Tissue masses can become large and uncomfortable, can spread\nto other parts of the body, and can lead to other medical problems.\nMale, 14 year old, German Shepherd dog with number 944 is limping on his front right leg. The licensee states this\ndog limps frequently and suspects it is a result of a previous injury. This dog has not been evaluated by a\nveterinarian for this problem. Alteration of the gait such as limping can indicate injury and pain.\nThe animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis\nis obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,\ntreatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\nThese dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian by 28 October 2014.\nThere is an expired bottle of injectable ivermectin (Noromectin - expiration date 12/2013). This is the bottle that the\nlicensee stated she is using to treat the dogs for blood parasites according to the program of veterinary care (PVC).\nThe PVC states that the ivermectin should be used on the \"non shelties\" but the licensee states that she is using the\nivermectin on the Shetland Sheep Dogs on occasion. There are no instructions from a veterinarian for mixing,\ndosing and use of the injectable ivermectin in dogs. Expired medications can experience spoilage or have reduced\nefficacy. This could lead to prolonged illness or suffering for the animals needing the drug. Incorrect use of\nmedications can cause unintended side effects. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility\nare not expired, be labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices, and have instructions for use\nfrom a veterinarian.
