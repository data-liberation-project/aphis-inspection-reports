  "narrative": "No non-compliant items identified during this inspection. \nThis is a focused inspection from the NCI during the last inspection.\nThe attending veterinarian was contacted and the sows #1001 and #1624 were treated for their abscesses, which\nhave healed very well. The young pigs with the scrapes on the sides of their noses and cheeks were treated and\nhave been relocated to another barn, and the current population of young pigs looks healthy and well cared for.\nCurrently the staff are keeping better track of the young pigs and treating them immediately when they start showing\nsigns of the facial injuries, and the sows abscesses are being treated when they are observed. The staff are more\nvigilant in their observations of abscesses and sores on their swine population and have worked out treatment\nregimens' with their attending veterinarian. \n \nInspection and Exit interview conducted with facility representative.",
