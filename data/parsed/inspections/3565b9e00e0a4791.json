Her body was\nfound with the head inside a gap at the base of the wall dividing two compounds. The gap, located between one of the\nconcrete footings and adjoining metal base plate, was created/deepened by weather related erosion. The facility\u2019s internal\ninvestigation concluded that the primate's death resulted from the head being caught in the gap. This enclosure was not\nmaintained in an adequate state of repair as appropriate for the juvenile rhesus macaque. Housing facilities for non-\nhuman primates must be kept in good repair, and must protect the animals from injury. At the time of inspection,\ncorrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented."
