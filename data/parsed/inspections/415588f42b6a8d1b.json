      "narrative": "This inspection was a focused inspection to verify correction of items previously documented as non-compliant\nduring the previous USDA inspection on April 11 2017. The facility has not yet corrected deficiencies previously\ncited under 2.31 (d)(1)(xi) for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide gas. This is a repeat critical\nnon-compliance.\nThe method of euthanasia for guinea pigs in the facility utilizes tanked carbon dioxide gas delivered to a euthanasia\nchamber. The chamber is a galvanized tub covered with a clear acrylic plastic lid. A pressure reducing regulator is\nconnected to the gas tank and is used to control gas pressure from the tank to the gas supply line going to the tub\nenclosure. No flow meter or other monitoring device is present in the system to monitor gas flow rates into the\nchamber. A facility manager stated the outflow pressure of gas from the tank is set at 30 psi at the regulator. The\nfacility written euthanasia procedure states \u201cturn on the CO2 at 20 to 50 pounds PSI until no further animal\nmovement is observed.\u201d\nThe described facility procedure for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide gas does not meet current\nstandards set forth in the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition. The procedure in use by\nthe facility lacks a flow meter to accurately maintain and monitor consistent gas flow rates to the chamber during the\neuthanasia process. The use of a tank regulator pre-set at a specific psi is not sufficient of itself to ensure that an\naccurate flow rate of carbon dioxide gas is being consistently delivered to the euthanasia chamber and\nrecommended gas displacement rates are being achieved. Without an appropriate sized flow meter in place,\nchamber gas displacement rates may be too high or too low. This may then lead to significant pain and distress to\nguinea pigs during the euthanasia process.\nAVMA guidelines for carbon dioxide gas usage recommend a chamber displacement rate of 10-30% of chamber\nvolume/minute. This displacement rate has been found to produce less pain and distress during the onset of\nunconsciousness than other rates.\nOverall, methods of euthanasia used must be in accordance with AVMA species guidelines and in accordance with\n9 CFR part 1, unless a deviation has been previously justified in writing and approved by the IACUC.\nA flow meter and appropriate methodology shall be employed to ensure that accurate carbon dioxide gas flow rates\nand chamber displacement rates are consistently maintained and monitored by facility personnel during the\neuthanasia process. In conjunction, animals need to be visually monitored by personnel throughout the euthanasia\nprocess and SOPs updated with required flow meter settings. Retraining of all employees who perform euthanasia\nshall also be done and documented.\nRegarding deficiencies previously cited on last inspection under 2.33 (b)(2), the facility has corrected the\ndeficiencies, Contact information for the attending veterinarian and provision of emergency, weekend and holiday\nveterinary care have also been posted within the animal facility.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Manager of Regulatory Affairs, Director of Regulatory\nAffairs, QC- Microbiology Supervisor and the QC - Microbiology Manager."
