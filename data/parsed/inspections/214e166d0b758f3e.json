It was about 2:00 pm when I observed the behavior and the owners had not consulted the veterinarian\nabout the animals condition.The owner must consult their attending veterinarian on health concerns of the animals\nin a timely manner in order to provide the proper diagnoses and treatments to ensure good health and well being of\nthe animals. Correct by November 16, 2015\n** The attending veterinarian instructed and documented that the facility should be treating the wolves monthly with\nivermectin for heartworm prevention. The facility only documented that they treated the animals in March, July and\nSeptember. The facility needs to follow the prevention plan provided by the attending veterinarian to ensure the\nanimals health and well-being. Correct by November 16, 2015.\n** A female bison was examined by the attending veterinarian September 22, 2015 for a wound located bilaterally in\nthe under arm area (auxiliary). He instructed the facility to treat with a topical antiseptic and fly repellent. The facility\nwas treating it with vetericyn and watching it. The veterinarian also instructed them to contact him if it doesn't get\nbetter. During the inspection the wound appeared fresh and wet with a bright red color. The animals was actively\nlicking the wound as well. The facility had not followed up with the attending veterinarian about the condition not\nresolving. This animal needs to be reexamined to access the current condition of the animal and to reevaluate\ntreatment options more appropriate for the matter.
