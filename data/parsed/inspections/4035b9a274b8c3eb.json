When she blinked, she was unable to\nclose her lids over the eyeball of the right eye, and instead the third eyelid came across the eye, as opposed to the\nleft eye, which blinked normally. This presentation suggests the possibility of an enlarged eyeball, an injury, or a\ndisease issue, and could be painful to the animal. The condition had been noticed by staff, and an annual exam\nhad already been scheduled for a few days later, but the staff did not recognize the possibility that this condition\ncould be painful and / or have serious medical consequences for the animal.\nThe Program of Veterinary Care should include daily observation by staff, and appropriate, prompt communication\nwith the attending veterinarian, or his or her alternate if not available, in the event that any health problems are\nnoted. Failure to consult with a veterinarian could result in suffering and / or a poor medical outcome for the\nanimals.\nTo be corrected immediately.\nAn exit interview was conducted at the time of inspection."
