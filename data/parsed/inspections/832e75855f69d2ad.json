Upon entering the building for inspection, the inspector heard a faint squeaking noise\ncoming from under a metal food receptacle. Behind and under the food receptacle was a hole in the dirt with 8\nNewfoundland puppies. The puppies appear to be very young, their eyes were still closed, their hair coats were\nsoiled, and are too young to move out of the hole on their own. The dam(cid:25)s haircoat was soiled, and she had\ndifficulty accessing the puppies in this area.\nThe pen is muddy. The area is not easily accessible to the licensee or the female dog. The hole is oval in shape,\nroughly 24 inches across, appears to be 18 inches deep, extends outside the building, and is partially blocked by\nthe metal enclosure above it. The licensee advised he was not aware that the puppies were there. He also stated he\ndid not have an appropriate facility to house the dam and puppies at that time. The licensee must provide\nappropriate facilities to house female dogs and their puppies to keep the puppies clean, allow the female to access\nand care for the pups, and protect the puppies from extreme temperatures, soiling, and other animals.\nThe licensee must provide these animals with appropriate housing facilities. The licensee must establish and\nmaintain programs of veterinary care that include the availability of appropriate facilities for all animals.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: Midnight on July 1, 2014"
