The crack appeared\ndeep and extended from the lateral edge across the top of the hoof. Although the pig would bear full weight on the\nlimb with the affected foot, the animal was also observed occasionally toe-touching with the same limb. The animal\ncare staff was not aware of the condition and, therefore, veterinary staff had not been alerted about the pig\u2019s hoof\nand no treatment plan had been initiated prior to the inspector pointing out the animal\u2019s condition. This condition\ncan be painful. This animal was examined by a veterinarian and an appropriate treatment plan was developed\nduring the inspection. The facility must ensure that the treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times.\nThe inspection was conducted May 15-18, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on May 18, 2017 with facility\nrepresentatives."
