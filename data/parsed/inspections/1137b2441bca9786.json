Several\nflies were observed on the scabbed section and flying around his ears when he occasionally shook his head . It was\nexplained that fly ointment had been recommended by the attending veterinarian around three weeks ago, but the\nanimal is difficult to handle due to temperament issues, and therefore has not yet received treatment.\nThis can be evidence of fly strike, a condition which causes discomfort to animals and must be controlled through\nappropriate veterinary care.\n**The wolf hybrid Snow Princess was observed to stand and move with a somewhat hunched posture. There is also\nevidence of moderate staining on her inner thighs and tail. She was last examined by the veterinarian three weeks\nago and is being brushed regularly as per recommendations to address staining and matting, however, irregular\nposture or gait was not recorded.\nHunched posture can indicate discomfort or pain and must be evaluated by a veterinarian to diagnose any illness\nand provide appropriate veterinary care to the animal.\nCorrect by 9/28/15.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Caretaker."
