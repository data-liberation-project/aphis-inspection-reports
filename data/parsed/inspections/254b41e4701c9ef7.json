It was\nafter 2 days that the staff noticed the animal didn't have food and its health condition. The staff is required to do\nobservations twice daily. Both the attending veterinarian and study director were called. It was determined that the animal\ncould no longer be used for the study due to his condition and was euthanized. The lack of daily observations contributed\nto the animal not being fed and receiving adequate veterinary care in a timely manner. Daily observations are essential to\nassess the health and well-being of the animals and must be conducted. The staff involved was reprimanded and put on\nprobation. Also the husbandry and technical staff were retrained on observing the animals along with routine husbandry\nand behavioral characteristics to detect sick or distressed hamsters.
