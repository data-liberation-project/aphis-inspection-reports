The rabbit was\nalso lethargic, kept its ears pointed back, and was isolated from the other rabbits in the enclosure. After removing the\ncrusty material around the nose, the rabbit still appeared to be breathing rapidly. Based on the rapid breathing and\ncrusting around the nose, this has likely been going on for several days. This problem was not discovered by the facility;\ntherefore, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted. Lack of adequate daily observations can delay veterinary\ncare, which negatively impacts animal welfare. The facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary\ncare that include daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being provided that a mechanism of\ndirect and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,\nbehavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The facility must ensure that the attending veterinarian\nis informed of this issue and must follow their plan for veterinary care. This issue was corrected by the facility on the day\nof the inspection. To be corrected by September 12, 2024."
