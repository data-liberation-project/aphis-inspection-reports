The chinchilla's eyes were squinted and the animal's face appeared to be\ngrimacing in pain or discomfort and it did not move in the enclosure the entire time the inspectors observed this\nanimal. The facility representative stated the chinchilla was in a fight last week and was injured and under\ntreatment. The treatment consisted of placing Neosporin on the ears. The inspector called the AV and the AV stated\nthe animal had been examined in mid November but not since that time. According to the Attending Veterinarian the\nfacility representative told the AV the animal was much improved since that time. The inspector asked the AV if he\nprescribed the Neosporin to be applied to both ears and he stated no that was not his treatment plan. The licensee\nmust have all animals examined by the AV and follow the AVs instructions and treatment plans at all times."
