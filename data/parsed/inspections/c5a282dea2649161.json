All of the enclosures have accumulations of excreta, dirt and\ndebris; there is not a single enclosure that is adequately cleaned. The wooden frames and wire on the outside of the\nprimary enclosures are thickly covered with cobwebs, dust, and feed. The accumulations on the outsides of the\nprimary enclosures, especially on the bottom rows, were such that it was difficult to see into the enclosures to\nobserve the animals. The cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this\naccumulation both inside and outside the enclosures. The owner's son stated he cleans the enclosures every 10\ndays by removing soiled bedding and putting new bedding in, but he does not sanitize and could not say the last\ntime sanitation was done. He stated that some of the enclosures were cleaned last week, and some had been left\nfor 2-3 weeks uncleaned. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards and health\nproblems. One guinea pig was heard sneezing, and the air quality within the facility was poor enough to cause\ndiscomfort to the APHIS inspectors during the inspection, despite having air moving through via open doors and\nwindows and the use of fans. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of dust,\ndirt, excreta, cobwebs, and debris and enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by\nensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of\nexcreta, dirt and debris.\nRemains uncorrected."
