This dividing fence is bent in numerous areas and leaning sharply.\nIn the enclosure housing a llama and a goat, the shelter is rusted and damaged in several areas, and has at least\none exposed sharp point.\nIn the entrance to the back pasture there is a barbed wire fence in disrepair, with multiple loose strands of wire. The\ngate at the interior fence line is down, and there is a collection of panels and fencing being stored on the ground\nnext to the pond.\nIn the west pygmy goat enclosure there is an orange colored shelter that is visibly leaning and not structurally\nsound.\nAt the other end of this same enclosure there is a section of fence which was removed from the connecting post by\nthe licensee. The licensee had intended to build a gate here, but has not done so. The enclosed goats are using\nthis open section of fencing as a gate, but this area of fence is not secure or stable.\nIn the south side llama enclosure there is a section of chainlink wire with two connected posts flat on the ground.\nThere is also a broken wire and pipe gate with loose wires near a feeder ( this was removed during inspection).\nIn the wild pig and potbelly pig enclosure sheets of tin are used as barrier walls. One sheet of tin has fallen and is\nflat on the ground. Another section of tin is loosely attached and has exposed sharp points.\nFacility structures that are not properly maintained do not provide a safe, secure environment for the animals.
