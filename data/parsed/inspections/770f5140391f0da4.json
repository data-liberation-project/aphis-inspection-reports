      "narrative": "In March 2019, one adult singing mouse was found dead in an enclosure. The death occurred when the mouse\nbecame trapped between the cage grid and the microisolator top on the enclosure. The investigation of the incident\nconcluded that perhaps a cage grid which was slightly bent had been used on this enclosure. This created just\nenough space for the mouse to squeeze through. Corrective action included retraining caretakers to check for\ndamage to the cage gridding prior to use for the singing mice. Signage has been added in the room to indicate the\ncorrect cage grid size to use for these small active mice.\nIn July 2019, four adult singing mice and several nursing pups were found deceased . An investigation determined a\ncaretaker had overlooked these animals and they were not fed for several days. The other animals in the room had\nreceived daily feed. An experienced rodent caretaker assumed responsibilities for the singing mice. The newly\nassigned caretaker was monitored by the ARC supervisor for several months until it was determined that there were\nno training issues regarding care of these animals.\nIn August 2019, four macaques escaped their enclosure and comingled in an animal room resulting in injury to two\nof the animals. The injuries ( bite wounds ) required veterinary care . An investigation determined that the animals\nescaped as a result of a caretaker failing to latch the enclosure properly. Corrective action has included retraining of\nall primate caretakers on the correct way to latch and secure all non human primate caging types used at this\nfacility. Signage showing the correct way to latch all non human primate enclosure has been added to rooms to\nfurther ensure the cages are latched properly.\nIt shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal\ntechnicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.\nThis responsibility shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel.\nCORRECTED AT TIME OF THE INSPECTION\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with attending veterinarian, facility veterinarians and ARC manager."
