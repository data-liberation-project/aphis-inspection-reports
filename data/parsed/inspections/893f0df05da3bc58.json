At the September 24th, 2024, inspection USDA inspectors counted 12 ducks. The facility sold 8 ducks on\nOctober 7th, 2024. There were only three ducks seen during this inspection.\nAt the time of inspection, a free flying duck could not be located at the facility because the facility had not securely\ncontained all the birds. Failure to securely contain birds potentially exposes them to injury, predation, or death.\nHousing facilities for birds must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of bird\nhoused in them. They must be kept in good repair, protect the birds from injury, and restrict other animals from entering\nthat may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within. Housing facilities must employ security measures that contain all\nbirds securely."

A fourth puppy from the litter was\nlisted on the APHIS 7006 but was crossed off (microchip # 900215006398746), therefore, it was assumed that this puppy\nwas not shipped. On the cage card for that litter, the puppy that was not shipped was listed as having been sold on\nOctober 5th, 2024. There was, however, no APHIS 7006 for the sale of a puppy on that date provided to the USDA\ninspectors.\nOn October 15th 2024, a puppy from the litter (microchip # 900215006398743) was taken to the attending veterinarian for\nevaluation and relinquished to the veterinarian. The attending veterinarian reports that the puppy tested positive for\nparvovirus and was relinquished in order that treatment could be attempted. The attending veterinarian reports that the\nfacility representative reported that the litter of puppies had be returned to him by the pet store on October 10th, 2024.\nThe puppy later died under veterinary care. The attending veterinarian reports that they provided medication for at home\ntreatment for two additional puppies from the litter that were ill.\nA third puppy from the litter (microchip # 900215006398753) is listed on the cage card as having died on October 19th,\n2024. The fourth puppy from the litter (microchip # 900215006398742) is currently housed with a group of other young\npuppies and appears recovered at the time of inspection.\nAt least two puppies (microchip # 900215006398753 and microchip # 900215006398743) from this litter did not receive\ntimely or emergency veterinary care which led directly to the death of the two puppies and there is an absence of records\nfor the disposition of a third puppy. Timely intervention can save the lives of puppies during a disease outbreak.\nAdditionally, the veterinarian that is listed as the backup veterinarian on the Program of Veterinary Care for all animals\nand birds except the dogs was not aware that they were being listed as the emergency veterinarian.\nHaving a backup veterinarian that is not able or willing to provide emergency care could prevent emergency and holiday\ncare from being available.\nA facility must have a program of veterinary care in place that uses appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,\nand treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care."
