Two small children, unaccompanied by an adult,\nwere observed to approach this unrestricted area and could easily have entered the ride arena. None of the\npersonnel engaged in the ride activities noticed these children nor the gap in the barrier until the APHIS inspectors\npointed out the area and the risk.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the\npublic, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure\nthe safety of animals and the public.\nCorrected during the inspection.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee and 2 APHIS VMO's on 3/19/2014 at the Pershing Center,\nLincoln, NE.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHeezen Dee, Veterinary Medical Officer"
