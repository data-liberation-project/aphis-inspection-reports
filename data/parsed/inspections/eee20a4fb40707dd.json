The supplement provides\nessential vitamins and minerals that these animals cannot receive from their current raw meat diet alone. At the time of\ninspection:\n\u2022 The lynx was thin and observed walking with an abnormal gait. The right rear leg bows outward, and instead of walking\ndigitigrade (on its toes with the heels off the ground), the right rear foot is plantigrade (sole of the foot making contact with\nthe ground). The front right limb has a valgus deformation (lower leg and foot angle outward). These conditions are\nconsistent with abnormal bone development. The lynx is fed 2 pounds of raw beef and chicken per day with a heaping\nteaspoon of nutritional supplement. The manufacturer recommends approximately 2 tablespoons or 6 teaspoons of the\nproduct per feeding.\n\u2022 The lion is thin, appears weak and has itchy skin lesions with alopecia, resulting in a bare spot over his shoulders and\nthe loss of most of his mane. While the owner says that she has increased his supplement, she acknowledges that it\nremains under the recommended dose of more than \u00bd cup per feeding.\n\u2022 The serval was observed laying on a wooden platform. The animal\u2019s body condition could not be properly assessed\nbecause although it watched as the owner approached, it would not rise or respond to her calls. It is on a raw chicken only\ndiet and also not receiving the recommended amount of nutritional supplement.\n\u2022 Both tigers are thin, and the owner says that she is increasing the amount of supplement given but admits that she is not\nproviding the recommended amount.\nImproper nutrition can negatively impact the well-being of the animals and lead to various health issues such as abnormal\nbone development, poor coat condition, compromised skin health, reduced activity, loss of coordination, weakened\nimmune system, stunted growth, or poor weight gain.\nThe food shall be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
