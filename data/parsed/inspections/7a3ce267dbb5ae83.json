      "narrative": "- There is a female marmoset housed with another non human primate that is limping on her left rear limb. The\nlicensee stated that this injury occurred just prior to parturition on March 3, 2016. The AV was at the facility on May\n20, 2016 and noticed the animal limping. The AV requested the licensee bring the animal in for sedation and\nradiographs. The licensee had not made an appointment at the time of the inspection and the animal was still\nlimping. Abnormal gait my indicate a limb injury, neurological deficits or neoplastic problems for the animal. The\nfemale marmoset must be examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered.\n- There is a female kinkajou with the distal aspect of her tail denuded. The denuded area was approximately 2\ninches in length and appeared red, swollen, and inflamed. The licensee stated the injury occurred when she\nintroduced the pair to each other. The licensee stated the injury occurred overnight approximately 2 to 4 weeks ago.\nDenuded areas can become infected and be painful. This animal must be seen by the AV for proper treatment of\nthe tail lesion.\n- There is a black and white rabbit with its entire left ear swollen and crusty. A crusty, swollen ear could be an\nindication of the prolonged presence of ear mites or a bacterial ear infection and both are painful. The licensee had\nnot noticed the ear on this rabbit at the time of the inspection. The licensee must have this rabbit examined by the\nAV to determine cause and appropriate treatment for this animal's ear.\nAll three animals are to be examined by the AV and the following information for each animal must be obtained and\navailable for the inspector. Documentation must be maintained for any health related problems and it must include\nthe following information:\n- Identity of the animal.\n- Descriptions of the illness or injury.\n- Dates, details, and results of examinations, tests, and other such procedures.\n- Dates and other details of all treatments, including the name, dose, route, frequency, and duration of treatment\nwith\ndrugs or other medications.\n- Follow-up exams to determine resolution of problem\nTo be corrected by: 6/19/2016."
