The public was allowed to feed and interact freely with the animals while the tour guide was outside the\nenclosures, either not paying attention or retrieving more food for the animals.\nIn the building housing the two Green Vervet monkeys, the public is allowed to feed the primates. The tour guide\nwas not paying close attention to the primates or the public members near the enclosure. One young child was seen\nplacing his hands on the wire enclosure within easy reach of the primates and could have easily been bitten. After\ninitially introducing the group to the primates, the guide walked to the other side of the building to show off another\nanimal, leaving the group to interact with the primates without direct supervision.\nDue to the lack of physical barriers, safety of the public and the animals relied solely on the supervision of the guide.\nThis lack of supervision could lead to physical harm to the animals or the public.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the\npublic, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the the animal and the general viewing public so as to\nassure the safety of animals and the public.\nCorrect by: July 18, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee."
