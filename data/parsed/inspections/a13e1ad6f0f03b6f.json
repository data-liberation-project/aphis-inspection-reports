I arrived at the facility at 12:00 pm and no one appeared to be on the premises. I waited for 30 minutes and\nthen left the facility. Once I obtained cellular service again I attempted to contact the owner for the second time. The\nowner answered and stated that he was unable to conduct an inspection at that time. I informed him that this was\nthe 2nd attempted inspection and to forward me some optimal time frames in which he would be available. I also\nincluded my business card along with the attempted inspection report."
