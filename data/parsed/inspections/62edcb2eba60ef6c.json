This chain can pose a risk of entrapment and\ninjury if it should get entangled on something within the exhibit.\nThis chain should only be attached right before the camel is to be taken on a lead and only under supervision of a\nqualified animal handler.\nThis was corrected after it was observed during the inspection. No further correction is necessary at this time.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the designated contact person."
