The height of the front fence along the road is six feet high and should be 8\nfeet high for bears. The two corners where the front 6 ft. high fence meets the side 8 ft. high fences are not\nstructurally sound as the fences do not join each other directly. The large gap created at one corner has been filled\nby a section of wire fencing about 4 ft. high placed between the two fences and partially held in place by beams of\nwood leaning against it. There are numerous large trees adjacent to and within a couple of feet of the perimeter\nfence that a bear could use to climb over the fence. Along a portion of the back fence and the side fence furthest\nfrom the entrance are so many trees, bushes, brush and weeds that the fence cannot be walked along to check its\ncondition. Adjacent to the bottom of the fence there are piles of leaves. When these leaves were raked away from\nthe fence, it was noted that there is a large gap almost 6 inches high in places between the bottom of the fence and\nthe ground. In December 2014 a black bear that had escaped from its enclosure was able to leave the facility by\ngoing under the perimeter fence. The bear ran into the woods. The perimeter fence must be constructed and\nmaintained so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going\nthrough it or under it and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.\nFences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals such as bears must be approved in writing by the\nAnimal Care Administrator. Correct prior to housing bears in the facility.\nExit conducted with undersigned University veterinarian, IACUC administrator and other facility staff."
