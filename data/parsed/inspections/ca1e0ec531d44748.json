Any of these could be detrimental to the\nhealth and well-being of the animals.\nWhereas the facility has contracted an architect to come up with plans for improvements to this exhibit, there is\ncurrently no documented timeline for performing maintenance on the pool surfaces.\nAll surfaces in a marine mammal primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate\ncleaning, and disinfection in order to maintain the desired water quality. All surfaces must be maintained in good\nrepair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program.\nTo be corrected by November 20, 2017.\nThis inspection was conducted on 3/20/17 and 3/22/17, and the inspection and exit interview were conducted with\nfacility representatives."
