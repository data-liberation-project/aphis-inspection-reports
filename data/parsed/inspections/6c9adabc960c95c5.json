      "narrative": "At time of this inspection the following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:\nNear the front of enclosure # 64, a tri-colored (gray, beige, and white) adult female guinea pig housed with 8 other adults\nwas noted to be lying on her left side with a severely chewed right rear leg, and a chewed left rear leg. The right rear leg\nhad bones and tendons exposed and was being cannibalized by two other adult guinea pigs. This guinea pig appeared in\na moribund condition and was unable to move her hind legs. Upon removing the animal from the enclosure the left side of\nher body appeared drenched with a hairless reddened area on the left hip area. The injured guinea pig was placed in an\nempty enclosure and drank profusely for several minutes.\nAt the request of the USDA inspectors, licensee contacted the attending veterinarian and scheduled an emergency visit.\nThe attending veterinarian examined and treated this guinea pig on July 20, 2022.\nA white newborn guinea pig in enclosure number 34 was noted to have a closed white eye. The guinea pig appeared to\nbe eating and drinking normally.\nA weanling was found dead in the brown enclosure # 1 housed with 28 other weanling guinea pigs, This enclosure\nhousing weanlings lacked adequate floor space. A newborn guinea pig was also found dead in a blue enclosure housing\n9 adults and 12 newborns.\nFailure to conduct adequate daily observations and identify guinea pigs requiring veterinary care can prolong animal\nhealth problems, delay treatment, and prolong distress and suffering. Correct by following the written Program of\nVeterinary Care on file, adequately observe guinea pigs daily, separate guinea pigs with health problems, treat animals\naccording to the veterinarian's instructions and communicate with the attending veterinarian on problems of animal health."
