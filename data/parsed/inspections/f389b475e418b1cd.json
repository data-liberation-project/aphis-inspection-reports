The affected area is\ncovering the majority of the surface of the right side of the neck and is wrapping around on the underside of the\nneck. The affected area contains many open wounds, as well as, a dark scab-like material across the surface. A\nwhite-colored discharge is dripping from one open wound and fresh blood was also noticed coming from at least\none other wound. The hair surrounding the affected area is wet and tinted with a red color.\nThe licensee had not noticed the condition of this fox's neck, but thought it might have been caused by a fight with\nthe female fox also housed in the same enclosure.\nOpen wounds could cause pain and discomfort to the animal. A white-colored discharge, as well as, areas of\ninflammation or swelling could indicate an underlying infection which may have a negative impact on the health of\nthe animal.\nThis fox must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment\nplan. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nCorrection date: End of business on December 01, 2018\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
