On the enclosure above the store, the goats have pushed the 2\" X 4\" wire totally loose in the\nfront left corner leaving a gap the goats could fall through. This area needs to be closed off until this is repaired. In\nthis same area, four protruding nail heads in a pallet ladder need to be removed.\nThe bottom of the fence wire in the walkways between the enclosures is not connected to the bottom board and is\ncurling up posing a tripping hazard. All bottom fencing needs to be secured so it does not curl up and so it will not\nbe pushed outside the board.\nThe ground wire on the secondary elevated enclosure with slopes is uncovered and multiple broken wires are\nprotruding. This wire needs to be removed or covered with dirt or sufficient substrate to keep the wires from\npotentially tripping or injuring the goats.\nTwo support posts for the secondary elevated enclosure are loose; one is entirely disconnected from the base.\nThese support posts need to be repaired or replaced so that the fencing does not become pushed out or loose.\nAbove items to be corrected by 7-31-15.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representative."
