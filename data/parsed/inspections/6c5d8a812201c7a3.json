Specifically, 20 chinchillas in the 22-1 group which were numbered 22-1-1 through\n22-1-20 (including control animals) did not receive any post-procedure Buprenorphine SR for procedures conducted\nbetween 9-30-2022 to 12-6-2022.\nThe failure to follow the protocol and administer the Buprenorphine SR as approved, at the prescribed times and dosages,\nmay have caused the chinchillas undue pain and distress. The IACUC must ensure that all responsible personnel follow\nthe approved protocol, adequate post-approval monitoring is conducted, and that protocols are reviewed and amended as\nneeded with adequate scrutiny.\nProcedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals will be performed with\nappropriate sedatives, analgesics or anesthetics, unless withholding such agents is justified for scientific reasons, in\nwriting, by the principal investigator and will continue for only the necessary period of time.\nCorrect by May 25, 2023.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
