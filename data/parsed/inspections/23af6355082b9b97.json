It was separated from its mother (mare) in an outdoor enclosure, because of its history of repeatedly\nstartling and running behind the mare during the last vaccinations.\nOn 3/31/14, there were 2 zoo keepers present in addition to the attending veterinarian (AV). A keeper walk-way\nseparated the enclosures of the colt and an adult male zebra (stallion)\nThe AV stated that as she approached the enclosures with the dart gun, the stallion became startled and began to\nrun in his enclosure. She could hear the colt running as well. The AV stated she felt the running stallion had startled\nthe colt. The AV then saw the colt, with its head down, run into the fence and fall to the ground. The AV and keepers\nentered the enclosure and administered emergency veterinary care, but the colt died. The AV took radiographs\nwhich confirmed a cervical fracture and other trauma. The AV and park staff held a meeting afterwards to discuss\nwhat had gone wrong and how to prevent this situation in the future. When the general curator and AV were asked\nwhat changes would be in place moving forward, none were given beyond using a \"(cid:28)buffer zone\"(cid:29) between animals.\nThe handling of this animal to facilitate routine vaccinations was not conducted in a manner that prevented trauma,\nbehavioral stress, and physical harm.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected from this date forward.\nExit interview was conducted on-site with facility representative."
