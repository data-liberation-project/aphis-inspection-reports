      "narrative": "A male juvenile hedgehog housed in the \"petter\" enclosure with 25 other weanling hedgehogs was noted to be\nlethargic and not very responsive to handling. The animal was lying partially curled on his right side while the other\njuvenile hedgehogs were roaming throughout the enclosure. The licensee was directed by the AC VMO to remove\nthis hedgehog for closer examination. There was a clear nasal discharge noted and he appeared to have\nnoticeable raspy breathing noises. The hedgehog barely attempted to curl up when handled, a normal protective\nbehavior, and, upon being placed in an empty plastic container, remained stretched out in a sternal posture and did\nnot move for the remainder of the inspection (approximately 15-20 minutes). The inspection was stopped after all\nanimals were observed to allow the licensee to take this hedgehog to a veterinarian for examination.\nLethargy, reluctance to move, and abnormal breathing sounds with nasal discharge may indicate a severe illness\nand should be identified quickly so that the animal can be separated from others in case of infectious illness and so\nthe animal can be evaluated by the attending veterinarian as soon as the problem is noted.\n**This hedgehog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian by 9/21/2015 to determine a diagnosis, initiate a treatment\nfor the diagnosed condition, and to develop a plan for follow-up to ensure the animal responds to the treatment as\nexpected. Records containing information on the suspected diagnosis, treatment needed, and follow-up plan need\nto be made available to APHIS inspectors by 9/23/2015.\nAn adult female hedgehog in bin #43 was noted on the cage card on 9/19 to weigh 346 grams. This animal\nappeared to be thin with a prominent backbone and appeared sunken in on both sides of the spine around the\nabdomen and chest. The hedgehog's pre-pregnancy weight in June was 398 grams, her maximum weight before\nbirthing 5 pups on 7/28 was 533 grams. Four of the pups survived and were pulled to wean by the licensee on 9/7\nand no weights had been recorded for her since 7/26 (prior to birthing, 511 grams) until 9/19.\nThis significant weight loss of 13% total body weight below pre-pregnancy weight along with her thin appearance\nmay indicate she is either not eating well enough after the pups have been weaned or there may be an underlying\nproblem causing the weight loss.\n**This hedgehog needs to be weighed by 9/23/2015 and, if there has not been any gain in weight since 9/19, must\nbe examined by the attending veterinarian for possible diagnosis for the weight loss, including treatment and\nfollow-up plans. Records containing information on the suspected diagnosis, treatment needed, and follow-up plan\nneed to be made available to APHIS inspectors by the next inspection.\nEach dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of\nemergency, weekend, and holiday care.\nTo be corrected by 9/23/2015."
