The avian caretaker was treating these birds for\nunspecified illnesses with oral oxytetracycline. One chicken was found dead in this enclosure during the inspection. The\ncaretaker had not consulted with a veterinarian regarding the health problems observed in these birds or the treatments\nhe was administering.\nThe written program of veterinary care on file does not include birds. There were no observation records for the above\nanimals or treatments administered. The facility contacted a new attending veterinarian regarding the feather loss, but she\nhas not visited the facility yet. The facility did not contact or consult with the veterinarian about the birds in the sick pen\nbeing treated with oxytetracycline.\nFeather loss can be caused by many factors including: an aggressive rooster, overbreeding, molting, mites, parasites,\nbacteria or fungal infections, poor nutrition, stress, boredom, bullying, and feather pulling. Open red exposed skin can\nlead to more aggression from other birds in the enclosure resulting in injuries and death. Birds that appear sick can be\ndue to a variety of health conditions that require consultation with the veterinarian for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\nLicensee must establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The turkeys and chickens listed above must be\nexamined and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian to prevent worsening of the conditions and unnecessary\nsuffering. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such examination and treatments to APHIS officials\nupon request."
