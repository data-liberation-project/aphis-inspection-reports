The group stood near a bike rack metal barrier where each member in turn is\ngiven stainless steel tongs holding a piece of chicken. The tongs are then extended into the enclosure in order to deposit\nthe food in the tiger\u2019s mouth. At that time, the attendant stands back to take a picture of the interaction. When the\ninspectors took part in the interaction, they found that the bike rack fence reached to the bottom of their bust area, a\nheight of 47 inches, about 4 feet. By extending an arm, with the elbow at the level of the bike rack and the hand covering\nhalf of the tongs, the inspector was able to reach the tiger enclosure. The tongs are 16 inches long per the licensee and\nthe length between the inspector\u2019s elbow and hand is 15 inches. When adding it together, the distance between the bike\nrack barrier and the tiger\u2019s enclosure was approximately 23 inches, about 2 feet. The way in which public feeding is being\nconducted by this exhibitor poses significant public and animal safety risks. Even with metal flaps placed one third of the\nway down from the tips of the tongs, approximately 5 inches could still penetrate the enclosure. The tigers could suffer\ninjuries from the scalloped edged tongs. In such close proximity, the public could be injured from accidentally coming into\ncontact with the tigers. During public exhibition, animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal\nand to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the\nsafety of animals and the public. To be corrected by May 17, 2022."
