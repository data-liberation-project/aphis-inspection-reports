Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing skin irritations. Additionally many of the dogs that were\nmatted along the anal region had feces caught in the mats which can cause additional irritation. A grooming\nprogram needs to be put into place so these dogs are routinely groomedto prevent this level of matting and for their\ncomfort and well being.

This ear needs to be\ntreated for the health of the dog.\n*** Dog # C53 had excessive debris in the left ear canal and on the fur around the ear. This ear needs to be treated\nfor the health of the dog\n*** Currently the facility is using one syringe and needle per 25 count of vaccines. For the health of the dogs and to\nreduce the potential spread of diseases, a needle can be used once per litter for vaccines but should not be used on\nmultiple litters of dogs. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs."
