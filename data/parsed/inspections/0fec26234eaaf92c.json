      "narrative": "- On March 3, 2016, one koala was found missing from her open exhibit. Koalas housed with her\nthe night that she went missing were unharmed. The koala exhibit is furnished with trees and other\nclimbing apparatus. The design of this enclosure allows several areas or access points which would\npermit entry of unauthorized animals. According to a facility representative, the remains of this koala\nwere found approximately 300 yards from the exhibit.The remaining koalas from this exhibit and an\nadjacent exhibit have since been relocated to temporary housing.\nNo predator owned by the zoo escaped its enclosure at this time. According to facility representatives,\na mountain lion not associated with the zoo and with a radio collar has been identified on their surveillance\ncameras at least four times during the time surrounding the incident.\nAs a precautionary measure, all vulnerable animals, with exception of some of the larger hoof stock, are\nnow locked in at night. The facility is actively working to cover holding yards in order to have additional\novernight space for protection.\nIncreased surveillance after hours has been implemented and the facility continues to inspect the\nperimeter fence on a regular schedule.\nGiven a predator has been identified on surveillance cameras on the premises since the event, the\nfacility cannot exclude the possibility of another unauthorized entry onto the zoo's grounds.\n****************************************************************\n-The following was noted during a walkthrough of portions of the north and south sides of the perimeter\nfence:\nNorth end:1) At least one gate that is part of the perimeter fence measures less than the required 8 feet\nheight.\n2) Vegetation has grown into or adjacent to the perimeter fence and can be used by an unauthorized\nanimal to facilitate entry or exit into the facility.\nSouth end:1) There is an area where tree branches/vines have grown into and around the barbed wire\nkick-ins, resulting in drooping or damaged wires.\nAccording to a facility representative, the perimeter fence is over two miles in length and is inspected at\nleast twice each month. The perimeter fence log (PFL), which documents issues found and work orders\nneeded, was reviewed. The PFL for the past month shows over 20 entries of both new and old issues\nranging from trees up against the perimeter fence, overhanging trees on the fence-line, and broken or\ndisplaced barbed wire kick-ins. Although many issues have been corrected, it appears there is a back log\non repairs to be completed as the PFL from earlier this year describes at least 3 work orders (submitted in\nJuly or September of 2014) had not yet been completely addressed and/or repairs finalized. A system to\nensure work orders are addressed and/or completed in a timely manner should be in place.\nAll outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence\nthat is of sufficient height to exclude animals and unauthorized persons. The fence must be constructed so\nthat it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from\ncircumventing it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a\nsecondary containment system for the animals in the facility.\nOriginal correction date: December 15, 2013\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative. This was a focused inspection of the koala\nincident.\nAccompanied on inspection by Dr. Michael Schnell, Veterinary Medical Officer\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
