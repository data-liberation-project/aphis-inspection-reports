(Affected animal was appropriately treated and recovered).\n-Sept 2021: an overdose of midazolam was given to a NHP because the concentration available was different than what\nthe infusion machine was set for.\n-August 19-27, 2021: A NHP was given an overdose of a diabetes medication because the newly acquired medication\nwas 200mg/ml and what was used prior was 50mg/ml.\n-October 07, 2021: Antibiotics were at times given to the incorrect animal because the orders were written under the ID of\nits social partner, however some technicians knew which was the correct animal while others didn't and followed the\nwritten orders.\n-January 6, 2022: one NHP had missed its daily treatments of a glucoregulatory medication and liver function support\nmedication and a different NHP received it because the last 2 digits of the ID were verified but not the complete\nidentification number.\nHandling of research animals must be done as carefully as possible."

      "narrative": "In August 2021 a NHP was found to have its hand stuck between the perch and the wall. Staff removed it and it was\ntreated by staff veterinarians which included amputation of two digits. Records indicate it was appropriately treated and\nmonitored for recovery. Staff also report the perch involved and all perch fixtures of this design were evaluated and\nreinforced as necessary to prevent further recurrence. This incident was reported to OLAW and the ACUC.\nIn December 2021 an enrichment device had been modified from its original design for use in a non-human primate\nenclosure. The enrichment device originally had a sheath with a bungie to attach to the enclosure, however the sheath\nbecame detached and when repaired it was modified to be held up with the two chains. The two chains used to suspend it\nwithin the enclosure had enough space that a macaque was able to get its head between the chains and then couldn't get\nback out. The facility found it caught and immediate CPR attempts were noted to be unsuccessful.\nNote: The facility reports all enrichment devices of this design were removed to prevent further occurrence and noted\nretraining of staff on appropriate enrichment device usage and device repair procedure/reporting would be put in place.\nThis incident was also reported by the facility to the USDA veterinary medical officers by the attending veterinarian in\nDecember 2021 and also was reported to OLAW and the ACUC.\nThese two incidents involving furniture-type fixtures had a serious adverse effect on the involved animals and did not\nprovide for the safe activity for the NHPs that use them. Ensure that all furniture-type fixtures or objects remain sturdily\nconstructed and strong enough to provide for the safe activity and welfare of nonhuman primates that use them.\nMaintain correct from this day forward.\nThis inspection of the non-human primates under LVSC was conducted with facility representatives from 4/5-4/7/2022\nAdditional Inspectors:\nDAWN BARKSDALE, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER\nGWENDALYN MAGINNIS, Nonhuman Primate Species SpecialistEnd Section"
