The river otter exhibit\nis constructed of a cement wall that varies in height due to the topography of the land that it is on. There is an\napproximately 2' tall chain link fence secured to the top of the wall. There are areas of the barrier that are of\ninsufficient height to ensure the safety of the animal. There are no additional barriers or personnel present to keep\nthe public from gaining access into the exhibit.\nA correction date of October 1, 2017 was given. This item remains uncorrected. The situation remains the same.\nThe height of the exhibit wall is not a sufficient barrier between the animal and the general viewing public to assure\nthe safety of the animal and the public. This will need to be addressed."
