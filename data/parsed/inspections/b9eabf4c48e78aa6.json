      "narrative": "The facility received a male Indian rhino (ID# 121021) last fall. The rhino was housed all winter in the rhino barn adjacent\nto the females. He was then introduced to the females in a smaller pasture prior to the group moving to the large pasture\non May 11, 2022 where the herd of one male and two females Bactrian camels lived. The male rhino lived in the pasture\nwithout incident as reported by the facility for two weeks, when they came in to find the male Bactrian camel (ID# 109040)\ndead on May 25, 2022. Pathology report indicated a 4 cm laceration on ventral right neck at thoracic inlet, tearing of\nmultiple large veins, and death due to suspected exsanguination from this laceration.\nIndian male rhinos become aggressive during a premating phase of breeding.\nWhile another male rhino may understand the social cues and have methods to submit, avoid or evade a dominant male\nin breeding, a male from another species (such as the male Bactrian camel) may not. Male Bactrian camels can also be\nhighly aggressive and dominant when they are in rut which is documented March-April. Male Bactrian camels rely on\nsocial cues to deter competitors. In the wild, the home ranges of these two species do not overlap, therefore, they may be\nunlikely to understand normal species specific social cues which have evolved to prevent conflict. Additionally, this rhino\nhad previously not lived with a camel, again, making it unlikely they would understand social cues. As these are two very\ndifferent species of ungulates, their social and behavioral cues do not coincide, and the camel did not have an effective\nmanner to evade the male rhino and so the injury was likely caused by the rhino.\n*** Records indicated that during 2021 and 2022, at least 5 male deer approximately 6-8 years of age were found dead\nfrom causes resulting from traumatic injuries as indicated in pathology reports. These deaths included:\n- Male Bactrian deer ID# 114090: This 7-year-old male was found dead in the water of a pond on 9/18/2021 and had no\nprior medical concerns. Necropsy showed 30-50 liters of blood in the pleural cavity (around the lungs), clotted blood within\nthe lungs, rhabdomyolysis and edema of the muscles, and hemorrhage and swelling within the spinal cord. The cause of\ndeath was attributed to exertional myopathy and trauma.\n- Male Bactrian deer ID# 114050: This 7-year-old male was euthanized on 10/11/2021 after being found severely injured.\nNecropsy findings showed that there was a deep puncture wound to the right lateral chest which penetrated the chest\ncavity, a partial rupture of the attachment of the triceps including a torn muscle, hemorrhage into the chest cavity and\npericardia! sac (around the heart). These findings are consistent with severe traumatic injury.\n- Male Pere David's deer ID# 114016: This 7-year-old male was found dead in the pasture on 6/23/2021. The prior day he\nwas in rut and observed chasing other males in the same enclosure. Necropsy showed swelling, bruising, and necrotic\ntissue in the neck and hemorrhage in the lungs and heart.\nMale Pere David's deer ID# 113030: This 8-year-old male was found dead 7/6/2021. The prior day he was noted to have\nappeared bright, alert, and reactive. It was noted that this was during the breeding season when males are in rut.\nNecropsy results showed a puncture wound to the right lower neck with significant areas of bruising, hemorrhage, and\nsubcutaneous emphysema (accumulation of air under the skin) in the shoulder, neck, face, and large areas in the right\nchest. The jugular vein had been lacerated and there were areas of hemorrhage in the lungs. Death was attributed to\ntrauma.\n-Male Pere David's deer ID# 116008: This 6-year-old male was found in a lake in the pasture on 6/29/2022. Necropsy\nresults showed extensive bruising and hemorrhage over the left face, neck, shoulder, and chest, hemorrhage into the\nchest cavity, 500-800 ml of hemorrhagic pericardia! effusion (around the heart), broken incisors and lacerations to the\nlower lip, and little to no food in the gastrointestinal system. The cause of death was not definitive though findings showed\nboth trauma and anorexia, insufficient food consumption.\nMale Sichuan takin ID# 115006: This 7-year-old male was found dead in the pasture on 6/23/22. Necropsy results\nshowed a large wound to the lower abdomen with a penetrating puncture into the abdominal cavity. There was severe\ncellulitis and hemorrhage around the puncture site and approximately a foot of intestine entrapped.\nCurrently the facility maintains herds of Bactrian deer (30 males and 38 females), a bachelor herd of 16 Bactrian deer,\nPere David's Deer {21 males and 51 females) and Takin (23 males to 26 females). These groups of animals are housed\nin similar large open pastures with varying topographic features. Both deer species are known to enter a breeding period\nseasonally known as \"rut\" in which males often fight for dominance and the ability to breed with females.\nWhile establishing dominance during rut, both species are known to fight and left unchecked these fights can lead to\ntraumatic injuries and death. Fighting can also occur at other times of the year as dominant males fight to guard feeding\nareas or other preferred areas of pastures. The facility states that the area is large enough for the animals to avoid or\nescape from each other and there is variable terrain with the hills, however there are limited visual barriers within most\npastures.\nAdditionally, there may be no easy access to alternate pastures for subordinate males to retreat to after dominance is\nestablished which would allow them to evade or avoid now dominant established males who are actively breeding\nfemales. Access to different pastures is managed by the facility at their discretion.\nThe facility confirmed that the deaths of hoof stock in the 2021 and 2022 were typical and consistent with observations\nfrom prior years. Facility staff must ensure that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and\nintervene to ensure adequate separation when incompatibility arises. The inclusion of visual barriers and/or safe retreat\nareas for subordinate males may help increase compatibility during times of the year when breeding behaviors are\nexpected to increase competition between adult males, however, close observation of animals and intervention is\nnecessary to ensure that animals are not housed with or near other animals that interfere with their health or cause them\ndiscomfort and/or death.\nFailure to ensure adequate separation of incompatible animals can result in behavioral stress, injuries, unnecessary\nsuffering, and death. Correct no later than 9/20/22 by ensuring that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are\ncompatible and that they do not interfere with the heath of other animals and/or cause discomfort.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nANDREA D AMBROSIO, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOR n"
