The laceration closest to the tail base spans the\nwidth of the tail, measuring 1-inch wide and 0.5-inch long, and exposes deeper underlying tissue with adjacent dark skin;\nthere is minimal discharge present. The other laceration, measuring 0.5-inch wide and 1-inch long, is a more superficial\nlaceration that is similarly surrounded by dark skin but has no discharge present. A facility representative stated the\nlameness had been identified on Saturday, March 1, 2025, at which point the dog was immediately moved to separate\nhousing for monitoring. The facility's written Program of Veterinary Care, however, does not provide guidance for\nmonitoring or managing lameness nor wound care, nor was the veterinarian contacted for guidance.\nAs lameness of this nature is a sign of pain, and as open wounds may require thorough assessment and care, failure to\nseek care or establishing guidance for addressing these issues may result in unnecessarily prolonged pain or other\nmedical risks. The facility must assure these injuries are addressed by a veterinarian and, going forward, must continue to\nmaintain appropriate methods for diagnosing and treating medical problems. At the time of inspection, the facility\nrepresentative notified the Attending Veterinarian and confirmed with the inspector that a plan for care of these injuries\nwas arranged.\nCorrect by end of day, March 5, 2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
