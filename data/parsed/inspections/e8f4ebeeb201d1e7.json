A\nreview of the January 2015 room log indicated that humidity had been below 20% every day of the month to date (3\nweeks). A paper posted at the room boldly showed the target humidity to be 40% with a range of 30 to 70%. Indoor\nhousing facilities as defined in 9CFR section 1.1 must be capable of maintaining humidity levels of 30 to 70%. Due\nto the small size of these animals, and their native habitat, a 20% relative humidity is not consistent with a level that\nensures the health and well-being of the animals housed and is not consistent with generally accepted professional\nand husbandry practices. Failure to provide appropriate humidity can result in the development of clinical signs\nincluding coughing, dehydration, and nose-bleeds. While the facility is currently monitoring for these signs,\nintervention would only be provided after the animal had felt the effects related to low humidity. Indoor housing\nfacilities for non-human primates must maintain the relative humidity at a level that ensures the health and\nwell-being of the animals as directed by the attending veterinarian.

      "narrative": "Five of the 34 primary enclosures for macaques at location 13 had perches added to them for enrichment. These\nextra perches (each cage had a fixed perch) were hung by four(4) chains. Two(2) chains on one end of the perch\nwere 7 links long and the two on the other end were 13 links long. Each link was approximately one inch in length.\nOne of the perches had been flipped over by the primate so that the chains crossed and created four triangular\nholes. The triangles on the 13 link side were large enough to accommodate the head of the primate. All four\ntriangles could accommodate an appendage and might cause entrapment if the perch was flipped again. This\nfacility had two primate deaths that appeared to be by strangulation in chains and were confirmed as asphyxiation\non necropsy. Both of these deaths were reported to OLAW. The first was closed with them 15 January 2014 and the\nsecond was closed with OLAW 26 September 2014. Based on this experience, the facility took measures to remove\nor redesign chain structures in or on primate cages. Long chains were removed or covered in PVC pipe throughout\nthe facility but the Five(5) perches supported by chains at location 13 were not removed or modified. Primary\nenclosures for non-human primates must be constructed and maintained in a manner so that they adequately\nprotect the animals from injury. While enrichment is important for the behavioral health of primates, chains that can\nform loops are known to cause injury to appendages and death by strangulation. Although the facility recognized\nthe ongoing risk of chains, they failed to identify potentially hazardous chains in all housing areas for NHPs. The\nfacility removed all identified potentially hazardous chain devices at the time of inspection. Additionally the facility\nmust ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained in a manner to prevent injury to the animals from this point\nforward.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representatives and the IACUC Chair.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMcfadden Gloria, Veterinary Medical Officer"
