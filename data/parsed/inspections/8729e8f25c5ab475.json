      "narrative": "During a recent visit to the zoo by an APHIS official, the African elephant was observed without her handler\nimmediately available when the public was present in the zoo. The elephant was contained in her enclosure on the\nback side of the elephant barn. The keeper was reported to have been in the barn however there are no windows\nor other openings within the wall of the barn to visualize the elephant when she is positioned on the south facing\nwall of the barn. The barrier between the elephant and the public consists of either single strand electric wire\nfencing or areas of livestock panel/gates that are not structurally strong enough to contain the adult elephant should\nshe choose to get out of her area and into the public areas. The facility must ensure that the handler is with the\nelephant at all times when the facility is open or choose to construct a primary enclosure that will adequately contain\nthe elephant.\nThe public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of animals. This\nincludes camels, sheep, goats, muntjac deer, fallow deer, bongo, llama, giraffe, sitatunga, oryx, zebra, and kudu.\nThese animals are housed in the walk through area of the zoo which is open to the public. Additionally, two\ntemporary pens were set up on two grassy sections of the zoo grounds to allow public interaction with a young\ncamel and young goats. There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are\nencouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate and coin feeders are located throughout the facility. Also, inspectors\nnoted members of the public picking grass from the facility grounds and feeding it to the fallow deer. There are no\nattendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals.\nPrimary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch\nthe animals. Unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must\nensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between\nthe animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing\nbarriers to prevent public contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are\npresent at each of these locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals."
