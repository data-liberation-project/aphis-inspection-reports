The presence of exposed or inappropriately\nplaced wiring material may lead to animals being trapped or injured. These areas must be identified, kept in good\nrepair and maintained to protect the animals and prevent injury to limbs and keep them from being entrapped\nbetween flooring/wiring materials.\nMule deer enclosure: The shelter structure located in the southeast corner of the pen had an approximately 2.5 ft\nlong X 3/4 inch wide gap in the corrugated metal sheeting on the shelter'(cid:25)s west wall. The gapping in the metal\ncreated sharp, protruding edges along its length. Failure to maintain primary enclosures in good repair may lead to\ninjury to the deer, including puncture wounds from sharp edges and trapping limbs or antlers in holes or gaps.
