She exhibited a\nslower and irregular gait compared to the other mouflon with her and had a head bob. In addition, there appeared to\nbe an irregularly shaped dark area of her haircoat, possibly including a wound, on her left side mid body about 6in\nlong and 2 in wide. The facility representatives stated this was a new issue to them.\n*One highly pregnant female camel appeared to be having difficulty breathing. Her breathing was highly audible and\nlabored. She kept her neck and head fully extended during the inspection. Severe swelling was noted in her\nfacial/head area along with swelling of her lower limbs especially her feet. The white area of her left eye showed\nsome reddened enlarged blood vessels.The only veterinary documentation for this camel was a notation from a vet\nvisit on 12-2-14 that she was doing well with nutritional management and was pregnant.\n*One female camel who gave birth approximately one week ago has been seperated from her calf due to swelling of\nher udder. The facility representative stated when asked that the vet has not seen her or been contacted about her\nbut that the swelling has gone down considerably since they seperated them. The cria appeared healthy.\n*One black and white llama was noted to have a whitish light bluish colored eyeball on its right side. The facility\nrepresenative stated this was an old injury that has healed. No veterinary documentation was available to review.\nThe facility representatives stated that the attending veterinarian was due out at the facility on 3/18/15 for a routine\nvisit. A veterinarian needs to be consulted for all abnormalities noted regarding the animals to ensure proper\ndiagnosis and treatment. Even though this is a repeat non-compliant item, these animals need to be seen by a\nveterinarian by COB on 3/18/15. This is a Direct citation.\nThe following drugs were noted to be expired in the refrigerator, the drug cabinet and the drug/treatment box:\n*Two bottles of Succinylcholine 100mg/ml injectable expired 5/6/14.\n*One bottle of Selenium Vitamin E (B-D-SE) injectable expired 5/2014.\n*One bottle of Oxytocin injectable expired Mar. 2014.\n*One bottle of High Level Vitamin B Complex 250 ml injectable expired 12/14.\n*One bottle of Agrimectin expired 6/14.\n*One bottle of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim tablets expired 10/14.\nThe use of expired drugs is not considered appropriate veterinary care as the drugs may no longer be effective. All\nmedications used must be in date and effective. Expired medications should be disposed of or stored seperately\nfrom in date medications.This is an indirect citation."

The current method of administering chemical restraint does not include the monitoring of vital\nfunctions and supportive care in the event the animal experiences respiratory distress. It is unclear in the PVC if the\nuse of succinyl-choline should be used in combination with xylazine. However, the use of paralytics such as\nsuccinyl-choline without anesthesia or analgesia is not within the established standards of veterinary care.\nThe licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the availability of appropriate\nguidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia,\nanalgesia, and tranquilization. Providing the authority to use paralytic drugs for immobilization without\nadministration of anesthetic drugs, additional supportive care, and the equipment to provide for ventilation in the\nevent of respiratory paralysis is not considered adequate veterinary care. This lack of adequate care can\ncompromise the health of these animals and is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and /\nor death. Correct by working with your attending veterinarian to ensure that there is appropriate guidance on the use\nof succinyl-choline for restraint. This guidance must be incorporated into the written program of veterinary care to\ninclude the equipment and methods for monitoring and providing emergency care to ensure animals under such\nchemical restrain do not experience unnecessary pain or distress.
