      "narrative": "***There was an approximately 6 years old male Shih Tzu (#00070C34D8), \"Willie\", with matted fur and a dental\ncondition. The dog had fur that was matted over most of its entire body. A large mat appeared to encompass the\ndog's entire back from the nape of his neck to the base of his tail and extended just over the sides of the animal.\nThe skin could not be observed over the back. Several various sized wadded-like mats were also present along the\ndog's abdomen, chest, legs and paws. An approximately 3 inch long rope-like mat was observed hanging down\nfrom the inside of the dog's right rear leg. Another large wadded-like mat was closely adhered to the skin and\ncovered much of the dog's left rear foot. This dog was included on the reports for the inspections conducted on\nFebruary 10, 2015 and February 17, 2015. During the February 10th inspection the dog was noted with an\n\"unusual slow gait and slow movements\". Written documentation dated 2/17/15 from a veterinarian stated that a\n\"routine check\" was performed on the dog and included that the dog needed \"to be cleaned up and change dog\nfood\". According to a facility representative, the dog food had been changed but the dog had not been bathed or\ngroomed. Matted fur can increase the risk of pain, discomfort and skin sores and it does not provide the insulation\nfor the animal as intended. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed. Upon observation of the dog's mouth,\nmost of the teeth had a heavy build-up of yellowish brown to dark brown to black material on the teeth. This\nabnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the cheek teeth and extended into the gum line. The gums\nappeared reddened, swollen and had receded along some of these teeth. On the right side of the dog's mouth,\nthere was a linear band of whitish grey material noted above the canine tooth. A larger portion of whitish grey\nmaterial was also noted behind the right upper canine tooth and appeared to extend to the right upper large\n(carnassial) cheek tooth. Individual teeth were not easily discernible in this area. The dog's left upper canine tooth\nappeared to have an uneven surface with a crack-like lesion noted on the tooth. The abnormal build-up of material\non this dog's teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This dog's dental condition could be\npainful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal. The\nlicensee must have this animal evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by close of business February 20, 2015 in order\nto ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The\nlicensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary\ncare for the animals in the facility.\n***At least two other dogs at the facility also had matted fur. One male Poodle (#95600008678081), \"(cid:28)Paul\"(cid:29), was\ngenerally matted over his entire body. The majority of the fur had a thick ropey appearance. There were also\nseveral various sized wadded-like mats of fur along his abdomen, chest, legs and tail and on his paws. Another\nblack and white female Shih Tzu, \"Oreo\", also had mats located generally over her body. These mats also\nappeared as various sized wadded-like mats of fur along the dog's chest, abdomen, legs and ears and on the paws.\nSome of these areas on both of the dogs appeared wet and dirty. Matted fur can increase the risk of pain,\ndiscomfort and skin sores and it does not provide the insulation for the animals as intended. The licensee must\nensure these dogs are groomed and establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs.\n***Within an outdoor enclosure, an individually housed female Pug, \"Sally\", had a condition noted along the edges\nof both ears. An approximately 1 inch section along the edge of the dog's right ear appeared wavy-like, dry and\nthickened. There was a smaller section along the edge of the dog's left ear which also had a similar, but not as\nprominent, wavy-like and thickened appearance. This abnormal condition could be due to injury, infection or other\nveterinary medical condition which could cause the animal discomfort. The licensee must have this dog examined\nby a licensed veterinarian no later than February 20, 2015 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made\nand an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.\n***In the ready to use medication area, there was a bottle of Penicillin. This medication had an expiration date of\n06/13. There was a bottle of Ivomec stored with a needle inserted into the rubber top, which provides an entry for\ncontaminates into the medication. Medications that are expired or stored improperly may not produce the desired\nresult. The licensee must remove the out of date medications from the ready to use medication storage and store\nmedications appropriately.\nThe licensee must follow the treatment plans for the animals, follow up on all of the instructions given by the\nveterinarian and ensure that all of the animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
