The employee stated, at the time of the inspection, that he\nhad been properly trained, and knew that the disinfectant needed to be diluted, but decided to apply it first, and then\nadd water, of his own initiated.\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee took appropriate action, suspending and retraining the employee,\nand reviewing Standard Operating Procedures. The dog received prompt and appropriate veterinary care, and\neventually recovered from its injuries, and was adopted as a pet into a home.\nAll animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause physical harm. Allowing this dog access to this\ndisinfectant resulted in serious harm. The facility must take steps to ensure that all employees follow the facility's\nstandard operating procedures and policies when handling animals.\nTo be corrected from this time forward."

The presence of a large\nnumber of dirty cages awaiting cleaning on top of this floor means that there is animal waste accumulating on the\ndeteriorating floor surface, which cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized because of the peeling surface, which\nentraps particles.\nAlso in this room there is a large container - at least 50 gallons, of acid wash that sits on top of a plastic grate. Dirty\nmaterial has accumulated within the grate, and it cannot be adequately cleaned, as the large container cannot be\nmoved until it is empty.\nThe facilities should be kept clean, and in good repair, in order to facilitate the necessary husbandry practices.\nFailure to maintain the cage wash area in sanitary conditions could have a negative impact on the animals, since\ntheir primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized in these areas.\nSteps should be taken immediately to improve the housekeeping in the facility, and the floor repair is to be\ncompleted by 6/19/17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nThe inspection occurred on 1/17/17 and 1/18/17."
