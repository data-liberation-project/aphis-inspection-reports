      "narrative": "*** During this inspection four animals were noted in need of veterinary care. There were no records or\ndocumentation available for review regarding any observations or treatments administered for any of the four\nanimals. The facility representative stated that she was unaware of any current treatment being administered and\nwas unaware of whether or not the attending veterinarian may have examined the animals.\nThree aoudad were noted limping. Two of them (tag # 229 and 504) appeared to be lame on their left rear legs. One\nof them was noted resting the tip of the hooves on the ground instead of bearing weight on the left rear leg while\nstanding. A third aoudad (no tag) was noted running toward the vehicle and was non-weight bearing on the front\nright leg. While standing it rested the tip of the hooves on the ground rather than placing weight on the leg.\nOne young sika deer was noted with multiple wounds on its' right side, especially over the forequarters, head, and\nface. The wounds appeared to be a few days old as there was no fresh blood present. Some of the wounds were\nlarge, up to 2 in by 4 in in size. The haircoat is missing and red flesh is visible.\nUntreated veterinary medical problems can lead to pain and distress to the animals and may progress to having\nserious consequences if remaining untreated. All veterinary observations, diagnoses and treatments should be\ndocumented in writing to allow all employees to know the status of and treatment required for the animals and for\nthe veterinarians to ensure adequate care is provided. These four animals need to be evaluated as described in the\nwritten program of veterinary care and a diagnosis and treatment plan need to be ascertained and documented.\n***Components of the available PVC are not being followed and/or are not being recorded as being performed.\nDeworming and vaccination schedules outlined in the PVC cannot be verified to meet the timelines required by the\nAV. The ability to determine which animals receive what treatments is necessary to ensure adequate veterinary\ncare.\n***The current PVC indicates that for all hoofstock species, except Blackbuck and Nilgai, succinylcholine is and will\ncontinue to be the sole agent used for capture, transport, and chemical restraint for procedures such as exams and\nlameness treatment. During conversations with facility representatives it was ascertained that succinylcholine is still\nthe sole drug being used to immobilize hoofstock. Bottles of succinylcholine were present at the facility. The\nveterinarian-approved instructions discuss the care and monitoring of the animal during the use of the\nneuromuscular blocker but make no mention of the fact that during immobilization with neuromuscular blocking\nagents, the animals remain fully conscious and are sensitive to pain, stress and stimulation. Succinylcholine is a\nparalytic agent that has no pain relieving or tranquilizing properties. In addition, this type of drug paralyzes\nrespiratory muscles, causing decreases in respiration rate that can be severe enough to lead to death if the animals\nare not ventilated appropriately. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities or training to intubate or\nmechanically ventilate animals if they stop breathing. Neuromuscular blockers such as succinylcholine should not\nbe used without concurrent appropriate use of anesthesia/analgesia and support measures (ventilation and\nmonitoring) to avoid the distressing effects, respiratory depression and enhanced risk of death due to paralysis of\nrespiratory muscles. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which are able to\nchemically restrain animals without causing paralysis while providing anesthesia and analgesia. The licensee must\nmaintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods of immobilizing and restraining\nhoofstock that are consistent with currently accepted professional standards of adequate veterinary care."

However, no\nattendants were present in the drive through area when the unaccompanied personal vehicle visits were taking\nplace. During this inspection, the inspectors noticed guests feeding animals through car windows and no employees\nwere noted in the vicinity. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry gate advises them to remain in their\nvehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding.
