The rabbit received veterinary care by the completion of the inspection.\nA portion of the white-tailed deer herd and fallow deer herd and one blackbuck antelope were observed to have\novergrown hooves.\nOne white-tailed deer, ear tag #69, was observed to be thin with fecal staining over the hocks/back legs. A brownish liquid\ncould also be seen rolling down the front aspect of the right rear leg, below the hock.\nTwo white-tail deer were observed to have a thin body condition.\nA large portion of adult white-tail deer were observed to have hair loss. The hair loss ranged from patchy spots over the\nneck, chest, and abdomen to generalized hair loss over those areas. The facility administered medications for internal and\nexternal parasites on several different occasions over the last month. However, the condition did not improve, and the\nunresolved condition was not communicated to a veterinarian.\nOne white goat was observed to be holding up its right front leg. The carpus joint appeared swollen. The facility identified\nthe animal Monday evening and administered antibiotics without notifying the veterinarian of the issue.\nMedical problems must be identified and communicated to the attending veterinarian so that a diagnosis can be\ndetermined, and treatment implemented. Failure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a\nveterinarian can result in prolonged pain, suffering, and even death. The facility representative must observe all animals\ndaily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed.\nTo be corrected by 8/12/2021"
