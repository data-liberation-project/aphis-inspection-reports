Current guidance from the attending veterinarian is that she should be\nnotified when adult dogs are found dead, however, when puppies are found dead she may or may not be notified.\nInstead, the animal care staff (who have significant additional responsibilities) are permitted to make the decision of\nwhether the body is disposed of without examination or if they perform a gross necropsy examination. When a gross\nnecropsy has been conducted, the medical records recording those results are incomplete. The lack of consistently\napplied methods to accurately diagnose the cause of deaths for these animals and complete record-keeping when tests\nare performed limits the ability to determine causes of deaths and implement changes that would prevent the deaths of\nadditional animals.\n***165 puppies under 5 weeks of age were found dead and the cause of death is identified as \u201cunknown\u201d in the medical\nrecords. Individual medical records are not recorded for puppies less than 5 weeks old, instead litter records are\nmaintained. The medical records that were evaluated did not have any recorded information indicating abnormalities\nobserved prior to death and did not include any information regarding a potential cause of death, investigation of death, or\nbody condition when found.\n***5 puppies (CMBCGY, a 7 week-old female; CLLCFK, a 7.4 week-old female; CMDCHW, a 7.4 week-old male;\nCMBCHN, a 6.9 week-old male; CLLCMY, a 6.3 week-old male) were found dead in building G2 and the cause of death\nidentified in the medical records is \u201cunknown\u201d.

Approximately\n90% of the plastic hanging doors have badly chewed edges with dirt and grime embedded in the edges. Some of the flaps\nhave been chewed so much that they are completely missing and the metal flashing around the doors is also damaged or\nmissing.\n*** Dog toys such as rubber \u2018Kongs\u2019 and plastic dumbbells are provided for many of the dogs. Approximately 75% of the\ntoys are severely worn resulting in irregular, pitted, flaking, and worn plastic surfaces. One Kong was found in an\nenclosure located in Building G3, Room 1 that was missing a large chunk of rubber; small pieces of rubber were present\nin the waste trough under the plastic coated metal grate flooring.\n*** In Building 96, Room 6, approximately 50% of the solid-floored whelping kennels had areas of chipped and peeling\npaint and exposed concrete on the back wall of the kennel. The kennels have a nesting area in the rear by the wall with\nbedding where the puppies stay. The areas of flaking paint are low on the wall and adjacent to the area used by the\nanimals.\n*** Throughout Buildings G1, G2, and G3 there are several areas of chipped concrete around the edge of the hole that\nprovides access between the inside and outside areas of each kennel. Some of the chipped concrete creates gaps about\n\u00bd inch to 1 inch in size between the concrete and the metal flashing of the door frame. Areas with chunks of concrete\nmissing have an underlying irregular, unsealed, and uneven surface.\n*** Metal kennel walls, gates, metal flashing surrounding the dog door flaps, heat lamps, and metal grates covering the\nwaste troughs have excessive accumulations of rust and deterioration. Buildings G1-3 have approximately 5-10% of their\nkennel walls, gates, or metal flashing surrounding the dog door flaps affected by rust. The rust on the metal kennels\nleaves a residue on hands and flakes off when touched. The remaining metal has pitting on the surface. In Building G3,\nRoom 2, the metal heating unit suspended above the dog kennels has accumulations of rust on the underside of the\nmetal tubing and on supporting brackets. In Building G2 each room has an outdoor waste trough running underneath the\nraised, plastic-coated metal grate flooring. At one end there is a metal grate covering an access point to the trough.\nClosest to the kennels there is an accumulation of flaking rust on the grate covering approximately 5-10% of the surface\narea.\n*** Plastic whelping trays are present in some of the enclosures containing dams and nursing puppies. Approximately\n10% of the whelping trays have edges and/or corners that are badly chewed and worn. In some cases, pieces of the\nplastic are missing altogether. A white plastic board (approximately 2 inches tall) is used as a divider in some solid-floored\nkennels containing dams and nursing puppies in building 96/97. Approximately 10% of the dividers have deep bite marks,\nchewed edges, and many of these chewed areas contain organic debris and hair. In Building 97, many of the metal\ncages containing dams and nursing puppies contain a white plastic board (approximately 2 inches tall) across the base of\nthe door inside the front of the cage. Approximately 10% of these plastic boards were chewed and worn.\nSurfaces that are worn, chewed, or in poor repair may harbor organic matter or bacteria that can cause illness, injury, or\npoor health in dogs.

Additionally, Animal Care \nhas no record of a tattoo request on file from this licensee and no records of any approval for the use of tattoos as official \nidentification. \nAccurate identification of all live dogs is important for animal identification, traceability of animals, and investigation of \ndisease outbreaks or animal theft. \nCorrect by August 30th, 2021 by obtaining approval from the Administrator for the use of tattoos as dog identification, or \nby using an alternative method of identification that does not require written approval by the Administrator. \n2.75(a)(1) \n   \nRecords: Dealers and exhibitors. \nThe facility is currently missing disposition records for several of their dogs and puppies. \nDisposition records show that there are three adult dogs whose disposition is recorded as \u2018missing\u2019: \n1) CLICEE, 9 months old, missing on 7/2/21 \n2) CLGCKD, 1 year old, missing on 7/2/21 \n3) CLJCDN, 4.7 months old, missing on 2/25/21\n\nDisposition records show that 21 puppies were recorded \"miss\" during the time frame 01/01/2021 to 07/22/2021. \nThe attending veterinarian stated that these dispositions, recorded as \"miss\", are likely due to data collection, data entry \nor administrative error, and will be corrected when dogs are identified. \nAccurate and complete recordkeeping of all acquisitions (including births) and dispositions is important for animal \nidentification, traceability of animals, and investigation of disease outbreaks or animal theft. \nCorrect by August 30th, 2021 by maintaining records that fully and accurately record the disposition of animals in \naccordance with 2.75(a)(1). \n2.75(a)(2) \n   \nRecords: Dealers and exhibitors. \nThe facility is not using official APHIS Forms 7005 and 7006 to record acquisitions and dispositions of dogs and cats. \nInstead, the facility is maintaining electronic records for acquisition and disposition information. There is currently no \napproved variance is on file from the APHIS Administrator regarding electronic record keeping. \nRecordkeeping is important for animal identification, traceability of animal movement, search for missing animals, and \ninvestigation of disease outbreaks or animal theft. \nCorrect by August 30th, 2021 by using official APHIS Forms 7005 and 7006 for recording acquisition and disposition \nrecords, or by requesting a variance from the APHIS Administrator to use electronic records. \n3.1(c)(1) \n   \nHousing facilities, general. \nThe facility has widespread problems with maintenance of primary enclosures, dog toys, and dog-contact surfaces:\n\n*** There are plastic hanging doors in most of the sheltered housing runs in Buildings G1, G2, and G3. Approximately \n90% of the plastic hanging doors have badly chewed edges with dirt and grime embedded in the edges. Some of the flaps \nhave been chewed so much that they are completely missing and the metal flashing around the doors is also damaged or \nmissing. \n*** Dog toys such as rubber \u2018Kongs\u2019 and plastic dumbbells are provided for many of the dogs. Approximately 75% of the \ntoys are severely worn resulting in irregular, pitted, flaking, and worn plastic surfaces. One Kong was found in an \nenclosure located in Building G3, Room 1 that was missing a large chunk of rubber; small pieces of rubber were present \nin the waste trough under the plastic coated metal grate flooring. \n*** In Building 96, Room 6, approximately 50% of the solid-floored whelping kennels had areas of chipped and peeling \npaint and exposed concrete on the back wall of the kennel. The kennels have a nesting area in the rear by the wall with \nbedding where the puppies stay. The areas of flaking paint are low on the wall and adjacent to the area used by the \nanimals. \n*** Throughout Buildings G1, G2, and G3 there are several areas of chipped concrete around the edge of the hole that \nprovides access between the inside and outside areas of each kennel. Some of the chipped concrete creates gaps about \n\u00bd inch to 1 inch in size between the concrete and the metal flashing of the door frame. Areas with chunks of concrete \nmissing have an underlying irregular, unsealed, and uneven surface. \n*** Metal kennel walls, gates, metal flashing surrounding the dog door flaps, heat lamps, and metal grates covering the \nwaste troughs have excessive accumulations of rust and deterioration. Buildings G1-3 have approximately 5-10% of their \nkennel walls, gates, or metal flashing surrounding the dog door flaps affected by rust. The rust on the metal kennels \nleaves a residue on hands and flakes off when touched. The remaining metal has pitting on the surface. In Building G3, \nRoom 2, the metal heating unit suspended above the dog kennels has accumulations of rust on the underside of the\n\nmetal tubing and on supporting brackets. In Building G2 each room has an outdoor waste trough running underneath the \nraised, plastic-coated metal grate flooring. At one end there is a metal grate covering an access point to the trough. \nClosest to the kennels there is an accumulation of flaking rust on the grate covering approximately 5-10% of the surface \narea. \n*** Plastic whelping trays are present in some of the enclosures containing dams and nursing puppies. Approximately \n10% of the whelping trays have edges and/or corners that are badly chewed and worn. In some cases, pieces of the \nplastic are missing altogether. A white plastic board (approximately 2 inches tall) is used as a divider in some solid-floored \nkennels containing dams and nursing puppies in building 96/97. Approximately 10% of the dividers have deep bite marks, \nchewed edges, and many of these chewed areas contain organic debris and hair.  In Building 97, many of the metal \ncages containing dams and nursing puppies contain a white plastic board (approximately 2 inches tall) across the base of \nthe door inside the front of the cage. Approximately 10% of these plastic boards were chewed and worn. \nSurfaces that are worn, chewed, or in poor repair may harbor organic matter or bacteria that can cause illness, injury, or \npoor health in dogs. Surfaces and structures in poor repair may trap, cut, or otherwise injure animals. \n \n \nCorrect by August 31, 2021 by maintaining enclosures, toys, and other surfaces in good repair. \n3.6(a)(2)(ii)  Critical\n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nRecords show that during the time frame January 1, 2021 to July 22, 2021, 71 dogs were injured when a body part (such \nas an ear or tail) was pulled through the wall of the kennel by a dog in an adjacent kennel and bitten. The exact injury \nvaried in each case, however substantial or minor, the dogs were subsequently euthanized.  Although some enclosures \nhad solid walls separating animals from the adjacent enclosure, the majority of kennels in the facility are constructed\n\nusing either metal wire or mesh to separate animals in adjacent enclosures.  Dogs with body parts pulled through cage \nwalls have experienced physical harm and unnecessary pain. \n \nCorrect by August 7th, 2021 by housing dogs in primary enclosures that protect the dogs from injury, including protecting \nanimals from injury by dogs in adjacent enclosures. \n3.7  Critical\n   \nCompatible grouping. \nRecords show that 2 female dogs were found dead from fight wounds, the first on 3/14/21 (CEJCGL) and second on \n3/18/21 (CFHCUB). Additionally, on 5/26/21 an intact 6-year-old female dog (CFGCMJ) was found dead killed by a cage \nmate. \nRecords show there were 48 dogs (over 5 weeks of age) who had fight wounds during this same time period (01/01/21-\n07/22/21). \nWhen asked about compatibility, the facility representative stated that following a fight, animals are relocated to a new \nenclosure. \nDogs injured or killed by cage mates may experience pain, distress, suffering, and death. \nCorrect by August 7th, 2021 by ensuring that all dogs housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible.  Ensure that \nthere is a mechanism of observation in place to ensure compatibility and prevent fighting. \n3.11(a) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nThe waste gutters below the main sheltered housing of Buildings G1, G2, and G3 contained a large accumulation of \nfeces, urine, standing water, insects (both dead and alive) and uneaten food under the raised indoor and outdoor kennel \nfloors. Near the outside gutters there is an overpowering ammonia and fecal odor that emanates from below the kennels.\n\nInside the buildings, below the raised kennel floors there is an accumulation of feces, urine, insects (dead and alive), and \nfood. Large numbers of cobwebs are present at the access points to the drain trough, which in some cases impede \nvisualization of the length of the trough. There is organic matter and debris surrounding the inside access points to the \ndrains and against the wall of the rooms. Around the entire facility are large populations live insects including house flies, \ndrain flies, water bugs, cockroaches, and spiders with cobwebs. According to the facility operations manager, a pump in \nthe system that cleans the gutters had broken on Thursday of the previous week and the facility had been unable to clean \nout the gutters since that time. The accumulation of organic material under the kennels has been present for 6 days \nwithout waste removal, and was continuing to grow. The facility operations manager stated that the gutters are typically \ncleaned every other day when the system is operational. \n \n \n \nBuild up of feces, urine, food waste and water waste provide breeding grounds for pests and insects, expose the dogs to \nunnecessary disease hazards, and cause noxious odors. \n \n \n \nCorrect by July 30th by maintaining a cleaning system that ensures excreta and other waste is removed from under \nprimary enclosures often enough to prevent excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, and to reduce disease \nhazards, insects, pests, and odors.   Additionally ensure that drainage and waste disposal is maintained in accordance \nwith 3.1(f).\n\n3.11(b) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nIn the Buildings 96 and 97, adult female dogs nursing litters of puppies were housed in solid-floored dog runs. There was \na build up of brown organic material on the walls of the dog runs, mainly located near the front of the runs. The facility \noperations manager stated that the floors in the runs were cleaned daily but the walls were spot cleaned with a degreaser \n(GP-100) and hot water daily or on an as-needed basis. The facility operations manager stated that these kennels are \npower washed and sanitized between litters, but are not sanitized during the 6 weeks that the dams and puppies are \nhoused there. \nAnimal enclosures in the whelping building are cleaned in accordance with two procedures. The first procedure, \n\u201cWhelping building pressure washing\u201d (EGS-SOP-PRD-6512) outlines pressure washing and application of a cold sterilant \nin the whelping areas, but does not specify when or at what frequency this procedure is completed. The facility operations \nmanager stated that the animal enclosures in the whelping area are only sanitized between litters (approximately every 6 \nweeks). The facility operations manager stated that while cages and runs are in use, they are spot cleaned daily or as \nneeded using a degreaser (GP-100) which does not have disinfection properties. \nThe second cleaning procedure, \u201cGeneral Husbandry of the Whelping Area\u201d (EGS-SOP-PRD-6521) states that cages are \nscrubbed daily with a disinfectant. However, the facility operations manager stated that employees currently use GP-100 \nas a degreaser to clean cages, but this product is not a disinfectant. The water temperature used for cleaning is not \nspecified or monitored/recorded. The facility operations manager stated that cages and runs in the whelping area are \ndisinfected in between litters (approximately every 6 weeks). \nBuildings G1, G2, and G3 are cleaned in accordance with the procedure for \u201cSanitation methods and frequency of \nindoor/outdoor facilities using the Landa stationary pressure washer\u201d (EGS-SOP-PRD-6526).  That SOP states that \nindoor/outdoor runs are cleaned with 180 degree Fahrenheit water at least every two weeks, but there is no detergent or\n\nsoap utilized in this cleaning process. The facility operations manager stated that the degreaser (GP-100) used elsewhere \nin the facility was not used in the broodstock building (G1, which house approximately 1100 adult dogs) due to concerns \nabout its potential impact on fertility. \nCleaning and disinfection is essential for removing waste and killing germs that can cause disease. Inadequate cleaning \nand disinfection may lead to animal sickness, outbreaks of disease, or proliferation of pests. \nCorrect by August 7th, 2021 by cleaning and disinfecting facilities in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. \n3.11(d) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nThere is an extensive, widespread pest problem throughout all animal-housing buildings at the facility. \n \nThere are live spiders and house flies in the building G3, most abundantly in rooms 1 and 2. Live spiders and spider webs \nwere present throughout this building on ceilings, in corners, in windows, and at the tops of dog runs containing dogs. \nSpider and spiderwebs were also present in drains, on equipment, and on overhead heating lamp structures. \n \nBuilding G3 also has large numbers of ants present on the floor and adjacent to self-feeders mounted on the front of \nkennels. Live ants were observed going in and out of self feeders containing dog food for dogs. \n \nHouse flies were present throughout all animal housing buildings at the facility (G1, G2, G3, and 96/97). Live flies were \npresent in moderate numbers on the walls, ceilings, floors, and flying in the air. Upon lifting the lid on many self-feeders \ncontaining dog food, flies often emerged or were seen crawling on food within the feeders.  Flies were extremely \nnumerous in Building G2, on the walls behind the enclosures.\n\nIn Building G1 live black hairy worm-type insects and live black beetles were present in the metal self-feeders (which \ncontained dog food) which were mounted to sides of kennels containing dogs. These self feeders were the only source of \nfood for the dogs. These live black worm-type inspects, along with live black beetles, were observed in amongst the dog \nfood contained in a large silo/hopper outside building G1.  In Building G2, numerous live black worm-type insects were \nalso present in metal self-feeders, and a large bulk feed container in a food storage room. \n \nThere were a very large number of live flies (\u2018sewer flies\u2019) in all of the whelping rooms containing live dogs in building 97 \n(rooms 7, 10, 11, 13). The flies were observed on the walls, ceilings, flying in the air, and in the drains in the rooms \nhousing dogs. In Building G1, numerous \u2018sewer flies\u2019 were also present on the walls behind kennels. \n \nInsects which contaminate feed can decreased nutritive value of the feed and/or result in reduced feed consumption. \nInsect infestation in other areas may irritate animals and/or can spread disease. \n \nCorrect by August 15, 2021 by maintaining an effective program to control pests including insects and spiders. \n3.13(b)(2) \n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nMedical records are not complete for numerous dogs. For example: \n*CLACJP, an 11-month old male, had a laceration by a leg caught in the run on 01/03/21. The location and description of \nthe injury are not recorded. \n*CMBCDM, a 4-month-old male, had a fracture on 06/10/21. The location and type of fracture is not recorded. \n*CMACLK, a 4-month-old male, had a fracture on 06/04/21. The location and type of fracture is not recorded. \n*CLGCTT, a 9-month old female, had a fracture on 04/23/21. The location and type of the fracture is not recorded.\n\n*CFEDDY, a 7-year-old female, had a fracture on 06/14/21. The location and type of the fracture is not recorded. \n*In addition to these 4 animals with fractures, two other animals were identified in the mortality logs as having been \neuthanized due to fractures (CLGCHJ a 7-month old female beagle with a broken right rear leg identified on 2/3/2021 and \nCLDCAH a 1-year old male beagle identified on 4/23/2021 with a broken tail).  When the attending veterinarian was asked \nabout how 6 dogs experienced fractures during this period, she stated that she had investigated a nutritional cause, but \nthat she hadn\u2019t been able to determine any cause with certainty.  Fractures and lacerations may result from improper \nhandling, unsafe primary enclosures, incompatibility of animals, improper nutrition, or many other causes. \nFailure to maintain complete and accurate medical records for dogs prevents the attending veterinarian from determining \nthe cause of these injuries and implementing preventive measures. Additionally, this lack of accurate complete record \nkeeping prevents APHIS Officials from determining the facility\u2019s compliance with other regulations and standards within \nthe Animal Welfare Act. \n*CJKCGC, a 2-year-old female, is listed on the mortality log with a cause of death as \u201cother\u201d on 04/20/21. The animal\u2019s \nindividual record contains no information about the animal\u2019s death; the record only contains general husbandry \ninformation. \n*CLBCJF, a 1-year-old female, is listed on the mortality log with a cause of death as \u201cother\u201d on 04/02/21. The animal\u2019s \nindividual record contains no information about the animal\u2019s death; the record only contains general husbandry \ninformation. \nDuring inspection the Attending Veterinarian stated that staff is supposed to notify her when adult dogs are found dead so \nshe can perform a necropsy examination.  There is no record of the results for such necropsy examination included in the \nmedical record for either of these two animals. \n*CKHCDL, a 1-year-old female, is listed on the mortality log with a cause of death as \u201cpull\u201d (pull injury) on 06/24/21. The\n\nanimal\u2019s individual record contains no information about the animal\u2019s death; the record only contains general husbandry \ninformation. \nComplete and Accurate medical records are important for the ensuring provision and continuity of veterinary care, \ncommunication with the animal care team, prevention of medical errors, and analysis of animal health. Lack of complete \nand accurate medical records may result in failure to identify adverse trends in animal health, medical errors, and lack of \nmedical care. \nCorrect by 08/30/21 by maintaining records for all dogs that include a date and description of problems identified, \nexamination findings, test results, plans for treatment and care, and treatments performed. \n \nThis inspection was conducted with the Operations Manager and the Attending Veterinarian. \nThe exit interview were conducted with the Operations Manager, Attending Veterinarian, Site Director, Regional Quality \nAssurance Manager, Director of Quality Assurance, Senior Vice President for Veterinary Services, Chief Operations \nOfficer, and Regional Facilities Manager. \nThis is a continuation of the report for the routine inspection conducted 07/20/21-7/22/2021 and contains the remaining \nnon-compliances found during the inspection from 7/20/2021 to 7/30/2021. The exit briefing for the items included on this \nreport was conducted on 7/30/2021. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nRachel Perez-Baum, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section",
