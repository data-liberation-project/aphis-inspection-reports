      "narrative": "A red fox was observed with abnormally increased redness and yellowish crusts/secretions adhered to facial hairs\naround both eyes. The licensee informed the fox's medical condition was a reoccurring issue, and apparently due\nto allergies. The licensee also informed that periodically the Attending Veterinarian (AV) prescribes an injectable\nanti-inflammatory drug to treat the allergies. Both inspectors assessed the fox's current condition and is serious\nenough to require a veterinary examination and assessment followed by appropriate treatment of the condition. To\nensure adequate veterinary care for the fox, the AV needs to examine, diagnose and treat as appropriate to\nalleviate ongoing discomfort and pain.\nCorrect by: September 24, 2015\nAn adult lion identified as \"(cid:28)Goldie\"(cid:29) was observed by the licensee on or about May 29, 2015 and determined by the\nlicensee to have a closed pyometra. The licensee contacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and stated that the AV\nprescribed antibiotics but did not come out to examine or confirm the licensee(cid:25)'s diagnosis. The lion'(cid:25)s condition\ndeteriorated the following day and the licensee contacted the AV who gave permission to euthanize the lion by\ngunshot. On September 21, 2015 the USDA inspector for the facility tried to contact the AV for confirmation on the\ndiagnosis and instructions provided to the licensee concerning the care, treatment and euthanasia of \"Goldie.\" The\nAV was traveling/unavailable and medical records were not available at the licensee(cid:25)'s facility, or accessible through\nthe AV.\nA closed pyometra is a life threatening emergency that requires prompt veterinary intervention. The licensee must\nestablish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to diagnose and\ntreat emergency disease conditions. The licensee failed to provide adequate veterinary care by not getting the lion\nexamined and the lion'(cid:25)s condition diagnosed and treated. Potential life threatening emergencies must be\nappropriately diagnosed by the AV and treated to minimize potential animal suffering.\nCorrect by: Immediately\nThe program of veterinary care (PVC) listed gunshot by the licensee as a method of euthanasia, but did not provide\ndetails on which species gunshot was allowed, who has been trained and qualified to perform the procedure,\nexplain or provide any details on how gunshot would be used to ensure euthanasia is done humanely, produces\nrapid unconsciousness and death without evidence of pain or distress and in a manner consistent with the AVMA\nGuidelines for Euthanasia of Animals 2013 Edition. Gunshot is not an acceptable method for routine euthanasia\nwhen other more acceptable methods are available. The PVC cannot list gunshot as a routine method of\neuthanasia without there being sufficient detail on which species it is to be used, who is trained and qualified to\nperform the procedure and how the euthanasia is performed and in a manner consistent with the AVMA Guidelines.\nCorrect by: Immediately\nThe licensee reported that a female tiger cub was found injured on the morning of August 28, 2015; injuries included\na swollen neck and bite marks. The licensee reported the finding to the Attending Veterinarian (AV), who\nprescribed via telephone medications to treat the inflammation and fever. The licensee stated the AV's plan was to\ncontrol the inflammation and fever first, and then to physically sedate and treat on Sunday August 29, 2015. After\none day of unsuccessful therapy, the cub's health condition deteriorated and died on August 28, 2015. The\nlicensee failed to provide adequate veterinary care to the cub by not having the AV examine, diagnose and treat the\nanimal's serious condition and deterioration. Medical conditions that are serious in nature and potentially life\nthreatening to regulated animals must be examined by the AV in order to appropriately assess the condition and to\nprovide adequate veterinary medical care.\nCorrect: Immediately"
