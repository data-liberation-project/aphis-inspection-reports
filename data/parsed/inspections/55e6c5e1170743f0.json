While the bus was\nstopped to allow feeding and petting of the animals, the animal position herself under the bus and was unnoticed by\nthe driver. As the bus pulled forward to proceed to the next feeding station, the aoudad was hit by a back tire of the\ntruck. The animal was immediately taken to the veterinary hospital for care. The animal was euthanized based upon\nthe recommendation of the veterinarian. NOTE:The yellow buses were not used for any further rides that day until\nfurther investigation into the manner. On the same day, during the next scheduled Safari ride with the zebra bus that\nwas equipped with a camera, two young aoudads sustained leg injuries in a similar manner as the other aoudad.\nBoth animals were immediately taken to the veterinary hospital for care. The aoudads were euthanized based upon\nthe recommendation of the veterinarian.\nThe bus used for the second Safari ride was equipped with a camera that gave a view underneath the bus. Keepers\nhad previously noticed the aoudads positioning themselves under the zebra printed bus. However, the additional\nmeasure to improve visibility of the animals was not effective in detecting animals under the bus. Animals must be\nhandled during public exhibition in a manner that poses minimal risk of harm. The space under the buses poses a\nthreat to animals and subject then to serious injury. Measures must be taken to prevent injury to the aoudads\nduring the Safari ride.\nCorrection: Public feeding of the aoudads is not longer allowed and they are now housed in an enclosure along the\nSafari ride route. Appropriate modifications to the operating procedures have also been made.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the CEO."
