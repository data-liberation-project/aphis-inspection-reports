The facility representative stated he had observed the swellings but\nhad not contacted his attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care on file did not provide instructions\non the actions he should take if they were observed.\nIn pen 49 there was an adult brown and white guinea pig with a crusty area around the right eye and the hair around\nthe eye was moist. In pen 48 there was a brown juvenile that was holding the left eye partially closed and it was\nmildly swollen. The facility representative stated he had not observed the eye issues in either guinea pig and had\nnot contacted the attending veterinarian.\nSwellings in the neck and eye abnormalities can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall\nhealth and well-being of the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to\nseek proper diagnosis and treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and\npossible spread to additional animals if the condition is contagious. The licensee must establish and maintain\nprograms of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\ndiseases and injuries.\nCorrect by: November 6, 2019"
