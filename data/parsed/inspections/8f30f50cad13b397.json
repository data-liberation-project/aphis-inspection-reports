At the time of this inspection, no otters were present in the enclosure from which the\nescape had occurred.\n7 Asian soft-clawed otters were housed in three enclosures, each enclosure containing 2 or 3 otters. The otters were\njuveniles and adults. The enclosures containing the otters were outdoors and consisted of chain link walls, a covering on\ntop, and chicken wire and green plastic tarps covering parts of each enclosure. The otters were observed to be chewing\non the green tarps, and the edges of some of the tarps were badly torn. One tarp had a hole in it with ragged edges, and\notters were observed actively chewing at this area of the tarp. There were also small metal wires used to hold parts of the\nenclosure together. One otter was observed chewing and pulling at the loose wires. Animals that chew on tarps and wires\nmay ingest pieces of these materials, which may result in serious, painful, and potentially deadly digestive problems such\nas a gut (gastrointestinal) obstruction.

      "narrative": "A male 10-month-old giraffe was housed in a pasture that contained a shelter which failed to provide adequate heat for\nthe local climatic conditions. The shelter was an approximately 12-foot tall shed with 3 sides, a roof, and a dirt floor. At\none end of the shed, black plastic was hung enclosing an area approximately 12 feet by 12 feet in size, which contained\nan oil space heater. There were large gaps between the black plastic and the walls of the structure. An employee stated\nthat the giraffe was closed up in the heated area of the shed at night, and that temperature in the shed was checked in the\nmorning and night but was not recorded. An employee stated that the heater was set to maintain a temperature between\n55F and 60F at night. The night of January 28th in Ethel, Louisiana the temperature reached the mid-30F\u2019s. At\napproximately 8:00AM the giraffe calf was out of his heated shed, although employees had not let him out. Employees\nstated that the giraffe could escape from the shed by pushing through or under the hanging black plastic sheet that made\nup one of the walls. At this time, the outdoor temperature was 44.2F, and the temperature inside the heated part of the\nshed was 44.2F. The heater in the shed was on its highest setting and was plugged in. Animals who do not have\nadequate shelter from cold weather may suffer from discomfort, frostbite, or hypothermia. Animals who are young, sick, or\nstressed are especially vulnerable to the impacts of cold weather exposure. Giraffes are especially susceptible to the\neffects of cold weather because they do not develop a winter coat or thick layer of fat to keep them warm through the\nwinter, and they have a large surface area on their long legs and necks through which they lose heat. Correct by providing\nadequate shelter from cold weather to protect the animal and prevent discomfort, and by continuing to monitor\ntemperatures within the giraffe shelter. Temporary correction by February 3rd, 2021, to provide adequate shelter and\ntemperatures for this juvenile animal at its current size. A permanent correction must be made by May 1st, 2021 by\nconstructing a taller shelter sufficient to accommodate an adult sized giraffe."
