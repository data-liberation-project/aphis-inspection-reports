Following the previous inspection, the facility added additional fish\nexclusion fencing where gaps existed and relocated most of the sheepshead and other larger fish from the manatee\nenclosures. The facility stated that three smaller sheepshead fish were still left in the manatee paddock. During the\ninspection, APHIS officials witnessed one of these approximately 4\u201d sheepshead fish continuing to pick at the tail wounds\non Betsy and Heinz, along with a different species of fish that was seen picking at the manatees\u2019 wounds and other\nsurfaces on their bodies. The manatees were seen elevating their tails out of the water in reaction to the fish biting the\nwounds located there. The facility also started feeding the manatees in the in-ground (\u201cmedical\u201d) pool to help mitigate the\nfish presence around the manatees; however, a ~4\u201d grey fish was seen picking at Ariel\u2019s side and tail wounds while she\nwas in the pool, with resultant hemorrhage. The wounds on the manatees appear largely unchanged since the previous\ninspection. While the facility has implemented multiple mitigation measures to reduce the fish burden on the manatees,\nthere are still fish negatively impacting the manatees at this time.\nAllowing unwanted animals access to animal enclosures can lead to pain, discomfort, and ongoing injury. Housing\nfacilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury, to contain the animals within the facility, and to restrict the entrance of unwanted animals.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nJessica Siegal-Willott n"
