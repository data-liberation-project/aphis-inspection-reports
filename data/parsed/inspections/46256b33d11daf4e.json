In addition, the enclosure located just west of the above described\nenclosure housing two red deer also has mud and standing water in the ground floor.

Standing water and mud can attract pests, lead to hoof or foot problems and increase the\nrisks of disease transmission and create a reluctance to enter the feed area. The licensee must provide a suitable\nmethod for the rapid elimination of excess water. The method of drainage shall comply with applicable Federal,\nState and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the environment.
