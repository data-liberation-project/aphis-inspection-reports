There are no other shade structures located within the pens. Animals housed in\noutdoor facilities that do not have access to shade can be injurious to their health. Animals housed in outdoor pens that\ndo not include shelter with enough space for all animals can lead to health problems and competition among the animals.\nEnsure one or more shelter structures are accessible to each animal that are large enough to allow each animal in the\nshelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to the shelter structures,\nensure one or more separate outside areas of shade are provided that are large enough to contain all the animals at one\ntime and protect them from the direct rays of the sun.
