Two Red Wolves escaped from their primary outdoor enclosure (approximately one acre); the\nprimary enclosure is surrounded by a secondary fence (which encompasses approximately four acres). The secondary\nfence encloses a total of four primary enclosures (each of approximately one acre), and the secondary fence is inside of a\nperimeter fence (which encompasses approximately 40 acres).\nOn the morning of November 13th, facility staff discovered 2 wolves outside of their primary containment and, instead,\ninside the secondary fence, an area to which they normally do not have access. An adult male Red Wolf (#12) escaped\nfrom its primary enclosure by digging at the junction of the fence and the dig barrier and either creating or finding a gap\nlarge enough to squeeze through. The enclosure consists of an 8-foot-tall chain link fence which is joined to a buried wire\nmesh dig barrier, which runs below the entire extent of the primary and secondary fence. The fencing and dig barrier are\njoined with metal connectors, spaced at equal distances along the junction. Prior to the inspection the facility relayed that\nthey had worked to correct the failed section and strengthen the junction by increasing the number of metal connectors\nattaching the fence to the dig barrier, both in the section that failed as well as other sections all along the fence. Another\nRed Wolf, a juvenile female, (#15), daughter to the male wolf escaped through the same gap. A third Red Wolf, a female\n(#11), the mother was found still within the primary enclosure. There was no apparent injury to either wolf after the\nincident. The wolves were recaptured the same day and placed, along with the mother wolf, into one of the other one-acre\nenclosures within the secondary fence.\nThe enclosures containing the wolves must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the wolves from\ninjury and contain them at all times. A failure in this could lead to injury or escape from the facility.\nCorrected at time of the inspection, November 26th, 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
