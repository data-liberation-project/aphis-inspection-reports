A\nfacility representative indicated they have the ability to control how much water is released during flood irrigation of\nprimary enclosures. Nearly the entirety of the enclosure for the alpacas was covered in standing water approximately 12\ninches deep minimum in most parts. There was one dry area of ground with no shade or shelter approximately 14 feet x\n14 feet in size that had a smaller cement pad for hay and feedstuff. The animals were observed to walk through and stand\nin standing water in order to access shade, shelter, food or drinking water.\nApproximately 1/3 of the surface area of the enclosure for the fallow deer was covered in muddy water approximately 6\ninches deep in a patchy and marshy pattern. Due to the irregular collection of water on the ground, the animals were\nobserved to walk through and stand in standing water in order to access shade, shelter, food or drinking water. A majority\nof the water soaked into the ground when inspected in the afternoon of the next day, for both enclosures. The attending\nveterinarian indicated the facility has not observed hoof issues related to flood irrigation of enclosures in these animals.\nAnimals that do not have access to dry areas or must wade through water to access resources may experience\ndiscomfort, distress or medical issues related to prolonged contact with standing water. A suitable method shall be\nprovided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The method of drainage shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local\nlaws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the environment.\nCorrect by 7 November 2024."
