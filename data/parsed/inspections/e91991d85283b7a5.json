The giraffe\u2019s head and neck were stuck under a lower horizontal bar on the catwalk railing,\naround a wall, and caught above a horizontal bar on the catwalk railing on the other side of the wall. The giraffe was\nsedated by the zoo veterinarian to free the animal from the railing. The giraffe died shortly after he was freed.\nPlywood has since been installed along the catwalk railing to prevent another giraffe from putting his head and neck\nthrough the railing. Three hay racks were also removed from the giraffe barn during this inspection since the racks\nhad large gaps on the sides between the enclosure wall and the vertical metal bars.\nAll primary animal enclosures must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and constructed in a manner to\nprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct from this day forward.\nThis inspection was conducted with the Vice President, Chief Veterinarian, and Lead/ Keeper/Registrar and exit\ninterview was conducted with the President & CEO and the General Curator."
