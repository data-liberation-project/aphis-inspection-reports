Records reviewed at the time of the inspection indicate that zoo employees were aware of the need to\nreplace this mesh since April 2014, but were not able to secure funding for the project at that time.\nUpon review of zoo documents and discussion with zoo employees, it appears that a significant contributing factor\nto\nTika's escape was that a small area of the outdoor exhibit mesh had failed due to deterioration from rubbing against\na tree branch and the age of the wire. Tika was able to escape from her outdoor exhibit through this area where the\nmesh had broken. All enclosures housing non-human primates must be designed and constructed so that they are\nstructurally sound for the species housed inside them and contain the animals securely.\nThis is a Critical Noncompliance Item (NCI)."
