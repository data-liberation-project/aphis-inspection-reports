      "narrative": "During this inspection, it was observed that several animals are in need of veterinary care.\n***A male Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that was irregular in shape, approximately 4\ninches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth was covered with flies.\nThe licensee provided documentation of a physical exam provided by the attending veterinarian, which stated that a\nsurgical resection should be performed at a facility that can address all surgical and postoperative concerns. The\nlicensee periodically applies fly spray to the area.\n***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS\ninspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing. The facility\nrepresentative provided documentation showing that the veterinarian had examined and treated the goat on March\n9, 2017. The goat was rechecked on May 27, 2017 by the veterinarian and it was his recommendation that 1) more\ndiagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2) if the facility representatives\ndo not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the animal. The veterinarian\nstated in his report that the animal did not appear to be in pain and the NSAIDS used previously provided no\nimprovement. In addition to the lameness observed, it was also observed that the goat was bleeding from his left\nhorn, which appears to be damaged. The licensee did not notice this prior to us pointing it out.\n***Nine goats, seven sheep, and one cow had overgrown hooves due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to\nappropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the\nfacility\u2019s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof\ncare in a timely manner.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The\nprogram for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee is required to follow the guidance of their attending\nveterinarian."
