The left lower side of his face is swollen compared to the right side of his face. There is\na small hairless area with a red scab on the left side of his neck, under his chin.

The licensee stated\nthat she had observed these issues but had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian, but had considered starting the cat\non Amoxi-Drops. The written Program of Veterinary Care does not include instructions for the care of eye or respiratory\ninfections in cats.\nOn or around 4/2/22, an approximately 2-day-old female serval kitten was found by the licensee to be doing poorly and\nshe removed it from its mother to try to provide care for it. The licensee contacted a veterinary technician who is not\nassociated with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and attempted to provide care for the kitten, but it died. The licensee\nstated that she did not contact the AV because it was after normal business hours, and that she did not contact an\nemergency veterinary clinic because she didn\u2019t think they would be willing or able to work on a serval. The AV was not\ncontacted after the death and no necropsy was performed.\nThe prompt identification of animal health issues and timely communication with the AV is essential for ensuring the\nhealth and welfare of animals. Animals with unidentified or untreated health issues may suffer from stress, pain, or\nworsening of their conditions which may in some cases lead to death.\nCorrect by 4/26/22 by conducting daily observation of all regulated animals to assess their health and well-being, and by\nhaving direct and frequent communication with the AV regarding all problems of animal health, behavior, and wellbeing."

The enclosure\nhousing 2 adult serval cats is located in the retail area of the store. The enclosure is made of welded wire panels that\nhave square openings that are approximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size. According to the licensee, at the time of the\nincident, there was a public barrier around the serval enclosure that consisted of vertical 3-foot-tall posts (stanchions) and\na retractable flexible strap stretched between the tops the posts. The horizontal strap was 3-feet from the ground and\nthere was nothing preventing a child or animal from passing under the strap. The distance between the animal enclosure\nand the public barrier was 3 feet in the area where the child was injured, which was at the far end of the serval enclosure\nnext to the chinchillas. A sign was also present instructing people not to reach or stick anything past the barrier.\nAccording to the licensee, she went to the back of the store to retrieve an animal and then she heard screaming. She\nimmediately returned to the retail area and found the child being comforted by her mother, who stated that the child had\nbeen scared by the cat. A few minutes later, the licensee saw that there was some blood on the child, and the mother\nstated that the serval cat had scratched the child. The child was taken to the emergency room.\nAt the time of the inspection, a few segments of caution tape had been added to the public barrier around the serval\nenclosure to block children from walking under the barrier. However, the caution tape is flexible and could be pushed\naside or torn by a child.\nServal cats have sharp claws and teeth which can injure people or animals who come too close to their enclosure.\nPeople or animals who are scratched or bitten by serval cats may suffer from pain, fear, injury, or infection. Serval cats\nwho scratch or bite people may themselves be injured in the process or may be subject to administrative consequences\nsuch as local or state requirements for quarantine or euthanasia.\nCorrect by 4/26/22 by ensuring that during public exhibition, the serval cats are handled so that there is minimal risk of\nharm to the animals and to the public, with sufficient distance and strong, effective barriers between the animals and the\ngeneral viewing public as to assure the safety of animals and the public (including small children)."
