Her enrichment plan states that she will have 24hr human contact and\nstuffed animals at all times. Inspectors saw keepers verbally engaging with Elsa for short periods of time with no\nphysical contact. Inspectors did not see a stuffed animal in with Elsa at all during their inspection (approximately 4\nhrs.). Young juveniles and individually housed non-human primates that are unable to see or hear other\nnon-human primates must be provided special attention regarding an enhancement of their enrichment to promote\ntheir psychological wellbeing.
