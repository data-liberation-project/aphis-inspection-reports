There was a crusty material on both eyes. The left eye area had hair loss.\n**Chinchilla BD-X-531 - was unable to open its left eye and there was a crusty material. It was squinting in the right\neye and there was a watery discharge.\n**The veterinary issues were not identified by the licensee and no treatment has been initiated for these animals.\nDuring inspection six chinchillas were observed to have the following veterinary issues:\n***Chinchilla #131 - The left eye had hair loss around the eye and the eyelid was reddened and swollen shut.\n***Two Chinchillas (No ID's, located in back section - south) - The right eye on both chinchillas was squinting and\nhad a watery discharge.\n***Chinchilla ID #M 675 - was squinting and had a watery discharge in the right eye.\n***A male Chinchilla ID #BD-Z-172 - The chinchilla was unable to open both eyes and both had a thick crusty\nmaterial.\n***Chinchilla ID #505 - was unable to open the left eye. There was a crusty material and hair loss around the eye.\n***While the facility initiated treatment for these six animals, the facility failed to follow the treatment plan from the\nveterinarian for continuing treatment after 2 days or have the animals reevaluated by the veterinarian.\nFailure to identify and treat veterinary issues can lead to pain, sickness, or the death of animals. Provide proper\nadequate veterinary care for these 9 animals by having them evaluated by the attending veterinarian in order to\ninitiate and maintain treatment for the veterinary issues as required. The treatment plan must be made available for\ninspectors if requested.\nNote: Licensee contacted the attending veterinarian and the attending veterinarian visited the facility to evaluate the\nanimals at the time of inspection."
