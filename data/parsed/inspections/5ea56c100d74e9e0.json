In the survival\nsurgery under this protocol the investigator states that incisions would be made in the skin over leg muscles with\nsubsequent injections of a tracer substance. There was no description of the length of the incisions or which leg\nmuscles would be used.\nProtocol #4187-03 contains an incomplete description of activities using nonhuman primates. Animals in this activity\nare approved for multiple major operative procedures including skull implants, arm implants, and vertebral implants.\nThere is no description of the size of incisions for any of the activities. There is no description of the size or locations\nof defects created in the skull or the instrumentation to be implanted. The only reference to the size of the vertebral\nincision and implant are the statements (cid:28)A laminectomy of several vertebrae, including dorsal spinous processes, is\nperformed& A stainless steel or plastic chamber with cap is cemented to the exposed surfaces of the vertebrae with\nacrylic cement.(cid:29) There is no description of which specific vertebrae or any maximum number of vertebrae that are to\nbe used in the activity. There is no description of the various implanted devices or their sizes.\nThree animals used on this protocol had significant health issues following the above surgical procedures. All three\nanimals were euthanized due to the severity of the health issues attributed to the IACUC approved activities in the\nabove protocol.\nProtocol #4167-01 contains an incomplete description of activities using nonhuman primates. Animals on this\nactivity are approved for up to three skull implants however there is no description of the size or locations of the\nimplants.\nNHP #10101 was observed to have two large skull implants plus a smaller post that, in total, involved a large portion\nof the surface of the skull. The implants appeared to be causing the right side of the eyebrow to be depressed.\nInadequate descriptions of activities using animals may prevent the IACUC from identifying deficiencies in activities.\nIt is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of proposed\nactivities that involve the use of animals in order that those activities may be adequately reviewed and determined\nto be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect by October 10, 2015 for the above protocols and during the next annual protocol review for all other\nprotocols.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.\nAccompanied by Dr. Pam Smith.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
