The licensee moved this dog to an\nindoor enclosure from his usual outdoor enclosure due to intolerance to the cold weather. The licensee stated that the dog\nappeared to be painful and vocalized when the weather was cold. During the inspection, the dog appeared reluctant to\nwalk and the gait appeared to be abnormal while in the indoor enclosure. The attending veterinarian verified that he is\naware of this dog's body condition and coat/skin condition. However, the licensee observed that this dog was showing\nsigns of pain or possible orthopedic problems but has not communicated that to the attending veterinarian.\nFailure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a veterinarian can result in prolonged pain or\neven death. The facility representative must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and\nfrequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health, behavior, and\nwell-being are conveyed and so that the medical conditions of the animals can be evaluated by the veterinarian. To be\ncorrected by close of business on 16 April 2021.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd Section"
