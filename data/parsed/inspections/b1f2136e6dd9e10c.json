Her belly nearly touched the ground while standing. She\nquickly returned to lying down. Additionally, her hooves in the front were overgrown, adding to her gait impairment.\nAt the educational facility there were two rabbits and one guinea pig. The toenails on these three animals were\novergrown to the point that they were curling up in different directions, and causing an abnormal angle to the toes\nwhen the animals were standing. Additionally one rabbit had mats, and a sticky substance, in its fur.\nObesity can cause discomfort, distress, and seriously affect the overall health of the animal. Overgrown toenails can\ncause gait abnormalities and discomfort. Matted fur can be painful to the animal.\nAnimal records did not indicate that any of these problems had been recognized or addressed. Failure to recognize\nand address problems with the health and well-being of the animals results in unnecessary suffering. Steps should\nbe taken to ensure that any problems with the animals are recognized in timely manner; addressed with proper\nhusbandry, and / or veterinary consultation when appropriate, and preferably documented so as to show\ncompliance.\nAll issues to be corrected and documented by 9/28/15.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representatives."
