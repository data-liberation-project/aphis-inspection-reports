      "narrative": "A white male alpaca was observed to have a wound on his right front leg. The wound is approximately 6-8 inches\nlong and 3 inches wide. Most of the wound was scabbed over however, there were a few areas that appeared to be\nflesh that were bright red in color. The alpaca was not limping on the injured leg, he was observed to be using his\nhind leg to itch the wound. The owner stated that the wound was an injury from the clippers when the alpaca was\nsheared approximately 2 weeks ago. The owner also indicated that he has not contacted his attending veterinarian\nfor the injury. He informed me that for the first 3-4 days that he applied scarlet oil to the wound and that is what the\nred coloring is on the injury. After the owner ran out of scarlet oil he used a horse wound spray that was purchased\nat a local farm supply store, he was applying that every 2-3 days. The bottle of spray was not able to be located\nduring the inspection. Lack of veterinary care for an injury can cause the animal more pain and discomfort. The\nalpaca must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was contacted during the\ninspection. The veterinarian told the owner to apply scarlet oil to the wound and an appointment was made for\ntomorrow to examine the animal.\nCorrect By: August 10, 2016\nThis was a focused inspection on the lions, tigers, hyena, and the white male alpaca."
