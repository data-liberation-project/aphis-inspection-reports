It was determined that the sedation regimen used did not adhere to the approved protocol\n#201702530. Also, the procedure was not approved as a non-survival surgery. On May 9th, 2019 the lab technician\nstated the medical records were incorrect, and that procedures had been conducted per the protocol and that\nanimals received proper sedation. On May 16th, 2019 the PI outlined the exact sedation protocol and procedures\nthat occurred and confirmed that they deviated from the approved protocol. The protocol included bupivacaine as a\nlocal anesthetic to mitigate pain during bone marrow collection. The cats received only high dose ketamine and\nacepromazine for the procedure.\nAs a part of the approved protocol #201808752 a procedure was performed on the right eye of a rabbit on June 8th,\n2020. The rabbit appropriately received analgesia (Meloxicam) prior to the procedure. The following day during post\nprocedure checks, the laboratory noted that the animal was recovering well and behaving normally. On post\nprocedure day 3, the animal was reported to the veterinary staff for ocular inflammation when it was discovered that\nthe animal did not receive Meloxicam 24 hours after the first dose per the protocol.\nBy not following the approved protocol, a research animal may experience greater pain or distress than was justified\nto or approved by the IACUC. Principal investigators will not deviate from approved protocols until they submit\nproposed modifications to protocols involving animal activity for review and approval by the IACUC prior to\nimplementation of such changes."
