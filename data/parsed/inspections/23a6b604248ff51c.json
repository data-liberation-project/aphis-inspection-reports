She appeared agitated and tried to\nturn her neck to rub the eye on her side.\n3) A member of the public addressed me thinking I worked for the auction as she saw a newborn alpaca cria that\nwas having difficulty breathing and appeared very weak and the female alpaca (#2542) did not seem to be taking\ncare of it.\nReview of consignment records did not document any health issues regarding these animals. The inspector notified\none of the principals of the auction who stated he would contact his veterinarian (on site). One of the vet techs later\nnotified me that the animals were being \"monitored\".\nFollowup of the three animals on 9/12/15 was conducted. The capybara had been sold. The banteng's eye\nappeared much improved. She was no longer squinting and drainage was minimal. The alpaca cria had died.\nThe facility is responsible for identifying veterinary issues and ensuring adequate veterinary care to include\ndiagnosis and treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the auction.
