According to the licensee, the paws were visible in the birth canal but after 2 days\nthere was no further effort to expel the cub. The licensee darted \"Sissy\" with ketamine twice and hand injected the\nbobcat one final time before she was able to get close to the bobcat. The licensee pulled the dead male cub the rest\nof the way out of the birth canal and observed it was quite large. No attempts were made to contact the veterinarian.\nThe licensee noted it was the weekend and even if she had called the vet and managed to get through to someone,\nit was unlikely the veterinarian would have come out.\nNot calling or contacting the attending veterinarian put the mother's and cubs' lives at risk and caused unnecessary\nsuffering to the mother. There is potential that the male cub could have been saved if intervention had occurred\nearly, when it was first noted the mother was not progressing in labor. Without the benefit of veterinary care,\ncomplications arising from the difficult birth could have caused infection and death to the mother.\nEnsure the veterinarian is contacted in all medical conditions pertaining to the bobcat(s) so that appropriate\nmethods are used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Additionally, ensure that a\nveterinarian is available for emergency, weekend and holiday care as described in the regulations. All veterinary\nmedical documentation shall be maintained and available to APHIS officials upon request.\nCorrect from this day forward"
