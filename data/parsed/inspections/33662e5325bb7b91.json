The\nIACUC investigation found that during one of the procedures the orogastric tube was not properly removed from animal.\nFailure to handle animals appropriately can lead to trauma, behavioral stress, and physical harm. In this case the\nimproper handling of the orogastric tube led to the death of a rabbit. Handling of all animals must be done as carefully as\npossible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort.\nThis incident was voluntarily reported to the USDA and corrective measures had been implemented prior to inspection.
