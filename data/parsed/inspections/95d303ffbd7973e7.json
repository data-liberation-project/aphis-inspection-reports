Additionally, a brown, black, and white\nguinea pig housed within the fourth pen from the exterior door had an area of reddened, non-haired, moist skin with\nlesions spanning the width of its hindquarters, as well as a reddened, non-haired, approximately egg-sized swelling\nunder its chin. Additionally, the brown, black, and white guinea pig's left eye appeared to have a small grey-to-blue\narea of opacity.\nLarge swellings, areas of reddened, non-haired, moist skin with lesions, and changes in eye clarity can be indicative\nof disease or injury, and can be painful for guinea pigs. Areas of reddened skin can affect the overall health and\nwell-being of guinea pigs. A veterinarian has not been consulted about this condition.\nThe licensee must have these two animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\ntreatment plan. Correct by December 15.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMchenry Kerry, Veterinary Medical Officer"
