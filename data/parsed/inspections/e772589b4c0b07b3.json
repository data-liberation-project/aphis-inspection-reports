The facility had recently ordered and received a new bottle of euthanasia solution and had labeled the old\nbottle of euthanasia solution as expired (September 2016). A review of the controlled drug log indicated that the\nexpired euthanasia solution was used on approximately 20 guinea pigs from October 2016 to April 2017. The\neuthanasia SOP was reviewed - the animals are all confirmed to be deceased as part of the protocol, but the\nprotocol does not require that the expiration date of the euthanasia solution be confirmed prior to use.\nGuidance from a veterinarian and the use of appropriate methods to treat animals are crucial components of\nveterinary care and are necessary to avoid and minimize pain and distress in animals. Utilizing expired euthanasia,\nanalgesia or anesthetic drugs is considered inadequate veterinary care.\nIdentified and corrected by facility prior to inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
