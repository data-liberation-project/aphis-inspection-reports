The licensee stated that this dog experienced hot spots periodically and was receiving topical\ntreatment for the lesions.\nPen #12 gray female dog \"Sonya\" was examined, noted to have numerous fleas and was observed scratching.\nPen #12 black/white female dog \"Ellie\" was examined and noted to have numerous fleas.\nIneffective flea control resulting in large numbers of adult fleas harbored on the dogs and in their environment can\ncause physical discomfort, result in tapeworm infestation, anemia, infection and contribute to medical complications\nsuch as hot spot formation in sensitive dogs. The current flea treatment and prevention program should be formally\nreviewed with the attending veterinarian to evaluate effectiveness and potential availability of new product\nselection/upgrades. Correct by: November 21, 2016.\n*Expired deworming medications were stored in the nursery where ten puppies and two adult dogs were housed\nduring this inspection. A bottle of Pyrantel Pamoate expired July 2016 and a bottle of Praziquantel injectable expired\nOctober 2015. Out of date medications may lose efficacy and become unsafe for use. Using expired medications is\nincompatible with the standard of care required to demonstrate adequate veterinary care under the Animal Welfare\nAct. This non-compliance was corrected during the inspection by discarding the expired medications."
