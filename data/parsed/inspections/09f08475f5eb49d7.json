The lack of these observations led to \nthe starvation and dehydration death of the dog prior to delivery to the receiver. \n \nThe regulations state that the operator of the conveyance or a person accompanying the operator observes the dog as \noften as circumstances allow, but not less than once every 4 hours, to make sure they have sufficient air for normal \nbreathing, that the ambient temperature is within the limits provided in 3.16(e), and that all applicable standards of this \nsubpart are being complied with. The regulated person must ensure that the operator or person accompanying the \noperator determines whether the dog is in obvious physical distress and obtains any veterinary care needed for the dog at \nthe closest available veterinary facility. Correct by 20June2023. \n3.18(d) \n   \nCare in transit. \nOpie, a four-year-old neutered male corgi dog in good physical condition, was accepted for consigned transport at \napproximately 1850 on 30December2022 in Townsend, Delaware. The dog was transported in a crate in the transporter\u2019s \nminivan. The dog was delivered to the receiver in Jesup, Iowa on Iowa at approximately midmorning on 05January2023. \nThe dog was deceased on arrival. \n \nDuring a two-hour phone conversation held between the transporter, the Animal Care Transportation Specialist, and the \nInspector on 07June2023 at 1 pm ET, the transporter stated that the dog was allowed to roam about in the minivan during \ntransport and that he took the dog out of the van on leash to walk him outside. A video of Opie being walked on a single \nleash outside on a sidewalk was sent to the consignor the day after transport started. A text message confirming that the \ndog was allowed to ride loose in the minivan was received by the consignor.  \n \nAllowing the dog to roam loose in a moving vehicle put this dog at significant risk of injury and death should an accident \nhave occurred. Walking the dog outside in an uncontained area put this dog at significant risk of escape or injury.  \n \nThe regulations state that removal during transportation in commerce is prohibited. Except during the cleaning of the \nprimary enclosures, as required in 3.15(b), during transportation in commerce a dog must not be removed from its primary \nenclosure, unless it is placed in another primary enclosure or facility that meets the requirements of 3.6 or 3.15. Correct \nby 20June2023. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.\n\nAdditional Inspectors: \nCHAD MOORE, Transportation Field Specialist n",
