      "narrative": "An approximately 6 year old, individually housed, female white-headed capuchin is showing signs consistent with\npsychological stress. Patchy hair loss is visible near the base of the tail and hind limbs. The licensee stated that the\ncapuchin plucked areas of its hair on one occasion while she was absent from the facility. The licensee also stated\nthat the capuchin has been difficult to handle and has exhibited unusual aggressive behavior. The facility's current\nenrichment plan that was approved by the attending veterinarian, has been deviated from due to the capuchin's\nunpredictable behavior. Additionally, the capuchin hasn't been on public display for a couple months because of the\nlicensee's concerns with its current temperament. The licensee has recently consulted the attending veterinarian,\nhowever, the environmental enhancement plan has not yet been altered or updated by the veterinarian beyond a\nfew suggestions. The facility has been offering a wide variety of enrichment items but the current plan has not\nincluded special considerations for nonhuman primates that are showing signs of being in psychological distress.\nThe abnormal behaviors exhibited by the capuchin may be an indication that the psychological/social needs of the\nanimal are not currently being met. Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that must be\naddressed when in captivity. Failure to do so can result in a variety of behavior problems.\nThe licensee must provide certain nonhuman primates special attention regarding enhancement of their\nenvironment based on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending\nveterinarian. Nonhuman primates that show signs of being in psychological distress through behavior or\nappearance must have these special considerations addressed in the written program of environmental enrichment.\nTo be corrected by: May 18, 2016."
