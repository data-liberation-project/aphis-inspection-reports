One enclosure housing a\nyoung dog had an access door with metal flashing strips that were bent away from the wall on the upper corners of\nboth sides around the door. The corners created sharp points projecting into the enclosure. Two additional\nenclosures had wire ends from the fencing pointing into the enclosures. There were at least 7 wire ends projecting\nupward and into one of the enclosures along the bottom of a fence. Sharp points increase the risk of injury to the\ndogs. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures housing dogs are kept in good repair and contain no sharp\npoints or edges that could injure the dogs at all times. To be corrected by: October 3, 2017\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative on September 28, 2017."
