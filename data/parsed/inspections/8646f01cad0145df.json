The \"white of the eye\" is more red on the left side when compared to the\nright. There is a white color visible within the left eyeball. The licensee had not identified this problem before the\ninspection and had not communicated the problem to the attending veterinarian. The program of veterinary care\ndoes not instruct the licensee on how to address this problem. Eye problems can be caused by infection, trauma,\neyelid conformation, and other medical problems. The squinting suggests that this eye is painful.\nFemale Pomeranian with chip number 017 582 367 (\"Princess\" DOB 4/2012) has a heavy buildup of dental calculus\non all of the visible molar and premolar teeth (\"cheek teeth\"). On the left side there is one loose lower premolar and\none loose upper premolar. Both teeth are easily moved. The licensee had not identified this problem before the\ninspection and had not communicated the problem to the attending veterinarian. The program of veterinary care\ndoes not instruct the licensee on how to address this problem. The loose teeth indicate that there is dental disease\npresent in this dog. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of\nthe jaw supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the\noverall health of the animal.\nThe conditions of these two dogs are clearly seen and should have been observed by the licensee. The conditions\nalso appear to have started to be a problem well before the last daily observation. The licensee must observe all\nanimals at least daily to asses their health. There must also be a mechanism of direct communication that is\nfrequent enough so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian. To be corrected by 19 Sept 2018."
