      "narrative": "Since the last full inspection of the non-human primate facilities (11/1/2016) there have been five incidents with\nnon-human primates that resulted in the need for wound closure (suturing) and partial digit amputations. Four of\nthese incidents occurred with macaques getting out of their primary enclosures due to human error or enclosure\nfailure. The macaque(s) were able to get out of their enclosure and then either sustained or caused injuries in the\ncourse of uncontrolled interactions with other macaques housed in the same secure room. Incidents of primary\nenclosure exits that caused injuries needing sutures and/or partial digit amputations occurred on 2/13/18 (1\nmacaque affected), 3/15/18 (1 macaque affected), 3/3/17 (1 macaque affected), and 5/24/17 (2 macaques affected).\nOne incident involved a marmoset getting its right hind foot closed in an enclosure door on 10/18/17 and 11/6/17.\nBoth incidents caused injuries to its right hind foot and required partial digit amputations of the affected foot. The\naffected marmoset was observed on the inspection and found to ambulate without problem and adjustments to the\nenclosures to prevent further incidents were observed.\nNote: Affected animals were treated promptly by clinical veterinary staff. The facility previously identified these\nincidents and reported them to the overseeing ACUC and steps to prevent future occurrences were taken.\nThis was an inspection of the animals and records maintained under the College of Letters and Sciences and a\nreview of the records pertaining to animals maintained under the WNPRC and the overseeing ACUC's records.\nThis inspection was conducted on 6/12 - 6/13 and the exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on\n6/14/2018.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBarksdale Dawn, Veterinary Medical Officer"
