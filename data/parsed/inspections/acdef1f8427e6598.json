This flinching behavior can indicate stress for the animal. Since\nthis is a facility with an adjacent gun range, and shots are fired frequently throughout the day every day, the facility\nshould consult with the attending vet and determine an appropriate method to alleviate the stressful impact on this\nanimal.\n*** The Asiatic black bear has a broken left front canine that is black in the middle of the tooth. Broken canines can\nbe painful and lead to possible infections. This bear should be evaluated by the attending vet to assess the\ncondition of the tooth and determine a possible course of treatment.\n*** The bears are geriatric and obese with their front claws removed. These bears are under treatment for arthritis,\nbut are currently housed in a concrete slab enclosure with no soft resting surfaces. Additionally the diet of these\nanimals is not of nutritive value to maintain them in a healthy body condition. In addition to dog food, the bears are\ngiven left over food from the club restaurant (pasta, breads, fries, and cooked meat products) which contributes to\ntheir weight. Additionally according to the caretaker the bears are not fed more food during fall which is a period of\nhyperplasia for them and therefore do not go down into a period of winter lethargy. Dietary issues in bears can\ncontribute to multiple health care problems and this diet should be evaluated by the attending vet to assure their\ndietary needs are being met and maintained in a manner that prevents injury and health issues.\nCorrect by: July 20, 2017"
