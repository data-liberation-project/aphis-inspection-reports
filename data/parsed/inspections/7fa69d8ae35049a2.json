The animal was left unattended in a waterless plastic wading pool for approximately an hour\nbefore it was found deceased.

Failure to\nhandle animals as carefully and expeditiously as possible can lead to injury or death. Animals must be handled in manner\nthat does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort."
