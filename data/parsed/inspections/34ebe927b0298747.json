The non-compliance as\ncited on the inspection report stated that the animals needed to be examined by a veterinarian. Review of facility\ndaily log records and conversations with facility staff showed that the facility attempted to take the animals to the vet\non 12/16/15 but the vet was unavailable due to an emergency. No record of a rescheduling of the appointment was\nnoted. Then on 12/18/15 there was a notation that the mouflon left the facility, taken by A. Another notation on\n1/15/16 stated that E.C. took the savannah cat. There were no notations that the cat was examined by a\nveterinarian between 12/15/15 and 1/15/16.\n*The current written Program of Veterinary Care states that the attending veterinarian will visit the facility every two\nmonths to ensure adequate veterinary care for the animals at the facility. The last notation or signature of the\nattending veterinarian visiting the facility was on 10/23/15.\nThe facility must assure that the attending veterinarian is given appropriate authority to ensure adequate veterinary\ncare for animals. This includes ensuring that the veterinarian makes regularly scheduled visits to the facility and that\nanimals in need of veterinary care are examined and treated appropriately. Correct from this day forward."
