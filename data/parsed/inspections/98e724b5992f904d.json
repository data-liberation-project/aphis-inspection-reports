Physical inspection of both individuals identified superficial wounds that were immediately relayed to the\nattending veterinarian. The AV prescribed pain medication for a period of 5 days with the option of continuing until 10\ndays if the animals still seemed painful. During this period, the pigs were held separately with a wooden slated wall\nbetween them. Daily observations and conversations with the facility staff indicate that the animals were spending a lot of\ntime together at the slated wall.\nOn December 20th, 2021, the facility decided to reintroduce the male pigs. The staff fed the pigs in separate locations\nand, per the facility, things were going well between the animals at first. As soon as the food was gone, the pigs began\nfighting again. The staff were unable to separate the males this time with two large baffle boards and after 1.5hrs, the\nmales separated themselves with the help of two additional curators with smaller baffle boards. Staff identified that one of\nthe male pigs had bent his lower left tusk at a 90 degree angle. The attending veterinarian was contacted again and\nreturned the next day for radiographs of the jaw. Radiographs confirmed that the animal had sustained a fracture to his\njaw and canine tooth, and subsequently required surgery to remove a fragment of the affected bone.\nDuring a conversation with the attending veterinarian, it was confirmed that the facility did not contact the AV for guidance\nand/or approval prior to reintroducing the males. Although the AV did not specifically prohibit the facility from reuniting the\nanimals, he did suggest that fighting amongst this species is common. Furthermore, the facility did not have a\ndocumented, trained and regularly exercised plan addressing how to reintroduce conspecifics after a physical altercation.\nThe absence of such a plan, including intervention procedures and gradual timeline for reintroductions, resulted in animal\ninjury. Currently, a verbal plan exists and was communicated to the USDA inspector by facility staff. The facility must have\nbetter established plans in place to properly reintroduce and handle animals in a manner that does not cause trauma,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect prior to the next relicense inspection date."
