Other animals that underwent the same procedure on\nthe same day were unaffected. Both affected animals were treated by the facility veterinarians; one was allowed to\nheal by secondary intention, the other required more extensive treatment including surgical debridement. Both\nanimals made a full recovery.\nPolicy at the time of the event recommended the use of circulating water heating pads or Bair Hugger\u00ae forced air\nheating pads for thermal support of anesthetized animals, and discouraged use of electric heating pads. The facility\nrepresentatives were not sure if the Primary Investigator (PI) was trained on this issue. The IACUC was unaware of\nthe use of electric heating pads in the animal labs because the researchers did not store them in the lab, but\nbrought them in only when the procedures were taking place. Therefore, the items were not present during\ninspections of the lab.\nThis was corrected prior to the time of inspection by making two policy changes. First, the thermal support policy\nwas changed so that the use of electric heating pads was not just discouraged, but banned. Second, all equipment\nthat will be used in animal work must be made available for inspection and will be inspected by the IACUC. All\npersonnel from all labs have been retrained according to the new policies. The facility needs to ensure all\nemployees are trained on current policies.\nThe inspection was conducted on 7/29-30/2014 and was accompanied by the NHP Project Resource Veterinarian,\nanimal area personnel, and IACUC office personnel.\nThe exit briefing was held on 7/30/2014 with facility veterinarians and IACUC office personnel.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
