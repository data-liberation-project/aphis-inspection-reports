The dog was housed\nwith several other dogs and had access to dry food. She was moved into a separate enclosure and given a wet/dry\nmixed diet which she began to consume. Due to her poor body condition but willingness to eat, there may be\nunderlying health related issues contributing to her weight loss. Her poor body condition should be communicated to\nthe attending veterinarian so that he has the ability to give adequate guidance on health related issues.\nCorrect by: Sept 21, 2018\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
