While the row of enclosures are in a shed structure with a roof\nand a solid wall at the rear of the enclosures, there must be a shelter that has a roof, four sides, and a floor. The\nowner must provide and maintain one or more shelters in each outdoor enclosure that are large enough to contain\nall the animals at one time and allow them to sit, stand, lie, and turn about freely.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
