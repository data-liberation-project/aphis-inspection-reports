      "narrative": "At time of inspection a female Silky Terrier (Microchip number 932 001000632273) was noted to be listless in her\nenclosure. Upon closer examination, the dog had a rectal temperature of 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit. A normal canine\ntemperature generally ranges from 101 to 102.5. It was noted that watery stool was coming from the dog's rectum\nwhile taking the temperature. The dog had black gums, so the assessment for paleness could not be determined.\nHowever, the gums were dry and tacky. The hydration status of the dog was assessed by tenting the skin to see if\nthe normal retraction was detected. However, the dog had long hair and an accurate assessment could not be\ndetermined. The dog laid minimally responsive for the entire examination. At that time, the inspection was stopped\nfor the licensee to seek veterinary attention for the dog immediately.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY 7/10/2019\n*The licensee provided documentation of examination by a licensed veterinarian prior to the close of business."
