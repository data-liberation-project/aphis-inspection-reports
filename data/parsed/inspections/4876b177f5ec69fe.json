All veterinary observations, diagnoses and treatments should be\ndocumented in writing to allow all employees to know the status of and treatment required for the animals and for\nthe veterinarians to ensure adequate care is provided.

Instead, the facility AV is evaluating BAM as a potential replacement for succinylcholine.\nFour animals have been successfully immobilized using BAM since the last inspection.
