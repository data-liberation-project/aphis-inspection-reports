The enclosure is located closest to the ground and near an electric heating unit which provides heat to the\nfacility. The electric unit is mounted to a shelf that is several feet off the ground. Based on Kestrel measurements, the\nrelative humidity at the level of the cage was 16% and the temperature was around 68 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe attending veterinarian performed a post-mortem examination on both gliders and found no evidence of infectious\ndisease. The female glider had evidence of dehydration and anorexia while the male had no specific abnormalities.\nAccording to the licensee, the sugar gliders were both active the evening before during their daily observation and water\nwas present in both water bottles.\nSugar gliders are sensitive to low temperatures and dehydration which can quickly lead to undue stress, physical harm,\ndiscomfort, and death.\nCorrect by 31 March 2022 by ensuring that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner\nthat does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
