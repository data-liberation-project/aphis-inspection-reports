A perimeter fence\nvariance for the facility had been in place since 2017. Enclosures that are not strong enough or appropriately constructed\nand maintained to protect the animals contained within can lead to escape, injury, predation and death.\nThe black heavy plastic flexible drainage tubing that serves as tunnels for the pine martin (1) in the area near the moose\ntrailer has an approximately 2 inch long by \u00bc-1/3 in wide hole with sharp edges. This hole could allow escape or\nentrapment and injury to the pine martins.\nSeveral large nails were exposed in the fox (3) pens where outer logs of the climbing structure had rotted off leaving large\nnail heads and shafts exposed. The exposed nails could lead to puncture, injury or death of the animals.\nIn one of the lynx pens and two of the fox pens, chain-link anti-dig fencing on the ground was exposed. In one fox pen, the\nexposed chain link was in the middle of the pen near the climbing structure. In the lynx pen, it was along two full sides\nextending several feet into the pen and with area of depression where all the underlying soil had washed away. Exposed\nchain-link on the floor of the pen could cause discomfort or injury to the animals.\nThe facility must be constructed of such materials and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. They must\nbe structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals."

The perimeter fencing did not meet the ground in numerous spots, including near the\nporcupine enclosure where the opening was observed being used as access point for humans.\nInadequate perimeter fencing can allow for access of unauthorized persons, other animals and fail to act as secondary\ncontainment for the animals in the facility. This could lead to injury, escape or death of the animal.\nAll outdoor housing must be enclosed by a perimeter fence to keep unauthorized persons and animals out and serve as a\nsecondary containment for the animals within unless the animals are exempt (the reindeer and completely indoor\nhoused).
