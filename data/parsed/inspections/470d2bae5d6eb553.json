I called the licensee to ask him if he could meet us at the property. The\nlicensee said that he was in CT and could not do an inspection. I asked if there was someone else in the area that\ncould do the inspection with us. He again told me that he was in CT and not available. I explained that I would be\nwriting this up as a \"repeat\" attempted inspection because of our attempted inspection on 9/12/18.\nWe decided to go to his other place of business, that is approximately 5 miles away, in Athol, MA. As we entered\nthis place of business the licensee was present. We again asked him to accompany us, or provide us a responsible\nadult to accompany us, to complete an inspection. Licensee declined again.\nEach exhibitor shall allow APHIS officials to enter their business, inspect the facilities and the records for\ncompliance."
