The licensee shall provide one or more shelter\nstructures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each\nanimal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to the\nshelter structures, one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large enough to contain all the\nanimals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs or cats\nmust contain a roof, four sides, and a floor.\nThis focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee on May 9, 2014. The non-compliant item\nwas discussed with the licensee during the inspection. This inspection was limited to the direct item 3.4b found\nduring a routine inspection on May 7,2014.
