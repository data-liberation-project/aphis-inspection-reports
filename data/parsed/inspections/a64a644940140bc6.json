The backbone and individual\nvertebrae are visible, and some muscle depletion is noted through the hindquarters.

Failure to provide the necessary equipment requested by the veterinarian to facilitate\nproper care delays the delivery of the care and can contribute to worsening health and wellbeing of the animal.\nThe licensee must make available any appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to facilitate proper\nveterinary care and hoof trimming.

      "narrative": "CRITICAL: On Thursday, 07/08/2021, the Curator of the facility sent an email regarding an escape incident involving a\nfemale black bear named, \u201cWinnie,\u201d that was being held there temporarily for the City of Alamogordo. This occurred the\nday prior at approximately 3:00pm. The bear escaped by pulling aside a layer of chain link material on the roof of the\nenclosure, resulting in an opening large enough for her to exit onto the top of the enclosure, where the bear was spotted\nby keeper staff. A team consisting of zoo staff, the veterinarian and members of the New Mexico Game and Fish\nDepartment carried out the full sedation and movement of the bear down from the top of the enclosure. The veterinarian\nexamined the bear and the bear was secured into holding by 4:05pm. New enclosure modifications to include metal\nreinforcement and an electric hot wire that is tested daily were in place at the time of inspection. The former design and\nconstruction of the enclosure was inadequate to contain the bear, which could have resulted in harm to the animal, other\nanimals or even people. Corrected before time of inspection.\nCRITICAL: One beaver named \u201cTimber,\u201d escaped from its primary enclosure after 4:00pm on 10/10/2020. The morning\nof 10/11/2020 the keeper noticed the beaver was missing. Two weeks prior to the incident the beaver arrived at the\nfacility and was being temporarily housed in the old crane exhibit while the permanent exhibit was being completed. The\ntemporary crane exhibit did not have dig barriers in place and the escaped beaver dug under two chain link fences and\none picket fence. Members of the public did report seeing a beaver along the nearby river. The zoo staff responded to all\nsightings; however, the exact location of the beaver was not known, and the facility has been unable to recover the\nanimal. The other beaver in the enclosure was moved to another location that prevents digging. Animals escaping from\nprimary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm from surrounding predatory animals and further injury when they are not\nsafely contained. Corrected before time of inspection.\nNON-CRITICAL: On the rear side of the elk and deer holding area, there is an ~15\u2019 section of chain link fencing that is\nloose and curled upward and inward, creating an ~8-10\u201d gap underneath and causing the fencing material to protrude into\nthe interior of that holding enclosure by several inches. Loose and protruding wire and gaps in fences pose a trip and/or\nentrapment hazard for the animals.\nHousing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved; they\nmust be sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nTo be corrected by 08/15/2021\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nCINDY RHODES, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOREnd Section"
