Either sheep must be removed from the enclosure (with only enough sheep\nremaining so they all could lie down in the shelter), or additional shelter must be added to the enclosure.\nAlso, the same problem was encountered in the cow enclosure. The shelter in the cow enclosure was full with cattle\nlying down inside it. There were four additional cows standing just outside the entrance but there was no room\ninside the shelter, if they had wanted its protection.
