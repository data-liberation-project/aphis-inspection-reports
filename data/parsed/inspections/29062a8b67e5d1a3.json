      "narrative": "At the time of the inspection the two young bear cubs approximately 5 months old were observed in an abnormal\nbehavior of paw sucking and ear sucking. One cub was on the ground sucking his paw while vocalizing and the\nother\ncub was laying over the one cub and sucking on his siblings right ear. This behavior went on for an extended period\nof time. It was observed at the beginning of the inspection and several hours later at the end of the inspection, the\ncubs were observed sucking again. The one cubs ear was soaked and there was indication of hair loss on the ear.\nThe facility stated that all of their hand reared cubs do this behavior and they were not concerned with it. This is an\nabnormal behavior pattern that can be attributed to stress and how the cubs cope with stress. Additionally the\nconstant sucking of the paw and ear can cause physical hot spots or potential ear infection. The facility did not\nrecognize that this was an abnormal behavior pattern and therefore did not convey this information to the vet in a\ntimely manner. The attending vet needs to assess the cubs behavior and assist the facility with a plan to encourage\nnormal behavior patterns for their health and well-being.\nCorrect by September 15, 2015"

At the\ntime of the euthanasia the male juvenile lion was present in lion holding directly adjacent to the tiger. At the time of\nthe euthanasia three shots were made with a high caliber rifle in an enclosed area. According to the facility\nrepresentative that conducted the euthanasia, the discharge of the firearm caused an employees ears to ring and\ncaused him discomfort. The juvenile lion was unable to escape the sound of the firearm in the building. The\ndischarge of the firearm may have caused trauma to the ear drums, and unnecessary discomfort for the juvenile\nlion. Additionally studies have shown that animals exposed to another animal being euthanized can be stressful.\nBecause of the current holding situation and the fact that the lion cannot be shifted out onto exhibit, another method\nof euthanizing the tiger should have been taken into consideration. Handling of all animals shall be done as\nexpeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress or unnecessary\ndiscomfort.\nCorrect from this day forward."
