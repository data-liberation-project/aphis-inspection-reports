There were 20 NHP's housed in this area during the inspection; however by the time of the inspection exit\ninterview the door with the gap in it was no longer part of their primary housing. This gap by the door of smaller NHP's\ncould allow them to get out and/or injured. Ensure that this gap is not present for this group of NHP's if they are housed in\nthese primary enclosures.\n***Correction: Ensure item is corrected prior to using the affected enclosure doors again on this group of NHP's or other\nNHP's that could possibly fit through the gap.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
