      "narrative": "On October 3, 2016, at approximately 11:30pm, USDA was notified by the director of the sanctuary that Boomer, a\nmale tiger, was loose from his enclosure. The licensee stated that he had forgotten to close the guillotine door to\nBoomer's enclosure when he went into the porta-storage unit to medicate Asia, a female tiger, who shared the\nshelter with Boomer. The licensee was unable to get Boomer back in his enclosure safely. Local law enforcement\nwas notified and arrived on scene where they were able to get the licensee into their vehicle and then located the\nloose tiger. Boomer attempted to leave his enclosure and was shot by local law enforcement. After being shot, the\ntiger spun around and ran back into his enclosure where he died. The licensee was injured during the escape.\nWhile loose, Boomer attacked a horned heifer and one American bison. The heifer had obvious injuries consistent\nwith claw marks or bite wounds on both of her rear legs and back end. The smaller bison was very stiff and reluctant\nto move. These injured animals were examined by the attending veterinarian. A diagnosis was made and treatment\nwas administered to the animals.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible to prevent trauma,\nbehavioral stress, unnecessary discomfort and physical harm.\nCorrection date: From this point forward.\nThis was a focused inspection to check on the direct citations from two inspection reports.\nOn September 28, 2016 and September 30, 2016 direct citations were cited under 2.40b2 - Veterinary Care, 2.40b3\n- Daily Observation, and 3.129a - Feeding. All of the animals cited for the directs were seen by a licensed\nveterinarian. A diagnosis and treatment was prescribed as needed.\nThe inspection was conducted on October 4, 2016 and the exit interview was conducted with the Board president\nvia phone on October 13, 2016.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHicks Beverly, Animal Care Inspector\nMckinnie Carolyn, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist\nThornton Karl, Animal Care Inspector\nGage Laurie, Big Cat Specialist\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
