      "narrative": "***The current program of veterinary care indicates that for all hoofstock species, except Blackbuck and Nilgai,\nsuccinylcholine will be the sole agent used for capture, transport, and chemical restraint for procedures such as\nexams and lameness treatment. During conversations with facility representatives it was ascertained that\nsuccinylcholine is the sole current drug being used to immobilize hoofstock. Bottles of succinylcholine were present\nat the facility. The veterinarian-approved instructions discuss the care and monitoring of the animal during the use\nof the neuromuscular blocker but makes no mention of the fact that during immobilization with neuromuscular\nblocking agents the animals remain fully conscious and are sensitive to pain, stress and stimulation. Succinylcholine\nis a paralytic agent that has no pain relieving or tranquilizing properties. In addition, this type of drug paralyzes\nrespiratory muscles causing decreases in respiration rate that can be severe enough to lead to death if the animals\nare not ventilated appropriately. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities or training to intubate or\nmechanically ventilate animals if they stop breathing. Neuromuscular blockers such as succinylcholine should not\nbe used without concurrent appropriate use of anesthesia/analgesia and support measures (ventilation and\nmonitoring) to avoid the distressing effects, respiratory depression and enhanced risk of death due to paralysis of\nrespiratory muscles. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which are able to\nchemically restrain animals without causing paralysis while providing anesthesia and analgesia. The licensee must\nmaintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods of immobilizing and restraining\nhoofstock that are consistent with currently accepted professional standards of adequate veterinary care."
