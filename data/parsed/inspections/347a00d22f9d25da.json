The report shall be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC\nmembers, contain any minority views, contain a description of the nature and extent of the facility\u2019s adherence to and\nspecifically identify any departures from the provisions of title 9, chapter I subchapter A Animal Welfare.

      "narrative": "Three dogs had medical issues that had not been previously identified by the facility and were not documented in the\ndogs\u2019 medical records:\nAn 11-year-old male yellow Labrador dog (\u201cShowboat\u201d, microchip 900215003196826) has severe dental disease. On both\nsides, the upper and lower back teeth are covered with a hard brown material covering the entire teeth, and the adjacent\ngums are swollen. On the upper right side, one of the smaller teeth has a hole or gap at the base of the tooth that is not\ncovered by the gums. The tip has broken off both of the upper canine teeth. Medical records for this dog show a \u201cdental\u201d\n11 months ago, and the dog\u2019s teeth are not mentioned again in the medical record since that time.\nA 12-year-old neutered male Golden Retriever dog (\u201cThor\u201d, microchip 956000005047348) has severe dental disease.\nThere is a dark brownish yellow hard substance on the largest upper back tooth on the right side, covering approximately\n90% of the tooth. The adjacent gums are red and swollen, and there is a small amount of grey material present at the\ngumline. Two nearby teeth are similarly affected, with the dark brownish yellow substance covering 25-50% of the teeth.\nOn the left side, there is a dark brownish yellow substance on many of the teeth, covering 75% of the largest upper back\ntooth. There is also a small amount of grey material at the gumline, and the gums are pink and swollen. The tip is broken\noff both upper canine teeth. Recent entries in the medical record show no mention of this animal\u2019s teeth.\nA 9-year-old female yellow Labrador dog (\u201cSunny\u201d, microchip 956000005267130) has ear and dental issues. The skin of\nher right ear canal is reddened compared to the left ear. The right ear canal is filled with a large amount of brown black\nmaterial and there is an odor associated with the material. The left ear canal itself is narrowed (and could not be\nvisualized as was the right) and has a small amount of brown black material in the outer ear area (not able to visualize\ndeeper). Ear issues can be discomforting and if left untreated can be painful and lead to serious infections. She also has a\nfirm enlargement of the gum tissue around the upper right canine tooth. This gum area is reddened compared to the left\nside. There is a dark grey brown hard substance on the tooth at the gumline and a light brown hard material on the upper\nhalf of the tooth. The tip of this tooth is broken or worn off.\nThe facility maintains a chart showing the \u2018annual exam\u2019/\u2019dental\u2019 due dates for each dog. The due dates for these three\ncited dogs were listed as upcoming in May. The current severe dental disease of these three dogs was not documented in\ntheir medical records and the facility had not taken steps to have these dogs treated before their regular annual\nexam/dental.\nAn additional three dogs were diagnosed with low thyroid blood test levels over the last approximately four months and\nstarted on supplemental thyroid medication. The medical records for all three dogs state that the dogs were to have\nfollow-up thyroid testing after being on the medication for several weeks but the records do not show that these tests have\nbeen done. Shady (microchip 956000012523827) was diagnosed and started on treatment on 12/6/23 with a recheck to\nbe done in 3 months. Teddy (microchip 95600001240830) was diagnosed and started on treatment on 1/10/23 with a\nrecheck test to be done in 45-55 days. Snowflake (microchip 956000012520418) was diagnosed and started on treatment\non 1/23/23 with a recheck test to be done in 60 days. The follow up testing requested by the veterinarian is important to\nensure that the correct dosage of the thyroid medication is administered. The attending veterinarian was able to be\nreached by phone on 4/17/23 and he stated that all three dogs are currently due for follow-up thyroid testing.\nAccurate and timely diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and health issues is important to ensure the health and comfort\nof the animals. Follow up testing requested by the veterinarian needs to be completed to ensure correct treatment\nregimens. Correct by using appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in\nconsultation with the AV, including the timely provision of follow-up care as prescribed by the AV."
