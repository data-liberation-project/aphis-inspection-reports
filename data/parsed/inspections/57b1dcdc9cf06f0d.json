This error was discovered during the procedure and the presiding veterinarian\nimmediately stopped and assessed the patient. The procedure and anesthesia were stopped, and CPR was administered;\nhowever, the patient never regained consciousness. An investigation of the incident by the IACUC found that the exhaust\nfrom the non-rebreathing system was connected to the gas exhaust outlet on the machine instead of the exhaust\ncannister. There was essentially no outlet for the exhaust gases. The IACUC Administrator stated that this incident was\nthe first feline death due to student negligence since the program's inception. The facility reviewed the incident and added\nthe following corrective actions to any procedure involving anesthesia. Prior to leak checking anesthesia machines,\nstudents will be required to connect audible pressure alarms to all anesthesia circuits for every anesthetic procedure and\nensure that they are working properly. Following the mandatory leak checks, and prior to attaching the patient, students\nwill attach an artificial lung to the anesthetic circuit and turn on the oxygen and vaporizer to further ensure that pop off\nvalves are open, circuits are correctly connected, and the artificial lung does not receive over pressure. Additionally, the\nprogram has instituted a clinical probation status for students whose negligence severely compromise an animal\u2019s\nwelfare. The student will receive a clinical probation letter in their academic file. A second letter will trigger an academic\nboard meeting for further actions up to and including expulsion from the academic program.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\nphysical harm or unnecessary trauma.\nThe facility\u2019s corrective actions had already been identified and established by the date of this inspection. No further\ncorrective actions needed at this time."
