The animals were restrained in a standing position with their collar fixed in the yoke of the chair.\nAfter discussion with the facility, it was determined that the macaques would be restrained in the chairs for 2-3\nhours.\nThe primate chair was designed for animals to perch in a natural position, hunched slightly forward, per the product\nwebsite. The position in which the animals are being restrained is not the appropriately ergonomic seated position\nfor which the chairs were designed and the duration for which they are held in this posture results in unnecessary\ndiscomfort for the animals. Several animals were noted attempting to make postural adjustments seeking adequate\nsupport for a species appropriate resting posture.\nHandling of all animals shall be done in a manner that does not cause unnecessary discomfort. A system should be\nin place to ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible.\nCorrection date: 30 November, 2016"
