The keeper stated that thawed meat is rolled into a tube-shape and\nthe customer is instructed to push the meat with a flattened hand to the lion through the opening in the plexi-glass\ncutout. The keeper also stated that the public may experience a brief moment where the lion(cid:25)s tongue may come in\ncontact with the palm of the hand of the feeder. This public feeding activity may allow for brief contact with the lion(cid:25)s\ntongue and poses the risk of the public potentially extending a finger past the plane of the lion(cid:25)s primary enclosure\nfence. Sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the public so as to assure the safety of the\nanimals and the public must be in place.\nCorrect for all future inspections.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGage Laurie, Big Cat Specialist"
