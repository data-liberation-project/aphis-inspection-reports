      "narrative": "A female Saint Bernard identified as \u201cBeckles\u201d (DOB 12-2011, Microchip #A02396226) was observed to have an\nopen sore/wound on the top of the nose area. The sore area was approximately 3/4 to 1 inch in size and appeared\npartially ulcerated,red and moist. Flies were observed landing around the affected area. The licensee stated that\nthe dog had been previously evaluated by a veterinarian and that she had been treating the sore area for flies on a\nregular basis. Documentation of a general fly control program was provided by the licensee, but no treatment\nrecords nor documentation were available at the time of inspection to verify \"Beckles\" had been evaluated by a\nveterinarian for her current wound and an appropriate treatment plan established for resolution of the condition.\nAn open, non-healing wound on the nose area could be indicative of repeated trauma, sunlight sensitivity or a skin\ndisorder associated with an underlying medical condition. Ineffective treatment or non-treatment may lead to\nfurther fly attraction, infection, inadequate wound healing and animal discomfort.\n\u201cBeckles\u201d needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to determine the cause of the sore and an appropriate treatment\nplan established to help resolve the condition. Written documentation of veterinary evaluation and current treatment\nneed to be maintained and those records made available to the inspector upon request.\nCorrect by 07-25-2017."
