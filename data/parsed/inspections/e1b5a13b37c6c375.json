Upon closer examination, the internal part\nof the dog\u2019s left ear contained a large amount of dark brown, crusty material that extended approximately 1.5 inches\ntowards the jaw line. Thick, sticky, yellowish opaque liquid could be seen within the crust inside the ear canal. The\nskin within the ear was red, appearing irritated and inflamed. In the right ear, a moderate amount of crusty dark\nbrown material could also be seen inside the canal and staining the area around the ear. The condition affecting the\nears was not observed by the licensee, therefore the attending veterinarian was not consulted for treatment.\nThick buildup of material in the ears may be indicative of infection and/or other veterinary medical conditions that\ncan cause pain, discomfort, as well as damage to the ear. The licensee is responsible for developing appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nThe licensee must have Comet evaluated by a veterinarian to obtain a diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
