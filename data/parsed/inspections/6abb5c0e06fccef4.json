      "narrative": "There is one male cougar that is approximately 6 years old housed singly in an enclosure that has two plastic tank-type\nstructures for shelter. This animal is currently in poor body condition with ribs and vertebrae visible. There is a small\namount of bedding in each structure that is excessively wet and soiled. One shelter also contains a small amount of meat\nthat the licensee stated was left over from the prior feeding. The licensee states that he does not remove food, but rather\nleaves it until the animals eat it. The cougar was laying in one shelter when inspectors approached the enclosure, but got\nup and exited upon our approach. The animal had areas of soiled wet fur on its hind end from where it was laying.\nAdditionally, the remainder of enclosure was covered in snow. The cougar walked abnormally shaking each foot\nintermittently clearly reluctant to walk in the snow and showing signs of discomfort. There is currently no clean, dry place\nfor the cougar to walk or lay anywhere within it\u2019s enclosure or the shelters provided.\nThe 2 female brown bears and 1 male brown bear are co-housed in a single primary enclosure with three individual metal\nbarrels provided for the bears to use as shelters. The male and female black bears are currently co-housed in the same\nprimary enclosure with 2 metal barrels provided for the bears to use as shelter. The two juvenile brown bears have two\nshelters provided \u2013 one metal barrel and one square plastic tank type shelter. The smaller juvenile brown bear has a\nrough coat and is thin.\nAt the time of the last inspection the licensee implemented temporary measures to alleviate the suffering of the bears by\nwrapping the barrels with blankets for insulation and adding fresh bedding to the barrels provided for shelter from the\nelements. Due to recent snow the blankets have become wet and the bedding is now wet and soiled. There is snow\npresent in most of the barrels present for shelter. The majority of the hay/straw that had been added for bedding is now\nstrewn across the enclosures. What remains in the barrels is discolored and appears wet. The barrel which the adult\nmale black bear is currently housed in has no bedding in much of the barrel and there is a several inch hole now visible in\nthe bottom of the barrel. The licensee said that he has been there to care for the bears in the last 2 weeks but declined to\nspeculate when. He refused to answer whether he had cleaned or replaced bedding at any time since the last inspection\ninstead asking if there was a regulation for that.\nThe local ambient temperature was 2 degrees F at 9AM, 7 degrees at 10:45 AM (when the inspection began), and\napproximately 17 degrees F when the inspection concluded. Surface temperatures were taken for each of the metal\nbarrels in several locations using a RayTek IR Thermometer. The inside of the majority of the barrels were 18-24 degrees\nF. The warmest measurements were in the 31-34 degrees F for a barrel which was in direct sun. The combination of\nwet/soiled bedding and wet snow-covered blankets prevents them from providing appropriate insulation and therefore\nthey are no longer adequate.\nNatural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall\nbe provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.\nThe prior attempts to correct this noncompliance were temporary and have not been maintained. Correct by ensuring that\npermanent measures are implemented to prevent chronic reoccurrence of suffering due to continued deterioration of\nthese temporary measures which are not suitable to the weather. Ensure that there are an adequate number of\nappropriate shelters which are constructed and insulated using materials suitable to the climate. Enough shelters and\nshelter space must be provided so that all animals housed in the primary enclosure can access a shelter area at the same\ntime to allow them to escape the cold temperatures, and precipitation. These shelters must be able to be maintained in a\ndry and sanitary manner."

The licensee asked why that was\nwrong, how they should be housed, and stated he must have a reason. Inspectors explained that keeping them together\ncan provide warmth and social interaction, therefore, we would like to understand his reasons for separation.

The six-year-old male cougar had only ice \navailable in his water receptacle.  The licensee stated that the property owners last did chores the prior evening.  He \nrefused to state a time that chores were usually done.  The licensee provided water to all animals except the black bears \nat the request of inspectors.  Multiple animals drank at least some water when it was presented indicating thirst.  When\n\nthe six-year-old male cougar was offered water he immediately approached and began drinking.  He drank for a total of \n42 seconds only stopping briefly when one of the brown bears housed next to him startled him.  The length of time that \nthis animal drank for indicates the level of thirst and is abnormal for the time of year.  This animal is suffering due to a lack \nof potable water (at a drinkable temperature) being provided on a frequent enough basis.  If potable water is not always \naccessible to the animals, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Correct by \nensuring that potable water is offered to the animals as frequently as needed to sustain the health of the animals. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nDANA MILLEREnd Section",
