When encouraged to walk, the goat would touch her right rear toes to the ground but not bear weight on the leg.\nWhen standing, she would hold the leg slightly off the ground. Once caught and examined, the right rear leg was\nsignificantly swollen down near the foot and warm to the touch, compared to the normal left rear leg. Additionally, the\nanimal had yellow, crusty discharge around both eyes as well as mild nasal discharge. The facility representative told me\nthat he noticed the animal limping about 2 weeks ago and have been monitoring it since. The facility representative had\nnot noticed the eye and nasal discharge. The attending veterinarian had not been notified of the abnormal condition of the\nanimal and veterinary care has not been provided to evaluate the goat's leg.\nDaily observation of all animals shall be made to assess their health and well-being and promptly identify injuries,\ndisease, and other medical conditions. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and\naccurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nUntreated injuries, infections, and other conditions can be painful and cause suffering to the animal, and frequent\ncommunications with the attending veterinarian are required to allow for the veterinarian to advise licensees on needed\ntreatments for health concerns, which helps to mitigate the effects of adverse health conditions. Correct by ensuring the\nfemale goat is evaluated by a veterinarian and that treatments and care are followed.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
