Record review indicated that the animal activities are not being\nconducted as outlined in the protocol. The protocol states that all animals will be weighed weekly, however the three\nrecords reviewed indicate that animals were weighed on 6/21/16, and no weights have been recorded since that\ntime. The protocol also states that the animals will be sedated with a volume range of 0.25-0.5 mL of a\nKetamine:Rompun mixture, however the three records reviewed indicate that the animals received a dose of 1.1-1.2\nmL of the mixture for sedation prior to a surgical procedure. Continuing review of animal activities is necessary in\norder to ensure that all animal activities are conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations. The\nIACUC must conduct a review of the activities involved in the aforementioned protocol and ensure that all animal\nactivities are conducted as stated in the protocol, or that the protocol is amended to reflect the activities as they are\nconducted.\n***\nTo be corrected by 20 August 2016.\nThis routine inspection and exit briefing were conducted with Dr. Natalie Cooper and facility representatives."
