      "narrative": "An adult male sable domestic ferret had reddish brown dry scabs and patchy hair loss over the right shoulder blade\nand neck. The first area was approximately 0.5 inch by 0.5 inch in size and was located over the right shoulder\nblade. The second area was approximately 0.5 inch by 0.5 inch and was located over the back of the neck. Facility\nowner indicated that this animal had been acquired approximately 4-5 days earlier as part of a pair, and that both\nferrets were placed in the enclosure with another adult ferret. Facility owner indicated that no scabs or hair loss had\nbeen noted on this animal.\nDaily observation of all animals is important to ensure that conditions that can negatively affect health and\nwell-being are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or\nbehavior should be communicated to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be used to ensure\nadequate care. Injuries or diseases that not treated properly may be painful and can lead to infection or other\nveterinary care health problems. The facility must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\ndiseases and injuries.\nAt the time of inspection, the animal was placed in a separate enclosure and the facility owner agreed to contact the\nattending veterinarian promptly.\nCorrect by contacting a veterinarian for assessment and treatment as appropriate. Correct by Monday, January\n20th, 2020."
