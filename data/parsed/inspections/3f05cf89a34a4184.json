The owner was not aware the animal was there and when the animal was examined it was missing an eye.\nThe owner stated his employee must have found the animal and moved it to the enclosure and provided it food and\nwater. The concern is that the condition of the animal was not communicated to the owner and the attending\nveterinarian. Methods of communication need to be put in place when animals are sick or injured to assure their\nhealth care needs are being met. This animal should be assessed by the vet for his welfare.\nCorrect by: April 19, 2016\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection."
