In both areas, this could allow the public to walk directly to the camel\nenclosure fencing and contact the animal. Perimeter fences prevent unsupervised contact between the public and\nthe animals.\nAssure that the camel enclosure is surrounded by a continuous perimeter fence. The fence must be at least six feet\ntall and three feet away from the animal enclosure.\nTo be corrected: 6-1-17\n2. An eight foot section of perimeter fence adjacent to the Canadian lynx enclosure is in disrepair. The top of the\nwire fence has been stretched and is now curled toward the ground.
