The attending veterinarian was not aware that the licensee was\nperforming the procedure at the age of approximately 5 weeks, and would want to witness the procedure at that age\nbefore guidance and approval would be given. The attending veterinarian stated they witnessed the licensee doing\nthe procedure on 5 skunks that were 2 weeks of age, and was comfortable with the licensee preforming the\nprocedure on future animals at the same age without the veterinarian being present. The licensee did not follow the\nexact procedure that was approved by the veterinarian in respect to the age of the animals.\nNot following the directions of the attending veterinarian does not ensure adequate veterinary care.
