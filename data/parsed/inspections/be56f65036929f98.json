      "narrative": "- The IACUC did not conduct appropriate reviews of the animal activities for protocols 99-02 and 99-06 to ensure\nthat the investigators are following the approved protocols. The animal use activity involved dogs for these\nprotocols.\n- Protocol 99-02 stated in the _\"Protocol 99-02 Surgeries\" section Laboratory Exercise Identification_ states \"After a\nmaximum of two hours of inhalant anesthesia, the isofluorane will be discontinued and the animal will be allowed to\nwake up.\" There is indication in the animal health records that some animals were under anesthesia for periods\nlonger than two hours as approved in the protocol. For example, the following animals surgery and anesthesia logs\nwere reviewed. These logs indicate that the dog identified as Louise ( 2 year old American Staffordshire terrier\ncross) identification numbers 13-075 and A021675 was induced on 11-6-2013 at 1:10 pm and endotracheal tube\nremoved at 4:07pm. Louise(cid:25)s length of procedure according to the surgery log book was 2 hours and 21 minutes.\nHer length of time under was 2 hours and 57 minutes. Dog identified as Ladybird identification numbers 13-040 and\nA138678 was induced on 4-17-2013 at 1:14 pm and endotracheal tube removed at 4:40 pm. Ladybird's length of\nprocedure according to the surgery log book was 2 hours and 22 minutes. Dog identified as Norman animal control\nidentification numbers 13-042 and A005258 was induced on 4-24-2013 at 1:13 pm and endotracheal tube removed\nat 4:21 pm. 13-042's length of procedure according to the surgery log book was 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n- The IACUC approved animal use activity (protocol 99-06 appendix F) involving dogs did not list the medication\nHydroxymorphone as an approved drug in the \"Appendix F drugs to be used\" section of the protocol. According to\nsurgical records Hydroxymorphone was administered during induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia logs and medical\nrecords indicate that the dog identified as Louise ( 2 year old American Staffordshire terrier cross) identification\nnumbers 13-075 and A021675 received 0.85 mg of hydroxymorphone IM as part of the preanesthetic. Anesthesia\nlogs and medical logs indicate that the dog identified as Fresca ( 2 year old American Staffordshire terrier cross )\nidentification number C13-002759 received 0.90 mg of hydroxymorphone IM as part of the preanesthetic. Proposals\nto conduct activities using animals shall include a complete description of the procedures so that theIACUC can\ndetermine whether to approve the proposed procedures.\nTo be corrected from this time forward."
