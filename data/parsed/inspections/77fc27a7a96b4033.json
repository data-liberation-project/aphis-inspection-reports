I told her that I\nattempted to do an inspection, but no one was home and that there would be a non-compliance on the inspection report. I\nconfirmed her e-mail address to send the inspection report. She did not mention to me that she had moved, however, she\ndid say she wanted to cancel her registration. Later, the current tenant at the known address called to ask about the flyer I\nleft. I explained to him what it was for, and he told me that he did not know the registrant and that she must have moved\nat least 2 months ago because he has lived at the address for the past 2 months.\nThe registrant moved and did not provide a new address as required for an inspection to be conducted under the Animal\nWelfare Act. Current address and contact information are essential to enforcing the Animal Welfare Act efficiently and\ncost-effectively.\nThe registrant shall notify the Deputy Administrator of Animal Care by certified mail of any change in the name, address,\nor ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler within 10\ndays after making such change.
