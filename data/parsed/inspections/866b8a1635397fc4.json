Therefore,\nlack of prospective review and approval precludes the IACUC members to fulfill their function of safeguarding the\nwelfare of the animals. The IACUC must assure that no proposal-related activities occur prior to IACUC approval.\nCorrected at time of exit.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Superintendent."
