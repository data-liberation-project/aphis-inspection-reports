      "narrative": "Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The following animals at location 2 require veterinary care.\n1) A young adult sable female ferret #5718 in enclosure 178 in room 13 has a large dark red to brown scab on its\nleft ear near the ear canal. The pinna of both of ears are folded/thickened with a fleshy cauliflower-type\nappearance. The scab is on the central portion of this fleshy area that nearly obscures the ear canal and made\nvisualization of the canal difficult while the ferret was awake. This ferret had no treatment records for the ears.\nFacility personnel informed the APHIS officials that the cauliflower appearance to the ears was the result of the\nother ferrets chewing and/or sucking on the ears as weanlings. The facility personnel also informed the APHIS\nofficials that the ears are treated at the time of the initial injury, but ferret #5718 was not currently receiving\ntreatment and no one was aware that this animal had scabs present. Scabs such as this may result from trauma by\ncage mates or be self-induced from the animal scratching at its ear as can occur with discomfort/pain from\nexcessive ear wax and/or infection.\n2) Three male ferrets (all in room 11) were identified during inspection with varying degrees of hair loss on the tail.\n- A sable male with right ear tag # 4039 in enclosure #3 had no hair on the last 2/3 of his tail. The underlying\nskin was pink but otherwise appeared normal. This animal also had several toenails that were slightly long and one\nnail present on the 3rd digit of the right hind foot that was excessively long (nearly 2 cm long).\n- A sable male with no ear tag (cage card ID # H1797) in enclosure #161 and sable male with no ear tag (cage\ncard ID# P4579) in enclosure # 164 both had hair loss on the tail. Both animals had hair that was noticeably\nthinning along the last third of the tail and became progressively worst towards the tip which was nearly bare. The\nunderlying skin appeared normal.\nThere was no documentation that the facility had identified the hair loss on these animals. When pointed out to the\nfacility president he stated that they do occasionally observe a similar pattern of hair loss, but that they don'(cid:25) t\ntypically document this finding. Hair loss can occur for many reasons in ferrets and failure to properly identify the\ncondition, have animals examined, and properly monitor this condition may result in misdiagnosis and/or worsening\nof the condition. Excessively long toenails are at a higher risk of being broken or caught on enclosures and\ntherefore can cause unnecessary discomfort to animals.\nCorrect by having the four animals listed above examined by the attending veterinarian to accurately diagnose the\ncondition and provide an appropriate monitoring and treatment plan. Additionally, ensure that appropriate methods\nto properly identify and treat (including methods for routine grooming such as nail trims) are in place for all other\nanimals from this point forward.\nTo be completed by: November 2, 2015\nThe inspection was conducted on October 27, 2015. The exit interview was conducted on October 28, 2013 with\nthe facility president; Dana Miller, SACS; and Mary Geib, VMO.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMiller Dana, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
