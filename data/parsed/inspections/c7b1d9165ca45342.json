Some of the dogs are showing signs of\ndiscomfort from the high level of fumes by wincing or squinting rapidly in an abnormal manner. There is a mixture of\nfresh, old and dried urine covering most of the concrete floor surface in the enclosures. The excessive accumulation\nof urine in the enclosures is causing some of the dogs to become wet and soiled. The hair coat on the dogs that are\nwhite or light colored are discolored from lying on the affected areas. Most of the rubber mats in the enclosures are\ndamp and heavily soiled. There is an excessive accumulation of fur, grime and fecal material adhered to the lower\nhalf of the chain-link fencing material that is being used to contain the dogs. The licensee stated that it has been a\ncouple weeks since the enclosures were thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.\nCleaning and sanitization of surfaces that are in contact with the dogs is necessary to prevent the accumulation of\ndirt, debris, excreta and other disease hazards. Hard surfaces the dogs come in contact with must be spot-cleaned\ndaily. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces within the housing facility are cleaned and sanitized once every\ntwo weeks or more often if needed for the health and well-being of the dogs.\nExit briefing conducted with licensee"
