These lines were damaged when the pig escaped its enclosure by\nlifting a panel that was not appropriately secured due to a damaged locking mechanism. When the pig was\ndiscovered, these lines were immediately clamped off but the pig had already experienced a severe amount of\nblood loss and the decision was made to humanely euthanize the animal. Enclosures housing animals should be\nkept in good repair to contain the animals and protect them from injury. Since the time of the incident all similar\nenclosures have been reviewed by the facility and have been repaired if needed. No other incidents of escape have\noccurred.\nCorrect by: Has been corrected.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with various university personnel."
