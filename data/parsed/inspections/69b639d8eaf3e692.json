      "narrative": "Dog #133, an adult female Schnauzer \"Shai\" housed in pen 12 was noted to have numerous fleas crawling in the\ninguinal and ventral abdominal areas.\nDog #114, an adult female Dachshund \"Penny\" housed in pen 1 was seen biting repeatedly at her left rear leg.\nUpon examination the area was damp and numerous fleas were seen crawling in the inguinal and ventral abdominal\nareas.\nDog #153, an adult female Shih Tzu \"Pinky\" housed in pen 9 was noted to have numerous fleas crawling in the\ninguinal and ventral abdominal areas. A light colored dog, extensive areas of dark flea dirt were identified through\nout the skin. Slight matting of the hair was seen along the back, abdominal and inguinal areas and the licensee\nstated the mats were the result of chewing at fleas.\nThe licensee has been administering injectable praziquantel to her dogs for the treatment of tapeworms. The dogs\nhave probably acquired these internal parasites from continuing flea infestation on the premises. The licensee\nstated that she obtained the medication from her veterinarian, however, the use of this product is not included in the\nprogram of veterinary care and the bottle was not labeled for dispensing by the licensee. This product requires a\nprescription for use in dogs and should be labeled appropriately by the prescribing veterinarian to meet industry\nregulatory and safety standards .\nAt the last inspection the facility program for the control and treatment of fleas was noted to be ineffective. The\nlicensee has not yet consulted with the attending veterinarian to review the efficacy of the current program for\nexternal parasite control and the fleas appear more numerous. An effective program for parasite control must be\nimplemented to prevent discomfort and illness related to fleas such as anemia, flea transmitted diseases and\ntapeworms.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPannill Elizabeth, Veterinary Medical Officer"
