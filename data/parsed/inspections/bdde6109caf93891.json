The neonatal cub was\ntransported for approximately 2 hours and at the public event for approximately 1 hour, during this time, it was\ncontained in a cardboard box that was insulated on the bottom with layers of towels, a heating pad, and plastic\nlining to keep the box warm and dry. The neonatal cub was removed from the box for feeding during the public\nevent. Before returning to the facility, the licensee stopped by a car dealership event at which time the event host\nviewed the cub while in vehicle.\nOn both September 28th and September 29th, at the age of 8 and 9 days old, the licensee conducted a 10 minute\ntalk for the public at the facility during the scheduled feeding time of the neonatal cub. For these feedings, the cub\nwas removed from the nursery and taken outside for public viewing.\nOn October 1, 2019, the licensee allowed radio station personnel access to facility\u2019s on-site nursey to promote the\nnew cougar cub. At one point during the interview, the licensee placed the young animal next to the interviewer\u2019s\nface.\nDue to the young age of the cougar cub, she has a developing immune system and unable to effectively regulate\nher body temperature, these exposures to the public environment and transportation potentially exposed the\nneonatal cub to diseases and changes in temperature that could affect its health and well-being.\nNeonatal non-domestic cats should only be exhibited for periods of time and under conditions consistent with their\ngood health and well-being.\nThe inspection was conducted by Karla Wills, Jessica Gowins and facility representatives on October 8, 2019.
