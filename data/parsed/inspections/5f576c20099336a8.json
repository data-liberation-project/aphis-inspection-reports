Both of the housing\nfacilities at the site are double layered with slatted flooring and wash downs for each level. Some of the fecal\nmaterial was dried and the accumulated material was both on top and in between the slatted floor openings. The\nfeces were so prevalent throughout the flooring that it was difficult for the dogs in those three enclosures to walk\naround the outdoor portion of their enclosures without stepping in fecal material. The licensee stated that it had\nbeen \"quite awhile, not more than a week\" since she had removed feces from the outdoor housing area due to the\nwinter weather conditions. Accumulations of feces in the enclosures increases the dogs' chances of coming in\ncontact with contaminated material and therefore poses a health risk for the dogs. The licensee shall remove feces\nfrom the primary enclosures at least once daily.
