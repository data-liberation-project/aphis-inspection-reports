They licensee reports\nthat the paperwork exists but was off site at the time of the inspection. Proper record keeping is essential for\ntracking movement of animals, to facilitate the inspection process, and to evaluate the medical care of the animals.\nLicensee must maintain complete records for review. To be corrected on all future inspections.\n3.1(a)\nHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.\nOne of the posts supporting an outdoor enclosure has a support post that is on the edge of a hole in the dirt\nunderneath it.  There is a PVC pipe used as a structural post on the north side of one of the buildings that is cracked\nand structurally unsound.  There are several wires underneath one of the outdoor runs on south side of the upper\ndeck of the south building that are rusted through and affect the integrity of the run.  There are wires on the floors\nand dividers of several of the indoor and outdoor enclosures that have deteriorated and have sharp points that could\ninjure the dogs.  These areas of disrepair can make the enclosures structurally unsound or could injure the dogs.\nThe licensee must develop a system of monitoring and maintenance to ensure that facilities are kept in good repair,\nprotect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely at all times. To be corrected by 17 April 2014.\n3.1(c)(1)\nHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.\n\nThe floor on the interior portion of the enclosures behind the house has worn to the point that a porous material is\nexposed that is not impervious to moisture and cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized. Inability to clean and\nsanitize surfaces can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that the housing facilities be\nconstructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or\nreplaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 27 May 2014.\n3.1(c)(3)\nHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.\nA majority of the access doors both inside and outside of the north and south sheltered housing facilities have a\nbuildup of a dark brown grimy material.  Many of the dividing walls of the outdoor enclosures have a buildup of a\nbrownish material, feces, and/or hair stuck in the wire at the base of these walls.  A wall at the back of one of the\noutdoor ground pens have a heavy accumulation of dirt, hair and old, dried fecal material stuck in the wire at ground\nlevel. At least four plastic shelter structures have areas that are chewed to the point that the surface is roughened\nand can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. Dirt and grime were visualized in these areas.  Rodent\ndroppings have accumulated in and under the wash-downs of the south building.  In the north building the automatic\nwaterers are leaking and causing rust and a green slimy buildup on the wire floors.  Most of the water bowls in the\noutdoor enclosures have a green material in the bottom. Many of the metal self-feeders have grime or other material\non the interior where the food is stored. At least two plastic shelter structures in the outdoor enclosures have straw\nbedding that is dirty and clumped.  Wooden dividers in some of the whelping building enclosures are chewed, worn,\nand are no longer impervious to moisture.  \nFailure to appropriately clean and sanitize surfaces in housing facilities for dogs can result in an increase of the risk\nof contamination and disease. All surfaces that come in contact with the dogs including food and water receptacles\nand all other surfaces in the housing facilities must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized as needed but at least every\ntwo weeks to prevent an accumulation of grime and prevent disease, odors and pests.  Materials that get\ncontaminated must be replaced  and all other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when\nnecessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. To be corrected by 27 April 2014.\n3.1(f)\nHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.\nWaste materials including straw, gravel, dirt, and old, dried feces are present on the east side of the property next to\nand pushing through the wooden fence.  These piles are approximately three feet away from the dogs housed in the\noutdoor enclosures near the fence.  These materials could cause odors and can attract pests which could spread\ndisease.  Licensee must provide for the regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of waste materials in\na manner that minimizes contamination and disease risk. To be corrected by 27 April 2014.\n\nThe inspection was conducted with the licensee on 26 March 2014. A preliminary exit interview was also conducted\nat that time.
