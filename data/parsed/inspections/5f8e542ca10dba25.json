She was scheduled for another four-hour exhibition (10:00AM \u2013 2:00 PM) on Sunday, January 11th.\nThe licensee stated that Stella got multiple smaller, unscheduled breaks throughout the day, which the inspectors were\nunable to visually confirm due to the arrangement of the photo booth. However, sloths are nocturnal and sleep on average\n15-20 hours during the day.\n- \u201cStella\u201d also did not have the opportunity to hang or perch from elevated furniture for the duration of the event. Stella had\nfurniture to rest in/on, and spent a long portion of the event holding onto her caretaker inside and outside the tented\nexhibit area. However, sloth\u2019s natural behavior is to live solitary in trees and spend most of their time hanging from a tree\nbranch or similar.\n- The rabbits were in view of the public for the entirety of the inspection. The animals had a 45-minute break from public\nhandling (e.g. petting and holding) on Saturday, January 10th, but remained in view of and close to the public during this\nbreak. Their temporary enclosures did not contain hide areas to avoid public eye. They were observed in the corner of the\nenclosure, which can indicate an attempt to avoid public handling.\nExhibiting animals under conditions and time periods inconsistent with their natural wake-sleep cycles, natural behaviors,\nand without opportunity to avoid public viewing, can affect their physical and psychological health.\nMeasures were taken to correct this for the remainder of the exhibition. Continue to correct this from this day forward\n(January 14th, 2025) by exhibiting animals for periods of time and under conditions consistent with their good health and\nwell-being."
