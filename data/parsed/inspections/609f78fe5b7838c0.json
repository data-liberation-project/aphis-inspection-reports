Adjacent to that there was another shed with a tin roof with sharp\nedges that could potentially harm an animal if it were to run into it. Midway on the west side of the llama's primary\nenclosure there was an extension of the fence made of cow panel that had pointy ends that an animal could also\nrun into it and potentially harm themselves. The outdoor facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the\nanimals that are contained within. Correct by 7/13/2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Head Keeper."
