In this case, the\nresponsible staff member failed to follow required procedures, resulting in the death of the guinea pig. This is an\nadverse event that caused the animal to experience overheating, physical harm, and unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect by ensuring that handling of all animals is done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that\ndoes not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary\ndiscomfort.\nNote: The IACUC reviewed the incident and reported it to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare on 1 July 2015.\nCorrective actions were taken including termination of the responsible employee and re-training of all animal and\nsupport staff and supervisors.\nCorrect from this point forward.\nThe facility inspection was conducted on 16 September.
