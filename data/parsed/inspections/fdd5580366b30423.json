The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel\npoles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest\nupon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep\nroots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is\napproximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. The enclosure currently houses a ~4 year old male lion and a ~ 3\nyear old female lion with limited mobility. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure\ncontainment of the animal. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats, additional\ncontainment measures must be made to the lion enclosure to prevent escape.\nNOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were\nmade.The exit briefing was conducted with the owner.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner."
