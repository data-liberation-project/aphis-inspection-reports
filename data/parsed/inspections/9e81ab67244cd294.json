Due to weather on the day of inspection, only a limited interaction between\ndogs and elephants could be observed by APHIS officials. The manager was asked to demonstrate an example of\nthis type of interaction, and so he called one of the dogs to create a barrier between the husbandry staff and an\nelephant which had reached its trunk through the enclosure bars. The dog showed aggressive behavior, growling\nand lunging at one elephant and entering its enclosure before being called by the manager. The manager also\nreported the dogs' having bitten the elephants during the course of their work. Furthermore, a CBS News clip from\nMay 13, 2014, which was verified by the facility representatives, showed the elephants exhibiting signs of distress\nwhen charged by one of the dogs, including ear flapping, trumpeting, and turning and running away. The manager\nwas clear that the dogs are not herding the elephants but are protecting the keepers during free contact. Having the\ndogs interact with the elephants by unrestrained lunging and biting may cause undue stress to the elephants. All\nanimal handling must be done in a manner that does not cause behavioral stress.\nCorrect by: from this point forward."
