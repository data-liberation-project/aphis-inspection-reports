The other opossum's enclosure had an electrical cord and power\noutlet bar which were attached to a trellis on the wall. Staff stated that this opossum is not able to climb, and\ntherefore unable to reach the electrical equipment.\nEnclosures should be free of hazards that could be harmful to the animals. Animal behavior cannot always be\npredicted, with regard to climbing, or sudden interest in features in the enclosure that were previously ignored by the\nanimal. Chewing an electrical wire could cause electrocution, or severe injuries. Steps should be taken to prevent\nthe possibility of an animal chewing an electrical wire, such as removal, concealing inside a wall, or enclosing in\nchew-proof conduit.\nTo be corrected by 2/23/16.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
