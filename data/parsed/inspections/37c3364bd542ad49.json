A USDA inspector\nvisit to the facility on November 19, 2024, confirmed budgerigars were on public display at the facility and that customers\nwere encouraged to enter the budgerigar enclosure to feed and interact with the birds. The owner stated that she was not\naware of any deaths or customer complaints related to events held at the facility on October 20. An accurate count of\nbudgerigars in the enclosure was not possible at the time of the USDA visit on November 19, due to the flight activity of\nthe large number of birds held within the enclose. The owner reported there were 200 budgerigars within the enclosure at\nthis time. 36 guinea pigs were also observed to be on exhibit in a separate enclosure at the facility on November 19.\nGuinea pigs and budgerigars on public exhibit are considered regulated species under the Animal Welfare Act.
