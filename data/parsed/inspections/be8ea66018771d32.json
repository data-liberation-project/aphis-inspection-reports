The upper canine teeth had a buildup of dark\ncolored tartar along the gum line and extending half way down the teeth. Several of the lower cheek teeth on both sides\nwere loose and moved easily when touched by the inspector. The gums under these teeth are receding and inflamed and\nbled during the examination.\nPoor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues.
