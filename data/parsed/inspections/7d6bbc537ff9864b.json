The animal was loaded into a transport cage and placed into a vehicle for transport to the Department of\nVeterinary Medicine. No accompanying movement paperwork or cage identification was used to identify the cage as\nbeing occupied. The facility's SOP for transport states that animals shall not be transported without appropriate\npaperwork. Two additional animals were placed in the same vehicle for transport. The two additional animals were\nunloaded on arrival at the Department of Veterinary Medicine; however, this animal was inadvertently left inside the\ntransport vehicle, and was not discovered until the following day between 8:00-8:30 am. Upon discovery he was\ndehydrated and in need of immediate medical attention. Although he received veterinary care, he did not recover\nfrom his condition, and was found dead at approximately 7:15 on 18 September 2012. Since this animal was left\nunattended in a vehicle for approximately twenty two hours, he was not handled in a manner which prevented\nphysical harm or unnecessary discomfort, which likely contributed to his death. The licensee must ensure that all\nanimals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible, and in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort at all times.\n*****\nAt the time of inspection, the facility had taken action to address this incident.\nThis focused inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHoward Tami, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
