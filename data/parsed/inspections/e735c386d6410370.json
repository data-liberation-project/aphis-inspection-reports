      "narrative": "A total of 6 animals were identified in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection. These included:\n*** A female grey agouti short-haired lop-eared rabbit in enclosure #LS4 had a large facial swelling (larger than a\ngolf-ball) which encompasses its right eye. The area around the eye appeared red, inflamed, and moist with\ncreamy opaque white to yellow discharge. The eye itself was not visible within the swollen tissue. The left eye also\nhas a much lesser amount of pink to red swollen tissue at the corner towards the nose. The fur surrounding the left\neye was also ruffled with discharge. This rabbit was hunched in the back corner of its enclosure. Overall the fur was\nunkempt and the rabbit was not engaged in its surroundings. This lack of movement, posture, and condition of the\neye and facial swelling indicates that the animal is experiencing pain and suffering. The facility notes included a\nnotation on 12/4 \u201cEar mites Ivomec Drops\u201d and again on 12/21 \u201cEar mites gone\u201d. There were no notations\nconcerning the eye or presence of the facial swelling. The licensee stated that he had observed this lesion and that\nhe believed it was improving. When asked, he stated that he had not provided any treatment for the eye nor any\npain medications to this rabbit since she was bred and is due to give birth soon. He stated that he is generally\nreluctant to give any medication to pregnant animals. The licensee further stated that he had not reported the rabbit\nto the attending veterinarian and had not received guidance from the attending veterinarians about the care for this\nanimal.\n*** A female broken pattern (brown & grey color) Lionhead rabbit housed in enclosure #MM2 had a large injury on\nthe back of her neck. There was a hole in the skin of this animal that was approximately 1.5 x 2 cm and irregularly\nshaped. The rim of this hole was bright read with some darker areas that appeared to be blood and scabs. Inside\nthe hole was a collection of creamy opaque material covering deeper tissue. Surrounding the hole was an area that\nthe skin was bright pink and firm with complete hair loss (approximately 3 x 5 cm) and a larger area of incomplete\nhair loss and firm, but normally colored skin surrounding that. The facility notes included a notation on 12/14\n\u201cmonitor bite on back\u201d. The licensee stated that he had observed this lesion and that he believed it to be an\nabscess that had ruptured, but that it was improving. He stated that he had not provided any treatment to this rabbit\nsince she was bred and is due to give birth soon. The licensee further stated that he had not reported the rabbit to\nthe attending veterinarian and had not received guidance from the attending veterinarians about the care for this\nanimal.\n*** A white and black female Lionhead rabbit housed with her litter in enclosure WS11 significant discharge in the\nright eye and nose. There was a small accumulation of mucoid discharge at the corner of the eye towards the nose.\nThe fur surrounding this eye had a wet appearance and additionally the white hair both above and below the eye\nhad brown discoloration consistent with dried discharge that the rabbit had failed to clean. Both nostrils had a\nmoderate accumulation of brown discharge. The accumulated discharge and lack of normal grooming behavior is\nan indicator to the severity of the animal\u2019s illness. The licensee stated that this rabbit is not currently receiving any\ntreatment.\n*** A white, short haired rabbit housed in the MM enclosure row had a severe accumulation of dark brown material\non its hind end covering its tail and extending partially up its abdomen and down both legs to at least the hocks.\nThis material appeared to be diarrhea and extended to the skin in several areas. The licensee stated that he had\nnot observed this prior to the inspection and that the rabbit was not currently receiving any treatment. There were\ntwo other rabbits housed with this rabbit that did not appear affected.\n*** A female brown and white rabbit housed in enclosure LL1 had brown crusts around both nostrils. The rabbit was\nheard and seen sneezing repeatedly several times during the inspection. The licensee stated that he was aware\nthat several animals (including this rabbit) were sneezing, but that he did not routinely treat rabbits for respiratory\nconcerns. He stated that he was not treating this rabbit because she was bred and due to give birth on the 14th and\nthat he had not discussed it with the attending veterinarian.\n*** A light brown and white rabbit housed in enclosure MM12 had a cloudy discoloration over the lower portion of\nher left eye. Before being disturbed, the rabbit was holding this eye partially closed and was observed repeatedly\nturning the eye away from the inspector. The eye being held partially shut is a common sign of discomfort and the\npostural adjustment is frequently observed in rabbits with eye problems, injury, and/or loss of vision. On closer\nexamination there was a cloudy discoloration in the lower fourth of the left eye and the eye membranes appeared\nreddened. Additionally the eye had a dull-dry appearance. The licensee stated that this was an old problem that he\ndid not believe was active. He stated that he had not reported it to the veterinarian and that the rabbit was not\ncurrently receiving any treatment.\nNone of these six rabbits were receiving adequate veterinary care for the various conditions outlined above.\nAlthough the licensee was aware of many of the conditions, the licensee had not sought veterinary guidance for\ntheir treatment and none of these findings had been communicated to the attending veterinarian. All licensees are\nrequired to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Additionally,\nsection 2.40(b)(3) requires that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending\nveterinarian so timely and accurate information is conveyed on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being.\nFailure to communicate abnormal findings and implement appropriate treatment can result in worsening of\nconditions and unnecessary animal suffering.\nCorrect by ensuring that the animals listed above are examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate methods\nare used to treat each condition listed above.\nTo be completed by: January 6, 2018.\n*** Facility records show that a total of five rabbits were treated by the licensee with Ivomec drops for ear mites\nbetween October and December 2017. When asked, the licensee produced a bottle of Ivomec brand ivermectin\nand confirmed that this was the only bottle of ivermectin currently in use at the facility. This bottle expired July\n2002. When that was pointed out to the licensee, he stated it still seemed to be working. The use of expired\nmedications is not considered to be and appropriate method to treat or prevent disease and therefore is not\nadequate veterinary care. Additionally, there is insufficient written guidance in the program of veterinary care\nregarding appropriate methods to treat ear mites. Under the heading ectoparasites, the current PVC states only\n\u201cEar mites \u2013 as needed\u201d but provides no information on the medication to use, dose, route, frequency, or duration of\nuse, nor any information on the signs which would indicate that treatment is needed. Adequate written guidance is\nnecessary to ensure that the licensee is following the instructions of the attending veterinarian to ensure adequate\ntreatment, control, and prevention of animal disease. Correct by seeking additional written guidance regarding\ntreatment of common conditions and ensuring that all medications used to treat animals are not expired.\nCorrect by: January 18, 2018."
