It was found that a device with an obsolete design had been\nused in the animal(cid:25)s primary enclosure. That device had enough unprotected chain length for an entrapment\naccident to occur. Immediate changes to the enrichment plan were to include fastener length in the maximum chain\nlength left unprotected by a PVC sleeve, and to make the enrichment storage area accessible to only the behavioral\nsciences group to ensure that only approved toys and other enrichment devices are dispensed for animal use.\nEnvironmental enrichment is an important part of housing non-human primates. Design of enrichment devices must\ninvolve careful scrutiny for safety for use with these animals; they can cause harm if not carefully constructed and\nmonitored with use to ensure they have not become unsafe.\nThe facility must ensure that all enrichment devices are safely constructed and maintained in order to protect the\nnon-human primates from injury. This NCI was corrected prior to the time of inspection.\nA progress report on the comprehensive alopecia study was reviewed.\nThe inspection was conducted by Drs. Gwynn Hallberg and Heather Cole on January 12-14, 2016 and was\naccompanied by facility personnel. The exit briefing was conducted on 1/14/2016 with facility personnel.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
