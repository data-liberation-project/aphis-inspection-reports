      "narrative": "At approximately 1pm on Thursday 9/8/22, the inspector found a dead male black llama (auction tag 5930) in an\nenclosure in the alpaca/llama annex. No auction staff or public were in the area. The inspector went into the office to find\nthe licensee but was told she was not on site. The inspector returned to the annex and found a young male staff member\nlooking at the llama. When asked about the llama, he stated that the llama had spent the morning constantly sitting down\nand that whenever anyone asked him to get up he would sit down again. He stated they were able to get the llama into\nthe sale ring but that \u201che must have finally died\u201d after being returned to the enclosure. When asked if he had reported any\nof these observations to a supervisor or the auction owners he stated that he assumed they already knew. The inspector\nlater learned from the licensee that the llama had sold at 11:41 am. The licensee was not aware that the auction staff had\nnoted the abnormal behavior of the llama prior to the sale and thus the attending veterinarian was not notified. Any\nabnormalities observed related to animal health, behavior and well-being should be conveyed in a timely and accurate\nmanner to the attending veterinarian to allow for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The observation of animals may be\naccomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian such as staff members but there must be a mechanism in\nplace to pass the information on to the attending veterinarian. Daily observation of all animals is necessary to assess their\nhealth and well-being; if any problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are noted, they must be conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner."

He\nconsulted a clipboard he was holding and attempted to separate and remove a particular goat from the group in the\nenclosure. Another goat attempted to sneak out the partially open gate behind the employee. The employee kicked this\ngoat away from the gate to keep it from escaping the enclosure. When the employee noticed the inspector present in the\narea, he stopped the behavior.\n*Numerous dogs were noted running off lead on the auction facility grounds including in the aisles of the barn where the\nlarge species were run out of the ring, in the aisles of the barn housing the larger hoofstock species and in the warm room\nhousing the smaller exotic/wild species. One of the dogs who apparently belonged to a worker (black and grey heeler)\nwas seen nipping at the heels of a zebra that was exiting the auction ring and returning to its enclosure/stall. Another dog\n(white with tan markings lab size mixed breed dog) belonging to a family looking at animals in the barn was running\naround sniffing at/looking into all the stalls. Two dogs were noted in the warm room. One small black and grey dog sat\nnext to crates housing foxes being auctioned. The larger white with light brown spots dog was sniffing at and using his\nnose to push on enclosures housing animals that were set on the floor in the warm room. Dogs should not have access to\nthe consigned animals. The dogs may cause discomfort and stress to the consigned animals, may injure the consigned\nanimals and depending on the species may transmit diseases/parasites to the auction animals.\n*A pen/enclosure housing sheep and goats was overcrowded. There were so many sheep being confined and held in the\nenclosure that the sheep had no room to turn around or lie down. The animals took up all the floor space from side to side\nand back to front with the exception of the corner with the water bucket. It was difficult to see all the animals as some\nwere hidden underneath/behind each other. Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort and overheating of the animals.\n*A loose goat was noted in the aisles in the goat/sheep annex. The goat attempted to crawl under an enclosure fence that\nit did not fit under when it saw the inspector. It almost got stuck but was able to get loose. Another enclosure was noted to\nhave an unlatched gate that someone left open. This allowed the goat to escape the enclosure and possibly come to\nphysical harm or escape the building.\nAll animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort."
