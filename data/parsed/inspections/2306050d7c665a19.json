From 04/19/16 through 04/21/16, facility records indicate that the animal was not eating its biscuits and\nthe animal would intermittently consume its food enrichment (4/19 & 4/21 the animal did not eat biscuits or\nenrichment). On 04/22/16, the animal was found dead in its enclosure. Verbal conversations with the Study Director\nand attending veterinarian, confirmed these observations would be considered a loss of appetite. According to the\nIACUC approved protocol and amendments, when an adverse complication of \u201closs of appetite\u201d occurs, the study\ndirector and clinical veterinarian must be contacted. Additionally, during the review and approval process for this\nprotocol, the attending veterinarian stated \u201cIf the animals are not coping well with the initial insult, please contact the\nveterinary staff.\u201d\nVerbal conversations with the Study Director and attending veterinarian and the medical record for this animal\nconfirm that the clinical veterinarian was not consulted regarding the loss of appetite (last notation was on 4/18/16).\nThe facility could not supply any additional documents regarding this incident.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Failure to properly communicate health problems to the appropriate personnel, can result in prolonged pain\nand suffering and increase the risk of development of serious medical conditions.\nThe facility must ensure that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and\nwell-being, is communicated to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided and\npain and distress is minimized.\nThe inspection was conducted from 10/12-10/13/16.\nA thorough exit interview regarding the non-compliance was conducted with facility representatives on 10/13/16.\nAdditional Inspectors\nEngel D.V.M Dominique, Hpa Gov User\nTims Tanya, Assistant Director"
