      "narrative": "***An intact adult male white sheep was lame on his right front limb at the walk. The ram was non-weight bearing on\nthe right front limb while standing. Facility representatives had not noticed that the ram was lame until the time of\nthe USDA inspection.\nLameness and non-weight bearing is an indication of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes\nincluding both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to observe and properly communicate animal health issues to\nthe attending veterinarian in a timely manner can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the animal and\npotentially worsen a current medical condition.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. The facility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns\nare found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nThis ram must be examined by a veterinarian no later than 6:00PM on July 14, 2017.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted on July 12, 2017. This report is limited to the direct noncompliant\nitems identified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items will follow. The\ninspection and the exit interview were conducted with the facility representative, APHIS intern, and APHIS inspector\non July 12, 2017."
