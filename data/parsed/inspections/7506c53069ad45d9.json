Although the hair is not matted, it is very long and heavy over the majority of his body and needs\nto be sheared each summer to prevent overheating and to observe the skin condition under the heavy coat. The\nveterinarian was contacted during this inspection and states she does not recommend shearing it now this late in\nthe summer as temperatures are starting to cool down and winters here are cold. The llama will need to be\nsheared before the heat of next summer.\nOne enclosure contains 31 large rabbits with about half of them being long haired rabbits. Many of the long haired\nrabbits have some matts in their fur, especially near the rear ends. All rabbits need to have fur matts removed as\nmatted fur can lead to serious underlying skin lesions.\nOne white rabbit has a split ear with black crusted edges where it was cut. This rabbit needs to be seen by the\nveterinarian to provide treatment for the injured ear.
