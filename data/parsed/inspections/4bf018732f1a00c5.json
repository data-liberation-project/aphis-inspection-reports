Currently there is a large\nleaved tree that is providing appropriate shade for the animals, and there is a low sloped area in the SE corner\nwhere they can get down out of the wind. There does need to be a more permanent structure to protect the animals\nin inclement weather.\nThe lack of appropriate weather barriers or structures to protect the animals from inclement weather can cause the\nanimals to be in discomfort or expose them to harsh conditions that could be avoided with access to sheltered\nconditions.\nThe licensee needs to provide a large enough and strong enough shelter for both the bison and watusi to be able to\nutilize to get away from severe weather and wind conditions.\nThe perimeter fence variance request is still under review.\nThe inspection and exit interview was conducted with the CEO of the facility."
