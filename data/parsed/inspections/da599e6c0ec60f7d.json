Specifically, for\npost-surgical support and treatment of severe fight wounds, the protocol specifies a table of analgesics and\ndosages.\nThe following was noted upon reviewing medical records:\nOn 3/12/14 in Cage ID \"Acomys 2\" it was observed that one of two males had several fight wounds, including (cid:28)\"right\naxillary (very deep, able to visualize muscle)\"(cid:29). The Attending Veterinarian recommended carprofen gel, which is\nspecified in the protocol as appropriate analgesia. The research group (cid:28)requested no treatment(cid:29). Five days later\nthere is a notation that the investigator requested no carprofen gel due to the mouse having a cranial cap. This is\ndespite the fact that the protocol lists carprofen as a specified appropriate analgesic for this procedure.\nOn 3/12/14 in Cage ID \"Acomys 10\" there is a notation that two males have several fight wounds, and one has a leg\nwound with intermittent lameness. The Attending Veterinarian recommends carprofen gel for 5 to 7 days for the\nlame mouse. There is a request for the research team to approve this treatment within 20 hours. Two days later\none mouse was euthanized, and the other (cid:28)\"recovered\"(cid:29). No analgesics appear to have been administered.\nOn 4/16/14 in Cage ID \"Acomys 42B\" there were two pups noted with (cid:28)\"multiple large surface area lesions\n(superficial to moderate)\"(cid:29). The Attending Veterinarian recommends treatment with Carprofen gel for two to three\ndays. The next day the research team replied that they \"(cid:28)declined carprofen gel at this time\"(cid:29).\nIn the 5/13/14 IACUC meeting minutes these same researches request a modification to the protocol to \"(cid:28)remove\nanti-inflammatory agents\"(cid:29) for part of the study, in order to \"(cid:28)elucidate the differences in inflammatory responses\"(cid:29).\nThese examples demonstrate that the research team was not following the IACUC-approved protocol which\nspecified treatment for pain and distress. The reluctance of the researches to employ analgesics, and the delay in\ntreatment, likely caused unnecessary pain and distress to these animals.\nUnless an acceptable justification is provided in writing for withholding appropriate treatment for pain and distress,\nand until the time that such a justification has been reviewed and approved by the IACUC, the researchers cannot\nvary from what is clearly described in the protocol.\nAnimals should be provided with appropriate treatment to relieve pain and distress in a timely manner, as described\nin the approved protocol.\nA similar issue was previously cited under this section on 11/26/13, and was to be corrected from that time forward.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representatives."
