It had an electric heating pad\nunder it\u2019s back during that procedure. The amount of heat is usually monitored by veterinary staff during a procedure, but\nin the investigation into this case, the zoo attending veterinarian and leadership staff concluded that proper monitoring\nwas not done, resulting in the severe burn to the monkey\u2019s back.\nEach exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to\nprevent and treat diseases. Established procedures for monitoring patients under anesthesia need to be followed at all\ntimes. All veterinary staff were retrained on use and monitoring of the heating pad.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
