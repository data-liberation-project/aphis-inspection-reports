In late May\nof 2023, a 10-year-old overweight male macaque was moved from indoor housing to outdoor housing after attempted\nweight loss with reduced chow indoors was not successful. He was placed in an ~400 square foot enclosure with 14\njuvenile macaques to facilitate increased movement and socialization, with sufficient food available at all times. While\noutside, daily observations were documented by the care and behavioral staff at least twice daily and the newly formed\ngroup was initially closely monitored for compatibility, with no issues identified. On August 22, 2023, the adult macaque\nwas presented to the veterinarians by the staff that conducts the daily observations for concerns of lethargy, diarrhea, and\npossible weight loss. At that time he weighed 8.17kg representing significant weight loss over the 3 month period. The\nveterinarians initiated appropriate supportive care and diagnostics to address the weight loss but the macaque appeared\nto have entered a metabolic fatty liver syndrome and was humanely euthanized on August 23, 2023. A necropsy was\nperformed and identified extensive liver and kidney amyloidosis, bronchopneumonia, and colitis but no specific cause was\nidentified. Although daily observations were performed, the significant weight loss was not observed and therefore it was\nnot conveyed to the veterinarians in a timely manner, resulting in humane euthanasia. Daily observations that effectively\nassess the health and well-being of the covered animals and convey timely and accurate information on health problems\nto the attending veterinarian is required under the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect by 30 October 2023"

Both animals were enrolled in an approved IACUC protocol, and the practice of\ntransporting two animals to imaging followed the facility procedures that had been in place for an extended period of time.\nUpon arrival at the facility, the staff left the heater on, as the external temperature was approximately 61 degrees F and\ntook one monkey inside, while a geriatric female rhesus macaque was left in the van. During the anesthetized procedure,\nthe first monkey had complications and the staff left the van unattended for longer than usual. The animal in the van was\nchecked multiple times and on the second check, was found unresponsive and appropriate veterinary care was\nimmediately initiated. Despite immediate cooling and resuscitative procedures, the temperature initially was consistent\nwith hyperthermia and was stabilized to below normal within 90 minutes, but the animal never regained consciousness\nand was humanely euthanized. The heater in the van is not thermostatically controlled and the temperature rose over the\ncourse of the extended study in the first animal, resulting in hyperthermia in the monkey remaining in the van. The\nnecropsy indicated significant comorbidities in the animal, but confirmed that the cause of death was likely heat related.\nThe facility temporarily stopped transporting animals offsite and immediately stopped the practice of transporting two\nanimals at a time. The particular van was taken out of use in order to measure the temperatures in similar conditions and\nheat was documented rapidly developing within the van, which likely exposed the animal to temperatures in excess of the\nregulatory standard of 85 degrees F for greater than 45 minutes. Temperature monitoring was initiated in the cargo area\nand thermostatically controlled heaters and air conditioning units are to be utilized in the future.\nCorrected at the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with IACUC and primate center staff.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nGeoffrey Olsen, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER\nWilliam Campbell, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER\nEduardo Vivas, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
