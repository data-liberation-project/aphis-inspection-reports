The fur was shedding with a localized area\nof matting, especially around the tail and back legs. Upon touching the rabbit, its ribs, spine, and hip bones could be felt\nunder its coat. The licensee stated the rabbit is eating so it is fine.\n\u2022 A male brown and white rabbit with black ear tips had a raised firm hairless mass between his right eye and above his\nnose, approximately 1 inch in diameter protruding about \u00bd inch. Also, on his back, above the right rear leg, the rabbit had\na thickened area of raised skin that had a center that was moist, hairless, and had a depression in the center that was red\nwith blackish-gray material coating it. This thickened area overall was approximately 2 inches in diameter by 1 inch high.\nWhen the inspector noted these areas, the licensee stated all the rabbits were okay and that they bite each other.\nThe licensee had not identified the conditions affecting these two rabbits and therefore, had not contacted the veterinarian\nfor guidance on care. Failure to promptly identify such conditions delays appropriate treatment and may cause undue\ndiscomfort to the animals. Daily observation of all animals is necessary to assess their health and well-being. If any\nproblems of animal health, behavior, or well-being are noted, they must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a\ntimely and accurate manner to allow for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Both rabbits' conditions identified above\nshould be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so she can determine the next steps for diagnoses, and treatment plans.\nCorrect by: 10/5/2025."
