      "narrative": "At the time of inspection it was noted that the elephant \"Bunny\" at times appears to have limited range of motion in\nher right front limb. During the performance she would sometimes not bend her right carpal joint in the same\nmanner as she uses her left limb. While walking, she sometimes extends the right front limb in a peg-like fashion.\nThese actions are intermittent, but consistently recurring, and they are suggestive of some underlying problem that\nmay be causing discomfort.\nThe exhibitor had not noticed any change in Bunny's gait, and there was no history of Bunny having gait problems\nof this type. The attending veterinarian stated that she had examined Bunny in January, and did not observe any\ngait abnormalities at that time, and she was not aware of any current problems with Bunny.\nAdequate veterinary care for the elephants is to include daily observation with assessment and recognition of any\npossible health problems, with these problems promptly reported to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate\ndiagnostics and any necessary treatment can occur in a timely manner in order to safeguard the animal's\nwell-being. Failure to recognize changes in gait or health could delay treatment, potentially resulting in worsening\nmedical conditions, and / or discomfort for the animal.\nThe elephant \"Bunny\" should be assessed by a veterinarian by 7/10/16, with appropriate treatment and follow-up to\noccur in a timely manner.\nThis inspection occurred in Baraboo, WI at the Circus World venue.\nElephants present were Bunny, 48 yrs, and Libby, 49 yrs.\nAn exit interview was conducted with the elephant handler."
