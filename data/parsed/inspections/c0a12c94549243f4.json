On Thursday as the inspectors were walking down this walkway, two\nmale peacocks were identified in their enclosures with their tail feathers extending into the walkway where people walking\nby could run into them. At least one of the tailfeathers appeared broken/damaged. On Friday, another male peacock was\nseen with its tailfeathers projecting into the walkway at ground level and partially covered by shavings. One person almost\nstepped on the tailfeathers. These birds were not able to move out of the way of people in the walkway due to the\nconstruction and placement of the enclosures and there was no sufficient barrier or distance between the birds and the\npeople. The birds may be injured if stepped on or knocked into by the public.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort."
