At the time of the last inspection on 4/27/17 the cub was exhibiting\nsome lameness in its hindquarters, and had a history of intermittent lameness in the front as well. The exhibitor was\nasked to have a diagnostic work up completed by a veterinarian who is experienced with this species, by 5/1/17.\nRadiographs and blood work were completed by that date, but the results were inconclusive. The animal is currently\nunwilling to stand, and clearly in discomfort. The animal is currently on pain medication, but its condition has not\nimproved, and at the time of the inspection the animal had not been observed by the veterinarian since 5/31/17.\nThe licensee must have a consultant veterinarian with more experience with big cat nutrition and medicine review\nevery aspect of this case and to determine an appropriate treatment plan including specific guidance about medical\ncare, treatment, diagnostics, diet and nutritional supplements for this animal. The licensee must immediately follow\nthe exact recommendations of the expert veterinarian. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing,\nto the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, any diagnostic tests and\nthe outcome of those tests that were performed, any medications or supplements prescribed along with the dosing\ninstructions, the treatment plan, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the\nmedication or supplement is administered to the animals, showing the amounts, and who administered it.\nAll animals should be observed on a daily basis, with any problems conveyed to the attending veterinarian, or\nhis/her designee, in a timely manner. Failure to consult with a veterinarian, and provide appropriate diagnostics and\ntreatment can result in a poor outcome for animals.\nThe licensee must ensure all animals at the facility are provided with adequate care to include ensuring that timely\nand accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian.\nTo be corrected by 6/21/17."

It was discovered that over the past week\nthe exhibitor has been giving the animal about 30 grams of calcium gluconate daily when the dose it actually\nneeded was 100 grams daily.\nFailure to provide an appropriate diet can lead to serious medical problems for the animals, especially growing\ncubs, which are susceptible to metabolic bone disease, which can cause lameness and fragile bones. The exhibitor\nmust ensure that diets have sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet should be\nprepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.
