He was brought to a nearby\nveterinary clinic on 2/16/15, but euthanized at the same clinic about a week later after failure to respond to\ntreatment. Although there were several days between observation of Tahzay's illness and his veterinary care\nappointment, the attending veterinarian had not been notified of Tahzay's condition at any time during his illness.\n**It was explained that one of the dogs, currently under observation for post- surgical treatment, had experienced a\nlarge amount of diarrhea the previous day and had last been observed eating by staff two days ago. The attending\nveterinarian had not been notified of this condition until time of inspection and recommended a change in treatment\nat time of inspection.\nDaily observation of the animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided\nthat a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on\nproblems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nFailure to communicate illness, whether it appears mild or serious, to the attending veterinarian, could result in\nimproper care of the animals. For example, this could lead to failure to seek professional veterinary care in a timely\nmanner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the animal's condition. A procedure should be adopted\nby which changes in health status or behavior of an animal are immediately reported to the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by 3/28/15"
