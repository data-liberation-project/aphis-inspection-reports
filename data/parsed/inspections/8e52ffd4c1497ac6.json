The owner noticed several days prior to\ngoing out of town August 28th that \"Bogdan\" was eating less and drinking more, appeared to be losing weight and\nwas more distant from his cagemate \"Sable\". The owner stated upon returning on August 29th, \"Bogdan\" was still\nnot eating and drinking normally and was subsequently found dead the morning of August 30th. The veterinarian\nwas not contacted when it was initially noted that \"Bogdan\" was not eating and drinking normally. The veterinarian\nwas eventually contacted via phone and indicated based on the information conveyed by the owner that the death\nof \"Bogdan\" may have been attributed to kidney failure. No clinical workup or necropsy was performed by the\nveterinarian. A veterinarian was not contacted in a timely manner for a proper diagnosis or treatment.\nThe lack of proper diagnosis or treatment of an animal in a timely manner can cause unnecessary pain or\ndiscomfort for the animal.\nThe veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the animal. Proper records should be kept\nof the diagnosis and treatment, if required, after the veterinarians consultation.\nThis inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.\nNote: The previous 2.40 (b)(2) non-complaint item cited on inspection report dated August 9, 2017 has been\ncorrected.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMoore Chad, Animal Care Inspector"
