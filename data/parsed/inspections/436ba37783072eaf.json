This is an area the sloth routinely grabs at to maneuver herself\ninto her box for sleeping and could cause injury. These wires need to be addressed for the safety of the sloth.\n\u2022 There is a section of wire mesh in the water buffalo enclosure that is broken and protruding into the yard next to the\naccess gate. This section of wire mesh needs to be addressed to remove the sharp points for the safety of the water\nbuffalo in the enclosure.\n\u2022 There is a section of metal approximately 3 feet high that by design divides the cavy enclosure into two sections. Several\ncavies were observed jumping over the divider and each time they would jump, you would hear their back legs hit the\ndivider as they came down on the other side. The nature of this divider in not effective in keeping animals separated and\ncan cause potential harm to their back legs when jumping over. This divider needs to be addressed for the safety of the\nanimals.\n\u2022 One area of the goats\u2019 outdoor primary enclosure\u2019s fence, located under the sheltered portion, was not high enough to\nkeep the goats contained in their primary outdoor enclosure. The goats were able to jump out of their enclosure into an\nalleyway between various hoofstock enclosures on both sides. The primary enclosure fence needs to be high enough to\nkeep the goats securely in their enclosure for their safety.\n\u2022 There were multiple concrete cinder block bricks near a brush pile in the middle of the water buffalo outdoor primary\nenclosure that could entrap a hoof or leg. These bricks need to be removed or prevent access to them for the safety of the\nwater buffalo as well as to keep the area in good repair.\nFailure to maintain enclosures in good repair, not of an adequate height, or that contain possibly injurious items may\nnegatively impact the health and comfort of the animals or allow for escape. All enclosures must be structurally sound and\nmaintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or escape.\nCorrect by: 02/10/2025"
