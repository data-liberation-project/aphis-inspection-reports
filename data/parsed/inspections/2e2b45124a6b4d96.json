The\nexhibitor must ensure that the veterinarian has the appropriate authority to make decisions regarding adequate care\nfor the animals. Failure to communicate, employ, and collaborate with the attending veterinarian, and follow the\nwritten Program of Veterinary Care, could be detrimental to the well-being of the animals.\nThe exhibitor should take immediate steps to employ the help of an attending veterinarian, and collaborate with that\nperson so as to provide a consistent program of veterinary care for the animals."
