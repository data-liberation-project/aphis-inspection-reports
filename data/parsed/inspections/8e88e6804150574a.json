      "narrative": "In the outdoor enclosures was a female Siberian Husky (M/C# 092811836) that was very thin and had a significant\nabdominal tuck. The hair coat had shed from the sides and hips but was still thick and in the process of shedding\nalong the neck, back and loin. When the dog was palpated, the spine, hips and ribs were easily felt and there was a\nsignificant muscle loss. The dog was in a large enclosure with 2 larger dogs. Dogs that are very thin may have\nother medical concerns. The owner must have the dog evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.\nThe dog must be housed in a separate enclosure from other dogs. Documents of diagnosis and treatment must be\navailable to APHIS officials.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: 1 AUGUST 2014\nSonny, a male red and white King Charles Cavalier Spaniel had a left eye that was bulging and had brown\ndiscoloration on the surface of both eyes. Eye conditions can be painful and when not properly treated, can lead to\nloss of vision. The dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documents of diagnosis\nand treatment must be available to APHIS officials.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: 1 AUGUST 2014\nScarlett (m/c# 092811344) a female Cocker Spaniel had a red mass on the outside lower lip on the right side. It\nwas about 1/2\" diameter in size and shiny. This dog had an ongoing eye condition that was being treated, as stated\nby the owner. There was a greenish discharge from both eyes although the eyes were clear and there was no\nredness observed. The cheek teeth and canine teeth had hard dark material on their surfaces. The dark brown\nmaterial may affect the health and well being of the affected animals if left untreated and can affect the way that the\ndog eats. The applicant should consult with the veterinarian to develop a dental care plan for all the dogs at the\nfacility. This plan should cover how dental disease will be identified and how differing degrees of disease will be\ntreated. The dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian so that a proper diagnosis can be made regarding the\nobserved problems and a treatment plan can be implemented. The licensee should document the diagnosis and the\ntreatment plan, and have it available to APHIS officials.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: 1 AUGUST 2014\nThere was female Brindle French Bulldog (Paris, m/c# 4A014D3004) that had a large gray, irregularly shaped,\nroughened mass on the top of the head. It was approximately 1/2\" above the surface of the skin and 1 1/2\" in\ndiameter. The owner stated that the dog had been evaluated by a veterinarian several months ago, but the mass\nhas increased in size. There was no documentation of the evaluation. Masses that change or grow may indicate a\nmore serious health condition. Due to the changes, the dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and\ntreatment.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: 5 AUGUST 2014"
