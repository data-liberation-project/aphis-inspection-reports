The inspectors observed several different employees handling and\npresenting the armadillos in short succession, often observing the same animal get picked up minutes after it was put\ndown by a different employee.\nHandling the animals in such a manner as described led to overt signs of behavioral stress by the armadillos during the\nexhibition.\nUpon intervention, the facility corrected the handling errors for the remainder of the exhibition on Saturday, January 10th,\nand Sunday, January 11th.

They did not have any\nitems in their temporary enclosure that they could hide in.\n- The sloth, Rico, was exhibited for four consecutive hours on Friday, January 9th, and a total of 6.5 hours on Saturday,\nJanuary 10th (8 hour exhibition with a 1-hour scheduled break followed by a 30 minute scheduled break). He was\nscheduled for another four hour exhibition on Sunday, January 10th. The licensee stated that Rico got multiple smaller,\nunscheduled breaks in his transport enclosure throughout the day, which the inspectors were unable to visually confirm\ndue to the arrangement of the photo booth. However, for the last 2-3 hours of the day, the inspectors observed him to be\ndeeply resting or possibly sleeping in a chair while the public was petting and taking photos with him, indicating that he\nwas tired. Sloths are nocturnal and sleep on average 15-20 hours during the day.\n- The two armadillos, which are also mainly nocturnal and sleep about 15-20 hours during the day, did not have a clearly\nobservable opportunity to rest out of public eye during the aforementioned exhibition hours. They did not have the\nopportunity to express natural behaviors such as hide or burrow, but were periodically observed trying to hide under a bed\non the floor of the enclosure.\nExhibiting animals under conditions and time periods inconsistent with their natural wake-sleep cycles, and without the\nability to avoid potentially stressful public interaction, can affect their physical and psychological health.\nCorrect this by exhibiting animals for periods of time and under conditions consistent with their good health and well-\nbeing."
