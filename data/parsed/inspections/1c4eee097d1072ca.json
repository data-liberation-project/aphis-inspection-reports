No\nkeeper notes concerning the donkey\u2019s hair loss and excessive scratching behavior could be found and the attending\nveterinarian was not aware of the donkey\u2019s condition. Excessive scratching, thinning hair coat, and hair loss could\nindicate an underlying health issue.\nThis donkey must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective\ntreatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector\nupon request.\nCorrection date: The attending veterinarian evaluated the donkey at the time of the inspection."

The female wallaby hopped away from the children and across the walking path to another area\nof the enclosure near a woman with a stroller. There are no employees present to supervise the potential public\ncontact with the animals and there are also no public barriers to keep the wallabies and people away from each\nother. Unsupervised contact between people and wallabies could result in a dangerous situation.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the\npublic, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure\nthe safety of animals and the public. The facility must either establish acceptable barriers to keep the free-ranging\nwallabies at a sufficient distance from the public or a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee\nor attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. The facility must ensure that all required\nmeasures are taken to eliminate any potentially dangerous situations between animals and the public.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representatives."
