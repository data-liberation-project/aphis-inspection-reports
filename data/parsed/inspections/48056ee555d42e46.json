      "narrative": "A female takin, Qiji, began showing signs of labor during the afternoon of 4/29/2014. According to zoo personnel,\nthis animal had a recent history of lethargy, lameness, and swollen legs. A plan to have the night keeper do periodic\nchecks on the animal throughout the night was made\nDocumentation provided states that the on-call veterinarian could not be reached earlier in the evening by a senior\nanimal keeper to discuss concerns involving the progression of the labor. When the senior animal keeper did speak\nwith the on-call veterinarian later that night to inform him of concerns that the takin was having problems with\ndelivery, she was told that getting a team together in the middle of the night to immediately deal with the situation\nwas doubtful and that it would be dealt with first thing in the morning. According to medical records, the takin\nreceived veterinary care the following morning and was euthanized due to findings encountered during a C-section\nto remove her fetus, which had died.\nAdditional documentation provided by the facility states that three animal keepers involved in Qiji(cid:25)'s care are\nconcerned that there is no clear plan for how to handle after-hours medical emergencies. It states that in the past,\nnight keepers have had difficulties in being able to reach the on-call veterinarian when there have been after-hours\nmedical concerns. In looking into these concerns, the Zoo(cid:25)s Animal Management Committee found that the\nafter-hours Vet call list was out of date and has since been updated and re-distributed.\nAlthough the zoo has a veterinarian and veterinary technician on call each night, and emergency procedures can\nand have been conducted during off hours, it appears in this case, there was a failure in communication between\nthe senior animal keeper and the on-call veterinarian and an uncertainty for how to handle after-hours medical\nemergencies.\nTo be corrected from this day forward.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
