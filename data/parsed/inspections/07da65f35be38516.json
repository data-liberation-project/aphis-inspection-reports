The majority of the surfaces of the right\nupper cheek teeth are encased in a heavy, thick buildup of brown/tan colored tartar. The top half of the surface of\nthe upper, right canine tooth has a buildup of dark brown tartar. Nearly the entire surface of the upper left cheek\nteeth are also coated in a buildup of brown/tan colored tartar and the top half of the upper left canine tooth has a\nheavy, thick buildup of brown/grey colored tartar. The gums are moderately reddened.\nFemale Miniature Pinscher (microchip #0A01656747) has an abnormal appearance to both eyes. There is a\ncloudy, blue color across the surface of both eyes and a small amount of crusty, yellow discharge is attached to the\nhair around the upper and lower eyelids of the left eye. At the time of the inspection, the inspector observed that the\ndog\u2019s behavior may indicate that she is having trouble with her vision. This dog has not been evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian for the condition of her eyes.\nFemale German shepherd (microchip #0412507E71) has an open wound on the backside of the external ear. The\nedges of the wound appear to have a dry, brown crust and the center of the wound appears red, raw, and moist.\nDark brown and red material is attached to the hair near the wound.\nMale German shepherd (microchip #000002002689022) has an open wound along the top edge of the external left\near. A thick clumps of dark brown colored material are attached to the edges of the wound and the center of the\nwound is red, raw and moist. Dry dark brown and red material is attached to the hair near the wound.\nThe licensee stated that the ears of both German shepherds did not look like this the day before, but they are\ncurrently being treated with Vetericyn for the ear wounds. There is no statement from the attending veterinarian\napproving this treatment, how many times a day the animals should be treated and for how many days they should\nreceive the treatment.\nOpen wounds and poor dental and eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the animals and could lead to\nfurther health issues.\nThe above listed dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an\neffective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the\ninspector upon request.\nA verbal correction date of end of business on June 23, 2017 was given at the time of the inspection.\nA bottle of Vetericyn currently being used to treat two German shepherds has an expiration date of August 2013. A\nbottle of Albon has an expiration date of April 2016 and a bottle of Pyrantel has an expiration date of May 2016.\nExpired medical products may lose their effectiveness and the health of the animals could suffer.\nThe use of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be acceptable veterinary practice\nand does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The licensee must either dispose of the expired products or\nclearly label them as expired and they are not to be used on the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all medical\nproducts used for the dogs is current in order to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.\nTo be corrected by: June 26, 2017"
