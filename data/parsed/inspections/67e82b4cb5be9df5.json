The enclosure is constructed with 4\u201d x 4\u201d wire mesh StaTite\nfencing. The keeper approached the enclosure fence with his phone in one hand and his set of keys in the other. The\nostrich reached through the enclosure fence and grabbed the keys with its beak. It then lifted its head and swallowed the\nkeys. The keeper was not part of the ostrich\u2019s care staff and violated zoo policy by closely approaching the ostrich in this\narea.\nThe keeper immediately reported the incident, but despite extensive veterinary care and surgical efforts, the keys were\nnot retrievable. The animal\u2019s health declined, and she was euthanized.\nHandling of zoo animals, which includes nearly every interaction between animals and zoo staff, needs to be carried out\nby trained and knowledgeable staff who prioritize animal welfare and safety during all interactions. The handling of all\nanimals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,\nexcessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
