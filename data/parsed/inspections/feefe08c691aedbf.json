      "narrative": "This facility has 2 types of outdoor enclosures for dogs--an open barn with pens partially under the overhang of the\nbarn and several open enclosures in a field with shade trees. There were two pens that had wooden shelters that\nhad large holes chewed through the wood. The last pen in the barn contained 2 adult dogs with 1 shelter structure\nand there was a hole approximately the size of a basketball chewed through the wall near the floor of the shelter.\nThe shelter structure was not under the barn overhang and therefore not protected from the weather. The open pen\ndirectly outside the back of the barn contained 5 adults dogs with 2 shelter structures and there was a hole\napproximately the size of a banana in the roof of 1 shelter, where it joined the wall. The shelter was under a shade\ntree but had no other protective barrier over it. In the early morning hours of the day of inspection, a severe storm\nhad passed over and it had rained approximately an inch in this area. The holes were large enough that the shelters\nno longer provided the dogs with adequate protection from the direct effect of wind or rain. Shelters that are large\nenough to contain all animals at once in a comfortable manner must be provided in all pens. Shelters must contain a\nroof, 4 sides, and a floor, provide adequate protection from the weather, and be constructed with materials that are\nimpervious to moisture. Correct by: September 7th.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
