When this animal walks her gait is adversely\naffected by these long front hooves. Overgrown hooves can cause changes in the angle of the toes, change the\ngait, cause discomfort when walking, and can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs such as arthritis. The\nhooves must be trimmed and a plan needs to be developed with the input of the attending veterinarian (AV), to\naddress the need for hoof trimming for all animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the\ndevelopment of chronic foot and leg problems.
