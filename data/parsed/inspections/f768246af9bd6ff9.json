She became agitated and moved away on her knees when the employee and then\nthe licensee attempted to encourage her to rise.\nThe licensee stated he had her on glucosamine, but not anti-inflammatories because he was told by some exotic\nanimal veterinarians and \"Kentucky vets\" (equine) that those medications were not useful. There are no written\ninstructions for the equine-formulated glucosamine product.\nThe Attending Veterinarian (AV) must be involved with plans for addressing chronic animal health conditions in\norder to reduce animal discomfort and avoid suffering. Any medications or supplements given her that are not\nlabeled for use in camels must be used only with written instructions from the AV.\nCorrect by consulting with the AV as soon as possible and developing and implementing a treatment plan by close\nof business on Friday, April 6, 2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nThe inspection was also accompanied by a USDA APHIS VS VMO."
