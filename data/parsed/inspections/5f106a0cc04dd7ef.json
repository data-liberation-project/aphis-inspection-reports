The facility representative stated that a small round bale of Sudan hay had been brought in ten days ago for\nbedding and that was when the hair loss began. According to the attending veterinarian's instructions on the\nprogram of veterinary care, hair loss for pigs is to be treated by replacing the bedding and deworming with\nIvermectin.\nThe pig barn is divided into sections with a gate between each section. The gate to the section where the Sudan\nwas placed for bedding purposes was open to where the pigs were still able to come in contact with this hay. The\nfacility representative stated that a Safe Guard deworming block had been given to the pigs since the hair loss had\nbeen observed. The attending veterinarian was contacted and reiterated the instructions written on the program of\nveterinary care. Veterinarian recommended treatments that are not followed can lead to worsening of the illness,\ncondition or injury of the animal.\n***In the sheep and goat barn, there was a cow that was being used to nurse three calves. This cow was thin.\nShoulder, rib and hip bones were protruding. The facility representative stated that a veterinarian had not been\ncontacted concerning this cow. The attending veterinarian was contacted and instructions for treatment were given\nvia phone. Thin animals with bone protrusion that is left unattended by veterinary intervention may worsen and lead\nto a serious condition in the animal.\nThe licensee must follow the veterinarian's instruction for treatments and assure that all of the animals receive\nadequate veterinary care as required."
