After JJ was placed in the tub he jumped out of the tub and landed on the floor that was 33 to 34 inches\nbelow the top of the tub. The licensee stated that when the dog landed both back legs went directly backwards. The\nlicensee stated that they got JJ to its feet and upon closer examination, found nothing wrong. The dog was able to walk\non its own. The dog was returned to its enclosure. At 4:30 AM on April 1, 2023, the licensee went to load JJ into an\nenclosure to be taken to a dog show. When JJ came out of his enclosure, he was observed dragging both back legs\nbehind him and placing no weight on the back legs. All animals need to be secured in a manner so that no physical harm\nis done to the dogs. Not having the dog secured in the wash tub could lead to the dog jumping out of the tub causing\ninjury, trauma or physical harm to the dog. The licensee must ensure that all animals will be handled in a manner that\ndoes not cause trauma, overheating and excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected by end of business 10/2/23."
