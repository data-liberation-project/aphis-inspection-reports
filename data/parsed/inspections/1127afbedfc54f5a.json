The emergency policy was put into motion and the manager was called. The call\nto the manager occurred around 8:30 am and a more extensive search was conducted. This search revealed that\nLightning had dug the ground underneath and pulled the sweeper flap fencing on a perimeter fence gate and was\noutside the facility. The manager quickly responded and arrived on grounds. Extensive tracking located Lightning\napproximately two miles from the facility. After reviewing the emergency policy and assessing the situation Lightning\nwas euthanized.\n-The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility and functions as a secondary\ncontainment. A full review of the perimeter fence policies, practices and maintenance must be conducted and\ncorrected to ensure the function of the perimeter fence protects, and contains all animals in the facility. Correction\nmust be sufficient so this non-compliant does not repeat.\n-Preliminary corrective measures have been implemented.\n-To be corrected by: January 10, 2016\nExit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
