On\nDec.21 another fight occurred resulting in a re-opening of the LH hock wound. After this, Lilikoi was observed self-\ntraumatizing (biting and licking) her LH hock and displayed intermittent non-weight bearing lameness on the LH resulting\nin an anesthetized exam with surgical consultation on Dec 24, 2024. Veterinary records from this exam indicate the\nfollowing: \u201cWounds include LH hock and other puncture wounds and superficial wounds. Primary wound over hock has\nsmall area of bone exposure and is about 4x5.5 cm. Wound on caudal LH about 3 cm proximal to hock joint is about\n2.5x5cm. There were full thickness puncture wounds on the right hind leg (RH) lateral and medial thigh and LH medial\nthigh. Multiple cutaneous scabbing/ mud-coated wounds on both sides. Left fibula simple non-displaced fracture noted on\nradiographs.\u201d Final findings include a left fibula fracture, left Achilles tendon rupture, and left hock open wounds.\nFailure to separate the African wild dogs following multiple reports to the AV and evidence of fighting during this time\nperiod likely resulted in the traumatic wounds and serious injuries sustained.\nIncompatible housing of animals can affect their well-being and even lead to injury and/or death.
