      "narrative": "DIRECT: There were multiple dogs with very bad teeth that need to be seen and treated by a veterinarian. There\nwas a male Yorkie (#315) blk/bro that was drooling excessively on the left side of his mouth that had molars that\nwere encased in hard brown material. Inside the mouth the gums were red and swollen with what appeared to be\npus-like material around the remaining teeth in the back, and a very foul odor coming from the mouth. In addition, 6\nother dogs of the 12 examined were in serious need of dental care; a Red Poodle F (#289), M (#267), Blk/wht\nPoodle F (#273), wht/bro Poodle M (#269), Yorkie bro/blk M (#344) and white Poodle F (#330). All 6 reported dogs\nhave varying numbers of molars encased in a hard brown material with very red and inflamed gums with pus-like\nmaterial between the gum line and teeth. The male Poodle (#269) had both sides with all of the back teeth encased\nin a solid row of a hard brown material making it impossible to discern individual teeth.\nAll of these dogs' had been recently purchased within the past 1.5 months by this licensee, and the veterinarian has\nnot been contacted to begin a dental program or begin treating the dogs' with bad teeth.\nIt is imperative that there is communication with the attending veterinarian to treat and maintain healthy teeth and\nmouths of the regulated animals'. Bad teeth and gums can cause pain and discomfort to the animals as well as lead\nto other health issues if left untreated.\nINDIRECT: There were 5 dogs' that had numerous matts on their faces covering their eyes and some with matts on\ntheir faces and legs. A red Poodle M (#267) had face and body matts, Shih tzu, wht/blk ears F (#288) had multiple\nmatts covering her eyes, Poodle bro/wht M (#269) with facial and body matts, white Poodle F (#330) with matts\ncovering the eyes, and a black Poodle M (#232) with matts covering his eyes.\nMatted hair needs to be removed in order to prevent any pain or discomfort from the matted hair pulling at the\nanimals' skin. The matted hair covering the eyes can cause eye irritation issues and hide infections that can occur\nwhich can cause a serious health issue if left un-noticed and untreated. The eyes being covered by long hair and\nmatts can also prevent the animal from being able to see properly and cause stress and/or discomfort.\nThe licensee must consult the veterinarian to diagnose and treat regulated animals with teeth issues. Once the dogs\nare identified that need dental care, the licensee must show an effort to get the animals treated in a timely manner\nand continue working on getting the animals with bad teeth treated as needed.\nAll hair coats should be trimmed and maintained in order to prevent matt development. All matts should be removed\nto prevent any pain or discomfort to the animal from hair pulling on the skin, and to prevent any sores or infections\nthat can occur to the eyes or body when covered by matted hair.
