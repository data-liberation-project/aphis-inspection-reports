I identified us as being from the UDSA and\nasked for the licensee. The licensee came to the door and I said hello and told her that we were there to do an\ninspection. The licensee indicated that she would not allow the police officer that was accompanying the inspection\nteam to go back to the animal area. I asked if she was refusing the inspection. At that time she stated that \" You can\ngo back there but not the officer.\" I explained that \"the officer must accompany us today\". The licensee then\nrefused inspection and again stated that \" You can go back there but not the officer.\" The USDA APHIS AC\ninspectors left the premises without conducting an inspection.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBaltrush Jan, Animal Care Inspector"
