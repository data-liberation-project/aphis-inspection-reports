When animals place their heads inside guest's personal vehicles or when the public pets the animals around their\nmouths when they are trying to feed, there is more than a minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public. During\npublic exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the safety of animals and\nthe public.\nCorrect by: 06/01/2025."

During that time, a camel was seen with its entire head and up to half its neck in a patron\u2019s car to the middle\nof the vehicle completely blocking this individual in place. A zebra was also seen with its entire head into a passenger\nwindow, and many llamas were observed with their heads in patrons cars.
