Viola, could cause physical harm to herself trying to remove it and it causes unnecessary\ndiscomfort for a prolonged period of time. This was corrected at the time of the inspection by removing the muzzle and\nmoving her out of the enclosure to another safe space.\n*** A Dachshund # 9224, \"Dottie\" housed with 4 other dogs had a bark collar around her neck. When she barked the\ncollar let out a high pitched sound that negatively impacted her and likely the other dogs in the enclosures as it was also\nheard by the licensee and inspector. Having a bark collar on a kennel dog for an extended period of time can cause\nbehavioral stress and cause unnecessary discomfort to the individual dog and others in the kennel as their hearing is\nhighly sensitive. This collar was removed from the dog during the inspection.\nCorrect by June 12, 2021\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
