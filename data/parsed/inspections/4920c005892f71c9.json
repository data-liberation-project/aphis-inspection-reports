The outdoor portion of the enclosure had coated wire\nflooring with one inch by one inch openings. There were five Maltese puppies which were approximately seven\nweeks old housed inside the enclosure. The puppies' legs and feet passing through the openings of the floor can\nincrease their risk of injury. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so\nthat they have floors that protect the dogs' feet and legs from injury and do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through\nany openings in the floor. To be corrected by: April 20, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
