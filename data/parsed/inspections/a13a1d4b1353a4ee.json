It was determined and informed to the owner, that a valid USDA license was required\nfor public exhibition of his animals. He was given an application packet at that time but has not since submitted an\napplication.\nAny person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale, except persons\nwho are exempted from the licensing requirements under section 2.1 (a)(3), must have a valid license.\nAcquire a valid USDA license if you wish to continue to exhibit animals to the public.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representative.\nConducting regulated activities without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act."
