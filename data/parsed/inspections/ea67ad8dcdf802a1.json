      "narrative": "There were 7 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of\nVeterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian.\nIn Building 1, Pen 5 there was a brown and tan weanling housed with 17 weanlings. The weanling was laying on its\nside and was severely lethargic and minimally responsive. The weanling was observed to have a decreased\nrespiratory rate. The weanling also had an episode lasting approximately 30 seconds in which it kicked its back feet\nand its body contracted in spasms and gradually relaxed. This animal had died by the time the inspection was\ncompleted. The facility reported they had not observed any problems with the animal when they had performed\ntheir daily observation that morning.\nIn Building 1, Pen 29 there was a tri-color adult guinea pig with a skin abnormality that was housed with 6 other\nguinea pigs. There was a circular area of hair loss approximately 2 cm in size on the bridge of the nose. The skin\nin this area appeared reddened. The facility had observed the condition but was not treating according to the\nprogram of veterinary care and had not contacted the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was\ncontacted and was not comfortable with the facility failing to treat this animal according to the program of veterinary\ncare.\nIn Building 2, there were 5 adult guinea pigs with swellings under the chin. The swellings ranged in size from .5 to 1\ninch in size and were firm movable masses. These were observed on a brown and white adult in pen 1, a brown\nand black adult in pen 3, a black and white and a tri-color adult in pen 4, and a brown adult in pen 8. The facility\nhad observed the swellings but was not treating according to the program of veterinary care and had not contacted\nthe attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was contacted and was not comfortable with the facility failing\nto treat these animals according to the program of veterinary care.\nNewborns that are lethargic and depressed can rapidly worsen and die if not evaluated and treated. Skin conditions\nwith hair loss and redness can be a sign of numerous infectious and non-infectious causes and requires\nexamination by a veterinarian and appropriate diagnostic testing to determine the underlying cause and determine a\ntreatment plan. Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health\nand well-being of the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications.\nDelays in providing appropriate veterinary care for these conditions can result in worsening of the condition and\npotentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature. The licensee must communicate with the\nattending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.\nCorrect by: February 5, 2020"
