      "narrative": "A kitten had been noted by a Thornton Police Detective on 11/1/2014 to be in need of veterinary care due to thin\nbody condition, lethargy, and abnormal appearance to the rectal area. The facility did not contact a veterinarian in a\ntimely manner and this kitten was found dead the next morning.\nA female albino hedgehog, \"Gwen\", had been acquired by the facility on 10/2/2014 from a licensed breeder. A\nfacility representative contacted the breeder on 10/17/2014 and stated that this female hedgehog, \"Gwen\", was not\ndoing well, losing weight, and possibly being bullied away from the food and water in the enclosure by another adult\nfemale hedgehog. Two more phone conversations and several text messages between facility representatives and\nthe licensed breeder indicated that this hedgehog was continuing to decline and would not readily eat or drink. The\nbreeder traveled over 5 hours to reclaim this animal as well as 3 other juvenile male hedgehogs due to concerns for\ntheir health and well-being. The female hedgehog, \"Gwen\", died overnight after the original owner attempted to\nprovide more aggressive therapeutic care. The facility never contacted a veterinarian regarding the condition of this\nanimal and did not seek appropriate care in a timely manner.\nDuring the inspection, a juvenile pinto-colored female hedgehog was noted to be thin and had some tenting of her\nskin. The body weight for this animal was 4.4 oz at the time of inspection. This is a low body weight as compared\nto another juvenile female hedgehog of similar size who weighed 6.0 oz at the time of inspection. This animal, and\nall of the animals, should be closely observed on a daily basis to ensure they are in good health, eating and drinking\nnormally, and, especially for juvenile animals, gaining weight and growing properly. This animal should be weighed\ndaily and should be seen by a veterinarian if she is not steadily gaining weight within the next week (by 11/22/2014).\nOne of the facility's employees has been taking animals home for \"health watch\" purposes. This employee took 1\nhedgehog on 6/18/2014 and 2 hedgehogs on 11/7/2014 because there was a concern that these animals were \"too\nsmall\" and not gaining weight appropriately. Neither the employee or the owners have contacted a veterinarian\nconcerning these animals and there is no indication as to whether they recovered and were returned to the facility\nfor sale as pet animals.\nWeight loss, lack of weight gain in young animals, tenting of the skin, lethargy, and other abnormal signs or\nbehaviors may be indicating an underlying medical problem. This information must be communicated to a\nveterinarian in a timely and accurate manner so that appropriate diagnostics, care, and treatment, if needed, can be\nprovided.\nThe facility must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nTo be corrected by 11/17/2014."
