The use of outdated medical materials is undesirable as these materials may lose their potency or degrade to\ntoxic byproducts if stored after the expiration date. This may result in unpredictable outcomes. All expired medical\nmaterials must be identified and properly disposed of or properly labeled and stored in an area separate from\nnon-expired medical materials. A system which would ensure that the expired items are identified and handled\naccordingly on a regular basis is required.\nThis item was corrected by the end of the inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with site head."
