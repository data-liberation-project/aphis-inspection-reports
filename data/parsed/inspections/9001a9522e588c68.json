However, the dam was slightly underconditioned with adequate hydration and was\nplaced on conservative treatment. The facility conducted daily study observations mid to late Monday morning with no\nindication of dehydration in any of the animals in the building . On July 20, 2021 two infant rhesus macaque deaths were\nreported and two infant rhesus macaques were reported unresponsive, and a third was reported dehydrated, but aware of\nit's surroundings. The attending veterinarian was notified of the water issue and treated all 3 animals. By the end of the\nday one macaque responded well to treatment while the others did not, and they were euthanized. Animal Resources\nconfirmed that the lixits were working properly on Monday, but it was determined on Tuesday that there was a reduction in\nwater pressure to the lixits. At this point, the water was shut off to prevent bloat, and all animals housed in the building\nwere supplemented with water until the water supply was deemed functional. Upon further investigation, it was\ndetermined by the Physical Facility personnel that the pressure regulator to the the housing room/lixits was not working\nproperly, thus reducing the water pressure to the animal room excessively. The housing facility must provide reliable\nrunning potable water for a nonhuman primates\u2019 drinking needs to prevent dehydration. The facility has implemented\nseveral corrective actions including daily manual checks and records of water pressure, monthly water flow confirmation\nchecks, water flow monitoring plan and facility water system evaluations to identify points of risk for additional monitoring.\nThe Center is offering the animals more high-water content supplements and all infant studies will consistently include\ntwice daily observations. The facility is in the process of utilizing a Building Automation System based automatic pressure\nmonitoring and alarm system to receive alerts for pressure values outside of acceptable ranges.
