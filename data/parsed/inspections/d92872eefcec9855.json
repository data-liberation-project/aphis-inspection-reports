The herdsman\nwho discovered the animal in this condition monitored and treated the animal for three days without consulting the\nattending veterinarian. The animal did not improve, and was subsequently euthanized.\nAnimals should be observed on a daily basis to assess their well-being, and any problems should be promptly\ncommunicated to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate steps can be taken to address health problems. In\nthis case the animal clearly needed prompt veterinary attention, and it was not received. Failure to communicate\nproblems and provide adequate care can result in unnecessary suffering.\nThe facility recognized this failure, reported the event, and has taken appropriate action to correct the problem with\nthe personnel involved.\nAn exit interview was conducted on 9/21/15 with facility representatives."
