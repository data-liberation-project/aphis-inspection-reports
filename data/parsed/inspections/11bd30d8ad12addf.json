Members of the public can participate in an encounter during which they walk through the aviary while feeding the\nlorikeets a cup of nectar. Birds are allowed to perch onto participants to obtain the nectar and the encounter is supervised\nby at least two staff members.\nFacility representatives state that at 2:00pm on Monday, April 22, 2024, animal care staff counted all twenty-six lorikeets.\nThe lorikeet aviary was then closed by staff at 3:45pm due to a lightning alert. After the lightning alert was lifted, two\nlorikeet aviary attendants went back into the aviary to secure it as per the Zoo\u2019s weather event protocol. Nothing unusual\nwas seen or heard by the attendants present during this period.\nAt 8:47am on Tuesday, April 23, 2024, animal care staff counted twenty-five lorikeets and reported one missing. The\naviary was then closed to the public and thorough searches of the habitat were conducted. All possibilities of containment\nfailure, fatality from other animals in the habitat, and all possible hiding spots were investigated but the bird was never\nrecovered. The security team thoroughly reviewed the surveillance camera material during the window of time of the\nincident and flagged one guest exhibiting suspicious behavior. According to the facility representatives, it was determined\nthat the Lorikeet was likely stolen from the aviary by a member of the public. A bird removed from its primary enclosure\nand social structure by a member of the public could have the potential to adversely affect the health and well-being of the\nanimal.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals\nand the public. Correct from this date forward of May 9,2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
