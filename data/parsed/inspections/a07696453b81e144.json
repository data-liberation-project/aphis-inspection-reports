The licensee\nstated that she was unaware guinea pigs could not be housed outdoors and that they provided a fan during the\nsummer months. The temperature had dropped below 40 degrees Fahrenheit the last two nights but the animals\nwere active and appeared healthy at the time of inspection. Exposing guinea pigs to extremes and fluctuations in\ntemperature can make them more susceptible to disease. Correct by moving the animals indoors and if planning to\nhouse them outside in good weather in the future, obtain prior approval for such outdoor housing from the Deputy\nAdministrator. Correct by 13 October 2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the director."
