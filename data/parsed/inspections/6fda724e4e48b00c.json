The exact weight of the\nmacaque is not known, but the licensee estimates him to be in the 6.6-22.0 pound range that would correspond to \"Group\n3\" under this regulation. Group 3 animals require a minimum floor area of 4.3 square feet and a minimum enclosure\nheight of 30 inches. His current enclosure has 3.75 square feet of floor area and is only 20 inches high. For the physical\nand psychological wellbeing of non-human primates, they must be provided adequate space to make normal behavioral\nmovements exercise, and play.
