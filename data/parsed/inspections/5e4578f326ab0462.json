In pen 9, there is a tri-colored juvenile guinea pig which is unable to stand or walk and shakes\nwhen gently touched. In pen 55, there is a tri-colored juvenile guinea pig which is unable to stand or walk and was\nbeing harassed by the other guinea pigs. When notified of this diseased guinea pig, the owner immediately\nremoved the animal from the enclosure.\nIn pen 4, there is a tri-colored guinea pig with multiple red, inflamed lesions on its back.\nThere are at least 10 other dead guinea pigs noted in several enclosures.\nThe owner stated that he had not observed the conditions of the ill and injured animals and had not contacted his\nattending veterinarian for instructions on caring for these animals. The owner was also unable to provide a written\nprogram of veterinary care.\nThe hair loss, inability to stand or walk, and red lesions can be indicative of disease and/or injury which can be\npainful and affect the general health and well being of the animals. Failure to use appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can result in pain to the animal and potentially worsening of the\ncondition.
