Law enforcement and emergency response units promptly responded to the licensee's property,\nestablished a no-enter perimeter, and were able to capture and return safely both animals to their enclosure. To\nacquire details about the incident, I interviewed the facility's supervisor, an animal keeper, and state inspectors.\nAlso, I conducted a thorough review of the facility's administrative, training, and animal medical records, coming to\nthe conclusion that the incident was due to human error. The incident happened when a new employee that was\ncleaning the primary enclosure, got distracted, left unattended the unlocked enclosure, and both animals moved\nfrom an unsecured chute into the unsecured enclosure; animals push two gates and escaped. The new employee\nlacked experience handling nonhuman primates (NHP), and was obviously in need of additional training handling\nNHP.\nEvery facility subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) maintaining apes and other NHP,\nmust have enough well trained employees to carry out the level of husbandry practices and care of NHP.\nEven-though the licensee fired the new employee the same day on the incident, the facility is, with their current\nmanpower, able to handle proper husbandry and needed care of their resident NHP; additional animal caretakers\nare to he hired.\nThis noncompliance was corrected prior to the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
