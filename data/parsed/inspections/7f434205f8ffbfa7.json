The principal\ninvestigator briefly stepped away from supervising the trainee to take an emergency phone call when the incident\noccurred.

The animal was observed exhibiting noticeable neurologic impairment within minutes, at which point\nthe procedure was terminated, veterinary staff were immediately contacted, and treatment was initiated.\nIt is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel involved in animal use are adequately trained to\nperform their duties.

After induction of anesthesia, the animal began to experience poor oxygenation based on peripheral SpO2\nmonitoring and a rapid, irregular heartbeat. Due to these vital signs, a decision was made to transition the animal to\ninhalant anesthesia with oxygen support. A technician quickly retrieved a portable anesthesia machine to bring to this\nprocedure space. The animal was attached to the anesthesia machine and immediately stopped breathing. A veterinarian\nwas called, and the monkey was taken to an area that had an anesthesia ventilator. The animal went into cardiac arrest\nand was unable to be resuscitated.\nThe incident was reviewed, and it was found that the anesthesia machine did not work properly with the circuit that was\nattached to it. The machine was not functioning properly, and this resulted in elevated pressures rapidly developing within\nthe tubing. Evidence of barotrauma was confirmed at gross necropsy confirming this increased pressure as the cause of\ndeath.\nThe facility failed to provide adequate equipment to prevent the death of the monkey. The facility shall ensure that all\nequipment is readily available and functioning properly.\nCorrected prior to the inspection."
