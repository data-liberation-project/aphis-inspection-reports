Injuries that are not treated maybe painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, and other\nveterinary care health problems.\n***One pig in the finishing house had a very thin body condition as evidenced by visible ribs as compared to litter\nmates. The animal appeared to be lethargic and reluctant to move compared to its litter mates. The licensee stated\nthat he had been treating the animal for three weeks with no change in condition. He stated that he had not\ncontacted the attending veterinarian regarding this animal. Thin body condition can signify inadequate nutrition or\nother underlying disease or pain.\nThe licensee must have these animals evaluated by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on June 26, 2015, to obtain accurate\ndiagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be\nprovided to the inspector upon request.
