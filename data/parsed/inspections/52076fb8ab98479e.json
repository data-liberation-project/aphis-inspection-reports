The young pups were small enough that in at least two incidences one\nhind limb was noted completely dropping through an opening in the grate past the level of the knee/stifle. When one\nof the pups tried to lift its rear leg out of the grate the grate was lifted up over an inch from level with the pup's leg.\nAnother pup's front paw was noted falling through one of the openings of the grate. Enclosure floors must be\nconstructed in a manner that protects the pups feet and legs from injury. This was corrected during the inspection\nby removal of the grates from the enclosures.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nThis inspection was conducted at the Espresso Exotic Animal Expo in Cowan, TN."
