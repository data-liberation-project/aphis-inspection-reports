Several domestic chickens were observed to have severely overgrown nails that resulted in abnormal\nplacement of toes while perching. All chickens appeared to walk normally. One domestic duck has approximately 1.5-inch\nround swelling at the base of digits 2 and 3 involving the interdigital web of one foot, which also has a small spot of pink\ndiscoloration on the top surface of the skin. The duck appeared to be walking normally. Failure to properly observe health\nproblems in animals can result in their prolonged pain, suffering and increase the risk of developing serious medical\nconditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral\nconcerns are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian."
