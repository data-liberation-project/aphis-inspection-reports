In addition, several animals were 'diagnosed' and treated during the last three weeks without a\nveterinarian being involved. The facility representative (Park Manager) stated during the inspection that he had\nnoticed that the AV hadn't been out to the facility for about the past two to three weeks and that the AV usually\ncame out 2-3 times a week prior to that. He stated that the Collection Manager usually works with the AV. The\ninspector contacted the AV by phone and was told that his last day at the facility was three weeks prior. Four\nanimals were noted during this inspection as needing veterinary attention and no documentation was available to\nshow show that the needed veterinary attention had been provided. Documentation reviewed included a log book\nof procedures completed which showed that since the AV left the facility two animals (one gemsbok and one addax)\nwere sedated with BAM (butorphanol, azaperone, medetomidine), diagnosed with foot rot and treated (with\ninjectable prescription drugs). In addition, one red river hog was \"euthanized due to old age\" but there was no\ndiagnosis or method of euthanasia documented. There was no documentation available to show that these\ndiagnoses and treatment plans were under the advisement of a veterinarian. The previously written program of\nveterinary plan did not include instructions for facility personnel for using these drugs, for diagnosing/treating foot\nrot or performing euthanasia.\nEach facility must employ an attending veterinarian who shall provide adequate veterinary care to its animals. In the\ncase of a part time/consulting veterinarian, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary\ncare and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
