The wound is approximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size and is black around the edges with pink tissue\npresent in the middle with a callus forming in the pink area. In the wrinkles of the wound is moist pink skin and there are\npieces of straw and hair stuck to the wound. The licensee asked the veterinarian over the phone at that time if it was okay\nto put \"Wound-Kote\" blue lotion spray wound dressing on the wound once a day or every other day. The veterinarian\nverbally stated that treatment was acceptable. The licensee has been applying the spray every day or every other day\ndepending on how it looks and has not contacted the vet since that initial conversation. The inspector attempted to\ncontact this veterinarian but they no longer work at the practice and there were no medical records present for this dog at\nthe veterinary practice under the name \"Piper\" or her microchip number. This dog also has an abnormal skin condition on\nher left hip that the licensee states is a 'hot spot' and is treating with the same wound spray once a day or every other\nday. There is no approved treatment plan for skin conditions that is approved by the attending veterinarian.\nDirect and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on\nproblems of animal health, behavior, and well-being can be discussed and a treatment plan can be made. The facility\nmust communicate any animal health concerns with their attending veterinarian so that an effective treatment plan can be\nput in place.\nThis dog must be seen by a licensed veterinarian by end of business 15-April-2022 and create an effective treatment\nplan."
