      "narrative": "2.40(b)(2) VETERINARY CARE - DIRECT\nA pen contained 9 adult rabbits. One long-haired adult grey, white, and red ('calico') rabbit had a red/brown dry scab on its\nback that was approximately 1 inch in diameter. The rabbit had an additional approximately 1 inch by 0.5 inch dry\nred/brown scab over its left shoulder blade, and another red/brown dry scab at the base of its left ear that was\napproximately 0.75 inches in length and 0.2 inches in width. The rabbit had an area of hair loss at the back of the base of\nits ears that was approximately 1.5 inches in diameter. Within both ear canals, there was a large buildup of a dry brownish\nyellow waxy substance, along with small areas of reddened skin that appeared to be inflammation of the skin. The rabbit\nwas observed to shake its head frequently and scratch repeatedly at the base of its ears. The rabbit intermittently carried\nits ears in an abnormal, lop-sided manner. The licensee stated that he had observed the largest scab on the back of this\nrabbit, and that it was a result of a fight with another rabbit, and that he was treating the scab with Vetricyn. The licensee\nstated that he had not observed the crust in the ear canals or abnormal position of the ears.\nWithin the same enclosure, an adult white rabbit had a moderate amount of a dry brownish yellow waxy substance in both\near canals, along with small areas of red in the ear canals. The rabbit was observed shaking its head. The licensee had\nnot observed the condition of the ears or head-shaking behavior prior to the inspection.\nThere was an adult female red and white goat in the outdoor small livestock pen who was limping. The goat intermittently\nheld up its front right leg, and the leg appeared slightly bent most of the time. There were no signs of swelling or wounds.\nThe licensee stated that he was aware of this problem, and that this goat had been recently acquired and that he was\nwaiting for the previous owner to provide treatment for the animal.\nThere was also an adult female dark brown and white sheep in the outdoor small livestock pen who was limping on both\nfront legs. Both front legs appeared to be stiff, and the animal walked with an abnormal gate. There were no signs of\nswelling or wounds. The licensee stated that he had not noticed this sheep's lameness prior to the inspection.\nPrompt identification of health problems and the provision of timely, adequate veterinary care is important to ensure\nanimal health and alleviate suffering and discomfort. Rabbits with ear or skin problems may experience discomfort, pain,\nor secondary infections. Goats and sheep with lameness may suffer from pain, and may have difficulty moving around to\naccess food, water, or shelter. Some conditions may be contagious, thus prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent the\ncondition from occurring in other animals.\nCorrect by contacting a veterinarian to seek guidance regarding medical care for the goat, sheep, and two rabbits and by\nproviding appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in your animals.\nCorrect by 5PM on September 30th, 2020. By the time of the exit interview, the licensee had contacted the Attending\nVeterinarian."
