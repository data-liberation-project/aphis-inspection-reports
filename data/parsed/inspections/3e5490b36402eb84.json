The inspector called the licensee and left a message\nrequesting the location of the dogs and the licensee returned the call and left a message confirming that the dogs\nwere no longer located at the facility.\nThe inspector then returned the call and left a message requesting the licensee to call back or to call the Field\nOffice and provide the location of the dogs. An Animal Care Compliance Specialist also attempted to contact the\nlicensee in order to locate the dogs, but as of the date of this inspection the licensee has failed to provide the\nlocation of the dogs to any Animal Care official.\nFailure to provide the location of the animals does not allow for the enforcement of the regulations and standards of\nthe Animal Welfare Act, therefore, the health, well-being and living conditions of these dogs could suffer.\nA licensee shall promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name, address,\nmanagement, or substantial control or ownership of his business or operation, or of any additional sites, within 10\ndays of any change.\nBy December 21, 2017, the licensee must send the change of location to the Regional Director by certified mail.\nThe inspector left a message on the licensee's cell phone stating that the location(s) of the dogs must be sent to the\nField Office (Regional Director) by December 21, 2017."
