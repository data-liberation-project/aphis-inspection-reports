The facility has a\ntreatment plan but these rabbits were overlooked and were not treated. None of these rabbits exhibited any signs of\nhead shaking, head tilting, scratching, or hematomas but a couple of them had an excessive amount of debris\nThere is a concern that these rabbits may have ear mites in their ears. When the clinical signs were identified the\nPresident instructed the staff to treat the rabbits right away with medication prescribed by the attending veterinarian.\nAll animals shall be observed daily in sufficient detail to assess their health and well being, taking into account\nprevious history of disease &/or other conditions that may be prevalent to a particular species, to minimize the\ndiscomfort of affected animals as well as the possibly of disease transmission to other susceptible animals. No\nfurther correction needed at this time.\n** There were two rabbits (H-721 and D-193) with eye conditions and one rabbit (E-451) with severe diarrhea. One\nrabbit had an opaque white appearance with a disturbed surface covering its right eye. The rabbit didn't exhibit any\nsigns of distress or pain but there was some drainage from the eye. The second rabbit had yellow crust and some\ndrainage from his right eye which was completely sealed shut. The rabbit with the diarrhea had an increased\nrespiration rate and was stretched out. The President stated that it has been bred twice without producing any litters\nand would probably be euthanized. None of these conditions were observed by the staff and they had not consulted\nthe veterinarian. All animals shall be observed daily in sufficient detail to assess their health and well being, taking\ninto account previous history of disease &/or other conditions that may be prevalent to a particular species, to\nminimize the discomfort of affected animals as well as the possibly of disease transmission to other susceptible\nanimals. A mechanism for direct & frequent caretaker communication is required so that timely information about\nanimal health & well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian to reduce the risk of further spread of the\ndisease to the affected animal as well as other susceptible animals.
