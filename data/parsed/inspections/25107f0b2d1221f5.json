The hanging rope was tied to two\nvertical wooden poles and was approximately one foot from the ceiling on each end. There is a risk to reach the heat\nlamps from a high hanging rope and cause burns or other injuries.\nThe enclosure must be constructed in a manner to prevent the animal access to the heat lamps in order to protect the\nanimal from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place to ensure all animal facilities are\nstructurally sound and in good repair to contain and protect the animal from injury.\nThis was corrected on February 18, 2022 by moving the hanging ropes lower and away from the heat lamps.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and licensee.\nEnd Section"
