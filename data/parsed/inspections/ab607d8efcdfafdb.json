When the appropriate individuals were notified on July 20th, initial corrective measures\nwere taken. The temperature continued to rise, and recorded temperatures in the hamster facility on July 21st\nranged from 88 \u2013 93 degrees. The initial corrective action was insufficient to maintain the appropriate temperature\nfor hamsters, leading to an ambient temperature of >85 degrees for more than 12 hours. Indoor housing for\nhamsters shall provide for the health and comfort of the animals, and the ambient temperature shall not be allowed\nto exceed 85 degrees.\nTo remain corrected after July 24th, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
