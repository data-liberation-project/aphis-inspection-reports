The protocol describes\nthe euthanizing agent as pentobarbital, given IM. The registrant agrees that using pentobarbital via an IM route is\nnot a professionally accepted standard, but that the route of delivery had been overlooked during the PI preparation\nand the IACUC review of the protocol. It is crucial that the IACUC carefully and diligently review all aspects of\nanimal use protocols to ensure that errors such as these are caught and corrected.\nThe IACUC must ensure, during its review and approval of activities involving animals that the proposed activities\nare in accordance with 9 CFR part 1 and 2. If a deviation is required, an acceptable justification for departure must\nbe presented in writing, reviewed and approved.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
