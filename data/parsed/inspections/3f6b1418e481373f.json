It was approximately 1-1.5 inches in diameter\non the upper arm and between 0.5-1 inches in diameter on the lower arm approximately. There was moderate-severe\nswelling around the wound, with a green discharge inside of the wound on the upper arm, along with scab tissue forming\nalong various parts of it, indicating this wound happened at least several days ago. The guinea pig cried out when it was\npicked up and while it was being handled and kept its arm in an upward bent fashion and would not put it down. These\nsigns indicate the animal was in pain. No one at the facility was aware of the injury prior to the inspection, and daily\nobservations were completed prior to this inspection. Adequate daily observations, in addition to timely communication\nwith the attending veterinarian, are essential to quickly identifying diseases and injuries, as well as timely treatment to\neliminate suffering. Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily\nobservation of all animals to assess their health and well-being. In addition, if daily observations are performed by\nsomeone other than the attending veterinarian, then a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so\nthat timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian.\nCorrect by: May 13, 2022, by 6pm."
