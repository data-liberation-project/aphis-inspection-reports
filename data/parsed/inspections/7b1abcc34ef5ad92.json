The animal at that time was controlled by a system of leads, but it was too fast, too\nlarge, and too unpredictable to be handled safely by the lead system. Since that time, the 3 primary cougar handlers\nattended a half-day training session at a major zoo, and also had staff from that zoo observe their handling\ntechniques on site over a two day period of time. Also, the new Head Animal Trainer, who does not personally\nhandle the animal, attended the same half-day session as mentioned above. The two secondary animal handlers\nhave worked under the supervision of a primary handler, but have never had any formal training beyond what was\navailable at the facility. The animal is currently handled by a two lead system using a primary handler and a\nsecondary handler, with another primary handler available by radio. On 3/7/16, the facility was notified that the level\nof training and experience does NOT fulfill the correction requirements of the citation of 5/12/15. The facility still has\nnot completed training and gained experience handling (cid:28)adult(cid:29) cougars. Most of their training has been handling\ntheir own animal as it grows and develops. They need to be able to anticipate the future handling requirements of\nthis animal. Failure to handle the animal properly will increase the risk of harm to the animal or to the public, or may\nlead to potential escape. This facility must either hire an individual who has the necessary handling experience and\nknowledge, or obtain the necessary experience themselves before continuing to handle this animal in this manner\n(by the lead system).\nREMAINS UNCORRECTED"
