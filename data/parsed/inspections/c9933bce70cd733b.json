      "narrative": "Records were reviewed for one young male baboon,30938. They state he died as a result of septicemia from\ntrauma wounds. Clinical records indicate that this animal had a clean health check and was in good body condition\napproximately 3 weeks before his death. At time of the health check on 10/28/13, the animal was relocated to a\nnew enclosure which housed a large number of male baboons. Daily observational logs during this time period do\nnot document an animal with wounds. They do not indicate any behavioral observation of the newly introduced\nanimal for acceptance into the group. The necropsy report states the animal was emaciated at time of death and\nhad multiple scabs from bite wounds on the body and a large abscess on the leg and ankle. The description of the\nwounds and body condition indicate that the animal had injuries for many days before its death. The animal\nreceived no care for his injuries as it was not identified or reported to the veterinary staff.\nRecords were reviewed for an adult female rhesus, 29458. This animal was placed in a newly formed group of\nconspecifics in building 134 in March 2013. Sometime prior to September 2013 this animal suffered a tail de gloving\ninjury. On October 30, 2013 the animal was involved in a second traumatic episode and sustained injuries that\nincluded multiple lacerations to the face and body. A portion of the tail was also amputated during the altercation. A\nstaff veterinarian stated during this inspection that the injuries were severe enough to warrant assessment of the\ngroup by the facility behavior team. There is no documentation that any behavior assessment of the individual or\ngroup was performed post injury.\nAn adequate program of veterinary care includes daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-\nbeing. Daily observation may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian, but there must be\ndirect and frequent communication so timely and accurate information on problems with animal health, behavior and\nwell - being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nNewly introduced animals must be observed for adjustment issues and animals with trauma wounds must be\npromptly identified and the behavior and vet staff promptly notified for intervention to provide adequate veterinary\ncare to the animals.\nCORRECT BY : 6-10-14\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted on June 2-4 2014 with the attending veterinarian and facility\nemployees.\nAdditional Inspectors\nKjos Jeanne, Veterinary Medical Officer\nMoore Mary, Veterinary Medical Officer"
