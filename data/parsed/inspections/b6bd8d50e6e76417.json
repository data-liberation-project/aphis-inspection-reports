The animal was tranquilized using a dart gun and subsequently captured. The animal was transported\nto the facility veterinary clinic where she was examined by a veterinarian and underwent medical tests, treatment,\nand monitoring. The animal was observed to be in declining health later the same day and was euthanized.\nAccording to a pathology report, the animal'(cid:25)s health was compromised by damage to one kidney with subsequent\ninternal bleeding. Abdominal radiographs were taken after capture and were unremarkable. The incident was\nself-reported and the facility is currently reinforcing transport enclosure doors. This enclosure design had been used\nby the facility for several years without incident.\nTransport enclosures should be strong enough to contain nonhuman primates securely in order to prevent the\nanimals from escaping. The facility should ensure that all nonhuman primate transport enclosures are of sufficient\nstrength to contain the animals.\nCorrect for all transport enclosures by August 28, 2016.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.\nAccompanied by Dr. Michael Schnell.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
