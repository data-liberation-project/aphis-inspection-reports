The licensee noticed the cloudiness and began treating the eye with ophthalmic\nantibiotics, but not at the direction of the attending veterinarian.\nThe lack of veterinary care as directed by the attending veterinarian can cause a mild and treatable condition to become\nmore serious and cause unnecessary pain or discomfort to the regulated animals. Self treatment with antibiotics/drugs\nwithout the proper diagnosis and consultation of the veterinarian can pose a serious risk for the regulated animals if the\nmedicine is incorrect for the problem.\nCommunication regarding animal health problems must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner to\nensure the proper diagnosis and treatment of the regulated animals.\nTo be corrected by 29 March 2022.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.\nEnd Section"
