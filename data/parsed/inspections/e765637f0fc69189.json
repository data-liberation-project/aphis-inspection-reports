      "narrative": "-Two female dogs were observed to be very thin. This included an approximately 5 1/2 year old female Boxer \"Lily\"\n(#0A02082504) and a female Miniature Pinscher \"Layla\" which was approximately 10 months old according to the\nlicensee. Both dogs had obvious visible waists and abdominal tucks. The tops of their lumbar vertebrae were visible\nand the pelvic bones were becoming prominent. \"Lily\" was housed with another adult Boxer and \"Layla\" was\nhoused with 4 other Miniature Pinschers. Both dogs were active and, according to a facility representative, the dogs\nhad been co-housed with other dogs for at least two weeks. The licensee and facility representative mentioned that\nthey had noticed the dogs were getting thin and thought the dogs may be getting \"bullied\" by another dog in each\nenclosure over the food. They also said that they would go into the enclosure to separate the dogs during their daily\nfeeding; however, the dogs were still housed with the other dog(s) and they were still thin. A veterinarian had not\nbeen contacted about these dogs' ongoing body conditions. A thin body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate\nnutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian\nregarding the body conditions of both of these dogs. This veterinary consultation is in order to ensure that an\naccurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must\nensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."

A buildup of dirt was observed within some of the grooves of the roughened surfaces; also hair\nwas observed in some of the edges. These roughened and grooved surfaces may not allow for adequate cleaning\nand sanitization increasing the risk of disease hazards. The jagged edges may also increase the risk of injury to the\ndogs.
