      "narrative": "Numerous goats were observed with nasal discharge and several were observed with diarrhea and areas of hair\nloss (described in detail below). The attending veterinarian had not been contacted prior to the inspection regarding\nany of these animals. None of the goats with nasal discharge or hair loss were receiving any veterinary treatment at\nthe time of inspection. Three goats were receiving Nuflor without the knowledge of the veterinarian or being listed in\nthe Program of Veterinary Care.\n**About 12-15 goats were observed with nasal discharge in both pastures. The nasal discharge was slimy in\nappearance and mostly white to clear with a few having a greenish color. There was also dry white crusty material\ninside and around the nose in some goats. Coughing was occasionally heard. None of these goats were receiving\nany treatments and had not been identified by staff.\n**Four of the goats were pulled from the main two herds and put inside a sick pen. One of the four goats was pulled\nthe night before and hadn(cid:25)t been treated with any medication, but the three other goats were receiving Nuflor.\nAnother goat with ear tag Y-26 located in pasture 2 was identified of having diarrhea. The goat had a large amount\nof brown greenish wet material on the tail, around the base of the tail, under the tail, on the upper portion of the\nback legs that was consistent with diarrhea. Y-26 was not receiving any treatments and the staff was unaware of the\ngoat(cid:25)s condition.\n**Two goats(R-24 and W-119) had a circular area of hair loss on the upper portion of the bridge of the nose. The\nareas of hair loss showed pink skin with white flaky material on the surface of the skin.\n**For the months of October, November, and December at total of 18 goats have naturally died. This is roughly a\n10% mortality loss for the goat herd over the past 3 months. No necropsies were performed and no diagnostic\ntesting was conducted to determine the cause of death. Fecal testing was performed on some of the goats before\ndeath that determined there was a parasite infection, but the cause of death was never determined. The owner\nreported that some of the goats were older but other goats simply died without showing any signs.\nAnimals not provided appropriate veterinary care will often not improve and will lead to the worsening of the original\ncondition along with secondary infections. Medications not approved by the attending veterinarian may have no\nimpact on the disease or may cause further harm to the animal. Mortality in goats is an important sign a serious\ndisease is present in a herd. A veterinarian needs to be contacted when there is an unexpected death, so the\ndisease can be properly diagnosed and the other animals be treated or given a preventive. Because of the recent\nhigh mortality loss, all animal deaths must have a necropsy conducted by a license veterinarian. All animals must be\nprovided appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in a timely manner and\nall treatments must be approved by the veterinarian either by the Program of Veterinarian Care or by direct\ncommunication. At the time of the exit interview the attending veterinarian had treated the animals identified in need\nof veterinary care."
