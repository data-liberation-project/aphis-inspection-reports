      "narrative": "On 4/22/17 a one year old Eurasian Lynx with a history of seizure activity was found dead. According to facility\nrecords, on 4/21/17 the animal had \"back to back seizures\". The attending veterinarian came to check on him, and,\naccording to facility records, she stated that the animal was \"still adjusting to the meds\", and that they should just\nkeep an eye on him. The next day the animal had a seizure again, and the vet was called, and, according to facility\nrecords, she asked the facility to keep a close eye on him, and keep her updated. At 9 PM the animal was found\ndead in his enclosure.\nThe exhibitor stated that the animal began having seizures at 8 months old. The animal continued to have\nintermittent seizures since that time. The only treatment regimen ever attempted was phenobarbital alone, which\nwas not sufficient to adequately control the seizures in this animal.\nA female lion cub, approximately 5 months old, was found to be lame in its hindquarters at the time of inspection.\nOn 3/15/17 in the facility records it was noted that the cub was favoring its right front leg. There was no feeding plan\navailable at the time of inspection, and it was unclear as to whether the cub is receiving an appropriate balance of\nminerals in its diet necessary for normal bone development and growth. No diagnostics have been performed on\nthis animal since its arrival on site. The exhibitor stated that the animal has been observed by two veterinarians, and\nthat the veterinarians expressed a view that the cub would grow out of it. There was no consideration of the\npossibility of metabolic bone disease, or other orthopedic problems.\nFailure to provide appropriate diagnostics and treatment can result in a poor outcome for animals.The exhibitor\nmust ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care, to include the use of appropriate methods to\ndiagnose and treat diseases. Veterinarians should have sufficient experience with the species on hand, so as to\nensure appropriate care.\nThe lion cub should be examined by an experienced veterinarian for a diagnostic workup by 5/1/17. All animals\nshould receive appropriate veterinary care from this time forward."

      "narrative": "There was no feeding plan for exotic cats available for review. At the time of inspection a female lion cub,\napproximately 5 months old, had a pan of food that consisted entirely of muscle meat without bone. There were not\nany supplements added to the meal, as the exhibitor stated she gives supplements only with morning or evening\nmeals. The cub was limping at the time of inspection, and a review of the facility records showed that the cub has\nexperienced intermittent lameness, which could be a sign of metabolic bone disease. When the inspectors asked to\nsee the supplements that were being fed to the cub, there was no open container of calcium supplement present.\nThe exhibitor had two unopened sealed bags of a white powder, which she stated was a calcium supplement, but\nthey were not labeled, and it was uncertain what form of calcium they might be, or how much should be fed. When\nasked how much calcium the exhibitor was feeding to this cub, she stated that it depended on various\ncircumstances. The supplements were being stored in the exhibitor's home, rather than the food prep area. There\nwere no posted feeding instructions present.\nFailure to provide an appropriate diet can lead to serious medical problems for the animals. The exhibitor must\nensure that diets have sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet should be prepared\nwith consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. The exhibitor should develop\nappropriate diet plans for the exotic cats on site.\nTo be corrected by 5/26/17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the exhibitor.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRosendale Marcy, Veterinary Medical Officer"
