Surgery records for the six swine assigned to protocol 15-001 were reviewed during this inspection and two\nswine (04445, 04446) had non-survival surgery performed that involved creating ten defects in the spleen (two more\nthan stated in the protocol). The IACUC 18 February 2015 meeting minutes document that \"Some members raised\nthe question of whether 8 spleen incisions were excessive...\" when discussing a similar protocol (15-004). The\nfacility IACUC did not approve an increase in the number of splenic defects for protocol 15-001. The facility\npersonnel therefore, did not follow protocol 15-001 for these two swine.\nProtocols 15-006 and 15-007 approved for sheep survival surgery describes post-operative pain medication with\nBuprenex for three days. This medication was only provided once daily for eight sheep (G4705, G4707, G4708, and\nG4711 on protocol 15-006; G4702, G4703, G4706, and G4713 on protocol 15-007) maintained postoperatively\nunder these protocols. The medication chart in the protocols indicated that Buprenorphine (Buprenex) should be\ngiven every 6 or every 12 hours. See section 2.33(b)(4) below for specific ramifications. The facility IACUC did not\napprove the decrease in frequency in the administration of the Buprenorphine. The facility personnel therefore, did\nnot follow protocols 15-006 and 15-007 for these eight sheep.\nThe facility IACUC must review and approve all proposed protocols and significant changes to ensure that the\nproposed activities comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. Correct by ensuring that all future activities are\ndone in accordance with the IACUC approved protocol and all significant changes to the ongoing use of animals are\nreviewed and approved by the IACUC.

      "narrative": "The ongoing protocols 15-006 and 15-007 were reviewed during this inspection and include the use of a paralytic\nand cardiac bypass during the thoracotomy. Both protocols state that the facility \"...will use invasive blood pressure\n(IBP), heart rate and rhythm to monitor the depth of anesthesia while under paralytics\". Blood pressure and heart\nrate are known to increase if the animal is experiencing pain. The paralytic was shown in the records to be\nadministered several times until the end of the cardiac bypass. Animals placed on cardiac bypass cannot be\nadequately monitored using heart rate and/or blood pressure since the cardiac bypass is controlling these functions\nfor the heart. The sheep are under the influence of the paralytic during the cardiac bypass so an additional method\nof animal monitoring must be instituted and described in the protocol to ensure the sheep are maintained under\nsufficient levels of the anesthesia and analgesia while under the effects of the paralytic. This was previously cited\nfor protocol 14-004 on the November 5, 2014 inspection report and no additional surgeries were conducted on this\nprotocol.\nThe current protocols 15-006 and 15-007 do not specify how monitoring will occur during the period of bypass or\nwhat additional methods are in place to ensure the sheep are receiving adequate anesthesia/analgesia during\ncardiac bypass while under the effects of the paralytic. Surgery must be performed with appropriate\nanalgesics/anesthetics and monitoring to assure that the animal is not experiencing pain during the procedures with\nthe use of paralytics. Although this is a repeat non-compliant item, the registrant was verbally instructed to have the\nprotocols address the use of paralytics with cardiac bypass before additional animal surgeries are conducted.
