Some animals only had single lesions, while others had a cluster of sores. Many\nanimals had winged insects on and around these lesions. Many animals were scratching, moving, and rubbing on\nor around these affected areas. The cause of these sores is unknown, and the facility is currently not treating the\nlesions. Open sores are a clear health problem, may lead to secondary infections or other complications and are\nindicators of distress or discomfort to the affected animals. The facility must contact a licensed veterinarian within\n24 hours of this date to determine the cause of these sores, and then develop an appropriate treatment plan.

These \"rubs\" are suspended several feet above the ground\nand are impregnated with a permethrin designed to stick to the animals when they make contact with the rub.\nHowever, the park is a very large facility and there are no more than 5 rubs covering this large area of land. Current\npest control practices do not appear adequate to control the insects infesting the buffalo. Insects are a nuisance to\naffected animals, and may impact the health and well being of the animals.\nThe facility must develop and document a plan to control pests throughout the facility.
