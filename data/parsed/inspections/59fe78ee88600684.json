Ribs and the outline of the dorsal portions of the backbone were evident\nunder the skin, as were areas of the hip bones.In the neck area, there were sunken areas along the jugular furrows\non both the right and left sides. Overall, the dog appeared alert and active. The licensee stated that the dog had\ntrouble keeping weight on and had last littered over 12 months ago. When asked when a veterinarian had last\nevaluated the dog, the licensee stated that the dog had not been evaluated by a veterinarian for the weight loss\nissue.\nSignificant weight loss with visible bony prominences such as backbone, points of the hips and ribs, may indicate\ninadequate caloric intake, parasitism, or a possible underlying disease issue.\nEach dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases.\nIzzy needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian within 48 hours to determine the cause of the weight loss and to\nestablish a treatment or nutritional plan to correct the loss of body condition."
