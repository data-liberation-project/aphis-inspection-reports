The\nlicensee did not grant access as requested, but instead stated that he did not know what he and his wife wanted to\ndo regarding the inspection. He stated he did not know anything about the recordkeeping at the facility that only his\nwife knew where the records were kept, and she had to leave for an appointment. The inspectors explained that if\nhis wife was able to show him where the records were kept that he could accompany us on the inspection as he\nwas also listed as a responsible party. He then returned inside the house to discuss the situation with his wife. He\nexited the house at 10:53 am, and informed the inspectors that his wife would make a decision regarding the\ninspection and be outside with us shortly. His wife met us outside and explained that she had an appointment and\nwould not accompany us on inspection. We again explained that she could show her husband, or us, where the\nrecords were kept and that we could conduct the inspection with her husband. She declined to accompany us on\nthe inspection, or to allow her husband to accompany us. Inspectors explained that this was considered a refusal of\ninspection, and that the refusal would be documented on an inspection report as a non-compliant item. She\nindicated that she understood that she would receive a report in the mail documenting the refusal of inspection. All\ndealers must allow APHIS officials to inspect and photograph the records, facilities, property and animals as the\nAPHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the Act and assess the health and welfare of the animals.\n*****\nTo be corrected from this date forward.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMeek Sandra, Animal Care Inspector"
