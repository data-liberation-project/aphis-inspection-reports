One of the pallets contained bags of rabbit feed, one of which was\ndamaged and spilling feed onto the floor, with rodent feces noted on the ground in front of the pallet. The second pallet\ncontained plastic wrapped goat protein blocks in good condition. The third pallet contained approximately 7 additional\nplastic wrapped goat protein blocks in which two were damaged and open. Each of the pallets had a sheet of cardboard\nseparating the pallet from the feed. The sheet of cardboard beneath the third pallet had several handfuls of broken up\nprotein block with a large amount of rodent feces and two deceased \u201cpinkie\u201d mice on top of it. This shed is currently\ncleaned on a weekly basis and was documented to have been last cleaned on 5/23/25. A large number of flies (too\nnumerous to count) were also observed, in flight only, within the same storage shed and within the alleyways of the upper\nbarn. Insects and mammalian pests can be reservoirs for disease, infection and if present in food storage areas can lead\nto contamination of feed. A safe and effective program for the control of insect ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian\npests shall be established and maintained.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
