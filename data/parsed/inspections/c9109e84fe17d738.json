The volunteer was accompanied by a senior volunteer when both entered the enclosure for feeding\nand cleaning duties.\nAnimals escaping from primary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm and further injury when they are not safely\ncontained. They also pose a threat to other people and animals if they are not effectively held in their designated\nenclosures as needed to complete routine responsibilities.\nHousing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals and protect them from\ninjury.
