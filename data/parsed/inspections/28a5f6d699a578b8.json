      "narrative": "During this inspection the female lynx was observed being totally non- weight bearing on the right foreleg. There\nwas no documentation of what happened and what was initially done, until it was written down during this\ninspection.\nThe licensee states the two Siberian lynx were separated due to a fight during a breeding attempt 3 days ago. The\nowner was out of town but told her husband to separate the cats which he did. Then he noticed the female cat had\na swollen right paw. When the owner returned two days after the injury, she examined the paw and stated she\ncould not find any wounds, and she started the lynx on antibiotics which she had for one of her dogs. The owner\nstates the swelling is improved and that the cat is acting normally besides being totally non-weight bearing on the\nright front leg.\nWhen an animal is injured the attending veterinarian is to be consulted so that appropriate veterinary care can be\nprovided on a timely basis. This is to prevent unnecessary suffering and pain. The veterinarian should have been\ncalled as soon as it was observed the animal was injured and needed medical examination and treatment. Even\nafter starting antibiotics, the licensee did not consult with the veterinarian to tell him the lynx is still non weight\nbearing after 3 days. The lynx may need additional treatments. The veterinarian was notified during this inspection\nand the licensee is waiting for a return call. To be corrected by 3-9-16.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representatives."
