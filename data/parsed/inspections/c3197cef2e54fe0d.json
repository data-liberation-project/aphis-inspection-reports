The crate she was in measured 24 inches tall\nx 17 inches long.\nOne dog (Benzi) measured to be 26 inches tall x 15 inches long. The crate he was in measured 24 inches tall x 17\ninches long.\nIt is obvious that these crates were too small to allow for the dogs to be able to stand up, turn around, and make\nnormal postural movements. More care will need to be taken to ensure that all the dogs / puppies being transported\nare in crates that have sufficient space."
