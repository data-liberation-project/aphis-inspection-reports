A facility representative stated that he had noticed a small amount of blood-tinged foam coming\nfrom the pig's mouth for the past 1-2 weeks; however, the pig was not receiving veterinary care for the condition.\nBlood present in the mouth can indicate an injury or a dental problem that can be painful and can interfere with the\nanimal's ability to eat. The pig also had excessively long hooves that needed to be trimmed. Excessively long\nhooves can be painful, can interfere with the animal's ability to walk normally, and can progress to other leg\nproblems. The licensee must have this pig examined by a veterinarian and treated appropriately and must provide a\nrecord of treatment to the inspector upon request.\nTO BE COMPLETED BY MARCH 31, 2014."
