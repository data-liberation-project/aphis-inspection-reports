The licensee stated that the incident occurred when an adult male entered the business an\nunknowingly stood too close to the area where the capuchin was located. The licensee also stated that the capuchin\nwas startled by the distracted person who stepped back into the public barrier. It subsequently bit the person on the\nback of the left leg, leaving multiple bite wounds above the ankle. The monkey was on a leash behind the public\nbarrier which consisted of a single chain attached to plastic posts. The chain had enough slack or was loose\nenough, to allow the person to unintentionally enter the animal area.\nFailure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers during public exhibition can be a safety hazard for the animal\nand/or the public. During public exhibition, the animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the\nanimal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public\nso as to assure the safety of animals and the public.\nTo be corrected by: 5:00 PM on July 19th, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
