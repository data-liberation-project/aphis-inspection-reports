It can foster skin infections and\nhinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. Also, matted hair does not maintain the same insulating\nqualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for\ncoat maintenance for the health and well-being of the dog. Correct by 5/20/16."
