The house is partially\ncollapsed in a hole with multiple wooden sides with holes chewed in them and chewed boards on the upper platform area.\nThere several chewed sides and boards on the platform located in the enclosure with the two gray hybrids.\nExposed fencing and holes in the ground can be a source of possible injury. If the regulated animals are running and trip\ninto the holes or drop a leg through the fence into the holes beneath there is an increased risk of breaking a leg.\nThe broken down dog house and holes chewed in the platforms and sides of the shelters can be a source of possible\ninjury causing splinters in their mouths, and the instability of damaged shelters and platforms the animals climb on or into\nfor shelter.\nAll holes should be filled and exposed fencing covered.
