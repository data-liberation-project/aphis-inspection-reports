      "narrative": "Two baboon enclosures had loops of water lines entering the cage from the top at the time of inspection. The\nwaterlines were attached to the source and to the cage at the water nipple. This created a loop of water line\nsufficiently large for the animals to put a head through and possibly cause strangulation. Facility personnel\nimmediately removed the water lines from the enclosure when they were pointed out by USDA personnel and the\nanimal staff was instructed to assure the cages were pulled away from the water line origin to prevent the lines from\nbeing reintroduced to the cages. Two more Baboons had enrichment devices attached to the front of their\nenclosures by a rope that was sufficiently long that it could be pulled into the enclosure (but not the enrichment\ndevice). This would create a loop of rope sufficiently large that a head or limb could be passed through and become\nentrapped. Personnel must ensure that the enclosures in which animals are placed do not contribute to these risks.\nCorrect by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to handle animals and equipment in a manner that takes\ninto account the special capabilities and behaviors of the animals.\nTwo racks of rabbit enclosures, containing six rabbits each, had water nipples that did not fully reach into the\ncage. The animal care staff had not noticed that the nipples did not break the plane of the back of the cage where\nthey were supposed to come into the cage through a hole approximately one and a half inches in diameter. The\nstaff had provided water bottles to two of the animals as an addition to the nipples. Having the nipple essentially\nrecessed into a small hole makes it difficult for the animal to easily access fresh water and could cause stress in the\nanimal and possibly lead to dehydration. Correct by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to monitor that the\nbasic needs of each animal are easily accessible.\nOne cat, that had recently had surgery, was noted to be in an enclosure that contained an Elizabethan collar.\nThe collar was not on the animal even though the surgical record said an E-collar would be used and did not have\nany end date for the wear of the device. The collar is used to prevent self-injurious behavior and, if not on, may lead\nto animal injury. Correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained to assure post-procedural care is provided and\ndocumented as directed.\nImmediate post-procedural care was outlined in the protocols for two animals but there was no documentation of\nthese procedures being performed by the investigative staff. An anesthesia record was present but did not indicate\nany animal information past the discontinuation of anesthesia or for the remainder of the procedure day. Animal\nnumber 23161 had no immediate post-procedural record and animal number 444 also had no immediate\npost-procedural record and facility personnel stated that the procedure may go as late as 8 PM at which point the\nanimal would be returned to its enclosure. Failure to complete proper post-procedural care could lead to animals\nexperiencing unnecessary pain or distress and, often, the only way to monitor that the investigators are following the\nstandards approved by the IACUC is by records review. Correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained and\ndocument their compliance with established post-procedural care.\nAll of the noted items above, except post-procedural care were addressed by the facility when identified by\nUSDA personnel. Correct against the future occurrence of these items by ensuring training and instruction of all\npersonnel in humane methods of animal maintenance and experimentation. The training must include: The basic\nneeds of each species of animal; Proper handling and care for the various species of animals used by the facility;\nProper pre-procedural and post- procedural care of animals; and Aseptic surgical methods and procedures.\nTo be corrected by 26 August 2016"
