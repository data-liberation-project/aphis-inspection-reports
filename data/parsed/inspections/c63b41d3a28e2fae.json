There is a loose flap of skin over the nose. According to the caretaker\nthe rabbit was treated with tetracycline for 3 days and has not been treated for the past 3 days. There are no\nrecords to indicate treatment was received. The treatment has not resolved the condition of the rabbit prolonging the\nanimals suffering. At the time of inspection, the rabbit is showing signs of respiratory distress.\n*** One chinchilla (in top cage with one other chinchilla) is slightly hunched in the corner of the cage, with eyes\npartially closed. The chinchilla is also minimally responsive to stimuli. The animal appears to be lethargic and in\npoor health. NOTE: The other two chinchillas jumped in response to my presence and touching the cage.\nThe rabbit and chinchillas must be examined by a veterinarian by March 1, 2016 for an appropriate diagnosis and\ntreatment plan. The licensee must establish and maintain a program of veterinary care that ensure appropriate\nmethods to prevent, diagnose, and control disease and illness.\n***Three chinchillas have coats that appear ruffled and are moderately oily. According to the caretaker, the\nchinchillas receive a dust bath once a week. The chinchillas must be examined by a veterinarian to assess the\ncondition of the chinchilla(cid:25)s coats. To ensure the animals maintain a healthy coat, discuss with the attending\nveterinarian the requirements for the frequency of providing a dust bath and husbandry practices. Correct by March\n1, 2016"
