While standing still it appears the llama's foot/ankle joint\nis positioned/held in an abnormal, dropped position due to the excess length of the hooves. The llama was\nobserved walking around a large area without any obvious limp. The licensee stated she did not know when the\nfarrier would be available to trim the hooves. Excessively long hooves can lead to lameness and be potentially\npainful. All animals requiring hoof trimming need to have their hooves trimmed promptly and as frequently as\nnecessary for foot health.\nTo be corrected by: May 22, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee."
