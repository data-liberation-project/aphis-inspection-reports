The symptoms for the following kittens ranged\nfrom yellowish-brown crust built up on nostrils, clear nasal discharge, frequent sneezing, and/or watery eyes: 6 Bengal\nkittens (that had yet to be microchipped) housed in the white cage near the window in the living room; 4 Bengal kittens\n(Microchip #\u2019s: 985141005790884, 985141005790195, 985141005791045, and 985141005790573) in the white cage\nnear the kitchen in the living room; 3 Bengal kittens (Microchip #\u2019s: 985141005790456, 985141005790202, and\n985141005794887) housed in a tall black cage near the kitchen, immediately adjacent to the white cage; and 3 Bengal\nkittens (Microchip #\u2019s: 985141005790417, 985141005794471, and 985141005790930) housed in a tall black cage in the\nliving room near the back hallway. There was a Leopard cat kitten (not microchipped) - housed in the second room to the\nleft off the hallway- that had active diarrhea (liquid consistency dripped along sides of water bowl and semi-solid clumps\nadjacent to the water bowl inside of its litterbox), lethargy, shallow breathing, and cloudy eyes with squinting and clear\ndischarge from both. The latter kitten was being treated by the licensee after it stopped eating the week before (started\neating again this week), but like the other kittens, had yet to be examined by a veterinarian. Failure to follow appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases can negatively impact the overall health and well-being of the\nanimals, and could possibly lead to avoidable suffering and death. Each dealer must establish and maintain programs of\nadequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases\nand injuries. All kittens must be examined and treated by a veterinarian by the end of the day.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nGervais Edmonds-Wiggins, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
