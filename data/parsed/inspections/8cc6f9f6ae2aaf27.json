The definitive cause of death was due to\nelectrocution. An electric contractor confirmed that a loose ground wire in the junction box for the heating lamp was\nworn through and had contact with the metal junction box, which resulted in electrifying the metal enclosure. All\nprimary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner which protects the animals from injury. The\nfacility must alter, repair or replace the aforementioned enclosure, and develop a maintenance plan to ensure that\nall enclosures protect the animals housed in the enclosure from injury.\nCorrect by: This incident was reported by the IACUC and corrective measures have been taken."
