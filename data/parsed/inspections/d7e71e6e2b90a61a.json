Upon closer\nobservation of her left ear, it was observed to have a thickened cobblestone appearance near the ear canal which\nextended outward toward the hair on the tip of the ear. The dog\u2019s left ear also had a couple of small circular areas\nwith scab-like material covering them near the edge of the ear and closer to the hair line. The right ear had a section\naround its canal that also had a cobblestone and thickened appearance. Both of the ear canals had some hair that\nappeared dark red to burgundy in color. According to the licensee, he had noticed that the dog had been scratching\nat the ears for the past 2-3 weeks. He stated that he had initially used a mite treatment in the ears but did not see\nan improvement. He then said he had tried a different product and showed the inspector an ear drop product which\ncontained oils. When asked about the last time the dog\u2019s ears had been treated, the licensee stated it had been\nabout three days ago.The licensee had not been in contact with a veterinarian regarding treatment for the dog\u2019s\nears. Also according to the licensee, he did not think he had seen any improvement in the dog's condition since he\nhad noticed that the dog was itching at her ears.
