For example,\nthe following consignments for the February 2017 auction were from three unlicensed individuals: One kangaroo\n#2696; three wallaby #1535,1536, and 1537; and one neutered skunk #4028. Examples of consignments from\nunlicensed individuals for the March 31/April 1 auction included the following records: one ring-tailed lemur #4153;\none kinkajou #4018; eighteen sugar gliders of which more that five were females, lot #s 4009-4016; and a kangaroo\n#2739 and zebra #2738. No official one-time exemption forms were included in the auction files provided to the\ninspectors or in the Animal Care Information System. In order for APHIS Officials to track animal movement,\ninvestigate disease outbreaks, and to prevent illegal movement the person consigning the regulated animals to the\nauction sale must have a valid USDA License. The auction must not obtain an animal from any person who is\nrequired to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.\nCorrect by June 30, 2017.\nThis was a focused inspection conducted on June 1, 2017 of the records from the February 2017 and March/April\n2017 auctions.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the facility representative and two VMO Animal Care Inspectors.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBrunkhorst Susanne, Veterinary Medical Officer"
