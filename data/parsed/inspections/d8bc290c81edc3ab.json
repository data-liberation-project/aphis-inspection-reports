Viewing the area of the openings on the walls from the\ninside it was noted that damage had been done to the plastic housing in-between the ventilation openings leaving\nlarge holes/openings and some sharp plastic edges. If the tape comes loose the chinchilla could attempt to escape\nfrom the enclosure possibly injuring itself on the sharp edges. The missing sections of plastic also affect the\nstructural strength of the enclosure and the presence of the duct tape has a negative effect on air flow. The\nstructural strength of primary enclosures used to transport live animals must be sufficient to contain the animals and\nto withstand the normal rigor of transportation. Correct from this day forward."

The enclosure was not long enough for the cavy to lie down or wide enough to turn around\ncomfortably. Primary enclosures used to transport animals shall be large enough to ensure that each animal\ncontained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments.

The solid floor of the primary enclosure (pet taxi type enclosure) housing the cavy during\ntransport and while at the exhibit site was noted to be wet with urine. A very small amount of straw was noted\nbunched in the back of the enclosure but it was too small in quantity and not absorbent enough to absorb/cover all\nthe excreta. Lack of sufficient clean absorbent litter can lead to leakage and discomfort to and wetting of the\nanimals. Primary enclosures with a solid bottom shall contain clean litter of a suitable absorbent material which is\nsafe and nontoxic and in sufficient quantity to absorb and cover excreta. Correct from this day forward.\nInspection conducted at Pinkerton Park in Franklin TN.\nExit conducted with facility representative."
