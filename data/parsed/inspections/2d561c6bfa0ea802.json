However, the temperature in the building\nwas even higher several hours after the initial temperature was taken. Excessive heat can lead to severe health\nproblems for enclosed animals. The sheltered housing facilities must be sufficiently heated and cooled when\nnecessary to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes, and to provide for their health and\nwell-being. The ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not be above 85 deg F for more than 4\nconsecutive hours when non human primates are present.\nTo be corrected by 9/27/2015."
