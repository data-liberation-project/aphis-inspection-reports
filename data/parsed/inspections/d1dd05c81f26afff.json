The fencing had been repaired at that time,\nbut the other fallow deer have not been found. When the facility representative approached the animal, the fallow deer\ndragged her back legs behind her as she attempted to walk away. The facility representative immediately restrained the\ndeer, carried her into a contained area, and the Attending Veterinarian was contacted for further instructions.\nIn the fallow deer enclosure, there are still several areas in a state of disrepair. On the spring house, two pieces of metal\nroofing material have been torn from the rear right corner of the building which has created an approximately 18 inch by 4\nfoot gap in the roof. There is an additional 12 inch by 12 inch piece of metal roofing missing from an area below the above\nmentioned gap. This area is covered by a wire panel but still contains jagged edges which could cause injury if the deer\nwere to step through the paneling. The spring house is built into the the hillside which would allow the deer to have\naccess to the gaps and sharp edges in the roof. The other small building, in the same enclosure, has several rusted\nroofing panels which are becoming detached from the structure.\nEnclosures with gaps, holes, sharp edges, or unstable structures can allow for the entrapment, serious injury, escape, or\ndeath of the animals.\nThe fallow deer must be evaluated by a Licensed Veterinarian for further diagnosis and treatment of its health issues.\nCorrect by 10/07/2022.\nThe facility must also remove, repair, or replace the above mentioned items in the fallow deer enclosure to protect the\nanimals from injury and contain them.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
