The left eye was swollen\nshut, and there was yellowish green discharge covering the bottom eyelid. The animal was observed to be repeatedly\nscratching at the eye. The consignor gently wiped the eye with a paper towel to remove the discharge, and the underlying\neyeball was observed to have a whitish yellow protrusion on its surface approximately 0.25 cm in size. The conjunctiva\naround the eye was red and swollen. The warm room attendant stated that she had seen that the eye was swollen that\nmorning, but the attending veterinarian had not been contacted. The attending veterinarian had visited the auction earlier\nthat morning and had not been notified about the condition of this animal at that time. The attending veterinarian\nsubsequently examined the guinea pig and stated that it needed some antibiotics for the eye.\nPrompt identification of medical problems in animals is important for animal welfare because untreated or worsening\nmedical problems may cause pain, discomfort, or stress for the animal.\nCorrect by today, November 27, 2021, by establishing a means of frequent and direct communication with the attending\nveterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal heath, behavior, and well-being can be\naddressed promptly.\nThis inspection was conducted with company representatives and the exit briefing was conducted with the owner.\nA complete routine inspection was started today 11/27/21.
