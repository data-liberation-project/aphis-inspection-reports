This one shelter can fit only\n2 bears snugly, leaving the third bear without options for shelter from rain, snow, wind or sun. There was a second\nplastic cube shelter, however it was rolled into the pond and is not accessible.\nThere are 5 full grown wolves (80-100lbs) in one enclosure that has only one house structure that has an\napproximate 4ftx4ft by 2-2.5ft high wooden box, with an approximate 5-6ft roof extension. This shelter is not big\nenough to provide adequate shelter for all 5 full grown wolves. For all of the animals to fit in the box, they would\nhave to crowd in to all seek protection from the weather, which would not allow the animals to extend their legs or lie\ndown comfortably.\nThere are 2 foxes (red and gray) and one jackal in an enclosure that do not have any shade or wind break provided\nover the top/sides of the enclosures. There are small igloo houses provided for dens. The open tops of the\nenclosures do not provide enough shade or shelter from inclement weather. There are 2 wolves that also do not\nhave any shade/wind break to provide protection from inclement weather or direct sun, as the present tarp is\nshredded and effectively nonexistent.\nOn 20 March 2017 the inspectors were notified by the licensee that a shade/windbreak was provided to the two\nfoxes and the jackal as well the shade for one enclosure with the two wolf juveniles. On 21 March 2017 the\ninspectors were also notified that a shade structure was placed on the enclosure containing the 5 adult wolves.\nThe past 1-2 weeks have had temperatures in the 20\u2019s-30\u2019s, with rain and snow. During the inspection it was raining\nwith temperatures of 39 degrees F. The lack of proper shelter and/or shade for all regulated animals that allows\nthem to get out of inclement weather conditions or providing a wind break can be a source of physical stress and\ndiscomfort. In severe weather conditions, or continual rain, snow, cold and hot conditions can be a possible cause\nfor health problems if the animals do not have the option to get into any protective shelter or be provided any wind\nbreak or shade. There must be enough appropriate shelter space available for all regulated animals in an\nenclosure, that allows for each animal to lay down comfortably in order to get away from any inclement weather. All\nshade and wind break surfaces must be kept in good condition, repaired or replaced when worn or missing.\nFour coatimundi are housed in a large outdoor enclosure near the house. Three coatimundi were active and viewed\nduring inspection. Licensee stated there was one more, but inspectors were unable to view this animal. It must\nhave been hiding in a den box. The den boxes are not heated. Coatimundi are native to warm climates, such as\ncentral and South America. At the time of inspection, it was a cold, damp, windy overcast day. Winter\ntemperatures for the area easily fall well below freezing. Animals experience undue stress and may develop health\ncomplications when their provided environment is not consistent with their evolutionary development. Natural or\nartificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all\nanimals.

This enclosure did not allow the animals to have enough space for normal postural\nmovements and adequate freedom of movement. There was no space for the animals to fly. These bats need to be\nprovided an enclosure that meets their normal postural needs of flight. There were several wooden bars at the top\nof the enclosure for the bats to roost. However, the bats were provided no space to which they could hide from other\nanimals in the room. The room where these bats are housed contained several species of primates, sloths as well\nas other species.\nAfter discussion with the licensee and review of the animal health records it was determined that between 16\nOctober 2016 and 23 November 2016 that the entire colony of Jamaican Fruit bats (6) had died. Necropsies were\nnot performed to determine the cause of death. The lack of sufficient and appropriate space for these animals may\nhave contributed to their death.\nFailure to provide adequate space for normal postural and social adjustment can cause illness, injury, and\nunnecessary distress to the animals. Correct by ensuring that all animals are provided sufficient space to allow\neach animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. For the straw\ncolored bats this must include adequate space and enclosure furnishings to allow them to fly, hide, and climb.\nThere is a young Hyena approximately 35-45lbs that is in an approximate 4ft x4ft x 3ft high wire cage in the house.\nThis animal only has room to stand with his head forward, it cannot straighten its head in a fully upward position, or\nstand to pivot when it turns around which is a normal postural movement that hyenas make. The spacing only\nallows for the hyena to take 1-2 steps in either direction, before having to turn around. This is the extent of\nmovement this animal is allowed to make in a 24 hour period, as there is not any other area for the animal to go\nwhere it gets any exercise or is able to walk or lope which is part of the hyenas\u2019 natural movements. During the\ninspection the hyena could only step to one side then the other when agitated while people were moving around the\nhouse.\nThe lack of space prevents an animal from being able to exhibit its natural movements and postures, which can be\na critical source of stress and discomfort which can lead to possible health issues and behavioral concerns.\nThe hyena must be put in an enclosure that allows for the hyena to be able to assume normal postural movements\nand mobility, and to be able to raise its head up to its full height in a standing position.\nTo be corrected by: 25 March 2017"

In severe weather conditions, or continual rain, snow, cold and hot conditions can be a possible cause\nfor health problems if the animals do not have the option to get into any protective shelter or be provided any wind\nbreak or shade.  There must be enough appropriate shelter space available for all regulated animals in an\nenclosure, that allows for each animal to lay down comfortably in order to get away from any inclement weather. All\nshade and wind break surfaces must be kept in good condition, repaired or replaced when worn or missing.\nFour coatimundi are housed in a large outdoor enclosure near the house.  Three coatimundi were active and viewed\nduring inspection.  Licensee stated there was one more, but inspectors were unable to view this animal.  It must\nhave been hiding in a den box.  The den boxes are not heated.  Coatimundi are native to warm climates, such as\ncentral and South America.  At the time of inspection, it was a cold, damp, windy overcast day.  Winter\ntemperatures for the area easily fall well below freezing.  Animals experience undue stress and may develop health\ncomplications when their provided environment is not consistent with their evolutionary development.  Natural or\nartificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all\nanimals.  The coatimundi must be provided a warm room or warm shelter(s) large enough to accommodate all the\nanimals.\n\nTo be corrected by:  25 March 2017\n3.128           DIRECT\nSPACE REQUIREMENTS. \nThere were three straw-colored fruit bats that were in a wire enclosure that was octagon shaped and approximately\n4 feet tall and 2 feet wide. This enclosure did not allow the animals to have enough space for normal postural\nmovements and adequate freedom of movement. There was no space for the animals to fly. These bats need to be\nprovided an enclosure that meets their normal postural needs of flight. There were several wooden bars at the top\nof the enclosure for the bats to roost. However, the bats were provided no space to which they could hide from other\nanimals in the room. The room where these bats are housed contained several species of primates, sloths as well\nas other species. \nAfter discussion with the licensee and review of the animal health records it was determined that between 16\nOctober 2016 and 23 November 2016 that the entire colony of Jamaican Fruit bats (6) had died. Necropsies were\nnot performed to determine the cause of death.  The lack of sufficient and appropriate space for these animals may\nhave contributed to their death.\nFailure to provide adequate space for normal postural and social adjustment can cause illness, injury, and\nunnecessary distress to the animals.  Correct by ensuring that all animals are provided sufficient space to allow\neach animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.  For the straw\ncolored bats this must include adequate space and enclosure furnishings to allow them to fly, hide, and climb.  \nThere is a young Hyena approximately 35-45lbs that is in an approximate 4ft x4ft x 3ft high wire cage in the house.\nThis animal only has room to stand with his head forward, it cannot straighten its head in a fully upward position, or\nstand to pivot when it turns around which is a normal postural movement that hyenas make. The spacing only\nallows for the hyena to take 1-2 steps in either direction, before having to turn around. This is the extent of\nmovement this animal is allowed to make in a 24 hour period, as there is not any other area for the animal to go\nwhere it gets any exercise or is able to walk or lope which is part of the hyenas\u2019 natural movements. During the\ninspection the hyena could only step to one side then the other when agitated while people were moving around the\nhouse.\nThe lack of space prevents an animal from being able to exhibit its natural movements and postures, which can be\na critical source of stress and discomfort which can lead to possible health issues and behavioral concerns.\nThe hyena must be put in an enclosure that allows for the hyena to be able to assume normal postural movements\nand mobility, and to be able to raise its head up to its full height in a standing position.\n\nTo be corrected by: 25 March 2017\n3.129(a)\nFEEDING.    \nThe poultry being fed to the lynx and bobcat was found in the enclosures as frozen balls that had been chewed on.\nThe licensee stated that the frozen poultry is given to the animals all year round. Feeding out frozen meat items is\nconsidered unpalatable for the animals. The meat is left to thaw in variable temperatures in the enclosures. APHIS\nconsiders frozen food wholesome when it is thawed in an appropriate manner (e.g. under refrigeration) to prevent\ncontamination. Thawing meat in an uncontrolled environment without proper cooling promotes unhealthy and\npotentially dangerous bacteria growth. Professionally accepted practices for thawing meat includes a stage of\nrefrigeration to slowly and safely thaw the frozen meat prior to feeding. This facility must use appropriate methods to\nsafely thaw frozen meat. This needs to be addressed so that food items are fed out in a manner that ensures them\nto be palatable and free from contamination.\nCorrect by: 23 March 2017\nThis report is a continuation of the previous report issued on 18 March 2017 and contains the citations from the\nroutine inspection conducted at that time.  An additional report containing the direct veterinary care citation related\nto the two tiger cubs and the interference citation was previously delivered to the licensee on 18 March 2017 and an\nexit interview was conducted at that time.  With respect to the noncompliant items contained within this report, an\nexit was conducted on 22 March 2017 with the licensee and the undersigned inspector.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCompton Annmarie, Animal Care Inspector\nMchenry Kerry, Veterinary Medical Officer",
