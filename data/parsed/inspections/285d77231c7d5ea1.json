While\ntalking to the Curator there was a group of kids by the lions exhibit and we noticed they attempted to throw\nsomething into the enclosure. The Curator addressed the matter and while returning to the barn we noticed there\nwas a student in a group that was standing on the fence leaning into the enclosure with the deer beneath him. The\nstudent was asked to get down. I noticed that the public attendant was on the other end of the enclosure trying to\nattend the public. There was no way this attendant could monitor the large groups of kids all the way around the\npetting zoo enclosure. There needs to be an attendant present at all times. There aren't enough attendants to work\nthe entire petting zoo. Their presence is imperative to prevent harm to the public and the animals. Correct by May\n18, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Curator."
