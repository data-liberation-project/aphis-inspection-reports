There was also a small to\nmoderate amount of rust on the insides of these feeders.\nExtensive damage to the surfaces of the feeders, leading to jagged edges or rusting, prohibits proper cleaning and\nsanitation of the receptacles. This is because pathogens may reside in a damaged or porous surface. In addition,\nrust can flake into the animal feed and may harm the animals if it is ingested. Animals may also injure themselves\non the sharp edges of the feeders.\nFood receptacles shall be kept clean, sanitary, and free from contamination to protect the animals from disease and\ninjury.\nCorrect by 2/4/2015.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Owner."
