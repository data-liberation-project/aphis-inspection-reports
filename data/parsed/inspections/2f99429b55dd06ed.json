      "narrative": "High levels of total chlorine in the Ocean Adventure pools caused eye issues in the dolphins and sea lions. Beginning\nMarch 18, 2025 water quality records for these pools documented a significant increase in total chlorine values\nconsistently over the next 31-day period. Values ranged from 1.20 to 4.30 parts per million (ppm) and multiple days noted\na symbol of +++ in which the facility indicated that the numbers could not be ready by the facility equipment as their value\nwas too high. During this period, the facility was actively trying to mitigate the high chlorine levels through water changes,\nfilter changes, addition of salt and thiosulfate.\nDespite the mitigation efforts, the high levels of chlorine did have a negative impact on the three dolphins. On March 25th,\nand 27th all the animals were examined by a veterinarian for documented intermittent eye squinting by the trainers.\nMedical notes stated that the OA pool water had intermittent increased levels of total chlorine and free chlorine for 7-10\ndays. All animals had an initial ophthalmic exam and then two days later a second exam was conducted and several\nanimals put on medications to manage eye pain.\nTrainers also began to document dolphins having eyes closed, tense when receiving eye medications, rubbing and\nscratching behaviors. When the dolphins were examined again on April 2, 2025, notations state that all three dolphins had\nblepharospasms, despite a treatment plan of multiple eye medications, NSAID\u2019s and antibiotics. At the time of the\ninspection, all dolphins were still under medical care and their eyes were open and alert.\nThe sea lions in these pools were also negatively impacted by the chlorine levels, and when seen by the veterinarian on\nMarch 25th they also were eye squinting intermittently. When examined two days later March 27th, two animals had mild\ncorneal edema notated in one eye. Despite the treatment plan of multiple eye medications, NSAID\u2019s and antibiotics, three\nof the four sea lions also went off feed for a minimum of one feed session over a period of 10 days documented from\nMarch 20th through April 7th. On April 2, 2025, one sea lion was documented as having blepharospasms, for a period of 5\ndays and another has stage 1 keratitis. At the time of the inspection, all the sea lions were still under medical care and\ntheir eyes were open and alert.\nIn discussions with the attending veterinarian, he reiterated that the high chlorine levels did affect the animals through\nevidence of squinty eyes. For the facility the desired range according to the AV for total chlorine is .8 to 1 ppm and for free\nchlorine, a desired range is .3 to .5 ppm. Currently the facility is still showing numbers higher than 1.0 ppm for total\nchlorine as of April 19th. High chlorine levels, such as those measured by the facility, commonly cause serious, painful\neye conditions in the animals exposed. When the water is chemically treated, the facility must work to ensure that the\nchemicals shall be added so as not to cause harm or physical discomfort to the marine mammals. This needs to be\naddressed for the overall health and comfort of the animals living in the Ocean Adventure pools.\nCorrect by: May 14, 2025\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
