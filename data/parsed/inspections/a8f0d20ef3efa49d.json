The gum line was reddened and swollen. When the facility owner rubbed at her\nupper right canine tooth, the gum surrounding the tooth began to bleed. These signs are consistent with the\npresence of dental disease.\nPoor dental health can cause pain and discomfort, impact the ability of the wolf-dog to eat, and lead to further health\nissues. \u201cLola\u201d must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective\ntreatment plan. The licensee must ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\ndiseases and injuries.\nTo be corrected by: November 30, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner."
