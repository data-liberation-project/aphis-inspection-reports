The dog is completely\nnon-weight bearing on this leg while she moved around the enclosure. The facility representative thought she had\nbeen carrying the leg in this manner for less than a month. This dog also has a buildup of brownish-grey tartar on\nher teeth. There is a creamy grey discharge along the gum line of the upper right and upper left cheek teeth. The\ngums are slightly reddened. This dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of her leg\nor teeth.\nMale Bichon (microchip #0A02336241) has an open wound on the inside of the left ear flap. The open wound is\nraw and red in color and the hair around it is caked with a dry, dark colored, scab-like material. The facility\nrepresentatives had not noticed the condition of this dog\u2019s ear and the dog has not been evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian.\nPoor dental health and open wounds could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to further health\nissues. Failure to bear weight on a leg could be a sign of pain or discomfort and could also indicate an underlying\nhealth issue.\nThe above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an\neffective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the\ninspector upon request.\nTo be corrected by: The facility representative transported both dogs to a licensed veterinarian\u2019s office at\nthe time of the inspection.\nOne bag of Veterinary Lactated Ringers Injection found in the puppy building expired in December 2016.

The licensee must dispose of this\nproduct or clearly mark it as expired so that it is not used for regulated animals.
