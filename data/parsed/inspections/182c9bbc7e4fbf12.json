The waybill number was 016-51451396. On inspection it was\ndiscovered that the Owner(cid:25)s Feeding and Watering Instructions attached to the crate had not been completed.\nThere was no documentation as to when the animal was last offered food and water, nor as to the feeding and\nwatering instructions for the next 24 hours. Intermediate handlers should not accept a dog or cat for transport in\ncommerce unless the consignor certifies in writing to the carrier and intermediate handler that the animal was\noffered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery for transport. This ensures that the animal receives\nadequate care during transport. The intermediate handler should take steps to ensure that the carriers for which\nthey handle animal cargo abide by these requirements.\nTo be corrected from this time forward.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a company representative."
