It was determined that under\nprotocol #RA005 animals that underwent survival procedures did not receive any form of analgesia, pre-emptively and\npost-procedurally at the frequency outlined in the approved protocol. According to the laboratory staff, analgesia was not\nrequired because protocol #RA005 was Category E.\nAccording to the approved protocol, analgesics should be administered at least 10 minutes prior to the initial incision at all\nperipheral catheterization and surgical sites. The IACUC required a response to the Committee from the Principal\nInvestigator (PI) and retraining of the laboratory staff by December 7th, 2023. The PI provided a response and\namendment. Following the amendment the IACUC approved the amendment and renewed the protocol (#RA006).\nThe IACUC reviewed the response from the PI and decided a follow-up PAM survey was needed to assess compliance\nand determine the number of rabbits that may not have received the appropriate analgesia. During the follow-up PAM\nsurvey on December 5, 2023, the IACUC determined none of the 395 rabbits were administered analgesia according to\nthe approved protocol and 306 of those rabbits received no analgesia at all.\nOn April 10th and April 11th, 2024, it was noted that the laboratory staff was still not administering the analgesia as\noutlined in the protocol. On April 10, 2024, the IACUC representative told the laboratory member that BID meant the next\npost procedural dose of analgesia must occur on the same day and not the next morning. The 4 study rabbits identified on\nApril 10th did not receive the second dose of analgesia until the next morning. The laboratory member did not ensure\nanalgesia was administered according to the protocol and as directed by the facility veterinarian and the IACUC\nrepresentative on April 10th and 11th. The IACUC suspended all activity on protocol #RA006 on April 11, 2024.\nThe IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications (to secure approval), or withhold approval of proposed\nsignificant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.\nCorrected by the IACUC on April 11, 2024, by suspending the protocol and placing the remaining rabbits on a holding\nprotocol."

When they entered the room, an unresponsive baboon was identified in its\nenclosure. Upon identifying the baboon, the laboratory personnel attempted to resuscitate the animal, with no success.\nAfter review of the surveillance footage, it appeared that the baboon was able to access the IV line at 3:30AM and laid\ndown at 3:59AM. The baboon was in the same position when the laboratory personnel entered the room at 7:30AM. The\nIV pump and line were reviewed by the laboratory personnel and it was determined that the baboon was able to pull the\nIV line into the enclosure and bite it. The bite created a leak in the IV line which caused the animal to exsanguinate. The\ntape used to hold the IV line was no longer secure and allowed the baboon to access to the IV line.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrected at the time of inspection through corrective action plan with Veterinary Resources clinical veterinarian."
