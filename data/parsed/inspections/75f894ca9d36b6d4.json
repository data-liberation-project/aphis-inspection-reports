      "narrative": "The following dogs are in need of veterinarian care:\n* One adult gray and white male named Darla ( number 04-1) and one adult blue and white male named Bandit (\nnumber 507) were observed to have an abnormal, goose stepping gait. The licensee stated that both Shih Zue /\nBichon cross dogs were approximately two years in age. When the dogs were observed walking, no bend or flex to\nthe back legs of both dogs were observed. In addition, the back legs of both dogs would extend straight forward\nand outwards when attempting to walk. Each dog would elevate one of their back legs and place no weight on it\nwhen they stopped walking. When resting the elevated back leg would extend forward to an estimated 45 degree\nangle and stay that way until they started walking. The licensee stated that both dogs were born with this abnormal\ngait from a topical treatment for flea or ticks that the licensee applied to the(cid:25) dams of both dogs. At the time of\ninspection, the licensee had not called the attending veterinarian nor had any treatment been provided to either\ndogs. Abnormal gaits can be painful causing discomfort when the dog has to place weight on the affected legs. It\ncan affect the mobility and daily activity of both dogs. The licensee must have both all three animals examined by a\nveterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented\nand provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary\ncare at all times.\n***************************************************\n* Dry, crusted, matted hair under both eyes of one adult male, white colored Bichon ( tag number 111 ) were\nobserved. The affected area under both eyes were an estimated 1 inch in diameter. No open wounds or lesions to\nthe skin under the affected area were observed upon closer examination of the eye area. The licensee stated that\nshe could not remember when the condition first stated. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had\nnot been consulted. Dried fluid discharge in the hair coat can be painful and irritating causing discomfort and can\nlead to a potential spread of infection.\nThe licensee must have all three animals examined by a veterinarian and have an appropriate treatment plan\nadministrated.
