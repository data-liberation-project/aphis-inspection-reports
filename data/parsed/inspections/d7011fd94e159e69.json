      "narrative": "A white ten year old beagle with brown and black spots named Sheba, ear tattoo number Q8, was seen with\nmoisture around the lips and upon closer examination was found to have dental disease. The majority of the front\nteeth of the upper jaw, including the canines, had a moderate amount of hard brown grey build-up. Most of the rear\nteeth of both the left and right side of the upper jaw had a heavy build-up of that hard brown to grey material. Two of\nthe rear teeth on the right side of the upper jaw had a cream to tan colored spongy material at the gum line. The\ndog\u2019s gums had receded along some of the rear teeth as well. The licensee had not identified Sheba\u2019s dental\ncondition and therefore was not providing treatment. If left untreated, the abnormal build-up can cause further\ndamage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. Dental conditions can be painful and may decrease the dog\u2019s ability\nto eat normally thus negatively impacting the overall health of the animal.\nA three year old white, black and brown beagle named Joey, ear tattoo number 1613, was seen with hairless areas\non the back of both the left and right paws. On the right paw, the skin on the larger of the two hairless areas\nappeared slightly thickened. There were 2 hairless areas on the left paw approximately 0.5 inches in diameter,\nlocated at the base of the toes. The skin in these two areas was raised and thickened. The skin surrounding the\nhairless region was dark brown to black in color. Three pinpoint red spots could be seen on the hairless region to\nthe left of the paw. The licensee had not noticed and was not treating the skin condition on Joey but explained that\nthis is a common occurrence in their facility. The licensee stated having communicated with the attending\nveterinarian in the past about treating and preventing this condition. Left untreated, this skin condition may worsen\ncausing pain and distress to the dog.\nFailure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in\nanimals with conditions such as these listed here. A more complete method of daily observation of all animals must\nbe implemented in order to assess their health, well-being and for timely communication with the attending\nveterinarian. The above described dogs need to be evaluated by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and\ntreatment.\nTo be corrected by December 23th 2019."
