The salt and mineral block in this area was visibly soaked from high water levels, which left\nthe supplements contaminated by the waste of other animal enclosures from water flowing down hill into the sheep\nenclosure.\nThe area where the facility is located is expected to have thunderstorms and rain for the next several days with the\ntemperatures falling into 40\u2019s at night, according to weather reports. There is an extreme likelihood for the animals to get\nwet from these flooded shelters and be in cold temperatures.
