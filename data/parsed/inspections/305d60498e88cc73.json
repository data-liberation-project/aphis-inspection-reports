We looked at this area from the outside and could see that the hole does leave a weak area\nwhere the bear might reach the tire. The area around the hole had excessive rust and was peeling. This rusted\nhole is a weak area were the bear could push through the wall and injure himself while in transit. The licensee\nexplained the design of the trailer will allow the bear to be divided away from this hole for the trip home. Ensure\nanimals do not have access to this area during transit and repair all rust-affected areas prior to transport/exhibit use.\nCorrect by April 30, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee. Inspection was at the Wisconsin Outdoor Life/Field\n& Stream Expo at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison, WI. Licensee expressed that he won't sign the report. A\ncopy of the report was left with the licensee and a copy will be mailed 1st class mail and certified mail.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMoore Chad, Animal Care Inspector"
