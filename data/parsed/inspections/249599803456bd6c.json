One spider monkey gives hugs to\nmembers of the public. The licensee brings these and other animals to off-site events including children\u2019s birthday parties\nand preschools.

Allowing nonhuman primates to climb on the head, shoulders, and arms of members of the public\nposes significant risk of harm to the animals and the public. The animals may contract diseases from members of the\npublic, or animals may be injured when roughly handled or dropped by members of the public. Members of the public may\nbe bitten or scratched when animals are startled, scared, or stressed, which in some cases may result in euthanasia of\nthe animal for rabies testing.\nCorrect by 12/18/22 by conducting encounters with nonhuman primates so that there is minimal risk of harm to the\nanimals and to the public to assure the safety of the animals and the public."
