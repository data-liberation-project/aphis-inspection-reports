      "narrative": "A wild caught, recently imported adult female coati has a wound on the tip of her tail. There is approximately 1/4 inch of\nwhite bone sticking out of the tip of the tail, surrounded by approximately 1/2 inch of bright red tissue. The animal was\nobserved to be highly stressed by the presence of the inspector, and started chewing on the tail wound. The licensee\nstated that they had observed the animal chewing at her tail a few weeks ago and had contacted the attending\nveterinarian (AV) at that time, who recommended monitoring and enrichment to decrease stress, which the licensee had\nbeen doing. The inspector contacted the attending veterinarian and the AV stated that she had not been aware that there\nwas exposed bone before the inspector identified the issue on 01/21/22. Exposed bone and tissue at the tip of an animals\ntail may be be caused an injury, frost bite, irritation caused by parasites, or self mutilation. Wounds may be a source of\npain for the animal, and can become infected. It is important to communicate with the attending veterinarian regarding an\nanimals response (or lack of response) to treatment so that the veterinarian can provide adequate veterinary care. Correct\nby January 26, 2022 by obtaining a consultation with the attending veterinarian or another veterinarian with experience in\nthis species regarding the current condition of this animal's tail."
