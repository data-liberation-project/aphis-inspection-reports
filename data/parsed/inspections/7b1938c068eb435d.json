      "narrative": "A herd of adult red river hogs have been housed in indoor enclosures (off exhibit night quarters) for the past 7 months,\nsince June 2020. These night quarters were meant to be used for only housing the animals during the night when they\nwould be primarily sleeping. In June 2020, the herd consisted of 5 females and 6 males, who were segregated by sex and\nhoused in two separate indoor night quarters.\n*The 5 adult females were housed in a cement-floored indoor enclosure which was approximately 14 feet long and 8 feet\nwide.\n*One female passed away due to natural causes on June 22nd, 2020, decreasing the number of animals in the enclosure\nto 4 adult females.\n*A second female (\"Pierce\" #201300) escaped from the enclosure on July 17th and upon returning to the enclosure on\nJuly 22nd, she was attacked by her herd mates resulting in severe bite wounds to her ears, legs, and abdomen, including\na bite wound on the left front leg that resulted in non-weight bearing lameness. Injuries were managed by the attending\nveterinarian. Pierce was moved to the veterinary clinic and temporarily to other night quarters, but was not moved back to\nlive with the other female hogs. Pierce's left front leg was diagnosed and treated by the attending veterinarian but due to\nsevere ligament damage the leg did not regain normal function. At the time of the inspection, Pierce was housed in the\nveterinary clinic and was observed to be quiet and alert, laying down, and moving the left front leg gingerly. The animal's\nprognosis is currently under evaluation by the attending veterinarian.\n*A third female (\"Ruby\") was attacked by her herd mates in the indoor enclosure (night quarters) on July 30th, 2020 which\nresulted in superficial injuries to Ruby's legs and ears. She was removed from the enclosure and housed at the veterinary\nclinic, where she remains. At the time of inspection, 2 adult female red river hogs remain in the indoor enclosures and 2\nare at the veterinary clinic for management and treatment of injuries.\n*6 adult males were housed in an indoor enclosure approximately 12 feet by 24 feet in size, with a cement floor.\n*An adult male red river hog (\"Wesley, #201203) was observed to have a laceration on the left side of his neck/shoulder\non August 31st, which was managed by the attending veterinarian. Wesley was observed to have a new deep laceration\non the left side of his neck/shoulder on October 16th, which was managed by the attending veterinarian. Both wounds\nwere thought to arise from fighting with herd mates.\n*A second male red river hog (\"Bread\" #201297) was observed to be acutely unwilling or unable to stand on October 21st\n2020, and it was thought that this injury was a result of fighting with herd mates. Bread received treatment from the\nattending veterinarian and recovered.\nAt some point, the male's indoor enclosure was divided into two spaces, and the males were separated into two groups of\nthree, each living in a space that is approximately 12 feet by 12 feet in size.\nZoo personnel stated that the red river hogs needed more space than they had in their indoor enclosure (night quarters),\nbut repairs to the outdoor area of the enclosure had been delayed and a timeframe was not yet known for when the\nrepairs would be completed. Zoo personnel stated that the animals had been confined to the indoor enclosures too long.\nZoo personnel stated that the animals did not fight when they had adequate space and access to the outdoors. The\nattending veterinarian agreed that the red river hogs needed better housing and more space. The current space for all 10\nred river hogs is inadequate and has not allowed for normal social adjustments as evident by the multiple incidents of in-\ngroup fighting in an established herd. Additionally, all 10 red river hogs are currently overweight or obese, which may be\nthe result of prolonged confinement with inadequate space for movement and exercise.\nGroups of animals housed without enough space to make normal social and behavioral adjustments can suffer from\nstress, injuries, obesity, and arthritis. Inadequate freedom of movement impairs an animal's ability to maintain health and\nwell being.\nImplement temporary correction by December 13th, 2020 by providing sufficient space to allow each animal to make\nnormal postural, behavioral, and social adjustments. Implement permanent correction by January 1st, 2021 by providing\nsufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural, behavioral, and social adjustments."
