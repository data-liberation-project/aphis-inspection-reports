The licensee noted that he had not noticed her condition. On the right side the upper\nteeth behind the canine are almost completely encased in a hard brown material. The tooth directly behind the canine\ntooth has some gum recession. On the left side the far back upper tooth is completely covered in a dark brown material\nand the gums are red and swollen. The front teeth are three quarters covered in a very thick brown to dark brown material\nwith gum recession seen on almost every tooth. The first upper left front tooth from the midline is also slightly loose. The\nlicensee call and made an appointment for this dog before the end of the inspection. Poor dental health can cause pain\nand discomfort to the animal as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. Each dealer must follow an appropriate\nprogram of veterinary care for dogs that includes preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy teeth for all dogs.\nCorrect by: November 23, 2022"
