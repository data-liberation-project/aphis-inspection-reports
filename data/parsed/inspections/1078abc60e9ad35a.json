      "narrative": "Currently the licensee is in possession of an 8 week old female tiger (Lilly) that he has had since it was under 2\nweeks old. The licensee has never owned a big cat or received any training on how to raise or train a growing big\ncat into an adult. When the owner initially took possession of the cub, the diet was completely inappropriate (lacking\nthe necessary protein and minerals/vitamins and given in too much quantity) until it was discussed with the AC Big\nCat Specialist.\nThe owner is now conducting public handling exhibitions where the public is allowed to pick up and carry the cub\nand take photos. During this inspection, an exhibition of the cub was observed and it was clear that the tiger did not\nwant to be picked up, however the public was allowed to continue while the tiger grunted, growled and swatted at\nthe faces of the people holding it. At that time, the inspector told the licensee that the cub\u2019s behavior showed that it\nhad had enough handling and it needed to be off exhibit. The licensee continued to stand by and watch as his\nhandler did not correct or stop the interaction.\nDuring two of the public interactions with the cub, inappropriate handling by public members was observed. One\nwoman picked up the cub and put her fingers in its mouth for her photo, then tried to lower the cub and ended up\ndropping her on her head just before she got to the ground (approximately 6 inches high). The second woman then\npicked the cub up and experienced the same swats to the face/neck and fidgeting as the first woman, and after her\nphoto she tried to lower the 18 lb cub, while the tiger twisted and was lowered with its back parallel to the ground\nsupporting its body weight by only its spine.\nDuring these two encounters the one employee had let the cub off its leash and had her back turned accepting\nmoney, while a public member took the tiger cub several feet away and picked the cub up by grasping it under it\u2019s\nforelegs and around its ribcage so that the cub\u2019s body hung down along the front of the public members\u2019 bodies for\nthe photo. The cub was grunting and uncomfortable and wanting down, however neither the employee nor licensee\nstopped either situation. When the public members left, the employee walked away from the cub to assist the\nlicensee with a large snake and the unleashed cub was left to wander around unattended. The cub took interest in,\nand wanted to go towards the area with a 13 plus ft python. The inspector had to stop the cub and get the attention\nof the employee to retrieve the cub and take it somewhere else. When the keeper picked up the tiger, she was\nscratched under her chin leaving a small cut.\nThe lack of proper training and experience while raising and handling a tiger can pose a serious threat of harm to\nthe animal, employees, and the public, as it grows and becomes stronger and possibly more aggressive. Per the\nlicensee, there has only been one knowledgeable, experienced person who has come to the property on two\noccasions to provide training for handling the tiger. There is not someone available full time on site, and the licensee\ndoes not currently have any plans to get further training at another facility.\nDuring the inspection, the handling issues were discussed with the licensee, so the next public interaction that was\nobserved went much better however, a baby stroller with a child in it was allowed so close to the cub that it could\nhave jumped into the stroller. The keeper did have the leash on the cub\u2019s harness this entire time, but the cub pulled\nto the end of it, and constantly chewed and pawed and bit at the ankles of the public. It was explained that they\nneed to keep young babies and strollers away, stop the people from crowding around the animal, and to stop the\ninteractions when people are getting scratched or bit, even though the animal is acting playful. There had been one\n4 yr old girl that said 'ouch' when the tiger bit her ankle while playing, although the skin was not broken.\nAfter the second showing was observed, discussion ensued about proper handling and the need to keep the public\nand the cub safe. The licensee is correcting the issues as he is told about them, however the inability to immediately\nrecognize these problems himself, either before they occur or after there is cause for concern, demonstrates the\nlack of training and experience with raising and handling a large, dangerous animal. Gaining experience and\nlearning while already having a cub on site, and only while an experienced person is infrequently on site, does not\nmeet the regulatory requirement of demonstrating adequate experience and knowledge of maintaining a tiger.\nThe licensee must demonstrate adequate knowledge and experience of the animals in which they maintain.\nTo be corrected by: May 23, 2019"
