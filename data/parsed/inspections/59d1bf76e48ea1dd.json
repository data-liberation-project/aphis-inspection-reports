The enclosures were equipped with wind breaks and wooden shelter boxes thus providing adequate\nprotection from certain elements such as the sun, the wind and the rain. However, a heat source was not used to\nprevent the ambient temperature within the shelter from falling below 45 \u00b0F. The licensee explained that heaters\nwere not currently being provided because of an electrical problem occurring in that outdoor area. The temperature\noutside was 41\u00b0 F at the time of the inspection and was predicted to drop even lower overnight. At such low\ntemperatures, non-human primates may experience discomfort and health issues such as frost bite. A system must\nbe established in order to safely provide heat to prevent the ambient temperature within the shelter from falling\nbelow 45\u00b0 F.\nTo be corrected by 11/15/19\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPannill Elizabeth, Veterinary Medical Officer"
