In both enclosure the wooden doors are 'freely moving' and not secured open or\nclosed.\nProtruding objects inside enclosures can cause injuries to the regulated animals. The un-secured doors could\ntrap/catch the animals in the doorway and cause possible injury, especially in the enclosure with 2 animals.\nThe licensee must repair or remove the protruding object, and secure the doors either open or closed.\nTo correct by: The licensee removed the section of pipe and secured the doors before the inspectors left the facility.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee"
