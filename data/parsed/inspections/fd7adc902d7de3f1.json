The animal sustained an injury during\nthe escape that resulted in euthanasia. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they\ncontain the non human primates securely and safely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including\nopening by the animal.\nThe incident was reported to the IACUC prior to this inspection. Appropriate corrective action has been taken to\nprevent similar future escapes. Locks were removed from grooming panels, cable ties installed and staff has been\nre-trained on cage locking mechanisms and evaluating cage locking."

During this inspection\nalopecia was noted over at least 20 % of the body that was not documented.
