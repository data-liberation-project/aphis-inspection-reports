      "narrative": "***APHIS inspector discovered a Syrian hamster with a large mass on the left side of the head. The mass was\nhairless, with most of it covered by a scab. There were two areas that contained beads of pus. The left eye was not\nvisible due to the size of the mass. To the right side of the large mass was a smaller bump of tissue. The hair\nsurrounding the right eye was patch and missing in spots. The hamster\u2019s overall hair coat was unthrifty and patchy.\nThe facility representative stated that they had not noticed this condition prior to the inspection.\nA mass is an indication of disease and can often be painful for the animal. It can result from numerous causes\nincluding both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis\nand treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal. The facility representative\nwas informed verbally that this hamster must be examined by a veterinarian no later than 6:00pm on April 16, 2018.\nTo be corrected by: April 16, 2018\n* **In an enclosure containing four Syrian hamsters, APHIS inspector discovered the remains of a hamster. In an\nenclosure containing 5 Syrian hamsters and another enclosure containing 6 Syrian hamsters, APHIS inspector\ndiscovered the remains of a hamster. The carcasses and skin were dried out, indicating that the remains had been\nin the enclosure for more than a day. The facility representative stated that the employee in charge of the hamsters\nis supposed to perform daily observations of the animals.\nFailure to properly observe the animals and their enclosures can lead to the facility missing medical conditions and\nfor animal carcasses to stay in the enclosure for extended periods of time. Failure to remove animal bodies in a\ntimely manner can increase the risk of disease for other animals in the enclosure.\nTo be corrected from this date forward.\nFailure to observe and properly communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner\ncan result in prolonged pain and suffering for the animal and potentially worsen a current medical condition. Daily\nobservation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being are\nrecognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must be\nconveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. The\nfacility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in\na timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals\nat the facility.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with two facility representatives."
