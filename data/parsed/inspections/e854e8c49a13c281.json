The other macaque bit off the tongue of macaque RA0952 approximately 1 cm rostral to the\nfrenulum.\nThe macaque RA0952 was sedated and assessed by a clinical veterinarian. The macaque received adequate veterinary\ncare.\nPrimary enclosures must be constructed to contain nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the\nenclosure, including opening by the animal.\nThis was corrected at the time of inspection through a complete change of enclosure for the macaque and retraining the\nanimal care staff.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nThis inspection was conducted November 17, 2021 - November 22, 2021.\nEnd Section"
