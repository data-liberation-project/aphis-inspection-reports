      "narrative": "- According to veterinary records dated 23 May 2015, a female Oryx was found dead by facility personnel. The\nrecord states that the animal was pregnant and approximately 2 weeks away from delivery. When questioned about\nthis animal, facility employees stated that no one knew the female was even pregnant.\nThe female is described as being in thin body condition with diarrhea stains on the hind limbs. A fecal examination\nrevealed three types of intestinal parasites present. The veterinary record states that the female (cid:28)was eating lots of\nfresh green grass which was going right through her(cid:29). The veterinarian indicates that this animal(cid:25)s metabolic needs\nalong with her parasite burden required (cid:28)a higher carb diet(cid:29). A second report dated 31 May 2015 describes the\nanimal as carrying a (cid:28)tremendous worm load(cid:29).\nThe death of this animal was a management failure on several levels. There was a failure to provide proper\nnutrition and a parasite control failure. However, the most serious failure was that no facility employees noted the\ncondition of this animal. Not only was her late term pregnancy missed, no one spotted her poor body condition or\nthe presence of diarrhea stains on her legs. This Oryx was an older, thin, pregnant animal with a heavy internal\nparasite burden. She was in an extremely high risk situation, and would have needed dedicated attention and care\nto survive and carry her calf to term. The facility(cid:25)'s failure to notice her condition put this animal in a position where\nshe could not survive the physical demands placed on her.\nAnimals must be observed on a daily basis by individuals with sufficient training and knowledge to properly assess\nthe health and condition of the animal. There must also be a mechanism of direct communication with the attending\nveterinarian to report any problems noted by facility personnel. The facility must take steps to ensure all animals\nare observed daily and assessed properly.\nCorrect from this point forward."
