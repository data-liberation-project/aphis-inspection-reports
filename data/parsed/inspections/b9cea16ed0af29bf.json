      "narrative": "- A nine year old black, male Shih Tzu named Calvin (ID# TR 67688805) had several abrasions/lesions covering\none or more of his legs, most noticeably his right rear leg. He also had a severe ear infection. His right ear was\nseverely swollen, reddened and had puss/discharge inside the canal of the ear. The infection could be caused by\nparasites, yeast, or bacteria. Ear infections can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to health problems for\nthat dog. If left untreated ear infections could lead to continued health issues, tissue damage or inflammation of the\near canal. He also had a moist dermatitis on his head with bruising. The lesion area was approximately an inch in\ndiameter, was circular in shape, reddened with dark spots, moist looking and was hairless. The licensee stated that\nshe hadn't noticed the problems with this dog and thought the injuries might have been caused from a fight. The\nlicensee immediately contacted the attending veterinarian and began treating the ear and cleaning the dog. The\nlicensee must have this dog evaluated and examined by the attending veterinarian and the appropriate treatment\nmust be administered and documented. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care to all animals at all\ntimes.\nTo be corrected by: 3/3/2016."
