      "narrative": "One approximately 1 year old (approximate age) juvenile black bear escaped its enclosure on June 25, 2016. This\nbear was able to access the public viewing area and was out of the enclosure for approximately 15-20 minutes\nbefore being successfully darted and returned to an appropriate holding area. The primary enclosure includes an\narea of fencing at the front which consists of 9 feet of vertical chain-link with a 5.5 foot angled kick-in (total height is\n12.5 feet). There is a single strand of electrified wire at the top of the angled kick-in portion and another at the\njunction of the vertical fence and kick-in. Additionally, there is a public viewing area that has a solid clear acrylic\nwindow and a sloped roof.\nOn Wednesday, June 22, 2016 two juvenile black bears were introduced to a new enclosure. The enclosure\ncontains several tall trees. Many of these trees were wrapped with hot wire strands that were designed to look like\nvines. However; according to the Vice President of Animal Care, the hot wire did not deter the bears from climbing\nthe trees on this date. In response the zoo removed the cubs from the enclosure and added additional strands of\nhot grass at the bottom of the trees. The bears were re-introduced to the enclosure on Thursday, June 23, 2016\nand again crossed the hot wire and climbed up the trees. The zoo staff then decided to close the enclosure on\nFriday, June 24, 2016 and again added additional hot wire stands and hot grass around the trees in an attempt to\ndeter the bears from climbing up the trees.\nOn Saturday, June 25, 2016 the bears were again introduced to the enclosure. One keeper was posted on the\npublic viewing side of the enclosure to watch the cubs interactions with the enclosure. At approximately 11:15am\nthe keeper noticed the 1 year (approximate age) female back bear named Joanie scaling her enclosure fence next\nto a public viewing area. The keeper tried to deter her from climbing the fence by verbally telling her to get down\nand by shaking the fence. However; the keeper's efforts did not deter her from continuing up the enclosure fencing.\nThe bear managed to climb up the 9 feet chain link vertical of the enclosure. The keeper stated that she vocalized\nas she crossed a hot wire stand at the top of the vertical fencing and continued to navigate up the 5 feet 5 inch\nkick-in. She then crossed an additional strand of hot wire located at the top of the kick-in and onto the roof of the\npublic viewing area. The keeper stated that once the bear was on the roof, she walked onto the kick in and\nappeared as though she wanted to get back into the enclosure. Ultimately the bear climbed down the public side of\nthe fence and onto the ground. The keeper stated he immediately notified zoo staff and that the zoo began visitor\nevacuation procedures before the bear made it to the ground. According to the keeper, approximately 100\nmembers of the public were still in the area when the bear got to the ground at which point the keeper attempted to\nremain between the bear and public until additional zoo staff arrived to evacuate the area. While evacuating the\npublic, the bear was corralled by keepers towards a back holding area at which point the bear scaled the fencing of\nthe holding enclosures and ended up on the top of the bear building (out of view of the keepers). A few seconds\nlater keepers located her on the back side of the bear building and next to the wolverine holding area. By this time\nadditional zoo staff had responded to the area and were able to guide her into the public viewing area for the\nwolverines where she was contained until the Zoo Veterinarian arrived (at 11:34 AM) to sedate the bear. The\nanimal was fully sedated within 13 minutes and was immediately transported to the veterinarian clinic on site for\nexamination and recovery.\nAfter the escape of Joanie, the second juvenile bear, Stevie, was still located within the enclosure. One of the\nkeepers attempted unsuccessfully to recall the second juvenile female black bear into the back holding area. Zoo\nstaff decided to sedate Stevie and move her into the back holding area. The Staff Veterinarian darted her at about\n12:30. The animal was fully sedated within 15 minutes and was moved into the back holding area and was injected\nwith a reversal medication. No further examination or testing was recorded for this animal on this day. However; a\nsecond injection of reversal medication was administered by the Staff Veterinarian on Sunday, June 26, 2016. Both\njuvenile bears are currently being housed in the back holding area until the zoo can re-access the enclosure.\nThe Senior Vice President of Animal Care stated that this enclosure has previously contained an adult black bear\nwithout incident. It has also contained two adult brown bears. He stated that they had completed some upgrades to\nthe enclosure and increased the kick-in height since the previous animals were housed in this enclosure. However;\nthe zoo had never had any issues with this enclose or had an escape from this enclosure in the past.\nAlthough this enclosure had previously contained other animals in the past, this enclosure failed to adequately\ncontain this animal. Failure to adequately contain dangerous animals risks both the welfare of the animal and safety\nof the public. Correct by ensuring that every enclosure is designed and constructed in a manner that is structurally\nsound, and maintained to protect and contain the animals\nCorrect By: Prior to replacing this animal back into this exhibit.\nThis was a focused inspection to evaluate the incident involving escape of a juvenile black bear. Primary\nenclosures, handling, and veterinary care surrounding this incident were evaluated during this inspection.\nInspection was conducted with the Vice President of Animal Care, staff members and Animal Care Inspector\nShannon Sebera.\nThe Exit interview was with the Senior Vice President of Animal Care and Conservation, Vice President of Animal\nCare and Animal Care Inspector Shannon Sebera."
