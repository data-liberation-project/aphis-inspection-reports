Both macaques sustained injuries and were\npromptly separated then evaluated by the clinical veterinarian. Both animals underwent surgery to repair and treat\nthe wounds, and both made a full recovery.\nIt was determined that the NHP was able to escape from its primary enclosure and gain entry into the other NHP\u2019s\nenclosure because personnel had failed to secure the 2 latches for the waste pan cover panel on the front of the\ncage following cage change earlier in the day. This cover panel secures the waste pan that also functions as the\ndivider between the top and bottom cages.\nAs a result, the macaque in the lower enclosure was able to push the solid bottom waste pan forward, then subvert\nthe locking mechanism for the floor of the top cage pushing the floor forward, and then gain entry into the top\nenclosure. Each NHP enclosure has 13 separate locking mechanisms for a total of 26 locks for the 2 enclosures; 2\nof the 26 locks had not been secured.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain\nthe non-human primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.\nThe research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the event to\nUSDA and OLAW, and implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nCorrective actions included but were not limited to providing additional retraining of all staff involved in care of NHPs\non the NHP cage change SOP following husbandry or medical procedures including confirming security of all\nlatches, implementation of additional procedures for checking cages and when handling NHPs, and modifications to\nenclosure latching mechanisms.\nNo additional incidents have occurred since these corrective actions have been implemented.\nNOTE - Inspection conducted 3/22/17 and 3/23/17.
