      "narrative": "Since the last inspection, a male tamarin (Gabriel) was injured when he was erroneously housed within the adjacent\nindoor primary enclosure with another male tamarin. Usually, Gabriel is housed individually due to incompatibility with the\nother male tamarin, who historically would fight with Gabriel. A shared wire mesh wall separates Gabriel from a pair of\ntamarins (one male and one female) and serves as one wall of both primary indoor enclosures. A wire mesh gated door is\nlocated within this shared mesh wall of the two indoor primary enclosures and is the only access point to enter Gabriel\u2019s\nenclosure. During the tamarins\u2019 feeding on November 5, 2023, when the attendant passed through the paired tamarins\u2019\nenclosure, to gain access to the gated door to bring food into Gabriel\u2019s enclosure, Gabriel jumped from his enclosure into\nthe paired tamarins\u2019 enclosure. While separating the animals, one tamarin leaped into Gabriel\u2019s enclosure and was\nthought to be Gabriel. On November 9, 2023, one of the paired tamarins was found to have a swollen cheek requiring a\nveterinary visit. At the veterinary visit, the microchip reader identified the injured tamarin was Gabriel. Gabriel had a\nfractured canine tooth upon examination and multiple bite wounds at his head and chin requiring cleaning under\nanesthesia. He was placed on antibiotics, given pain medication, and a topical wound ointment. Therefore, it wasn't\ndiscovered until the veterinary exam that instead of Gabriel being housed individually, he was actually housed with the\nmale tamarin while the female tamarin was housed individually in Gabriel's enclosure from November 5, 2023 to\nNovember 9, 2023. By not confirming the tamarins were in their correct enclosures, Gabriel suffered wounds and\nunnecessary stress and/or discomfort. Animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral\nstress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrected prior to inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
