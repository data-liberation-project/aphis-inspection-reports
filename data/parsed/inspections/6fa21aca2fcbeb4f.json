  "narrative": "A focused inspection was conducted on December 1, 2016 to look at the pig, Kevin, and his enclosure.\nKevin was in an enclosure with the pig that had been with him previously, as well as one new one. More straw had\nbeen added as bedding in the shelter and the tarp that was previously in contact with the heat lamp had been\nremoved. The roof of the enclosure was covered with a quilt that was not in contact with the heat lamp. The heat\nlamp had been turned on. When the inspector approached the enclosure, the three pigs were outside the shelter\nand did not appear to be in any discomfort. \nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, facility representative, and VMO Dominique\nEngel.",
