      "narrative": "Female Neapolitan Mastiff (#102) has yellow colored discharge located in the interior corner of the left eye. The\ndischarge is also coating the hair above the left eye and around the exterior corner of the left eye. The white of the\neye is moderately reddened and the eye appears cloudy and slightly blue in color. There is a small amount of\nyellow discharge located in the interior corner of the right eye. The facility representative stated that the dog is not\ncurrently receiving any treatment for the condition of the eyes.\nFemale Husky (#43) has an open sore on the outside of the right front leg. The sore is hairless, moist, and red in\ncolor and the hair surrounding the sore is dark colored. The area of the leg located around the sore appeared and\nfelt slightly swollen. The facility representative stated that the sore was caused by the dog excessively licking the\nleg. Written documentation indicates the dog was initially treated with hot sauce placed on the sore December\n7-11, 2016. The dog was then examined by a licensed veterinarian on January 18, 2017 and the written statement\nfrom the veterinarian said that tabasco sauce should be used to stop the dog from licking the sore, but there is no\nindication of how often the tabasco should be used or for how long. The veterinarian also provided further\ninformation about the cause of the licking behavior and that disagreeable tasting products should be placed on the\nwound to stop the licking. Written documentation indicates that the last time the dog was treated with the tabasco\nsauce was February 23, 2017. The facility representative said the dog has received no further treatment for the\nsore and the dog was examined on March 22, 2017 by the attending veterinarian but there is no written\ndocumentation about the sore.\nPoor eye health and open sores could cause pain and discomfort to the dogs. The above mentioned dogs must be\nevaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment. The diagnosis\nand treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspectors upon request.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, ACI Corbin Ranslem and the facility\nrepresentatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRanslem Corbin, Animal Care Inspector"
