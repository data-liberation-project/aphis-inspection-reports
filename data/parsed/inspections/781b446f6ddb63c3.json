The puppy was the only one in the litter but the other litters of puppies in the next enclosures at\napproximately the same age were very active. He did not try to move when the mom was jumping around and on him.\nWhen removed from the enclosure and placed on the floor, it still was not willing to move and showed no interest. No\ndiarrhea was observed. The owner had not been to the kennel yet on this day and the helper had not reported anything\nabnormal about this dog. Due to how quickly puppies can decline if not given proper medical care, this puppy must be\nevaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment by end of this day.\nTo be corrected by close of business on 6/24/2024\nA female white Poodle (Roseanna, id# 6312, DOB 5/14/2018) appeared thin. There was an abdominal tuck and the ribs\nand hips were easily palpated. Her molars were encased in a large amount of brown hard material making it difficult to\ndetermine each separate tooth. Poor dental health is painful to the dog and can lead to further health issues, including\nweight loss. Poor body condition can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition,\nsuch as dental disease. The condition had not been observed by the licensee. The licensee must use appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in the regulated animals and ensure each animal\nreceives adequate veterinary care at all times. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to\nassess its health and to develop an effective treatment plan. Medical records must be maintained on both dogs and made\navailable to APHIS inspection.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 28, 2024\nNOTE: Licensee understood that the Lhaso Apso puppy needed to be evaluated by a veterinarian and called the\nveterinarian to get an appointment for that day (6/24/2024).\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
