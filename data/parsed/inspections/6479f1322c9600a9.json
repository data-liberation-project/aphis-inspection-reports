The day before, according to staff, she was observed to be\nuninterested in food, and unwilling to leave her den, which was unusual. A staff member in charge of animal care\nsaid that she was cold to the touch, and that they placed her on a heating pad. The staff member stated that the fox\nwas very old, and that she suspected the fox was dying. Another animal keeper stated that it was a Sunday, and it\nwould have been difficult to consult a veterinarian on a Sunday. The next morning she was found dead in her\nenclosure. There was no veterinary consultation during this episode preceding the death of the fox.\nThe Program of Veterinary Care should include daily observation by staff, to include appropriate, prompt\ncommunication with the attending veterinarian, or his or her alternate if not available, in the event that any health\nproblems are noted. Failure to consult with a veterinarian could result in unnecessary suffering and / or a poor\nmedical outcome for the animals.\nThis issue was cited previously in 2014, and was to have been corrected immediately.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
