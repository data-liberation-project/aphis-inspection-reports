The\nneed to dart and sedate the AHD during the incident subjected the animal to behavioral stress, unnecessary\ndiscomfort and potential harm which could have been prevented. After the incident, facility management proactively\nreviewed safety aspects and enclosure containment plans and as a result, hot wire arrangements within the\nenclosure were modified and updated.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Mr. Matthew James, Chief, Animal Science Division, and\nwith Ms. Deidre Flaherty, Zoological Supervisor."
