She, also, had a swelling between her toes and an area\nwith moist skin, but no discharge. The licensee made an appointment for the dog, while we were there, for the\nsame day.\nDental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue, and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the\nability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The licensee must provide adequate\nveterinary care to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The information including diagnosis,\ntreatment, and resolution of the conditions must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative, ACI Bartels, and VMO Shaver.\nAdditional Inspectors\nShaver Margaret, Veterinary Medical Officer"
