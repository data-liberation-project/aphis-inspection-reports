      "narrative": "There was a sow (#858) in room 6 of the farrowing area that had an injury to her right front leg. There was a scrape\napproximately 3-5 inches long and 2 inches wide that had a yellowish color and was slick with a fluid, possible\ninfection or tissue fluid due to the irritation. There was a flap of skin hanging on the let and did appear to be a few\ndays old. The sow was also observed to be shaking her head continuously, tilting her head to the left and appeared\nto have moderate discomfort with her head with some irritation in her left ear.\n-There was a sow (#97) that had a swelling approximately 3-4 inches on her right knee that had an approximate 1\ninch circular protrusion from the center of it that was pink/red in color. This was a previously treated abscess from\nMay 4th-7th 2015 and appeared healed at that time, however at this time this area has become misshaped with a\nstrange center around the knee area and has an issue that should be looked at by a veterinarian.\n-There were three 3 month old pigs out of 150 pigs being moved to the nursery barn, that had facial injuries around\ntheir eyes and noses covered with a thick brown crusty material. There were areas on their faces where the skin\nwas cracked, red and raw in appearance. There has been no treatment for these issues at this time and the\nveterinarian has not been consulted or seen either health issue by the time of the inspection.\nUntreated injuries can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animals, and left untreated can\nbecome infected or cause chronic issues depending on the affliction.\nThe veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of any injuries or illnesses as soon as they\nare observed, and/or the animals should be treated according to protocols set up by their attending veterinarian for\ninjuries/illnesses once they are observed.\nNote: The attending veterinarian was contacted by the end of the inspection and preliminary treatment was provided\nto all animals mentioned by the facility employee during the inspection."

      "narrative": "Upon arrival at the facility there was a trailer being loaded with 150 three month old,12-15 pound pigs that were\nbeing transported from the farrowing barn to the nursery barn down the road. The carts used to transport the pigs\n(approx. 4' L x 3' deep x 3' W) from their current location to the trailer were over loaded 3 to 4 pig layers deep. At\nthe point of unloading a young employee was grabbing the pigs by the leg and tossing them into the trailer and\ndropping them from his standing height, resulting in the animals falling 1-2 feet onto the floor. The pace this handler\nwas grabbing and tossing the pigs was so fast that the pigs dropped were unable to stand up and move out of the\nway before the second and third pigs were dropped on top of them. This resulted in the squealing and thumping that\nwas heard in the lot that drew the inspectors' attention upon arrival. The second cart behind this one was also\nloaded 3 pigs deep, however this older employee did unload the pigs properly by dropping them into the trailer at a\nheight that allowed them to stand and move out of the way before the next pig was put in, and they were picked up\nby the body when moved.\nThe mass loading of the carts and handling of pigs from the carts into the trailer was corrected immediately for the\nremainder of the loading of 150 pigs. The last 50-60 pigs had been transported in the crates in the appropriate\nnumbers resulting in only a single layer of pigs at a time. And they were set in the trailer properly and with enough\ntime to move. There were no injuries observed during the loading of these pigs during the inspection.\nIt is imperative that proper handling and transport of the regulated animals is observed in order to prevent any\nstress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort to the animals.\nThe licensee must make sure that all regulated animals are handled properly to prevent unnecessary stress or\npossibility of injuries, and that all employees are trained to handle the animals properly.\nTo be corrected by: The NCI was corrected immediately during the inspection and from this day forward\nNote: The licensee advised that proper handling training will be immediately provided to all employees and close\nmonitoring will be implemented from this day forward."
