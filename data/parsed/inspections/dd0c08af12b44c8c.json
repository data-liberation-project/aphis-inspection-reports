There are some areas of the fence that the bottom is curled\ninward with sharp point protruding towards the animals. Next to the shelter the bottom of the fence is only being held by\ntwo strands of stretched fence attached to a lower support pole. Because of the stretching of the fence and not being\nproperly secured it has large holes and gaps along the bottom. A work order was submitted on 9/25/2020, but there has\nbeen no repair work done. Inspector was told since the submission of the work order this area of the fence has gotten\nworse. The sharp points, gaps and large holes in the fence could cause an injury to the animals and if not corrected could\npotentially allow an animal to escape. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound, in good\nrepair to contain and protect the animal.\nTo be corrected by: July 13, 2021\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Animal Curator.\nEnd Section"
