      "narrative": "Female pomsky (tattoo #14, microchip #892981) is lame in both hind legs. The inspectors observed the dog to appear\npainful on both hindlegs as she moved around the enclosure. The dog often held one of the hind feet of the floor as she\nmoved or would rock her weight back on the heel of the foot with the toes held off the flooring when standing. Closer\ninspection of the dog revealed a raw, red, open lesion on the pad of one toe on each hind foot. The dog is housed on\nraised expanded metal flooring and the affected area of the toes are rubbing against the metal when the dog is walking.\nThe condition of the dog has not been noticed and no treatment has been provided. This dog was moved to an enclosure\nwith a different type of flooring during the inspection. The behavior of this animal indicates that the open lesions are\npainful and if left untreated could lead to further health issues.\nFemale Boston terrier (microchip #991001003375932) appears very painful on the left hind leg. The inspectors observed\nthe dog stretching the leg out behind her several times while standing and holding the foot off the flooring. While moving\naround the enclosure, the dog showed signs of severe lameness and often failed to bear weight on the leg. Closer\ninspection of the leg revealed a raw, red, open lesion on the pad of one toe. The condition of the dog has not been\nnoticed and no treatment has been provided. The behavior of this animal indicates that the open lesions are painful and if\nleft untreated could lead to further health issues.\nFemale Ore-pei (tattoo #27, microchip #7E10180551) is lame on the left front leg. Closer examination revealed the entire\nleg is swollen from the elbow to the foot. Numerous dark red wounds are located on the medial, lateral, and posterior\nsides of the leg. The condition of the dog has not been identified and no treatment has been provided. The behavior of\nthis animal indicates the swollen leg is painful and could also suggest there is an underlying health issue such as\ninfection. If left untreated it could lead to further health issues.\nFemale Shih tzu (tattoo #10) has an abnormal condition of the right eye. The eye appears cloudy and has a blueish color.\nThe white of the eye is moderately reddened and a dark red area is located in the center of the eye. The hair surrounding\nthe eye is wet and coated in discharge. The dog was observed squinting the eye and hesitant to fully open it. The\ncondition of the dog has not been noticed and no treatment has been provided. The behavior of this animal indicates the\ncondition of the eye is painful and if left untreated could lead to further health issues.\nFemale Cavalier spaniel (tattoo #2, microchip #882806) has an abnormal condition of the right eye. The eye appears\ncloudy and the white of the eye is moderately reddened. A brown discharge is located along the bottom eyelid and the\nhair surrounding the eye is wet. The condition of the dog has not been noticed and no treatment has been provided.\nAbnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the animal and if left untreated could lead to further\nhealth issues.\nFemale bulldog (tattoo #37, microchip #7E10334731) has an abnormal condition on both front feet. Each foot contains a\nlarge red lesion between the toes. A darker red area is located on the surface of each lesion and appears to be slightly\nwet. The condition of the dog has not been noticed and no treatment has been provided. Abnormal skin conditions could\ncause pain and discomfort to the animal and if left untreated could lead to further health issues.\nThe above-mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective\ntreatment plan. The licensee must ensure that each animal receives adequate veterinary care at all times.\nAt the time of the inspection a veterinarian examined and established a treatment plan for each of the affected dogs.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nWilliam Janecke, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
