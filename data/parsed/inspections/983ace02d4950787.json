Also, porcupines have chewed a main structure post that could weaken the structure of the enclosure\nfence where they are housed. The owner must repair or replace the exposed wire flooring and the enclosure fence\npost to help ensure that animals will not be injured or escape. The owner needs to put into place a maintenance\nprogram that closely monitors the structural strength of this enclose and that any needed repairs are done in a\ntimely manner.
