The facility uses different types of rodent bait stations\nin an effort to control the problem, but these methods are clearly not adequate. Adequate pest control requires a systemic\napproach and includes thorough cleaning and sanitization of all areas of the kennel, appropriate storage of food and\nsupplies, and preventing rodent access to the facility as much as possible. Bait stations alone are not sufficient for the\ncurrent situation.\nAn effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that\nare pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce\ncontamination by pests in animal areas.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
