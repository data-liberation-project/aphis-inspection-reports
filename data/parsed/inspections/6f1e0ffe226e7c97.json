      "narrative": "In the bear enclosure one of the main upright metal posts has corrosion leaving holes in the lower portions of the\npost which may compromise the structural strength of the caging.\nIn the coyote enclosure there are several deep burrows excavated near the edges of the primary enclosure fence.\nOne of these burrows is angled in the direction of the enclosure fence. On the outside of the enclosure near the\naccess tunnel and in very close proximity to this burrow, there is a hole or depression in the ground that may have\noccurred from the dirt collapsing or possibly another animal digging near the enclosure. These holes could create\nan escape route for the coyote.\nThe goat pen housing the single goat next to the turkey pen has a small gap at the base of the chain link fencing\nbetween the enclosures. There are sharp points on the wire. The enclosure containing 15 goats on the other side of\nthe singly housed goat has a large gap at the base of the fence along the back side. On the other side of the path\nthe dirt has eroded primarily at the back side of the enclosure housing about 14 goats creating large gaps between\nthe bottom of the fence and the ground. These gaps may allow an animal to get out of the enclosure, become\ntrapped, or allow other animals to enter.\nThere are sharp points of wire in areas the goats can access, such as at the front of the enclosure where there are\nfence panels connected together with a piece of wire and an area on the left back portion of the fence where a\nsupplemental layer of fence was attached by a piece of wire. The wire used was cut and twisted leaving sharp\npoints pointing into the enclosure. These sharp points are an injury hazard.\nAt the sheep pen containing 17 sheep, next to alpacas there are gaps along the back fence between the fence and\nthe ground. In the area behind the old blacksmith shop there is a wooden platform that is broken along the edge\nclose to the cross fence. The broken platform combined with the erosion of the dirt beneath the platform has created\na narrow drop-off that could potentially cause leg injury.\nThe access pass-through tunnel for the bobcats has small rusty holes in the side compromising structural strength.\nOn the rectangular pen side there is erosion that has exposed sharp wire points protruding upward from the floor\nthat may cause injury.\nAt the left front corner of the bison enclosure a large hole/gap was visible in the bottom of the chain link fence.\nThere are sharp points protruding from the bent fencing. There is a gap at the bottom of the fencing under the railing\ntoward the back of the enclosure and a long loose metal cable dangling loosely toward the back of the enclosure.\nIn the pen for the fox by the river there are thin wires wrapped at the bottom of the fence enclosure with several\nsharp ends pointing inward into the enclosure. The gray fox pen has a raised platform where the fox was sleeping\nduring the inspection. There are two of the wooden cross supports that are falling off/displaced and in poor repair.\nThere is also a metal rung at the bottom of one of the front enclosure panels that has broken and is pointing into the\ncage.\nPoorly maintained enclosures with wire structure that has been compromised by rust, gaps in the fence and/or\nsharp edges and points pose an injury hazard. The structural integrity of the fence is compromised which will\ninterfere with the capability of the fence to adequately maintain the animals within their enclosure and fail to prevent\nother animals from entering the enclosure.\nAll housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from\ninjury and to contain the animals. They shall be constructed of material of such strength as appropriate for the\nanimals involved. The licensee must verify containment features such as buried wire are in place and adequate.\nThe licensee must secure, repair or remove all dangling or exposed wires or cables that may pose an entanglement\nrisk in all animal enclosures. The licensee must ensure that in all facilities there are no sharp wires or other sharp\nedges or pointed objects on which animals can injure themselves. The licensee must ensure that the supplemental\nstructures inside any enclosure (such as platforms, shelters, supports, or any other item that the animal comes into\ncontact with) are in good repair and do not pose an injury hazard."
