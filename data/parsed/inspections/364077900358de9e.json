The staff has not been able to locate the\notter. An animal that escapes its enclosure can be preyed upon by wild animals outside of the park. In addition the\notter may not have the skill set to survive on its own outside of the park. The licensee must ensure that all\nenclosures in the park are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals. Correct\nimmediately.\nNote: At the time of inspection, the licensee had already fixed the river otter enclosure so the remaining otter is not\nable to escape from it. The enclosure was fixed the day it was realized that the otter had went missing.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd of report."
