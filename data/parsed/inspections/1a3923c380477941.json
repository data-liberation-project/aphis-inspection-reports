The lateral toe of the right hind foot appeared swollen, and the sole\nhad an area, approximately 0.5 inches long, that was oval in shape, flattened, red and irritated. The lateral toe of the right\nfront foot similarly was swollen with a pea sized red, irritated, flattened area on the sole. Four Smaller red lesions were\nseen on the sole of the left front foot located mainly on the thumb, lateral finger, and palm area. The region surrounding all\nthe affected areas were white.\nThe male capybara had some thinning of the hair over the mid-section of his spine, the affected area comprising\napproximately 1/3 of his back. At the bottom of the hair thinning section, about at the hip area, there were 2 circular\nlesions, stacked one below the other, approximately 0.5 inches in diameter each. The top lesion was white with a mild\nscab while the bottom lesion was moderately ulcerated and crusty. An approximately 1.5-inch-long area of hair loss could\nalso be seen on the left side of his face, below his eye.\nThe licensee had not identified the conditions affecting these two animals, therefore had not contacted the veterinarian for\nguidance on care. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in animals\nwith such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented to properly assess\ntheir health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely\ndiagnosis and adequate medical attention. The veterinarian must be consulted in order to establish a treatment plan for\nthe Red Coati and Capybara mentioned above. To be corrected by March 30, 2022."

      "narrative": "During the inspection one of three kinkajous were trying to get out of its enclosure and became lodged in between the\nfencing. The animal was able to get three quarters of his body through and was observed becoming frustrated as he\nstruggled to get free. Since the animal can\u2019t be handled the owner was unable to assist him immediately. Eventually, the\nanimal was able to back out of the fencing without any apparent injuries. The animal should not be able to get its body\nthrough the fencing for its safety and to keep the animal contained. The kinkajou\u2019s enclosure must be constructed to\ncontain the animal and to protect the animal from injury.\nThe kinkajou\u2019s den box contains three kinkajous. The den box has been missing its fourth leg and the nails have been\nprotruding from the structure. The owner was asked to put his weight on the den box to check its sturdiness. It was\nobserved that the leg perpendicular to the missing leg was not supporting the structure at all. The left back leg and front\nright leg were holding up the structure along with the perching branch going across the front holding it up against the\npanel fencing keeping it upright. The den box was not secured properly, and the opening is not appropriate for the\nanimals\u2019 paws. The den box must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.\nThe singly housed red mountain coatimundi\u2019s den box had become unhinged and dropped allowing it to be wedged in\nbetween the panels and platforms, which obstructed the animal from getting out. The owner stated it occurred over the\nweekend. Once the den box was removed and put on the floor, inspectors witnessed the coati getting into the enclosure\ndisplaying how the weight of the animal\u2019s body on the straight-edged opening could cause injury to the paws . The den\nbox is not properly secured to the enclosure to stay elevated and the edges of the opening of the den is not constructed to\nprotect the animal from injury. The facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriated for\nthe animals involved.\nIn several areas along the primary enclosures\u2019 fencing containing the capybara, goats, sheep, and mouflon there was\nsignificant space that allowed the animals to go under it. Inspectors observed the male goat going under the fencing\nduring the inspection. The owner stated that he thought the capybaras were getting out by going under the fencing as\nwell, which could possibly attribute to the hair loss and abrasions on the capybara\u2019s back. The fencing should not allow\nthe animals to get out contradicting its purpose to contain the animals appropriately and protect the animals from injury.\nIn the primary enclosure for the capybara, goats, sheep, and mouflon there was a pile of discarded wooden pallets with\nexposed nail heads. There were also holes in the ground at the entrance of the natural spring that constantly gets\nwashed out and was being filled with scrap concrete and construction materials with some contents having metal stakes\nand rebar still attached to it. On the opposite side of the pond within the enclosure there was a plastic barrel that was the\nremains from a broken platform that has not yet been removed. The animal\u2019s primary enclosure has many items in it that\nisn\u2019t specifically for the animals and isn\u2019t safe for the animals. The holes need to be filled with appropriate materials to\nprevent injury.\nAn African crested porcupine had chewed the shade cloth that covered both their enclosure along with the white-nosed\ncoatimundi\u2019s enclosure. Shredded pieces of the tarp could be seen along the inside and outer edge of the animal\u2019s\nprimary enclosure. Inspectors observed a capybara chewing a similar tarp during the inspection. Other animals that have\naccess to this enclosure could possibly ingest the scattered materials along with the African crested porcupines. The\nanimals\u2019 facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury."
