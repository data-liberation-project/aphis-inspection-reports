There are inconsistent dates listed on the supporting documentation for this transport. The Certificate of\nVeterinary Inspection states a shipping date of 15 July 2020 (17 days of age). The APHIS 7020 form provided by the\nlicensee of origin shows a disposition date of 19 July 2020 (21 days of age). However, this licensee states that the\ntransport actually happened 24 July 2020. The lion cub would have been 26 days of age on 24 July 2020. Neonatal\nnondomestic cats have special handing and husbandry needs and are placed in danger when they are exposed to\nmembers of the public and/or stressful conditions, including transportation. Cubs under 4 weeks of age (28 days) do not\nhave a developed immune system, are susceptible to a wide variety of diseases including those of domestic cats, and\ncannot thermoregulate. The licensee must ensure that handling of all animals be done as expeditiously and carefully as\npossible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort. To be corrected by 30 April 2021.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nMICHAEL TYGART, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
