He is also lame on the left front limb\nand both medial and lateral claws were extremely long. A soft ball-size swelling is present on the anterior side of\nthe left carpal area. The facility representative stated that he had been lame with his left front limb since they\nacquired him in November 2013 and the other facility had documented the problem. From a review of the written\nveterinarian medical records for (cid:28)\"Oliver\" an intermittent lameness had been documented since March 2014. The\nattending veterinarian has been made aware of the condition of the left front limb. The attending veterinarian was\nnot aware of the right front limb lameness and thus no treatments have been administered. \"Oliver\" was observed\nby the inspectors at approximately 2 pm and according to the facility representative the veterinarian rounds with the\nAV occurred earlier in the day and that he was there every week for 4 hours on Tuesday mornings. The\nrepresentative called the AV and the inspectors accompanied him to \"(cid:28)Oliver's\"(cid:29) enclosure around 5 pm. The AV\nstated (cid:28)that \"even his grandmother could see that he was lame.\"(cid:29) Lameness may indicate an underlying disease\nprocess. The facility must establish and maintain an appropriate program of veterinarian care to prevent, control,\ndiagnosis and treat disease."
