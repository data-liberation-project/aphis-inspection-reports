Some of these animals' toenails were approximately an\ninch long and some were observed going through the openings in the wire mesh flooring. The long nails could get caught\nin the wire flooring of the enclosures. The licensee must trim the toenails of these animals to ensure that the animals can\nmove normally and prevent the potential for injury. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must\nestablish and follow a program of regular toenail maintenance for all the animals to prevent the overgrowth of toenails."
