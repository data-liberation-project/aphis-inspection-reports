Animals and unauthorized\npeople can use this damaged section to enter and exit the area and gain access to the animals behind it. The perimeter\nfence must be constructed so that it protects marine mammals by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from\ngoing through it or under it and having contact with the marine mammals, and so that it can function as a secondary\ncontainment system for the marine animals in the facility when appropriate.
