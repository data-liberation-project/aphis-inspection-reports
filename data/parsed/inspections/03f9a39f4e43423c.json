He stated the\nattending veterinarian (AV) had seen the lamb a couple of days ago and stated \"there is nothing to do about it\".\nThere is no documentation from the AV or the licensee to show when this animal was noted to have a problem nor\nwhat was to be done to provide relief from the painful condition.\n**An adult Dorsett ewe was noted to have the left nostril partially closed and pinkish tissue around the nostril and\nbelow the left eye appeared to be swollen. The licensee stated that the animal was old and may have a \"sticker or\nsomething\" that was causing the misshapen or swollen face and that he planned to take her to an auction next\nweek. No diagnosis, treatment, or plan to relieve the painful/distressful condition had been made.\nLimb fractures are painful and should be appropriately diagnosed and treated under the direction of the AV to\nminimize pain and distress. Facial swelling and obstruction of the nares can be painful and/or distressful and\nshould be appropriately diagnosed and treated under the direction of the AV to minimize pain and distress.\nThe licensee shall have and follow a program of veterinary care for all regulated animals that includes the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries\nThese two animals need to be seen by a veterinarian by 1/23/2015 and the licensee must provide documentation to\nAPHIS officials regarding the diagnosis, any treatment prescribed and to show that treatment is given as directed, or\nthat other methods for eliminating pain and distress associated with the diagnosed condition, and a plan for\nfollow-up to determine if treatment is successful."
