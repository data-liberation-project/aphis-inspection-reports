The normal tooth structure cannot be\nidentified under the calculi and tartar. Dental issues can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally\nand negatively impact the overall health of the animal. Animals with health concerns should receive prompt\nveterinary care that is appropriate for their circumstances. In these cases, the facility had noted mild to moderate\ntartar and gingivitis on the previous exam in Oct 2015, but these animals have not received any treatment. Although\nthe facility recently started a program of dental treatment, with another dog receiving a dental treatment earlier this\nmonth, the three dogs cited here have not received appropriate care.\nSeveral pigs had bandages to protect indwelling catheters that were soiled or loose, resulting in the catheter itself or\nthe site where the catheter exited the skin being exposed to contamination. The catheter sites or catheters should\nbe maintained to prevent contamination and infection. The bandages or jackets are not being changed or\nmaintained to prevent contamination.\nDuring a surgical procedure for a covered species, the emergency drug box included lidocaine, calcium gluconate\nand dopamine that were past their expiration dates. In a drug cabinet located adjacent to a surgical suite, expired\ndrugs were observed to be stored intermingled with in-date drugs. These drugs were removed at time of inspection.\nExpired drugs should be labeled and separated from in-date drugs and or medical material to minimize the potential\nfor misuse, which could be detrimental to the well-being of the animals.\nSeveral pigs had excessively long hooves that needed to be trimmed. Overgrown hooves can cause discomfort and\nlameness.\nThe failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases or injuries may negatively\nimpact the well-being and quality of life of the animals. The facility should ensure that all animals receive\nappropriate veterinary care."
