      "narrative": "On today's inspection, there was female golden doodle, ID# 1410, housed in an enclosure that measured 36\"X30\"\nor 7.5 sq ft. The dog was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail while standing and lying down. On\nboth occasions, this dog measured 28\" and would require 8.03 sq ft of minimum space.\nIn an adjacent enclosure that measured 36\"X30\" or 7.5 sq ft., there was a female King Charles Cavalier Spaniel ID#\n7345 that measured 21\u201d, a female Dachshund ID# 7330 that measured 16\u201d, and a female Maltipoo ID# 4058 that\nmeasured 14\u201d that would collectively require 11.2 sq. ft. of minimum space.\nThese enclosures do not provide these dogs with adequate amounts of space. The Licensee must ensure that dogs\nhave at least the minimum about of floor space that is required. To determine the appropriate amount of space the\nlicensee must ensure that each dog housed in a primary enclosure is provided a minimum amount of floor space,\ncalculated as follows: Find the mathematical square of the sum of the length of the dog in inches (measured from\nthe tip of its nose to the base of its tail) plus 6 inches; then divide the product by 144. The calculation is: (length of\ndog in inches + 6) x (length of dog in inches + 6) = required floor space in square inches. Required floor space in\ninches/144 = required floor space in square feet.\nThe Inspection and Records collection were conducted on 1/6/2020 with facility representatives.\nThe Records Review and Exit was conducted with the Licensee on 1/7/2020.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPadden Andrew, Veterinary Medical Officer"
