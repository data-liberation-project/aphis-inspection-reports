An adult answered and\nindicated she is a tenant and that she has lack of familiarity with the animals, their care, and their records. She\nrelayed she did not have Mr. Roy's phone number, due to another family member being the point of contact with Mr.\nRoy. I called Mr. Roy's primary phone number at 11:38 AM, and I left a message then waited at the site for 30\nminutes. I then left the facility and returned approximately 45 minutes later, anticipating I might have heard from Mr.\nRoy by that time, or that I might see him at his facility at that time. After recognizing he still was not at his facility and\nhad not called me back yet, I left the facility."
