The driver was unable to\nprovide any additional details. A quick survey of the area did not indicate that any animals were present or could\nreside at that address (no fencing, barns or other facilities necessary to maintain animals on the property). The\nphone number provided by the licensee was disconnected. We then left the property. A conversation with the\nfacility's assigned inspector indicated that the licensee may have left the country indefinitely but the licensee had not\nformally notified either the Regional Office or his inspector of his intent to relocate or discontinue his license.\nAdditional Inspectors\nNeafsey Michael, Assistant Director"
