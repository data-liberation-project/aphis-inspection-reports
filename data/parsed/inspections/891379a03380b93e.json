One of the female opossums was recovered in an escape enclosure\nwhich is provided in the event of an animal escape for the animal to find safe refuge. The second small female opossum,\napproximately 12-14 months weighing approximately 60-70 grams was found deceased in the breeding room. The\ndeceased animal was sent for necropsy evaluation on 15 March 2024. The results were obtained on 24 April 2024 which\nrevealed the animal\u2019s gastrointestinal tract contained a moderate amount of food but otherwise no obvious findings to\ndetermine the exact cause of death. There was no evidence of physical trauma to the deceased animal or wounds on the\nrecovered animal.\nThis facility experiences a very low number of escaped animals ranging from 1-2 escapes annually, with all recovered\nand no previous deaths in over 20 years. The short-tailed opossums are kept in plastic containers with a secured wire top\ncovering. The facility believes that the animal was able to escape due to warping of the top wire cover which resulted in a\nsmall gap between the plastic container and the top wire covering at the corner of the enclosure. New metal tops have\nbeen ordered, replacing any that appear warped as a correction, in order to maintain the enclosures in good repair and\ncontain the animals securely. Short-tailed opossums are a territorial species, and the recovered animal may have taken\nup residence in the escape container first and prevented the deceased animal from being able to gain access. As a\ncorrection, the facility has added an additional escape enclosure to each room.\nThe housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury\nand to contain the animals.\nCorrected before inspection on 22 May 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with AV and IACUC Staff.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nEric Irvin, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
