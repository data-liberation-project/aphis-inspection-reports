The main\nkeeper that worked with the Prevost squirrel attempted to voluntarily capture the animal; however, after several\nunsuccessful attempts the animal was hand contained and transferred into a transport cage, totaling a time span of 45\nminutes from initial attempt to final capture. Approximately an hour or so later, a keeper checked on the squirrel in its\ncage, and was observed, per the facility, walking around with an abnormal, drunken gait. The keeper called for assistance\nand eventually the Bird and Mammal Curator was called. The attending veterinarian was contacted and instructed that the\nstaff administer Pedialyte and prepare subcutaneous fluids but when the staff entered the enclosure to administer the SQ\nfluids, the squirrel was found deceased. A necropsy report found incidental disease findings as well as evidence of stress-\nrelated pathologic findings. Although both keepers were trained on the proper methods to capture an animal, the\ncontinuous unsuccessful attempts to capture the squirrel over the span of approximately 45 minutes negatively impacted\nthe health and welfare of the animal. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a\nmanner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect by January 31st, 2022.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Mammal and Bird Curator, General Curator and Director.\nEnd Section"
