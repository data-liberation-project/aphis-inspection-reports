An investigation found that a rusty quick-connect fitting between the main water line and the rack system\nhad caused a decrease in water pressure to the rack and resulted in no water reaching the enclosure containing the two\nhamsters. Further investigation by the facility found that these fittings were not designed for water systems and that there\nwere several of these fittings in use throughout the facility. All the fittings in the facility were changed to new ones\ndesigned for use in watering systems and no further issues have been reported.\nHamsters housed in enclosures in rack systems rely on the structural integrity of that system to ensure the proper delivery\nof water. Facilities for hamsters need to be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect them from injury.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.\nn"
