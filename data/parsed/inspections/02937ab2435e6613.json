It did not appear to be ill or injured and the licensees stated that it was still young and had concerns for it\nbeing out near the others due to incompatibility and territoriality. There were originally two marmosets in this\nenclosure but one had died not long ago. One of the owners indicated that she provides the remaining animal with\nindividual attention herself. The environmental enhancement plan does not have any provisions for the individual\nhousing of nonhuman primates. The attending veterinarian was contacted and she was not aware that they had a\nmarmoset housed where it could not see or hear other primates. In addition, this facility breeds primates and there\nis no provision for infant/juvenile care in the enrichment plan. Housing a primate by itself and out of sight and\nhearing of other primates can affect the psychological well-being of the animal and result in stress or behavioral\nproblems. The primate environmental enhancement plan must address the social needs of individually housed\nprimates. Individually housed primates must be able to see and hear others of their own or compatible species\nunless the attending veterinarian determines that it would endanger their health, safety, or well-being. The reasons\nfor exemption must be recorded by the attending veterinarian for each exempted primate.

There was an accumulation of significant amounts of decaying food and fecal\nwaste in most of the enclosures housing marmosets. Marmosets housed in cages in a utility shed had excessive\nwet and decaying food and fecal waste on the bottom of the cage form which a foul odor was detected. Those\ncages had large areas of rust on them and resting platforms and nest boxes that were coated in a dark layer of\ngrime and which were splintered and in disrepair.\nMultiple outdoor portions of the other sheltered marmoset enclosures had many very dirty surfaces with varying\npatterns of discoloration. Some were green with algae, some had dark greasy appearing staining, and some were\nblack and/or patchy white with what appeared to be mold. Dirty surfaces included feeding areas, ropes, perches,\ntoys, nest boxes, pass through tunnels, and walls. There was flaking and worn paint and wood that was\ndeteriorating. Some water and food receptacle holders/access portals were very rusted, some to the point of\npossible structural compromise.\nThe room where the nest boxes and feeding stations are accessed was very dirty with black discoloration that\nlooked like mold on the walls and, on the nest boxes and the food access panels. This room is also where food is\nstored and brought in for distribution.\nSoiled surfaces and accumulation of food and fecal waste may cause a risk of diseases, odor accumulation, or\npest infestation that could affect the health and well-being of the animals. There was a significant mortality event at\nthis facility several months previously and there continue to be sporadic deaths of undetermined causes. Lack of\nadequate sanitation may be a contributing factor to increased mortality.\nRusted or deteriorating surfaces cannot be completely cleaned and need to be repaired or replaced. Food and\nexcrement must be removed from indoor primary enclosures daily. Dirt floors and absorbent bedding must be spot\ncleaned frequently enough to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with bodily waste and other waste,\nand often enough to prevent excessive waste accumulation, pest infestation, and disease hazards. Surfaces must\nbe kept clean and replaced when worn and when they cannot be cleaned and sanitized."
