They never entered into full hibernation and had to be removed from the trap. By that\ntime, their health had deteriorated to the point that they had to be euthanized. A camera set-up was in place to\nrecord activity, but resolution was not sufficient to adequately monitor activity, and real-time surveillance was not\npossible. The camera had to be physically accessed to retrieve the recording to be reviewed.\nDaily observation of all animals is required to assess their health and well-being. Monitoring animals in hibernation\npresents unique challenges which must be addressed to meet this requirement.\nThis was corrected prior to the time of inspection by updating the SOP to outline in detail adequate hibernation\nroutine and monitoring. The IACUC has reviewed and approved the new SOP.\n** A female pygmy rabbit, Prim, was noted at the inspection to have a healed injury on her face. An injury to her\nnose made a flap of skin that healed as a tag. The facility worker stated that it had happened a few months earlier.\nWhen asked if the AV had been notified, the answer was no.\nTimely and accurate communication to the AV regarding injuries is necessary to so the AV can appropriately assess\nand treat them, if indicated, to ensure optimal health of the animals.\nThis was corrected at the time of inspection; a veterinarian examined the animal, and the animal was moved to an\nenclosure with less foot traffic near her that would cause her stress and further injury by causing her to run into the\nsides of the enclosure."
