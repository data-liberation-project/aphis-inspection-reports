Three of these incidents were due to human error and one\nincident was due to an enclosure lock failure. In these four incidents, the nonhuman primates were injured due to\nuncontrolled interactions with other nonhuman primates in secure animal rooms where the escapes occurred. Some\nlost portions of their tongues while others needed sutures and/or partial digit amputations. In order to prevent further\nescapes that lead to injury of animals, the research facility must ensure that personnel always handle animals as\ncarefully as possible and ensure that the enclosures' hardware is appropriate to enable personnel to handle animals\nwithout injury.\nNote: The facility previously identified these incidents and reported them to the ACUC.

      "narrative": "On 12-28-15 a rhesus macaque was found dead in its enclosure. Necropsy indicated it had severe trauma wounds\nand suggested that it died acutely with traumatic thoracic injuries. Three days (12-24-15) prior to its death , it had\nbeen treated for wounds caused by an older cagemate. Wounds affected multiple muscle layers on its back and\ninvolved a partially exposed vertebrae (bone). The medical record indicates that the affected macaque was treated\nand returned to the same enclosure with the aggressive cagemate and noted that Behavior [department] would be\nnotified of the aggression. Following closure and treatment of wounds, the macaque was given pain medication and\nrecovery was monitored for three days with no further agression noted but there are no records of a behavior\nevaluation of the grouping or from the veterinarians indicating if the cagemates should continue to be considered\ncompatible in light of the serious aggression injuries on 12-24-2015. Injuries on 12-24-15 suggest that there was a\ncompatibility problem with the cagemate which led to its death on 12-28-15. While working to maintain beneficial\nsocial groups or pairings, the facility must ensure that the compatibility of non-human primates is determined in\naccordance with generally accepted professional practices and actual observations, as directed by the attending\nveterinarian, to ensure that the pairings are in fact compatible.\nCorrect from this day forward."

The\nwater levels in the water bottles throughout the room were low. In one of the three cages, one mouse was found\ndead and the other mouse was hunched and had an unthrifty appearance. The dead mouse had been cannibalized\nby the second mouse which had to be humanely euthanized. Necropsy reports indicated the stomach contents of\nthe mouse found dead contained hair, paper and bedding. The room sheets documenting feeding schedules had\nnot been marked on January 22, 23, or 24th to indicate the animals had been fed on those dates. To ensure animal\nwell-being; animals must be fed daily except when considering veterinary treatment, hibernation or other accepted\nprofessional practices.\nThis incident was reported to the ACUC and appropriate corrective actions have been taken to ensure lapses in\nfeeding animals in the affected lab does not occur in the future.\nThis inspection was conducted from 11/1-11/3/2016 and was a routine inspection of nonhuman primates and a\nroutine record review of the Graduate School and College of Letters and Sciences.
