Four temperature measurements were taken in the room\napproximately once every hour starting at 1:20 pm. These measurements were taken with a Kestrel handheld\nweather meter, standing with the meter held at arms length from the threshold of the primate room door, and were\nas follows:\n1st measurement- Temperature: 86.0\u00b0 F, Humidity: 64.9%, Heat index: 94.5\n2nd measurement- Temperature: 87.3\u00b0 F, Humidity: 57.8%, Heat index: 94.6\n3rd measurement- Temperature: 85.7\u00b0 F, Humidity: 68.5%, Heat index: 96.1\n4th measurement- Temperature: 86.4\u00b0 F, Humidity: 65.9%, Heat index 96.6\nAt approximately 5:00 pm a digital wall thermometer in the room read 86.9\u00b0 F although a second temperature probe\non the wall placed by the door near this thermometer read 85\u00b0 F. The Kestrel, held near the animal cages at the\nback of the room, read 85.7\u00b0 F at approximately this time. It was explained that the second thermometer (displaying\nthe 85\u00b0 F temperature) is made to trigger an alarm if it detects temperatures above 85\u00b0 F for more than 4 hours.\nThis did not occur during the inspection.\nHigh temperatures for prolonged periods of time can stress animals, leading to discomfort and illness. Discomfort\nfrom heat may be exacerbated by high humidity.\nThe ambient temperature in an indoor primate facility must not rise above 85\u00b0 F for more than 4 consecutive hours\nwhen nonhuman primates are present.\nCorrect by 9/7/2014\nThis was a focused inspection to assess the temperature in the primate rooms.\nThe inspection was performed on 8/6/14 with the Operations Manager and Animal Care Technicians. The exit\nbriefing was conducted with the President and COO on 8/7/14."
