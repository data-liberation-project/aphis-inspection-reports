All animals will\nreceive antibiotics pre-operatively (3-5 mg/kg of Cefazolin IV and post-operatively 3-5 mg/kg of ceftiofur IM twice a\nday for 3 days)\". None of the animals received the drugs as specified in the protocol but better, longer- acting pain\nmedications: a sustained release opiod, a sustained release NSAID (Meloxicam) and Enrofloxacin (Baytril)\nantibiotic were used with veterinary discretion to minimize the stress from handling and restraint necessary to\nmedicate the pigs post-operatively. This significant change regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing\nactivities was not brought to the attention of the IACUC after the Attending Veterinarian administered the drug\nregimen after the first pig\u2019s surgery. It is the IACUC\u2019s responsibility to review and approve, require modifications in\nto secure approval or withhold approval of proposed significant changes to a protocol in order to ensure that animal\ncare and use are in accordance with legal requirements. Correct by seeking IACUC approval for significant changes\nto a protocol.\nCorrect from this day forward.\nExit interview was conducted withthe Director of Animal Research and the Animal Care Husbandry Manager"
