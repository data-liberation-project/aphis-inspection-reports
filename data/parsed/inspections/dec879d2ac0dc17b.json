      "narrative": "1) The attending veterinarian came to the facility on Friday, November 14, 2014 to examine the guinea pigs with\nhair loss and sores/scabs cited on the November 12, 2014 inspection report. Treatment for the entire guinea pig\ncolony was prescribed for the hair loss. The licensee treated the guinea pigs in rows 1 and 4 on Saturday,\nNovember 15, 2014, but not rows 2 and 3. An adult white guinea pig with hair loss and a large scab on the top of its\nback with thinning hair on its sides and an adult tricolor guinea pig with hair loss on its sides in row 3 that were cited\non the previous inspection report had not received treatment yet. There were an additional 364 guinea pigs in rows\n2 and 3 that had not yet been treated by the licensee.\n2) The attending veterinarian approved the medication the licensee was using for the treatment of presumed\nringworm. The attending veterinarian had directed the licensee to apply the treatment to the presumed ringworm\nlesions once a day. There was no documentation or markings on enclosures of which guinea pigs had been\nidentified with lesions or of any guinea pigs receiving the ringworm treatment. The licensee informed the APHIS\nofficials that the guinea pigs in rows one and four received the ringworm medication on Saturday, November 15,\n2014. During this inspection there were three guinea pigs in row 1, two guinea pigs in row 2, two guinea pigs on\nrow 3 and one guinea pig in row 4 with circular areas of crusts/scabs and hair loss. During this inspection the\nlicensee treated these animals for presumed ringworm as directed by his attending veterinarian and documented\nthe treatment on enclosure cards.\n3) In row 3 in the third enclosure from the top of the third column of enclosures was a black and white guinea pig\nwith a white blaze down its nose with a distinct head tilt to the right. This animal had not previously been noticed by\nthe licensee and had not received any veterinary examination, diagnostic procedures or treatment as directed by\nthe attending veterinarian for this condition. A head tilt is a serious medical condition that may result from multiple\ncauses such ear infection and neurological disease. This condition may be contagious. This animal must be\nexamined and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian.\n4) In row 3 in the sixth enclosure from the top of the sixth column of enclosures was a weanling tricolor guinea pig\nwith runny fecal material caked to its rear end. This weanling was hunched over by itself and was reluctant to\nmove. Later in the inspection the weanling was observed eating, but it still was not as active as the other\nweanlings in the enclosure. This animal had not previously been noticed by the licensee and had not received any\nveterinary examination, diagnostic procedures or treatment as directed by the attending veterinarian for this\ncondition. Diarrhea in small animals like weanlings can cause dehydration and death if left untreated and may\naffect the health of the other guinea pigs in and next to its enclosure. The licensee separated this weanling during\nthis inspection, but the guinea pig has not received any additional care. This animal must be examined and treated\nas directed by the attending veterinarian.\nThe licensee must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The two guinea pigs in row 3 (items #3 & #4)\nmust be examined and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian. Records of the examination, diagnosis and\ntreatment must be maintained for APHIS officials. The guinea pigs in rows 2 and 3 must receive the colony\ntreatment for hair loss and the guinea pigs identified with presumed ringworm lesions must receive the treatment as\nprescribed by the attending veterinarian to prevent the spread of disease and limit the suffering of the animals.\nRemains uncorrected."

      "narrative": "Heating.The temperature fluctuated in the guinea pig building from a low of 48.5 degrees F. to a high of 61.9\ndegrees F. during the inspection. The lowest temperature reading was measured adjacent to the guinea pig\nenclosures in the northwest corner of the building near the beginning of the inspection. At that time the windows\nwere partially opened and the wind speed reached greater than 1 mph at the nearest cages (row 4, column 1). The\nwindows were closed at that time, however, both wall mounted heaters still had to be turned up to get the\ntemperature 60 degrees or higher in some areas of the building. Several areas of the building still did not reach 60\ndegrees F. even with this modification. Between rows 2 and 3, the temperature only reached 58.5 degrees F. by\nthe end of the inspection. Although the bedding in most enclosures had been recently replaced, several that had\nbedding added on Wednesday, November 12, 2014 (and higher numbers of animals), had large portions of the\nbedding that were damp with urine and spilled water. Guinea pigs are very sensitive to both drafts and changes in\ntemperature. Animals may become ill if temperature is not closely monitored and kept between 60-85 degrees\nFahrenheit. The licensee must ensure that the temperature is maintained at acceptable levels throughout the entire\nfacility regardless of changing conditions outside. Continued monitoring of the temperature in the guinea pig\nbuilding is necessary with changing weather. Adjustments to the heaters, windows, fans, and vents must be made\nto keep the ambient temperature from falling below 60 degrees F. or exceeding 85 degrees F. when guinea pigs are\npresent.\nCorrect from this day forward."

At the start of the inspection, the windows were partly opened in the guinea pig room for ventilation.\nDrafts were measured with the Kestrel 4000 that exceeded 3 miles per hour near the windows and exceeding 1 mile\nper hour at the guinea pig enclosures nearest the windows. Guinea pigs in the nearest enclosures were observed\nhuddling initially and later (once windows were closed) were observed grooming and engaged in other normal\nbehavior. In the afternoon when the windows were closed to increase the temperature and stop the drafts, the\nammonia smell increased in the guinea pig building. The strongest ammonia odors were present in the middle of the\nbuilding between rows 2 and 3. Ammonia can irritate the eyes and respiratory tracts of the guinea pigs and cause\nthe animals to be more susceptible to eye and respiratory tract infections. Additionally, significant drafts may result\nin the development of multiple health problems. Rows 2 and 3 were last cleaned on Wednesday, November 12,\n2014 and multiple enclosures contained wet bedding. More frequent bedding changes and cleaning are necessary\nwhen the windows are closed to prevent harmful ammonia levels to rise in the guinea pig building. The guinea pig\nbuilding must be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors and moisture condensation.
