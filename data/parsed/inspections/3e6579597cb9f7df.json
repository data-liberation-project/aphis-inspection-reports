      "narrative": "One female hedgehog (87) was observed to have dark red sores on her skin underneath both of her ears. The\nsores appeared to include both ear canals. The skin lesions are approximately 3/4 inch long and 1/4 inch wide. The\nwounds appeared moist with some of the hairs adjacent to the wounds stained with a moist light brown material.\nThe owner reports he has been gone for the past four days but had treated her for skin mites before he left. While\nhe was gone, someone else came in to feed the hedgehogs but no health observations were made or reported to\nthe attending veterinarian. All animals must be observed daily and the facility must establish a mechanism of direct\nand frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that all problems of animal health. behavior and\nwell-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. In addition to setting up a mechanism for\nobservation and communication going forward, the attending veterinarian needs to be contacted regarding this\nhedgehog's health problem to ensure appropriate treatment. Correct by 3/27/18."
