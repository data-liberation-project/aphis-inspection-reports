According to the Principal Investigator, she decided to use Bupivacaine instead of the IACUC\napproved 2% Lidocaine as the preoperative anaesthetic because of the longer-acting duration. The PI did consult\nwith the Attending Veterinarian before implementing the drug change. While it is applaudable that the PI is seeking\nbetter pain management, all significant changes must be approved by the IACUC unless the IACUC has a written\npolicy that gives the AV authority in making these decisions. Currently, there is no policy that grants significant\nchanges can be made without IACUC approval. It is necessary for an IACUC to review and approve the proposed\nactivities and significant changes for the care and use of animals and to provide the proper oversight of the use of\nanimals by the research facility. Lack of supervision by an IACUC often leads to non-compliances with the Animal\nWelfare Act and this decreases animal welfare. Correct by ensuring all animal use activities and proposed\nsignificant changes have been approved by the IACUC before any animal procedures or changes are begun.\nCorrect this day forward.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director of Research Compliance."
