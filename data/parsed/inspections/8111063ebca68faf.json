While inside of her hide, it was observed that all of the straw was soiled, wet and had\nfeces in it. As the bear came out of the hide, her back legs were soaked through, with a buildup of feces between\nher legs. It has been three weeks since the cribs have been cleaned.\nA build up of feces, dirt, debris and wet bedding in the enclosures can be a source of illness and discomfort for the\nregulated animals if not removed in a timely manner, before the buildup.\nThe licensee must increase the cleaning of the bear pens more often to prevent the buildup of feces, old food, wet\nstraw and debris that can cause the regulated animals discomfort or inability to move freely without coming in\ncontact with the debris. All wet bedding must be removed and replaced with dry.\nThe licensee cleaned out the adjoining corn crib and supplied it with dry straw by the end of the inspection. The\nbear was moved into the clean area immediately.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee."
