      "narrative": "Two hamsters assigned to Protocol #0071 were not handled as carefully as possible by research staff on 5/30/24.\nResearch staff were performing the procedure of transferring group-housed hamsters from their home enclosure to a\nsecond enclosure set-up for overnight fecal collection (an approximately 16-hour period). After the animals were\ntransferred, the fecal collection enclosures containing the transferred hamsters were placed on top of the home\nenclosures (the wire tops of the home enclosures had been removed). The next morning, husbandry staff discovered that\ntwo hamsters had been left inside in their home cage overnight (two separate home cages had one hamster). The two\nhamsters left in their home cages had access to food and bedding but did not have access to water during the 16-hour\novernight period. In addition, the home cages of the two hamsters during the overnight period had an interior height less\nthan the 6\u201d specified in Section 3.28 (c)(2)(ii) and did not provide sufficient space for the hamsters to make normal\npostural adjustments. Husbandry staff immediately contacted veterinary staff and moved the two hamsters to a new\nenclosure with a water bottle. A veterinarian evaluated both hamsters and determined that the animals were hydrated,\nwere in good health without any observable signs of distress, and no treatment was indicated.\nPer this Section, the handling of animals by all personnel, including research staff, should be done as carefully as\npossible in a manner that does not cause behavioral stress or unnecessary discomfort. The failure of research staff to\nrecognize that not all of the animals housed in an enclosure were transferred to the new enclosure and that two animals\nremained in their original enclosure is not handling the animals as carefully as possible. As a result of improper handling,\nthe two hamsters did not have access to water for 16 hours and were also housed in an enclosure that did not meet the\nspace requirements for a hamster primary enclosure as per Section 3.28.\nThe research facility addressed this incident prior to the inspection by implementing corrective measures that included the\nretraining of investigator staff on animal husbandry practices, implementing additional study procedures, and increased\noversight of the laboratory by veterinary staff. To remain corrected from this date 8/14/24 forward.\nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives from 8/13/24 through 8/14/24.
