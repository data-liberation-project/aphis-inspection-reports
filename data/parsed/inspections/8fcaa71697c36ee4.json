Jag was voluntarily trained for the treatment and had received them in this pool previously without\nincident. The ED stated there has not been a malfunction of the restraint system of the medical pool during the 10 years\nof its use. Due to the frequency of the treatments, manual restraint was now required for Jag. While being handled for his\ntherapy, Jag pushed through the trainers and swam beneath the false bottom of the pool enclosure. Despite immediate\nattempts to direct him out of the enclosure by opening the gates to adjacent pools and cutting the net of the false bottom,\nthe animal expired. Corrective action has since been implemented to minimize the risk of animal injury while handled for\nmedical treatment. The presence of animal care staff and trainers may not be sufficient to restrain a dolphin, especially\nunder stressful conditions. A system should be in place to ensure safe handling of animals, especially while undergoing\nmedical treatments. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nn"
