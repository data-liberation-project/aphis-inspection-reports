      "narrative": "A number of animals had conditions that required veterinary medical assessments and treatment. There were\nseveral animals exhibiting lameness, many with ear lesions suggestive of fly-strike, one animal with a large open\nsore on its hip, one animal with severe hair loss on her tail, and one animal who had ear tip lesions but was also\nflicking his ears, shaking his head, and holding his head slightly tilted to the right. The following is a list of animals\nand their associated conditions:\n** Limping animals included: 1) British Columbian wolf (\u201cBaby Chaco\u201d) \u2013 right front leg limp. The foreman stated that\nthis was due to an old injury/infection that the veterinarian said was not going to heal any further. There were no\nrecords on hand verifying what veterinary treatments or assessments were done. The limp indicates a possible\npainful condition. 2) Arctic wolf (\u201cInuk\u201d)- Appears to have a stiff gait on rising and a left hind limp. The foreman\nindicated this animal often seemed to be stiff initially on getting up but would loosen up after walking around for a\nlittle while. 3) Arctic wolf (\u201cCeleste\u201d)- left front limp. This animal was frequently holding it\u2019s left front foot off the\nground and often appeared reluctant to put weight on that foot, sometimes hopping a little to avoid using it. 4) Arctic\nfox (\u201cLucy\u201d) \u2013severe non-weight bearing left hind leg lameness. This animal also had large clumps of hair that were\nmatted and dangling as its winter coat was shedding. It was moving around on three legs with the left hind tucked\nup under one of the dangling mats of hair. The foreman said he hadn\u2019t noticed \u201cCeleste\u201d or \u201cLucy limping before and\nthought it was new since Saturday (two days prior to the inspection). When asked he said a veterinarian had not\nseen them yet.\n** Many of the wolves, including all six white Arctic wolves (\u201cInuk\u201d, \u201cSpirit Prince\u201d, \u201cYeti\u201d, \u201cMishka\u201d, \u201cCeleste\u201d, and\n\u201cSakima\u201d) and at least two Gray wolves (\u201cMinquah\u201d and \u201cSage\u201d), had wounds on their ear tips that appeared to be\nconsistent with fly strike. At the time of the inspection only a few flies were observed actually landing on the ears but\nseveral large flies were heard buzzing in the vicinity. The ear tips exhibited hair loss, had varying degrees of\nredness, swelling, sores, scabbing, and in some cased a very dark reddish to black discoloration that raises concern\nabout the vascular supply to the tissue. The foreman said that they were treating the ears with Vetericyn and\nTRIcare but that the veterinarian had not looked at the ears. Fly control was discussed. At the time of the exit\ninterview the licensee presented a new ointment from the veterinarian (VIP clear fly repellent ointment).\n** \u201cSakima\u201d , one of the Arctic wolves, also had a large open sore or wound on the left hip area. The foreman and\nthe licensee both stated that it was a \u201chotspot\u201d but this wound was quite large, had black crusting/scabbing and\nthickened margins. It appeared very red as if the wound had split open to reveal bright red inflamed tissue\nunderneath. Several flies were seen landing on this wound. The foreman said it was being treated but he didn\u2019t think\nthe veterinarian had seen it.\n** A grey wolf, \u201cMinquah\u201d, had ear tip lesions but was also exhibiting very frequent ear flicking and head shaking as\nwell as a slight head tilt to the right. These signs may possibly indicate some other problem such as an ear infection.\nThis animal is also missing most of his left ear, which is apparently an old injury, but the remnants of the pinna had\nsome of the fly-strike lesions on it also.\n** The gray wolf \u201cSage\u201d, in addition to the flystrike-type ear sores, had severe hair loss on her tail and some\npossible underlying redness. The hair loss gave it a rattail-like appearance.\n**The attending veterinarian must be notified of animal health problems so that they can provide appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Health records are needed to convey\nnecessary information to all people involved in an animal\u2019s care. Every facility should have system of health records\nsufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate the delivery of adequate health care.\nAt the exit interview the licensee indicated that she has an appointment for the veterinarian to come out in the\nafternoon to have them look at these issues.\nCorrect by: 5/18/2017"
