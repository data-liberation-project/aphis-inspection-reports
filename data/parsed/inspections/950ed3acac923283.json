The outdoor temperature at the conclusion of the\ninspection was 26 degrees F and the low temperature reported over night on weather.gov for this zip code was\nreported as 24 degrees F. This problem appears to be a result of the keeper door being left open and the heater in\nthis area not working properly for an unknown period of time. Because the zoo employees had not noticed the\nmalfunctioning heater today as of the time of inspection (about 11am), the temperature in this area was below 45\ndegrees for at least 4 hours. Failure to maintain the temperature in the sheltered building housing nonhuman\nprimates can result in animals who are unable to maintain a safe body temperature. The licensee must ensure that\nthe sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities must be sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to protect\nthe nonhuman primates from temperature extremes, and to provide for their health and well-being. The ambient\ntemperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not fall below 45 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours\nwhen nonhuman primates are present, To be corrected by close of business on 5 Feb 2020.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLundy Kendall, Animal Care Inspector"
