A tractor driven by an employee with an attached trailer was observed taking a\ngroup of children through the safari. The employee would stop occasionally to allow feeding of the animals and the\nemployee would step down off the tractor to monitor one side of the trailer, but children were also feeding animals on the\nopposite side of the trailer unobserved. In the budgie aviary, one attendant was present while members of the public were\nfeeding the birds but instead of monitoring the interactions, the attendant was looking away and/or at their phone instead\nof monitoring the interactions. At one point the attendant left for a break while members of the public were still present in\nthe aviary for approximately 10 minutes, so the public was left unattended while feeding the birds. At the giraffe feeding\nstation and the farm animal petting area, adults and children were observed feeding the giraffe and farm animals with no\nreadily identifiable attendant present. Lack of employee oversight of direct interactions between the animals and the\nvisitors may lead to injury to the humans and/or injury or distress to the animals.
