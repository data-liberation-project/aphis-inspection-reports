The facility's veterinarian\nprescribed a treatment plan which included: administration of polyflex every 24 hrs. for 5 days and Baytril every 24\nhrs. for 10 days. The animal should have received polyflex on September 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st. Records\nshow that the animal did not receive polyflex on 19-Sep-14 and 21-Sep-14. The records also show the last\nadministration of any medication to this animal was on 21-Sep-14. According to the prescribed treatment plan from\nthe veterinarian, the animal should have received Baytril from September 17th through September 26th. The facility\ntreated with Baytril for only 5 days (should have been 10 days). At the time of inspection, the facility could not\nsupply any additional documentation of medication administration or a new treatment plan from their veterinarian.\nFailure to follow the prescribed treatment plan from the veterinarian can lead to inadequate treatment, prolonged\ninjury with any associated pain and distress for the animal. From this time forward, the facility should maintain\ndocumentation of medication administration or any changes to treatment plans as directed by their veterinarian.\n***One rabbit was noted by the APHIS VMO(cid:25)s to be squinting and had a clear discharge and reddened tissue in the\ncorners of both eyes. The facility representatives stated that this problem had been noted before and it had been\ntreated by wiping the eyes with Vetricyn. Reddened tissue and discharge from the eyes may indicate an underlying\ninflammatory or infectious problem and, if not properly diagnosed and treated, may lead to a painful condition or\nloss of vision.\nThe licensee contacted their veterinarian by email following the inspection. The licensee still must have this animal\nexamined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 19, 2014, to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate\ntreatment plans for the issue cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided to the inspector upon\nrequest. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those\ntests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and\nentries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the\nanimals.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of the animal\nat that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the\nneed for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed."
