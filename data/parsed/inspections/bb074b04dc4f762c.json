The round wire enclosure had a roof over the top and was covered nearly halfway around the\nenclosure by metal sheeting on one side. There is approximately a 2-foot gap between the metal sheeting and roof. The\nfloor consisted of a few inches of woodchips on top of a wooden platform. There was no shelter inside the enclosure to\nfully allow the animal to hide or to shelter from strong winds or blowing precipitation. The facility representative stated that\nthis porcupine is well-acclimated to weather conditions at this time of year and they do place an igloo kennel shelter inside\nthe enclosure from October until April. Failing to provide an appropriate shelter at all times may lead to animal discomfort,\nstress, and illness. An appropriate shelter must be provided within the outdoor primary enclosure to allow the porcupine\nprotection from harsh elements and inclement weather year-round.\n***This was corrected prior to the exit interview.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
