At\nthis age and size the liger is too big and strong to be adequately restrained by only a dog harness and leash.

A dog leash and harness are not meant to restrain a liger.\nDuring public exhibition animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.\nAn exotic felid of this size could seriously injure a child or an adult if it were to gain access to the public.\nTo be corrected by Feb 22, 2016\nThis inspection occurred at the San Angelo Stock Show with the licensee, ACI Don Fox, and VMO Cindy\nDiGesualdo.
