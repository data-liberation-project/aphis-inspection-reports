The\nwound approximately a quarter inch in diameter was open, circular in shape, inflamed, reddened, moist looking and\nhairless. The licensee stated the wound was first observed on 2/24/18. The licensee stated that Vetericyn wound\ntreatment spray was being used to treat the wound. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not\nbeen consulted. An open wound can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which\naffects the health and well-being of the cat. Daily observation of the animals may be accomplished by someone\nother than the attending veterinarian provided that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required\nso that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian. Failure to communicate illness, whether it appears mild or serious, to the attending\nveterinarian, could result in improper care of the animals. For example, this could lead to failure to seek professional\nveterinary care in a timely manner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the animal's condition. The\nlicensee must observe all animals daily to access their health and well-being. The licensee must ensure that all\nanimals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a timely manner by a veterinarian\nas part of the facility\u2019s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility uses appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times. The outcome of this consultation including\nthe diagnosis, treatment plan and how the condition will be resolved must be documented and provided to the\ninspector upon request. If the healing process is delayed it can cause unnecessary pain, discomfort, or suffering,\nwhich can create a negative impact on the animal\u2019s health and well-being. The licensee must ensure all animals\nreceive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by 3/6/18."
