      "narrative": "-There was one adult female blackbuck antelope which was lying down away from the rest of the herd along the\nfence line. The animal had an abnormal condition of the right eye which appeared swollen compared to the left eye.\nWhen attempting to get a closer view of the animal, it got up and ran away toward the rest of the herd. A white to\nyellow colored cylindrical-like object or material appeared to be extending from or penetrating the eye. The eyeball\nitself was not easily visualized. There was a large amount of dark discharge-like material in the fur extending from\nthe corner of the eye downward past the bottom jaw. According to the licensee, he noticed an eye condition and\ntreated the animal once which was documented in the licensee's written records on May 28, 2017, but the animal\nwas not examined by a veterinarian. It is possible that the treatment did not improve the condition and/or a new\ncondition has developed since the last documented treatment approximately two weeks earlier. The eye condition\ncould indicate an injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could be painful. The licensee must\nhave this blackbuck examined by a veterinarian. This veterinary examination is in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document\nthis information and provide it to the inspector upon request. To be corrected by: June 14, 2017\n-There were at least five adult aoudad with excessively long hooves especially on the rear claws. At least one of\nthese animals with long rear hooves, had a gait that appeared unsteady on the rear limbs. One of the sheep had a\nmedial claw on the left rear hoof twisted over the top of the tip of the adjacent claw. Another animal had a lateral\nclaw on the right rear hoof that was curled outward. There were at least two animals with hooves that were long\nand curling upward or veering outward. One of the sheep had a right rear medial claw that appeared split or\ncracked. Long hooves can affect an animal\u2019s gait and can increase the risk of injury and/or discomfort. The licensee\nmust ensure that all hooves are kept short enough to not affect the animal\u2019s stance or gait and are kept at an\nappropriate length which will avoid injury. To be corrected by: June 16, 2017\n-There were some medications at the facility which were past their expiration date. The following is a list of\nproducts, and their labeled expiration dates in parentheses, that were stored with other products and/or medications\ncurrently in use at the facility and were therefore ready for use.\nPenicillin G (12/2016), 2 bottles of Clostridium Perfringens Types C & D Tetanus Toxoid (22 Jul 16 & 21 Feb 17),\nXylazine (7/09), \u201cTolazine\u201d (2/11), 2 bottles of \u201cTelazol\u201d (01/2016 & 01/2016), Thiamine HCl (1-17), Vitamin B\nComplex (10/15), Amoxicillin (05/16), Xylazine/\u201cAnaSed\u201d (Jul 14), Ivermectin (01/17), Sterile Saline Solution\n(2016-03) and \u201cProbios\u201d (04/17).\nExpired medications may not work as anticipated and/or may lose their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or\ncontrol disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure all medications are within their expiration dates at all times.\nTo be corrected by: June 16, 2017\n-The licensee was also using some medications in an off-label manner. For example, the licensee had used\nxylazine in a blackbuck without instructions for its use in that animal from a veterinarian. Use of medications in a\nmanner other than what is stated on the label could increase the risk of injury, illness and/or death in the animal.\nThe licensee must ensure that all medications used in a manner other than what is on the product\u2019s label have\nwritten instructions for its use under the order and direction of a licensed veterinarian. To be corrected by: June 27,\n2017\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nThe inspection and a preliminary exit interview were conducted on June 13, 2017 with the licensee. An exit\ninterview was completed on June 14, 2017 with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nProctor Chad, Animal Care Inspector"
