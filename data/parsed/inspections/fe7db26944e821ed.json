There was a\nsticker applied in Amsterdam stating that the animal had been fed and watered after arriving there, but it said the\nanimal was last offered food and water on 10/8 at 8:00. Assuming that was 8:00 AM, with the 8 hour time\ndifference, that would have been 12 AM SFO time, thirteen hours previous to the time of inspection at SFO. But this\nis uncertain, as the information was unclear, and no feeding and watering instructions were provided from the\nshipper.\nWaybill # 074-57280510\nCarriers must ensure that a certification is signed by the consignor that includes written instructions for feeding and\nwatering, and that this information is clearly visible on the primary enclosure so that the animal can be properly\ncared for during transit.\nThis same issue was previously cited at this cargo office at SFO on 3/20/14 with an immediate correction date.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a cargo office representative."
