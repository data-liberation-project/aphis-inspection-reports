The liquid was seen splashing onto a ferret\u2019s head within the enclosure directly below.\n\u2022 The plastic grates at the bottom of the enclosures are scraped daily but not sufficiently to remove all excrement. The\ninspector observed the cleaning done solely by scraping feces off which left behind a significant amount of smeared\nbrown residue on the floors that the ferrets were able to come in contact with.\n\u2022 A large buildup of brownish black material consisting of remnants of excrement and feed was observed at the wire sides\nof many enclosures, mostly where the flooring grate meets the wire, as well as between the towers of enclosures.\nThe lack of adequate cleaning has resulted in a significantly dirty living environment that may be contributing to discomfort\nand lead to disease. It is necessary to maintain a clean enclosure, including the fixtures within, to reduce contamination\nand the risk of disease as well as discomfort to the animals. Excreta should be removed from the primary enclosure as\noften as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to\nreduce odors.\nCorrect by: 08/15/2025."
