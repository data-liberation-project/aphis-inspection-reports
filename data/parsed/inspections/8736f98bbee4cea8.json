This dog is still housed at the\nfacility and has not had any dental procedures performed.\nDuring this inspection this dog's teeth were observed to have a brown to tannish hard material covering the surface\nof the upper molars and upper canines on both sides of the mouth. The gums were reddened adjacent to the\naffected teeth. The gums above the canine teeth were pulled up and away.These signs are consistent with dental\ndisease which can be painful and lead to systemic health problems.\nThis same dog was observed continuously circling to the right at a fast pace. The circling continued at a slower\npace when the dog was unaware of being observed. The circling behavior was documented on November 28, 2012\nduring a behavior assessment of the dog. Management of this behavior consisted of extra socialization which has\nsince been discontinued. It is not documented whether the treatment altered the behavior. This behavior can have\nphysical and/or psychological causes.\nThe facility must establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes prevention,\nidentification and treatment of diagnosed diseases.This dog should be examined by a veterinarian to determine\naccurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the described symptoms. Follow up care as directed by the\nveterinarian should be documented.\nCorrect by: February 7, 2014.\nExit interview conducted with management."
