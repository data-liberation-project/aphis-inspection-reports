The enclosure was taken out of use until fixed and the jill and kits were relocated to a new\nenclosure.\nIn another incident, a ferret was found with its lower jaw stuck in the cage bars. It was freed, treated for a skin lesion\nunder the jaw, and relocated to a new enclosure. The cage was evaluated and found to have bent bars. The enclosure\nwas repaired.\nIn the third incident, a ferret was found with its paw caught in the enclosure. The ferret was freed and evaluated. No\ntreatment was determined to be needed. The cage was taken out of use until fixed and all ferrets in the enclosure were\nrelocated to a new one.\nEnclosures need to be designed, built, and maintained so that they keep the ferrets contained, protecting them from\npotential injury, and so they don\u2019t pose a risk of injury to the animals within. The enclosures in these incidents were\nrepaired. The facility has implemented procedures to try to better identify enclosures in need of repair and many\nenclosures have already been repaired or removed from service.\nCorrection: Ensure the process of identification of defects and repairs is ongoing.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.\nEnd Section"
