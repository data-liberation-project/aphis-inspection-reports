After 30 minutes with no contact from the\nlicensee, the inspector left the premises.\nLack of availability renders the inspection process impossible. The licensee must ensure that a responsible and\nknowledgeable adult is available to accompany APHIS inspectors during normal business hours.\nThe inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information\nmanagement system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was\ndeployed, the \u201cprepared by\u201d date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the\noriginal inspection report, which occurred on August 15, 2016."
