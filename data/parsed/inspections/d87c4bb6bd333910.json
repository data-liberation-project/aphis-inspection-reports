The\nbottle was approximately half full and currently being used by the licensee to sedate three adult dogs. The licensee\npurchased the drug from the attending veterinarian in October of 2016. The licensee stated that the drug is used\nwhen dogs at the facility need to be sheared. While a dog is sedated, the licensee or employee may also clip\ntoenails and look for any abnormal health conditions.\nThe bottle of Rompun-Ketaset does not list an expiration date or use for a specific animal. Medications must be\nlabeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents and dosage rates of the\ncontainer can be known with certainty and not used past its expiration date. The licensee must also ensure that all\nmedication labels are labeled with the contents (concentration of drug), dosing instructions specific for the species\nof the animal it\u2019s being administered to.\nThis drug is not listed on the program of veterinary care that the licensee maintains at the facility. If the individual(s)\nadministering the controlled substance is not a veterinarian or is not directly supervised by a veterinarian, then the\nindividual\u2019s training should be documented and approved by the attending veterinarian as part of the facility\u2019s\nprogram of veterinary care. Sedative/tranquilizers and controlled substances must be used by a trained and\nknowledgeable individual. If not used properly, this medication could cause harm to the animals.\nThe licensee must be adequately trained by the attending veterinarian on the use of controlled substances and\nother sedative/tranquilizers to ensure proper dosing rates and administration to protect the health and welfare of the\nanimals at the facility. Additionally, the licensee must also have written guidance from the attending veterinarian to\nappropriately monitor vital signs, handle animals during and after administration, recognize when medical\nintervention is necessary and determine what steps to take.\nTo be corrected by: February 20, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\n*The female Beagle (#0A01233177) and male Beagle (#145357586A) listed under 2.40 (b)(2) on the November 16,\n2016 inspection report, have both had their toenails trimmed.
