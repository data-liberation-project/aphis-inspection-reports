The Sheriff department was\nable to follow the dogs to their home and made contact with the owner of the dogs, according to the licensee.

All fencing surrounding the pastures have been reinforced where needed including rocks/bricks surrounding the\nbottom of fences to prevent animals from digging under and possibly making contact with the animals.
