The child had been sitting on its mother\u2019s lap on a\nbench in the parakeet enclosure and suddenly jump off, landing on the bird which was on floor in front of the bench. The\nenclosure is designed to allow the public to come in and have an interactive experience with the parakeets, feeding them\nfrom their hands with seed provided by the facility. There are about 300 parakeets in the enclosure. People are seated on\nbenches as they feed the birds. Some of the birdseed falls on the floor around the benches or onto people's shoes. The\ninspector watched 4 or 5 groups move through the enclosure and there were large numbers of parakeets around people's\nfeet and perched on shoes in every group. The attendants generally did not attempt to keep the parakeets away from the\nbenches or people\u2019s feet while they were seated, but they did instruct them to keep their feet and heals on the floor and\nshuffle as they walked in out of the enclosure. They did try to shew birds away from one set of small children. Some\npeople\u2019s feet, especially children, could not completely reach the floor and many people inadvertently lifted the heels of\ntheir shoes and the inspector observed birds putting their heads under the heals looking for seeds.\nDuring public exhibition, care must be taken so that there is minimal risk of harm to the birds with sufficient distance\nand/or barriers between the birds and the general viewing public to assure the safety of animals.\nTo be corrected by: June 6.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
