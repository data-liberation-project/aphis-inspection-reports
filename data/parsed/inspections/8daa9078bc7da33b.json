      "narrative": "At the exit interview, as we finished going through the inspection report, Mr. Woody became increasingly upset,\ncombative and verbally abusive towards us. His face reddened and he was yelling. He began verbally attacking us\nby accusing us of having personal agendas, and purposefully not lifting his suspension immediately. I tried to tell the\nlicensee that we did not have the authority to lift the suspension, at which time he accused us of lying. He continued\nto rant about HSUS, PETA, the USDAs\u2019, and our personal agendas\u2019 with those groups to get him out of the animal\nbusiness. It was impossible to say anything because he was yelling and would not stop to listen to anything we tried\nto say or let us get a word in.\nWe were unable to finish the exit interview because of his behavior and his nonstop yelling and interruptions. We\ncould not discuss items we felt he should monitor or improve, nor were we able to ask him if he had any questions\nsince we were concerned that anything we said might inflame him more and cause his bad behavior to become\neven worse. At this point, knowing that nothing more could be accomplished and that we needed to leave the\nsituation, I managed to ask Mr. Woody to sign the reports. As he was signing his name in an exaggerated and\nfurious manner, his pen stopped working, and he whipped it across the kitchen where it hit the wall and fell to the\nfloor. I took the reports and we immediately left the facility.\nBoth Dr. Kingston and I felt our anxiety peak during the exit interview and was very concerned that Mr. Woodys'\nbehavior had become unpredictable. He had never gotten this upset in past inspections. For safety\u2019s sake, we both\nknew we needed to leave as quickly as possible, and not discuss a harassment/interference NCI with him. Mr.\nWoodys' actions during the inspection made it at times difficult and frustrating, and interfered with us performing our\nduties smoothly, and his behavior at the exit interview was intolerable because we truly did not know what actions\nhe would take in his fit of anger.\nThis citation was written after the inability to finish the exit intreveiw and was sent by certified and regular mail to the\nlicensee\nAdditional Inspectors\nKingston Susan, Supervisory Compliance Specialist"
