      "narrative": "The facility is allowing public interaction with 4 young coatimundi without ensuring minimal risk of harm to the\nanimals and to the public. During this inspection I requested the facility demonstrate how they are handling the\nanimals. We entered the enclosure, sat down, and two of the coati were allowed to climb onto our laps. The\nmethod of control was to grab the animals if they started a behavior that was not appropriate. One of the coati was\nable to grab my arm in its mouth before the attendant was able to restrain it.\nDuring public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.\nThe current method to control or restrain an animal is ineffective in preventing an injury to the public. A more\nappropriate handling method that would minimize the risk of injury during public interactions must be established in\nconsultation with the attending veterinarian.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
