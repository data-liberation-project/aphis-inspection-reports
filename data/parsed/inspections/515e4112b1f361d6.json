The licensee stated to the USDA inspectors that they had two customers coming, one at 5:10 PM and\n5:30 PM and it was not a good time for the inspection. Licensee further stated that they needed to bathe puppies\nand that they would also need to go back to work at 6:30. The inspector informed the licensee that the inspection\nwas to be a focused and was to check two dogs. The licensee requested the inspectors return at 5:40 PM to\nperform the inspection.\nAt 5:11 p.m., the licensee texted the inspectors stating, My person just told me 530 it will not work tonight sorry the\nlicensee.\nAt approximately 5:13 p.m. the inspector texted back, \u201cAre you saying the inspection will not work or that the puppy\nsale will not work?\u201d\nAt approximately 5:21 p.m. the licensee texted the inspectors, \u201cInspection will not work\u201d.\nThen at approximately 5:30 p.m. the inspectors texted back, \u201cAre you refusing an inspection at this time?\u201d\nThe licensee did not respond to this text and this was the end of the text communication.\nInspectors returned to licensee facility at 5:45 p.m. and met licensee as he was going to his mailbox. The licensee\nstated that they could not do the inspection at this time. Licensee stated a customer had texted that they were late\nand would be coming at 6:10 PM. Inspector asked if the licensee was refusing inspection at this time. The licensee\nstated that they were not refusing inspection but nobody would be available tonight for inspection. The licensee\nstated that they did not want the inspectors present when the customer arrived. Inspector told the licensee that if\nthey were not able to inspect that it would be considered a refusal to inspect. Inspector further explained that\ntoday\u2019s inspection was intended to be a focused inspection and would likely be no longer than 15 minutes to check\ntwo dogs ( previously cited on the March 21 2017 inspection report).\nUnannounced inspections are required to allow APHIS officials to assess the health and welfare of the animals in\norder to enforce the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards. Failure to allow access for inspection interferes\nwith the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. If the licensee cannot be\navailable during normal business hours, a person (over age 18) should be designated to accompany the inspector\nduring the inspection.\nFrom this day forward, the licensee must provide inspectors access for inspection when requested by APHIS\nofficials.\nUSPS Tracking #: 9590940227566351142035.\nThis focused inspection was attempted by Randall Wagner (ACI).\nThis inspection will be sent both regular and certified mail.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSecor Thomas, Veterinary Medical Officer"
