All\nfour dogs had lesions that were visually similar on both ears. Each lesion was observed to be large (approximately\n0.75-1.5\" diameter), round to ovoid, reddened, devoid of hair, and with crusted blood at the edges. Fresh blood was\nobserved with some of the lesions. The Akita dog with lesions was observed shaking its head. The licensee\nindicated that his decision to use topical hydrocortisone application for the dogs' ears was not informed by advice\nfrom his veterinarian. After requesting the licensee to consult his attending veterinarian for guidance on the dogs'\nears, the attending veterinarian's office conveyed to USDA that the licensee had only inquired about how to repel\nflies from dogs. The attending veterinarian's office specified that the licensee had not asked how he should treat the\nlesions that were present on the dogs' ears.\nAppropriate methods for prevention, control, diagnoses, and treatments of diseases must be employed as part of a\nprogram of veterinary care, in order to ensure dog health and well-being. The lack of appropriate methods for\ntreatment of ear lesions can create pain, stress, and more advanced skin health issues.\nThe licensee must obtain a diagnosis and treatment recommendations from the attending veterinarian of record for\nDogs #18170, #18173, #18174, and #18176.\nCorrect by July 12, 2018."
