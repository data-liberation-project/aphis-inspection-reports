Barney was observed scratching for extended periods of\ntime around these areas of hair loss. Barney was diagnosed last March with allergy related dermatitis.

This hygroma if untreated can\nprogress to local fluid accumulations, ulceration and infections. The licensee stated the vet has evaluated the\nhygroma but there is no documentation indicating when this was and no method of alleviating the pressure on the\njoints has been addressed.\nCindy\u2019s pacing behavior should be communicated to the attending vet and she should be assessed for an\nunderlying medical condition either physical or psychological in nature. Pacing can be indicative of physical or\npsychological issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modification."

She was anchored to the chair for each photo but the chair is not anchored to\nanything making it immovable. The chair is approximately 30 pounds and was easily picked up by the inspector. A\nfew times Cindy wanted to get off the chair during the morning photo session and although her handler stopped her,\nthere is potential that if frustrated she could leave taking the chair with her. To minimize the risk of harm to the\nanimal and public, this chair should be anchored to an immovable object which can act as a sufficient barrier to\nrestrict contact with guests.\nCorrect by: March 4, 2017"

      "narrative": "While in travel status for several months of the year, the primary enclosure for the three bears is a rectangular cattle\npanel enclosure set up in a building on a concrete floor with shavings. There are no visual barriers in the enclosure\nthat allows the animals to avoid each other or get out of view of the guests. There are no furniture items, water tubs,\nstraw or bedding that allows the animals to express normal postural or social adjustments. Black bears normally\nengage in postural behaviors of swimming, climbing, digging and denning and socially need to be able to have the\nchoice to get away from each other.\nCindy the female bear was observed pacing along the back panel for an extended period of time before and after\nthe show. This occurred on Friday and Saturday of the visit and inspection. She was facing the back wall away from\nthe public side and would seeming only break from the pacing behavior if the younger bear \u201cBarney\u201d would grab at\nher legs repeatedly. She would then turn on him mouth open until he would submit and she would begin pacing\nagain. Pacing in black bears is an abnormal behavior pattern and can indicate stress, frustration or an underlying\nmedical condition.\nAndy the older male bear laid in the center of the enclosure for the majority of the day and when he would get up,\nhis movements were stiff, slow and seemingly arthritic in nature. There has been no modification to the enclosure\nwith the addition of straw or bedding that would allow Andy to get off the concrete to be more comfortable and the\nconcrete can exacerbate his debility. In addition, several times \u201cBarney\u201d the younger bear would try and elicit a\nresponse from the older bear and would get on top of him and Andy would tolerate it for a few moments before\nopening his mouth and the younger bear would get off. Andy has no way to separate himself from the younger bear\nwhich can cause additional stress or is potentially painful in his condition.\nBarney is the youngest bear with hair loss over several parts of his body including a bald patch on his hindquarters.\nBarney is the most active bear and was observed trying to elicit behaviors from the other bears, rolling on his back\nand grabbing his back paws and trying to run around. Barney is scratching and rubbing his back on the concrete\nwhich has caused a bald spot on his hindquarters. Barney was observed pacing for short periods of time. He needs\nto be provided functional elements in this enclosure to promote normal behaviors as to prevent any abnormal ones\nlike pacing from becoming a continuous and rigid behavior.\nCorrect by: March 4, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nThis inspection occurred over a two day period March 24-25, 2017 at the Lewis and Clark County Fairgrounds in\nHelena, MT.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHood Brian, Animal Care Inspector"
