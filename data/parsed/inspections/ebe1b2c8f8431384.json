Most of the cheek teeth could not be visualized. The gums were swollen and\nreddened and a malodorous smell was coming from his mouth that is evident when standing about 2 feet from the\ndog. There was a white creamy material along the gum line near one of the large cheek teeth on the right side.\nThe buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the\ndog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a\nveterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must\nbe documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by February 27,2014\nThe inspection and exit interview was done with a facility representative."
