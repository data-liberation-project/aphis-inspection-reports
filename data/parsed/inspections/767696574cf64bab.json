The veterinarian treated the animal\norally with meloxicam in the feed, but there was no change in the animal\u2019s condition. This was reported to the AV who\nadvised monitoring of the animal, but no further diagnostics or treatments are planned by the veterinarian as of the date of\nthis report.\n\u2022 Oryx: One oryx (BCS 2/9) noted to be limping on the right forelimb was visually evaluated by the AV on August 27, 2021\nand was treated orally with a two-week course of meloxicam in the feed. The animal did not respond to the treatment, and\nwas again reported to the AV who performed another visual exam on November 5, 2021. The limp continues and there\nare no further diagnostics or treatments planned by the veterinarian as of the date of this report.\n\u2022 Red deer: The male red deer is still thin (BCS 3/9) with a \u201cpot\u201d belly. He has a patchy hair coat with short, thin hair in\nsome areas and long hair in others.\n\u2022 White-tailed deer: One female remains thin (BCS 3/9) with an unthrifty hair coat and prominent ribs, vertebrae and hips\nand little muscle covering the hindquarters.\n\u2022 White-tailed deer: One male remains thin (BCS 3/9) with limited muscle over the ribs, vertebrae, hips and hindquarters.\n\u2022 Addax: There are approximately four addax in the front pen, one singly-housed addax and eight out of ten Addax in the\nmiddle pen that remain thin (BCS 2 \u2013 3/9), with prominent ribs, vertebrae and hips, with little muscle covering the\nhindquarters.\n\u2022 Sika Deer: There are two female sika deer that are still thin (BCS 2 \u2013 3/9), with insufficient muscle tissue covering the\nhindquarters, spine and ribs.\n\u2022 Female ibex with left forelimb lameness. The attending veterinarian performed a visual exam on August 27, 2021 and\nprescribed a four-week course of meloxicam in the feed. The animal did not respond to the treatment, the lameness\npersists, and the animal is compensating with an abnormal posture (spine curved upwards). The animal is also thin (BCS\n3/9). No further diagnostics or treatments are planned by the veterinarian as of the date of this report.\nThe attending veterinarian\u2019s treatment plan for the thin animals (unlimited alfalfa hay to be made available and veterinary\nrechecks every month) has not resolved the problems in the animals listed above. There are multiple reasons these\nanimals could be thin which include parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, competition from herd mates, and systemic\ndisease. There are multiple reasons the ibex and oryx could be minimally to completely non-weight bearing on their\nrespective frontlimbs. Minimal diagnostics have been employed to determine the exact cause of the problems in the\nabove animals, and there has been insufficient response to the treatments provided thus far. Without proper diagnostics\nand treatment based on the results of the diagnostics, the condition of the animals may not improve or could worsen,\nespecially in light of upcoming colder environmental temperatures. Examination on the above animals must be completed\nto determine appropriate diagnostics, treatment options, and prognoses"
