      "narrative": "*On June 29, 2021 at approximately 11:30 am the inspectors looked at the dairy cows comprising the veterinary teaching\nherd. One black and white overweight cow (Ear Tag #5483) was noted lying sternal very close to the fence/gate leading to\nthe covered student palpation stalls. The rest of the cows were located down the hill near the hay and water sources.\nNatural shade and shelter areas (trees) for the cows were available but were far away from the cows and located down a\nhill, across parts of two pastures and up another hill. Cow #5483 had a respiratory rate of 88 breaths per minute (normal\n10-30) and was exhibiting flaring of the nostrils. The dairy caretaker went into the enclosure to get her to stand up. She\nstood with her neck extended breathing heavily, nostrils flaring. Her respiratory rate at this time was 100 breaths per\nminute. The caretaker opened the gate and she along with the other cows went under the covered palpation stalls where\nthey had access to shade, food, and water. The temperature was 82 degrees with 63 percent humidity. A large animal\nveterinarian was contacted. He examined the cow at 3:45pm and diagnosed her with heat stress due to high humidity,\nbeing overweight and warm temperature. The access to shade appeared to improve her condition enough (respiratory\nrate 60, heart rate 84, and body temperature 101.2 according to records) that she was able to be returned to her pasture\nthat day.\nAnimals subjected to combinations of excessive temperature, humidity, and time, taking into consideration such factors as\nhealth status and body condition issues, can present a threat to an animal\u2019s health and well-being. The cows need to be\nhoused and handled in a manner to avoid causing overheating, stress, and unnecessary discomfort.\n*The IACUC meeting minutes from the March 18, 2021 meeting include a discussion about an adverse event that\noccurred on Feb. 4, 2021. The Principal Investigator did not report the event to the IACUC until February 18th. The\nIACUC conducted a review of the event. On Feb. 4, 2021 the Principal Investigator (PI) and lab staff on protocol 20-100\nused six Gottingen pigs in a study involving traumatic brain injuries. The first pig used died during the procedure and\nblood was noted on the intubation tube. The staff made positioning changes for the second pig who also died with \u201cmore\nblood\u201d noted. The PI team continued to troubleshoot and make changes to the study procedures. In total only two of the\nsix pigs used survived. At no point during the six procedures was the attending veterinarian notified of the adverse events\noccurring. The continued study manipulations and handling of the pigs after the initial unexpected death led to potentially\npreventable deaths and pain (surviving pigs). The two pigs that did survive exhibited abnormal neurological signs.\nFollowing anesthetic recovery, a veterinarian\u2019s assessment of these signs included ataxia (incoordination), weakness in\nall four limbs and mild/moderate mental depression. One pig was noted trembling. The veterinarian prescribed pain\nmedication for both pigs.\n**Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect by 7/15/21."
