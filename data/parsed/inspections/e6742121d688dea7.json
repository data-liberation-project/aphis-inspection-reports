He suspected it was\nbumped by one of the other goats and has been observing it. Because it is still limping continuously, it needs to be\nseen by the veterinarian.\nAn older white female pot belly pig has deeply crusted and flaking skin on her back from her neck to her rump. The\ncaretaker states it has gotten progressively worse since summer. This skin condition could lead to infection and is\nprobably uncomfortable. This animal needs to be seen by the veterinarian, so treatment can be initiated.\nTo be corrected by 12-17-17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the caretaker and the Bishop and his wife."
