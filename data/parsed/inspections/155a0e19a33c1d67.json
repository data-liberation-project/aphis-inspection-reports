A facility representative subsequently provided water and a large male hedgehog immediately began\ndrinking greedily and continued drinking without stopping for 90 seconds. Two other hedgehogs also drank greedily\nfor approximately 60 seconds each. Water must be provided as often as necessary to ensure the health and\ncomfort of the animals. Animals demonstrating extended drinking times when offered water can indicate the\namount, accessibility or frequency of watering is not sufficient for the animals contained in the enclosure.\nThe licensee corrected this non-compliance by removing 6 hedgehogs to another enclosure and providing ample\nwater sources in both enclosures.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the store manager."
