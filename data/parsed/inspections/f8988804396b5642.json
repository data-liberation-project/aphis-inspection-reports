This type of hair condition/ loss is not consistent with seasonal shedding. The\nattending veterinarian has not been consulted nor is there any recorded documentation about the coat or weight loss. The\nbody conditions, coat appearance and hair loss can be indicators of parasites, nutritional deficiencies, or other underlying\nmedical conditions.
