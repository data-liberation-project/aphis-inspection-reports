Only one side of the facility housed dogs. Located directly\nacross the walkway from the occupied dog enclosures were partially constructed enclosures which were\nunoccupied. There was an excessive amount of black shaving-like material on the unoccupied side of the facility\nincluding on the walkway of the building. According to the licensee the black shavings were from construction of the\nenclosures. Additional housing facility surfaces, including the windowsill, appeared to have an accumulation of\ndust/dirt. There were also some dust-filled cobwebs along the ceiling and the corners of the window. There were\nseveral items, not all used for the husbandry of the animals, inside the housing facility laying above the dog\nenclosures.\nThe floor of the walkway inside of another sheltered building, housing an adult dog and her puppy, had several\nsquare feet of exposed wooden sub-floor. Most of this portion of the floor was at the entrance of the facility; other\nparts of the floor had a tile down over the sub-floor. The floor also appeared to have some accumulation of gravel\nand dust on the floor.\nThe condition and site of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter to facilitate the required husbandry\npractices and to decrease the risk of disease and/or injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the housing\nfacilities are kept neat and free of accumulations of trash, waste material, junk and other discarded items at all\ntimes. To be corrected by: May 22, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
