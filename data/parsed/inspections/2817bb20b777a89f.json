      "narrative": "On 06/15/2025, 24 adult cynomolgus macaques housed indoors experienced prolonged, elevated temperatures for\napproximately six hours and 40 minutes. The temperature was measured and recorded by the automated environmental\nmonitoring system as remaining within the range of 29.6 and 33.2 degrees Celsius between the hours of 9:00am and\n3:40pm that day. Facility records indicate that a facilities staff member responded to an elevated temperature alarm from\nthe monitoring system for this non-human primate housing room, and noticed that the room had a quarantine sign on the\ndoor. The facility worker was aware that there were animals in the room and did not go inside or act to correct the\nunderlying cause because of the signage but also did not notify other personnel of the issue so that they could address\nthe problem. When husbandry staff noticed the issue later that day, they took action to bring down the temperature to\nacceptable levels. A veterinarian examined the animals in the room and found no signs of adverse effects on the animals.\nThe facility held training for facility staff and modified door signs as measures to prevent a recurrence.\nNon-human primates that are hot may experience discomfort, lethargy, or stress; those with medical problems or under\nstudy may be especially vulnerable to the effects of excessive heat. The registrant must ensure that ambient\ntemperatures in the facility do not fall below 7.2 degrees Celsius or rise above 29.5 degrees Celsius for more than four\nconsecutive hours when non-human primates are present. Ambient temperatures must be maintained at a level that\nensures the health and well-being of the species housed, as directed by the attending veterinarian, in accordance with\ngenerally accepted professional and husbandry practices.\nCORRECTED PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS INSPECTION ON 08/20/2025\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian and other facility representatives.\nn"
