Specifically, there were no inhalant anesthesia machines\nand no provisions for emergency resuscitation. During surgical procedures, the accepted standard of care is to have\nthe capability of providing supplemental oxygenation or anesthetic if needed, and to provide resuscitative measures\nif necessary. Failure to provide this equipment constitutes a lack of availability of appropriate facilities and\nequipment to ensure the veterinary care regulatory provisions. The facility may not perform any major operative\nprocedures without the appropriate facilities and equipment.\n******Correct before the next operative procedure.\n2) From the review of medical records, the extent of the attending veterinarian\u2019s involvement in examinations and\ndiagnoses is unclear for several animals, including #16JAD4, #1410806, and #1412203. While several records\ncontained physical examination and diagnostic notes from the veterinarians along with their signatures, these\nparticular records failed to indicate veterinarian involvement in physical examination and diagnoses. It appears at\ntimes this facility has inadequate veterinary personnel, and veterinary technicians may be the only ones directly\ninvolved in diagnosis and care of medical issues. There are two licensed veterinary technicians responsible for\napproximately 3000 animals. Although there is a full time attending veterinarian, along with a consulting veterinarian\nand a back-up small animal practitioner, availability is hampered by biosecurity procedures so that it may be difficult\nfor the veterinarians to address simultaneous health issues at the different locations where animals are housed.\nCorroborating evidence for lack of veterinary staff is evident from a video in which a staff member states that the\nveterinarian should not be called to examine an animal because of a biosecurity issue. Adequate personnel\nnumbers and availability are essential in order to provide appropriate veterinary care to all animals that may need it\nat the facility.\n*****Correct from this day, July 12, 2017, forward."
