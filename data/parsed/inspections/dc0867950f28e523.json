As the goat returned to the shelter, the gait was abnormal as he kicked the left hind limb out to shift\nweight. Once in the shelter, the goat dropped to his front knees and struggled to get in a sitting position. He ended up in\nan awkward position with his face directly against the back of the shelter. He made no attempt to turn around. The goat is\nexperiencing discomfort due to the condition of its hooves.\nThe licensee stated that the goat has a history of chronic hoof issues and is overdue for a hoof trim. The scheduled\nappointment with the veterinarian was canceled 2 weeks ago due to weather and rescheduled for the the end of next\nweek. Regular trimming and evaluation of the hooves by the veterinarian is important to prevent overgrowth and to\nminimize pain and discomfort.
