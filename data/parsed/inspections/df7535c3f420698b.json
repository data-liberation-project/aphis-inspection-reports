At this time the facility still does not have a perimeter fence that adequately fulfills the requirements\ndescribed in 3.127 (d). The purpose of the perimeter fence, as described in this subsection, is to prevent people and\nanimals from passing under or through the fence and entering the premises, and also to act as secondary\ncontainment, in the event that an exhibit animal should escape its enclosure. Additionally, the perimeter fence must\nbe at least three feet from the enclosure fence to prevent contact through the fencing. At the time of this inspection\nthe following problems were observed:\n- A gate in the perimeter fence, which serves as the parking exit, is left open and unattended throughout the day.\nWhereas the entrance gate is visible to the nearby office area, and employees are available to monitor and close\nthe gate if needed, this exit gate is more remote, and not easily monitored. The gate is just behind the primary\nenclosures for cheetahs and striped hyenas.\n- There are some areas of the perimeter fence, along the side of the hyena enclosure, near the neighboring\nproperty, where the fence is not quite 8 feet in height. One area measured only 71 inches.\n- In the \"Christmas\" hoof-stock enclosure the enclosure has been encircled with perimeter fencing, but where the\ngate enters the enclosure the perimeter fence and the enclosure fence come together, so there is not a three feet\nspace between perimeter and enclosure fencing. Also there were some areas in the \"Hill\" hoof-stock enclosure\nwhere the perimeter fencing and the enclosure fencing come very close together (less than three feet) due to terrain\nissues.\n- In the \"Vista\" enclosure which contains five nyala, there is no barrier in the front of the enclosure between the\nanimal enclosure fencing and an area where guests are lodged and relatively unattended. In the back of this\nenclosure there is old fencing behind the enclosure fencing that should serve as perimeter fencing, but does meet\nthe requirements because part of it is single strand wire that could allow people or animals to pass through, and it\ndoes not meet the height requirement.\nThese are examples of where the perimeter fence falls short of meeting expectations. Failure to provide an\nadequate perimeter fence could put the well-being of the animals at risk, due to the possibility of harmful\nunauthorized contact with people or animals, including exposure to animals that could introduce diseases, and also\ndue to the risk of inadequate containment in the event of an escape. The facility should continue with its plan to\ncomplete the perimeter fence and bring all sections into compliance.\nThis inspection was conducted on 9/19/18 and 9/25/18, with facility representatives.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on 9/25/18."
