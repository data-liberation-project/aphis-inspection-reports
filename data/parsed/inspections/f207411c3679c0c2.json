The licensee advised that the puppy had not been\nacting right for the past day or two and he had self treated diarrhea 1-2 days prior, however the puppy was not\ngetting better so he tried to give it honey this morning in case it was hypoglycemic. The veterinarian had not been\ncontacted for proper diagnosis or treatment options with the symptoms getting worse over the past few days. By the\nend of the inspection the puppy had expired.\nIt is important that the veterinarian is contacted immediately when an illness is observed and treatments that are\nsuggested by a veterinarian are not working. Timely consultation with a veterinarian can increase the chances of\nsurvival and decrease time an animal can be in discomfort or pain from an injury or illness. Proper diagnosis and\ntreatment of illnesses early in their observation can increase the chances of a treatable condition being resolved\nand the animal surviving.\nThe licensee must contact a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and/or treatment options as soon as any health issues\nare observed.\nTo correct by: This day forward.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee."
