After the cleaning was\nperformed, the staff employee failed to release two of the bats back into the colony room from the temporary caging they\nwere placed in for cleaning. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) number 502 Fruit Bat Husbandry states that the\nstaff will, \u201cvisually inspect each cage and confirm there are no bats present, then remove green tag and lock cage closed\u201d.\nThe staff member responsible for releasing the bats opened the doors, let the bats fly out, but did not confirm all the\ncages were empty prior to removing the green tag (which indicates the cage is now empty). It is assumed that the\nemployee did not follow the remainder of the SOP which states, \u201cinspect all carts, racks, wheels, and cages prior to\nremoving from housing room. Inspect again once in anteroom. Spray cages, racks, and wheels with approved\ndisinfectant and transport to dirty cage wash.\u201d If followed, the SOP seems to provide ample opportunity to recognize that\nthe two animals had not been released. As stated in the University's response, the two bats were found dead by\nUniversity staff, on November 23rd, still within the temporary holding cage in the storage room, and their death was the\ndirect result of \"exposure to 180 degree water\" within the cage wash. The staff employee\u2019s failure to follow the prescribed\nSOP for handling these animals when the colony room is cleaned resulted in their unnecessary suffering and death.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThis incident was self-reported by the University on November 28th,2022, a full investigation of the incident was\nperformed and the Office of Laboratory Animal Care has initiated the process for termination of the responsible employee.\nCorrected by the time of inspection\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nKATHARINE FRANK, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
