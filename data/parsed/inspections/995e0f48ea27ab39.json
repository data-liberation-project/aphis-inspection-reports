This exception to the standards\nof the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) was not acknowledged as an exception in the protocol nor was it attached to the\nfacility's 2014 Annual Report. The Principal Investigator (PI) stated within the protocol that there were \"No\nexceptions\" to the standards and regulations promulgated under the AWA for the care and use of warm-blooded\nanimals. According to the AWA, animals such as pigs must be fed at least once a day. The registrant must ensure\nthat exceptions to the standards and regulations of the AWA are justified by the PI, approved by the IACUC, and\nincluded with the Annual Report so the Administrator can ensure that minimal standards not being met are\nscientifically justified.
