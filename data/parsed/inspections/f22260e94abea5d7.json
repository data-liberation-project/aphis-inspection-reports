      "narrative": "The following dogs are in need of veterinary care:\n* One white colored adult Schnauzer ( collar number 23), one fawn and white colored adult female Italian\nGreyhound ( tattoo number 135), one blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound ( tattoo number 139) and one\nred colored adult male Dachshund ( No identification) have an accumulation of dark brown material coating the\nentire surface of the upper cheek teeth. There was a creamy white discharge along the gum line. The gum line is\nred and swollen and has receded away from the upper cheek teeth. These signs are consistent with the presence\nof dental disease. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful. It can\nimpact the ability of the dog to eat, affecting the health and well-being of the dog. Dental disease can be painful,\nlead to a decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth.\n* The hind limbs of one blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound (tattoo number 139) appeared abnormal.\nWhile standing and in motion, the animal did not extend its knee joint normally, if at all. The dog appeared to hop\naround on its hind limbs with the knee joint at an approximate 90 degree angle. When asked, the licensee stated\nthat she was unaware any dogs in the enclosure had any issues. When this dog was brought to her attention by the\nVMO, the licensee stated (cid:28)it(cid:25)s probably luxated patellas(cid:29). The VMO asked the licensee again if this dog has been\nevaluated by a veterinarian for the condition, and she responded (cid:28)No(cid:29). Abnormal limb conformations and abnormal\nmobility can be indicators of disease and often pain. These conditions can result from numerous causes including\nboth infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and\ntreatment can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.\n* The eyes of one blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound (tattoo number 436) appeared abnormal.\nApproximately half of the iris, in both the right and left eyes, have a milky-white, thickened opaque area.\nAdditionally, the sclera of both eyes appeared abnormally red. When asked, the licensee stated this animal has not\nbeen evaluated by a veterinarian. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies,\ninjury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing. Furthermore, not having clear vision\ncan cause discomfort affecting the health and well-being of the dog and has the potential for injury.\n* One red colored adult male Dachshund (no identification) sustained injuries to its left ear and received no\ntreatment. According to the licensee, approximately two weeks ago, she put this male dog into an enclosure with\nanother male dog. This male dog sustained several bite wounds to the left ear and the licensee separated the two\ndogs. The licensee did not contact her veterinarian regarding the wounds and the animal received no treatment.\nInjuries that are not treated appropriately maybe painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, and other\nveterinary care problems.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 20, 2015, to obtain\naccurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation\nmust be provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all\ndiagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed\nalong with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when\nthe medication is administered to the animals.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and\nthe need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate\nveterinary care, as prescribed by the attending veterinarian. The program for providing adequate veterinary care\nshall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\n**************************************************\n* One white colored adult Schnauzer ( collar number 23) has matted hair on the abdomen and both back legs,\ncovering approximately 30 percent of the body. The hair was heavily clumped and corded and to the point that the\nskin could be visualized. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture affecting the\nskin. It can foster skin infections and affect the animal's mobility. Matted hair does not maintain the same insulating\nqualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for\ncoat maintenance for the health and welfare of the dog. The dog was groomed during the inspection."
