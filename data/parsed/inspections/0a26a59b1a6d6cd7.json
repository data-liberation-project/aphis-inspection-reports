Necropsy results indicated the cause of death for each gazelle was predation by an unknown animal.\nFacility representatives stated the predator likely had been a wild coyote, based on necropsy findings and neighborhood\ncoyote sightings. At the time of the inspection, there were no weaknesses identified in the perimeter fence to indicate\nwhere and how the predator could have entered the facility grounds.\nEnclosures with structural weakness increase the risk of animal escape or entry of unwanted predators that can harm the\nanimals. All facilities must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury,\nincluding restricting other animals from entering that may cause harm, and to properly contain them. This was corrected\nby the time of the inspection, and must remain corrected from this day, September 6, 2024, forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
