      "narrative": "Two guinea pigs, # 27604 and # 27675, had pink cards noting a veterinary care issue on their enclosures. Upon\ninspection, it was observed that each animal had a large lesion measuring approximately one inch wide and 1/2\ninch in height over the shoulder blade area. The lesions were wet, with red, hairless tissue exposed. According to\nstaff, the lesions had resulted as a serious reaction to an adjuvant injection given as part of a study. Upon reviewing\nthe corresponding Veterinary Services Report for each animal, and discussing the matter with the attending\nveterinarian, it was found that although the lesions were first observed on 1/25/16, the attending veterinarian had\nnot been consulted until the day of inspection (1/28/16). The attending veterinarian was on site at the time of\ninspection, and treated the animals. Minutes from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee highlighted a\nsimilar incident - failure to notify the attending veterinarian of an animal requiring veterinary care - in June, 2015. It\nwas suggested at that time that further training of staff should be provided on this issue.\nAnimals should be observed on a daily basis, and medical problems should be promptly communicated to the\nattending veterinarian, so that appropriate treatment, or other measures to relieve pain and distress, can commence\nin a timely manner. Failure to consult the attending veterinarian could result in unnecessary animal suffering. The\nfacility should take steps to ensure appropriate and timely observation and communication.\nTo be corrected from this time forward.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representatives."
