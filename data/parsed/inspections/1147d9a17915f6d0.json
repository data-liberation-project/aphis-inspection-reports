      "narrative": "On 10/9/18 the transporter accepted 73 rhesus macaque primates for transport. The shipment originated in Oregon,\nand 44 animals were to be delivered to Maryland, with 29 going on to New Jersey. Upon arrival in New Jersey on\n10/11/18 (around 8:30 PM local time, according to receiving staff), one animal, ID number 34597, was found to be\ndown and unresponsive in the shipping crate, and subsequently died following treatment efforts overnight. The\nveterinarian who treated the animal documented the primary diagnosis as dehydration.\nUpon reviewing the \u201cAnimal Health Observation Log\u201d that the drivers complete during the trip the following notation\nwas observed on 10/11/18 at 7:48 AM to 8:11 AM Pacific Time: \u201cFeed, Water by JKL \u2013 All Alert, Active\u201d. The next\nnotation for the 29 animals continuing to NJ was made upon their arrival there, at 6:30 PM Pacific Time, and states:\n\u201cDelivered Cargo\u201d. During the lapse of approximately 10.5 hours there is no record of an observation of the animals,\nand it was during this time period that the animal with ID # 34597, collapsed and became unresponsive.\nThe transporter must observe the nonhuman primates while in transit at least once every four hours. They must be\nable to determine whether any of the animals are in obvious physical distress, and obtain appropriate veterinary\ncare. Failure to adequately observe and assess animals while in transit can result in unnecessary suffering and\ndeath. The transporter must ensure that nonhuman primates are adequately observed at least once every four\nhours while in transit, from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the company representative for JKL Secure Freight."
