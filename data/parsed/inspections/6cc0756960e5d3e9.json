      "narrative": "In June of 2018 the facility self-reported an incident to USDA. The incident involved a dog recovering from\nanesthesia for a surgical procedure approved by the IACUC. The principal investigator\u2019s laboratory staff that was\nmonitoring the dog\u2019s recovery communicated with the attending veterinarian about some concerns they had. The\nlab staff confirmed with the attending veterinarian by email that they would contact the on-call veterinarian if any\ncomplications occurred overnight as the animal continued to recover. When complications did arise, the lab staff\nfailed to contact the on-call veterinarian. The laboratory staff attempted medical interventions, but the dog did not\nsurvive. At this time the lab staff contacted the on-call veterinarian to tell them what happened.The Director of the\nDivision of Comparative Medicine confirmed that failure to communicate the complications with the veterinarian\nviolated the research facility\u2019s policy. The director and attending veterinarian also stated that if the complications\nhad been communicated to a veterinarian earlier, then the veterinarian would have suggested other interventions\nthan what the lab staff provided. The facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care\nincluding the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the\navailability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Failure to do so can jeopardize the welfare of animals. This\nitem has been corrected. The IACUC promptly investigated this incident and took corrective actions to prevent\nfuture occurrences.\nThis was a focused inspection limited to information pertaining to the self-reported incident.\nThis inspection on Jun 27, 2018 and exit interview on July 2, 2018 were conducted with facility representatives."
