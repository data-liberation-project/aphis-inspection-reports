      "narrative": "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) discussed three incidents that involved Principal\nInvestigators (PIs) carrying out activities that did not conform to their approved protocols. At the time of this\ninspection, these incidents were reviewed by USDA / APHIS / Animal Care inspectors, and the following was\ndetermined:\n1.) On protocol AN121408-01A involving swine, there was a procedure involving steam ablation of the gallbladder.\nThe approved protocol called for four puffs of steam to be administered at one centimeter intervals. Animal number\n6727 underwent this procedure on 7/9/16, but the medical records show that 200 puffs of steam were administered,\nwhich far exceeds the size of the gallbladder. The animal stopped eating, received appropriate supportive veterinary\ncare, and was subsequently euthanized on 7/13/16. Necropsy showed that the stomach had been perforated.\n2.) On 10/16/16 a pig, number 6737, on protocol AN136364-02 was taken for CT scan imaging under anesthesia,\nas per the approved protocol. The animal died while being returned to its enclosure following the procedure. The\nPI's team disposed of the carcass prior to finding out whether the veterinary staff wanted to carry out a necropsy,\nwhich could have helped to determine the cause of death. The IACUC reviewed this incident and counseled the PI.\nAt the time of this inspection a further review revealed that the PI's team did not adhere to the approved protocol.\nThe protocol called for one contrast material to be used, but on this animal both the conventional contrast material\nand the test material were given, for a total of three doses. This may have prolonged the time that the animal was\nunder anesthesia, as the approved protocol stated that anesthesia would be approximately from one to three hours,\nbut this animal died after four and a half hours of anesthesia. The IACUC was not fully informed by the PI regarding\nthe deviation from the protocol that may have contributed to the animal's death.\n3.) On protocol AN135213-01C involving voles, the PI had requested an amendment to his protocol to add a new\nprocedure - a cranial surgery. The PI proceeded to do this surgery on two animals on 4/2/17, prior to IACUC\napproval. The small incisions on the head did not heal as expected, and the animals were euthanized once the\nunapproved activity was discovered by the veterinary staff.\nFailure to adhere to the IACUC approved protocol can have a serious animal welfare impact, as evidenced here in\nthese cases. Significant changes cannot be made to the study protocol without IACUC approval. The Principal\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that the procedures involving animals adhere to their approved protocols,\nin order to provide adequate oversight of the welfare of the animals on study. The IACUC must reinforce the\nimportance of strictly adhering to approved protocols; Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that all\nmembers of their teams strictly adhere to procedures outlined in IACUC approved protocols. The IACUC must\nprovide adequate oversight of animal activities in order to safeguard the welfare of animals on study.\nThis inspection was conducted at all UCSF sites with covered species on 7/26/17 and 7/27/17, and an exit interview\nwith the inspectors and the facility representatives occurred on 7/27/17.\nAdditional Inspectors\nFrank Katharine, Veterinary Medical Officer\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
