The veterinary plan in the record involved stressing the importance of getting her\ncataract surgery scheduled soon with an external specialist; however, the facility did not take initial steps to schedule the\nprocedure. On 9/28/23, the medical record stated that \u201cSushi\u201d was slow to eat and the plan again stressed the importance\nof scheduling cataract surgery. Starting on 10/11/23, \u201cSushi\u201d began variably refusing food. By 10/15/23 and throughout\nthe 3-day USDA inspection, she was completely refusing food, due to eye pain, per the medical records. At the time of\ninspection, cataract surgery still has not been scheduled.\n-On 9/11/23, the medical records for multiple animals state that the veterinarian is unable to perform necessary\ndiagnostics as the facility no longer has access to an ultrasound, radiography, or endoscopy. It is also noted that there is\nno access to a functioning anesthesia machine for emergencies.\n- On 10/10/23 and 10/12/23, in the medical records for \u201cOnyx\u201d, a male bottlenose dolphin, the attending veterinarian\nstates she needs to perform an ultrasound exam but there is no ultrasound available.\n- On 10/11/23, in the medical records for \u201cRingo\u201d and \u201cCayman\u201d, two male bottlenose dolphins, the veterinarian states she\nneeds to perform radiographs or a CT scan to confirm that they have no active infection but no imaging was available.\n- On 7/5/2023, and again on 10/11/23, the AV notes that she does not have access to a functioning gastroscope, which\nshe calls essential for adequate diagnostics and treatment of the animals at the facility.\n- The attending veterinarian has been unable to perform a full annual physical exam, which includes weights, on the three\nadult manatees held at the facility in more than 5 years, because the facility has not provided scales that can be used in\nthese enclosures.\nFailure to ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority over the veterinary care, including prevention,\ndiagnostics, and treatment of the animals, can lead to unnecessary stress, discomfort, and suffering of the animals.
