The licensee stated that an additional veterinarian\nhad performed diagnostics on the alpaca and that none of the treatments had improved her condition.

The licensee stated that the\nrabbit had last received a hair cut in August 2022 and that she would not be trimming him again soon due to the winter\ntemperatures. The AV stated that he disapproved of the frequency of the grooming and that the rabbit required more\nfrequent grooming.\nAn adult male wolf with a history of chronic diarrhea has not been re-evaluated by the AV. There were multiple areas of\nloose bowel movements within the wolf enclosure at the time of the inspection. The licensee stated that the wolf had been\nbrought to the AV for monthly preventatives and been given supplements, but they had not improved his condition.
