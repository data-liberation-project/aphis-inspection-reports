The facility did not identify the veterinary issues\nprior to the inspection.\nA white female poochon Emma (microchip number 7192) approximately 4 years old, has severe gum recession on the\nlower jaw and two loose bottom teeth. While performing the physical examination of the dog the inspector observed\nmovement in the teeth when minimum pressure was applied on the bottom gum. There is excessive brown/black tarter\nbuildup at the base of the teeth near the gumline. The dog reacted to the examination of the mouth by pulling its head\naway from the inspector when touched and whelping.\nA grey female shih-poo named Pepsi (microchip number 2413) approximately 2.5 years old, has severe gum recession on\nthe lower jaw. While performing the physical examination of the dog the inspector observed movement in the front lower\nteeth when minimal pressure was applied to the gum. The teeth also had brown/black tarter buildup at the base near the\ngumline. The front lower teeth are loose, the dog did not react to examination of the mouth.\nFailure to conduct adequate daily observations to assess the health and well-being of the dogs with direct and frequent\ncommunication to the attending veterinarian, can delay treatment leading to the condition getting worse and delays in\nhealing.\nThe facility took both dogs to the veterinary clinic for evaluation following the inspection.\nCorrect by ensuring that the animal listed above, and the condition of the animal are reported to the attending veterinarian\nso that the animals can be properly examined, diagnosed, and treated. Additionally, ensure that daily observation of\nanimals is adequate to identify any signs of poor health. Ensure that there is accurate and timely communication of\nproblems of animal health, behavior, and well-being conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct by 5:00 PM, 11-\nFeburary-2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with The Facility Representative.\nn"
