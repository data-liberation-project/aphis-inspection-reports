Window frames have reddish\ndust, possible from rust. Some repairs have been initiated, including temporary measures to ensure that the floor is\nnot peeling, and is impervious to moisture. Further repairs have been planned, but not yet carried out.\nThe ceiling above the enclosure in the small yard has peeling paint, and the wood appears to be deteriorating, and\nthis could allow particles to fall into the enclosure. An estimate for making these repairs has been obtained from a\ncontractor, and repair planning is in progress.\nAll surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces can\nimpede cleaning, create hazards, and otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.\nRepeat citation, previosuly cited in 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. .\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
