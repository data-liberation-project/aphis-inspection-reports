In a\nneighboring enclosure, a female chocolate lab was intermittently shivering in her plastic shelter. The facility representative\nstated that this dog is timid and is shaking due to the inspector's presence. The inspector took steps back from the shelter\nand the dog left the shelter, walked to the water bowl and back into the shelter. She immediately laid back down with her\nfeet tucked into the straw. All of the adult dogs have to walk across a wet floor to drink water and eat their food. There are\nshallow pools of water and organic material in several enclosures. The facility representative stated at the time of\ninspection, they had cleaned and sanitized two weeks ago but the floors don't dry.\nThe facility's veterinarian stated in a phone call that they approve the short haired dogs living outside as long as extra\nbedding and extra food is provided. The vet also suggested the facility take the female lab's temperature to make sure\nshe was healthy enough to be outdoors. Wet flooring mixed with organic materials may cause disease hazards and cause\nthe dogs to become wet or soiled and hinder their ability to stay warm in cold weather.\nStanding water must be removed from the primary enclosure and animals in other primary enclosures must be protected\nfrom being contaminated with water and other wastes.
