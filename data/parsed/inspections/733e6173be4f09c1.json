A long term and effective method of providing the bear access to a den at all times must be established.\n***The metal pipe construction of the bear den does not possess sufficient insulating properties for this tropical\nspecies and the lack of bedding exacerbates this issue. Bedding provides a soft substrate, as well as insulation, and\nis particularly important for bears because of their motivation to build nests and line dens. Failure to provide an\nappropriately furnished den may result in frustration or unmotivated behavior, and an inability to behaviorally\nthermoregulate. The den construction remains unchanged but the bear has been provided with straw to facilitate\nnesting behavior. A more appropriate den is needed for the bear's health and comfort. NOTE: The bear is\nscheduled to be moved to a new facility.\n***The fallow deer enclosure has a two-sided shelter that cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation. In\naddition, there are holes and sharp edges in the shelter divider.\n***The mouflon shelter has only two sides, and cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation. In addition, the\nshelter has gaps and loose boards.Failure to protect animals from detrimental weather conditions can negatively\nimpact their health and ability to fight disease. Appropriately constructed shelters, with a minimum of 3-sides, must\nbe provided.\nNOTE: The cougar has been moved to a new licensed facility.\nThis is a focused inspection to assess the correction of the Direct NCIs noted on the inspection report dated\n10-12-2016.\nThe exit briefing was conducted with the owners.\nThis is an electronic copy of the Microsoft Word inspection report dated 28 October 2016."
