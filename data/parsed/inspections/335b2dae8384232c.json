Since acquiring, the attending\nveterinarian has not been contacted to allow an evaluation of the injury and recommended treatment options. Upon\ninspection today, the rabbit had copious amounts of discolored, mucoid ocular discharge draining from the left eye.\nThe build-up surrounding the eye appeared hardened, and was yellow-to-green in color, with the underlying skin\nmoderately inflamed and reddened. The eye itself was clouded and very inflamed, making it difficult to visualize.\nEye injuries can be painful and distressful to the animal, as well as progress to infection if not treated appropriately.\nThe attending veterinarian shall evaluate this animal to ensure the injury is diagnosed and treated appropriately.\nCorrect by having this rabbit examined by a licensed veterinarian(s) for diagnosis and treatment no later than close\nof business October 9, 2019."
