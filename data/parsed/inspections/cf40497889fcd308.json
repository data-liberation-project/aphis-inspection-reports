The pain medication\nwould allow for data collection to take place over the next couple of days, after which the voles would be humanely\neuthanized. At the end of the surgical procedure, laboratory personnel discovered that there was an insufficient amount of\npain medication on hand. The technician consulted with the primary investigator and was directed to humanely euthanize\nthe voles while under anesthesia due to concerns about post operative pain. There was no attempt to contact the\nAttending Veterinarian for the facility.\nLaboratory personnel failed to assure that appropriate pain medication was available before starting the surgical\nprocedure, and further failed to consider contacting the Attending Veterinarian to request support or guidance. Inadequate\nor incomplete training of laboratory personnel can have a significant impact on the health and welfare of research\nanimals. The facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care are fully trained and qualified to perform their\nduties.\nCorrect from 2 August 2024 onward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nn"
