When she breaths,\nthere are sounds of nasal congestion. The cat has a rough coat and a quiet demeanor, but was easily stressed/fractious\nwhen handled. There is an approximately 1-centimeter wide patch of reddish crust on the surface of the left eyeball,\naround which the surface of the eye is grey and cloudy. There are crusts and some drool around the cat's mouth, but the\ncat\u2019s mouth was unable to be opened during the inspection because the cat resisted handling and was very reactive when\nits face was touched; the Principle Investigator (who is also the IACUC chairperson) stated that the cat has stomatitis\n(inflammation in the mouth). The cat\u2019s medical records show that the clinical veterinarian treated the cat with long-acting\nmedications for stomatitis on May 6, 2024 but the cat has not received any follow up evaluations or treatments since that\ntime.\nUpon the USDA inspector\u2019s recommendation, the cat was examined by the AV the evening of May 28, 2024 and the AV\nnoted that the cat did not appear to be improving much in response to the May 6 stomatitis treatment. The AV also stated\nthat the growth on surface of the eye had not been noted in the weeks prior and had likely taken at least 3-5 days to form.\nWhen asked about the hydration status of the cat, the AV stated that the hydration status was not optimal. Neither the AV\nnor the clinical veterinarian (who was out of town) had not been informed about the cat\u2019s current poor state or its eye\ncondition prior to the USDA inspection. The cat received treatment on 5/28/24.\nDaily observation of animals and communication with the AV regarding animal health and behavior issues is important for\nthe prompt identification and treatment of injuries, illnesses, and other problems in animals. Without adequate daily\nobservation by appropriately trained staff, and prompt communication with the AV, animals may suffer unnecessarily from\npain, stress, or worsening of their condition. Cats with stomatitis and conditions affecting the surface of the eye may\nexperience significant pain and may be reluctant to eat or drink, resulting in dehydration or other systemic problems.\nCorrect by 5/29/24 by ensuring that all animals are observed on a daily basis to assess their health and well-being, and\nthat a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is in place so that timely and accurate information on problems of\nanimal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV."
