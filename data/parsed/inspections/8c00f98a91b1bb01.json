      "narrative": "Upon inspection, two main issues were identified regarding handling that included insufficient control of animals during\npublic interactions and lack of adequate public barriers.\nDuring the public interaction with the servals and the small-clawed otter, there was insufficient direct control of the\nanimals:\n\u2022 During inspection, the female otter appeared hyperactive, incessantly moving/playing in her enclosure while constantly\nvocalizing. Furthermore, when the licensee entered the enclosure with a mask on, the otter attempted to take the mask\nand bit the licensee on the left forearm causing her to bleed from two significant puncture wounds. This otter\ndemonstrated her potential to be dangerous. Yet, during public interaction, the otter, unrestrained, is allowed free roam\nand complete contact with patrons seated on a bench or on the floor in the enclosure. Per the licensee, the otter is\nallowed to climb up the patrons, reaching past their shoulders to their heads. There is no direct control of this otter during\nbroad contact interactions as she is not physically restrained with a leash or harness and she is not trained for recall.\n\u2022 The public is allowed to go into the servals\u2019 primary enclosure, accompanied by the licensee, while both servals are\nunrestrained. Neither animal has a harness or leash on, and they are not trained for recall. The patrons seated on a\nbench are allowed to freely touch/interact with the male serval roaming around. Servals have the potential to be\ndangerous given that they are wild predatory cats with sharp teeth and a significant bite force.\nGiven the potentially dangerous nature of these animals there is a high risk of injury to the public in the way the\ninteractions are being conducted with insufficient direct control.\nTwo areas were found to have insufficient public barriers:\n\u2022 There was no public barrier outside the servals\u2019 primary enclosure and the wire that made up the enclosure had gaps\nlarge enough to allow a paw or a small hand to go through.\n\u2022 Large tree trunk logs were placed in front of three enclosures containing rabies vector species. One enclosure held three\nred foxes, another had four racoons, and finally, the last one contained an artic fox. The large tree trunk logs were placed\napproximately 3-4 feet away from the enclosures at a height of approximately 18-20 inches but with significant breaks in\nbetween the logs, where a patron could easily walk between them and gain access to the wire of the primary enclosures.\nThere was insufficient control of the animals during the public interactions and insufficient public barriers in place that did\nnot provide a safe environment for the public or the animals. These interactions and lack of public barriers could result in\nnot only a member of the public becoming injured, but potentially also the animal. Handling of the animals during public\nexhibition must be done in a manner so there is minimal risk to the animal and the public. Proper handling includes\nhaving sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general viewing public to assure the safety of the\nanimals and the public. Adequate control of the animals during public interactions and appropriate public barriers must be\nprovided.\nCORRECT BY 02/16/2022"
