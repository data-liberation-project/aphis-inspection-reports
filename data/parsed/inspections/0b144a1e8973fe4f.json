This PACS employee followed the established protocol and\ncontacted the Veterinary Technician (supervisor) who supervises the animals cared for by the PACS staff. The\nsupervisor directed the employee to give oral pain medication to the horse. At approximately 5:30 PM, the\nsupervisor called another Veterinary Technician Instructor (VTI) to go to the facility and assist the PACS employee.\nThe supervisor also called the large animal Veterinarian on call for emergency care around this same time. The\nVeterinarian advised the supervisor to contact a large animal veterinary clinic locally as he was caring for client\nanimals and would not be able to respond until at least 9:00 PM. The VTI did arrive to assist the employee at\napproximately 6:20 PM and called the supervisor to ask if they should call the local large animal veterinary clinic as\nSweetie Pye was not improving. The supervisor did not contact the local large animal veterinary clinic. The\nsupervisor, who had arrived at the facility around 8:15 PM, contacted the large animal Veterinarian at 9:00 PM to let\nhim know the horse had died.\nThe supervisor did not follow the facility's program for emergency veterinary care even after being advised by the on\ncall veteirnarian to contact the local large animal veterinary clinic. This horse did not receive appropriate and timely\ncare to address an emergency veterinary condition which caused unrelieved pain and distress resulting in death.\nThe facility's program for providing adequate veterinary care for the animals must include the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency care.\nTo be corrected immediately.\nAccompanied on the inspection conducted on 4/11/2014 by the IACUC Chair. Exit briefing conducted with IACUC\nChair on 5/5/2014."
