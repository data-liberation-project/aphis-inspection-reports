This\nenclosure provided a total of 623.5 square inches of floor space, giving each of the 15 guinea pigs 41.6 square\ninches of floor space per animal. Guinea pigs weighing less than 350 grams are required to have at least 60 square\ninches of floor space. The enclosure is only large enough to house 10 of the 15 guinea pigs. Once APHIS officials\nidentified the number of guinea pigs housed in the enclosure, the facility escort moved 5 of the guinea pigs to a new\nenclosure. Guinea pigs must be housed in primary enclosures that provide at least the required floor space for their\ncomfort and well-being. Correct from this day forward."
