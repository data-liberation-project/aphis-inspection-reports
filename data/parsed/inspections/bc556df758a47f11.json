When\nthe licensee lifted the hedgehog\u2019s upper lip, there was swelling present along the gums of the right side of the\nmouth. The licensee stated that she had not noticed this problem prior to the inspection and the animal had not\nbeen seen by a veterinarian recently.\nThe licensee must have this hedgehog examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 4, 2016, to obtain\naccurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation\nmust be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary\ndiagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any\nmedications prescribed along with the dosing instructions. The licensee must provide documentation of entries on a\nlog and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of the animal\nat that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the\nneed for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are observed daily and provided with\nadequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The\nprogram for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases and injuries."
