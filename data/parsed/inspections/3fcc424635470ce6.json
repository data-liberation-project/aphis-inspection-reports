Multiple entries were also noted to be blank or \u201cNA\u201d with a passing assessment. In addition, during an\nobserved acclimation training session, an inspector observed two employees fail to follow the standard operating\nprocedure, SOP ACU-006, noted within the \u201cHolding, Management and Acclimation Protocol for the Use of Macaque\nMonkeys\u201d, ACUM22-02. During a session, one employee attempted to return an animal, unassisted by the additional\nhandler, to its enclosure with only one catch pole attached to the animal\u2019s collar. This resulted in the animal climbing on\nand between two banks of cages, resulting in increased potential for injury as the second handler attempted to pole catch\nthe animal to assist the return to its enclosure. The SOP states that \u201cboth handlers will attach to the collar, and slowly\nremove the animal from the chair leading animal to the floor\u201d then \u201cboth handlers will simultaneously lift poles and guide\nthe animal towards the inside of its cage\u201d. These observations and the documented failure to follow the facility\u2019s\nguidelines and SOP\u2019s for acclimation, would be considered a significant change in ongoing activity that has not been\nsubmitted to the IACUC for review and approval.\nCorrect by 8/7/23"
