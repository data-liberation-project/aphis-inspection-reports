The 18 year old llama had arrived at the facility on 9/24/13 and weighed 292\npounds at that time, according to medical records. No other weights were recorded until the llama was used for a\nblood collection on 12/19/14, at which time theweight was recorded at 217 lbs. There were no notations made in the\nmedical record at that time about the weight loss\nor body condition, and no other treatment or intervention prior to the death, which was described as unexpected.\nThere is another llama on site currently on this same protocol. This animal arrived on 7/16/12 and weighed 373 lbs.\nThe current weight on this animal is 295 lbs, with a body condition score recorded as of 2 out of 5. Weights and\nbody\ncondition evaluations had not previously been conducted on a regular basis on these animals. The facility indicates\nthat they have now begun monthly physical exams on these animals.\nThe facility should use appropriate means to evaluate the health status of the animals on a regular basis, and\ninvestigate possible health concerns, such as substantial weight loss, in an appropriate and timely manner, in order\nto safeguard the health and well-being of the animals.\nAnother Veterinary Care issue was cited under this same section on the last inspection on 6/17/2014, and was to\nhae been corrected at the time of inspection.\nThis was a focused inspection on areas previously identified on inspection reports and facility self-reporting.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
