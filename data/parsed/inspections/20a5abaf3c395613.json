At SFO the passenger became incapacitated, and was not allowed to board the connecting flight. At that\npoint the cat was tagged as luggage (Tag # 401 6394 548), and went to the cargo facility, around 5:30 PM.\nSubsequently, after some confusion about whether the owner would be collecting the cat from the cargo office, cat\nwas shipped in cargo on a United flight the next day at 10:30 AM to SEA, where it was reunited with the owner.\nThe Animal Welfare Act regulations require that carriers not accept dogs and cats for transport unless feeding and\nwatering instructions are obtained in writing from the person shipping the animal. In this instance no feeding and\nwatering instructions could be obtained. In this event, per 3.13(f), the carrier must continue to provide proper care,\nfeeding, and housing to the dog or cat, and maintain the dog or cat in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional and husbandry practices for the time that the animal remains in the carrier(cid:25)s possession, during efforts\nto contact the owner.\nFeeding requirements for an adult cat are at minimum every 24 hours per the regulations, but without instructions,\nand without knowing when an animal was last offered food and water the airline should assume that the animal may\nneed food and water, and those should be supplied to the animal in order to safeguard its well-being. This cat was\nnot offered food, and it had been well over 24 hours since the animal began the trip from Japan by the time the\nanimal arrived at SEA.\nThe carrier should develop clear policies on how they handle these cases so as to ensure proper care. The carrier\nshould be equipped with supplies so as to be able to provide proper husbandry in cases where the kenneling\nservice is not used.\nAdditionally, 3.13(f) requires that efforts to contact the owner be documented, and this information should be\nobviously apparent to any staff members responsible for caring for the animal. This information was not immediately\navailable, and created confusion about the status of the animal for incoming AM staff. Such confusion, combined\nwith the absence of feeding and watering instructions, could endanger the animal's welfare. Staff should ensure\ndocumentation and communication to help safeguard the welfare of the animals.\nTo be corrected immediately.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with United SFO cargo facility management staff on 4/14/14."
