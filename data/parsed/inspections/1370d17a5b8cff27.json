The species is one that that occurs on campus and in nearby areas and was\ncaptured at a nearby grove; it was in an acclimation phase following capture, without having been used in any\nexperiments. After a thorough search of the primary enclosure and items within it and the housing room, anteroom and\nentire animal holding facility (including within ceiling and air duct spaces), it was determined that the bat likely escaped\nthrough a very small gap in the primary enclosure at the point where the tray bottom was located, which staff initially\ndeemed too small to allow escape. The gap has since been eliminated. The bat might then have escaped beneath the\nanteroom and main facility doors, which have since been modified to close any potential gap sites.\nThe registrant must ensure that enclosures and housing facilities are constructed of such material and of such strength as\nappropriate for the animals involved; they must be sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury\nand to contain the animals.\nCORRECTED BEFORE THE TIME OF INSPECTION.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with an IACUC representative.\nEnd Section"
