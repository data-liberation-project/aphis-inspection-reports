The chain and lock that secures the bottom of the gate is on the ground. The licensee stated the lock was\nbroken. The gate is hung with post pins pointing up. This manner of hanging the gate may allow the gate to be lifted\noff the hinges by the hippo. The space between the bars of the gate is large enough that the hippo may be able to\nreach thru the gate and lift it up and off the hinges. The hippo has grown considerably over the last few years and\nthere is now concern that the height of the gate may allow the hippo to reach over the gate. One piece of hot wire\nwas on the ground by the gate. Hot wire on the ground would cause the hot wire system to fail. The gate must be\nreplaced with a gate that has the structural strength to contain an animal such as a hippo. It must also be properly\nhung and secured with locks and chains at all times to prevent escape. Electric fencing along all sides of the\nenclosure must be checked daily and with sufficient frequency to ensure it is functioning properly and repairs made\nimmediately. A hippo is a strong, dangerous animal and the enclosure must be maintained at all times in good\nrepair to prevent escape or injury.\nNote : The hot wire was corrected at time of the inspection.\nChain and lock to be placed on bottom of gate.
