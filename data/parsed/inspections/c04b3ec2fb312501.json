      "narrative": "There were dry, whitish crusts almost completely covering the insides of both ears of the brown rabbit named\nCrookneck. Crusting was also present on the outside base of the rabbit's left ear. Crookneck also had a small\namount of white, thick discharge at the inside corner of his right eye. His left eye was mostly held shut with some\nwet matting present around the eye. It was explained that the eye discharge had first been noticed 2 days ago but\nthe crusting had started 2-3 weeks ago. The owner treated with an over the counter rabbit medication but the\ncondition did not improve. The owner noted that Crookneck has had this problem several times in the past and it\ntypically improves with treatment. He has had a head tilt ever since he was acquired. A veterinarian has not yet\nbeen consulted about his condition. Ear infestations and untreated eye infections can cause significant discomfort to\nanimals.\nThe goat named Mariah was observed to be very thin, with sternum (chest bone), ribs, spinal bones and hip bones\nprotruding (visible under skin and readily palpable). Her hair coat was also somewhat unkempt with some hairloss\naround her lower back. It was explained that she had become thin several months ago when a companion passed\naway and has failed to gain weight despite eating what is observed to be a normal amount, getting turned out to\ngraze more often than the other goats, and receiving probiotic medications. The owner has been working to resolve\nher condition but Mariah does not seem to be improving. A veterinarian has not yet been consulted about her\ncondition. Weight loss can significantly weaken animals and may indicate a serious underlying condition (for\nexample, heavy parasitic infestation or systemic disease).\nA veterinarian must be consulted when animal health problems arise, especially if the animal's condition does not\nimprove with home nursing care. Animals with serious health concerns including significant weight loss, eye\nproblems, and chronic parasite infestations should be physically evaluated by a veterniarian to ensure that the\ncondition does not become worse or start to cause the animal distress. Appropriate and timely diagnosis, treatment,\nand control of animal health issues can also prevent the problem from recurring or affecting other animals. Affected\nanimals: 1 rabbit, 1 goat.\nCorrect by 5/15/14 and 5/19/14 respectively."

It was explained that the enclosure had not been\ncleaned in several weeks as it was suspected the rabbits might be pregnant.
