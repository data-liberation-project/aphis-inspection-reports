It was\nstated that the usual procedure was for the ferrets to be induced at higher to maximum concentrations, to then be\nmaintained at a reduced concentration for the remainder of the procedure.\n- One graduate student was alone monitoring 4 anesthetized ferrets. The investigation also found that the student, while\nperforming the procedure, was not well positioned to simultaneously monitor anesthesia of the ferrets.\nMistakes in handling, mainly anesthesia technique and monitoring, done during this procedure contributed to the ferret\u2019s\ndeath. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd Section"
