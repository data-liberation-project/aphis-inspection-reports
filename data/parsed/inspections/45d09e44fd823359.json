In\nthe video the wound appeared to be approximately 1-2 cm in size. The feathers surrounding the reddish-pink circular\nwound appeared wet and matted down from drainage and/or blood that extended from the wound down to the neck.\nUnder the moistened feathers the skin appeared mildly red in color. The animal was severely lethargic. The animal was\nlaying down with its head held up from its body, but leaning forward and down in a quiet, depressed manner. The animal's\neye that could be seen was tightly shut. The animal had little to no reaction to the enclosure being manipulated, the loud\nenvironment, or an individual putting their finger inside the enclosure.\nAPHIS officials sent questions regarding veterinary care for animals at the facility through email. The Attending\nVeterinarian stated that the response was sent on the behalf of the veterinarians who work during these sales.\nThe Attending Veterinarian and associate veterinarians working at the facility could not recall seeing these animals or any\nspecific treatments given to them. None of the veterinarians were able to confirm that any of the animals were evaluated\nor that any veterinary care was provided. In addition, there are no medical treatment records available for review and no\nother documentation to show whether a veterinary evaluation was requested or conducted.\nThe Facility Representative/Attending Veterinarian has stated previously that he does not consider consigned animals at\nthe auction as patients of the auction\u2019s veterinarians. Additionally, the Attending Veterinarian stated that all treatment\nsheets or notes (if any were conducted / provided) would follow the animal to the new owner for follow-up treatment by the\nanimal\u2019s veterinarian.\nThe facility could not demonstrate that the following animal at the March 2024 sale received adequate veterinary care in\ncompliance with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).\nThis animal is showing signs of pain and/or distress. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care to all animals at the\nfacility can lead to prolonged suffering, stress in the animals, and possible disease spread.\nThe facility cannot demonstrate if these animals received adequate veterinary care. Each dealer or exhibitor shall\nestablish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by ensuring that all animals receive adequate veterinary care."
