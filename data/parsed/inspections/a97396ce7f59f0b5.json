However, the same form also indicated that buprenorphine was to\nbe administered intramuscularly, but no other details were provided. The protocol indicated that analgesic use\nwould be provided according to the standard operating procedure for analgesics (SOP ARL-EX-027). Review of the\nstudy records indicated that a custom-compounded, sustained-release buprenorphine formula was used. The SOP\ndid not include any information related to this sustained-release formula, but did include the dose information for the\nstandard commercially-available product, which was to be administered at a dose of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg twice daily.\nThe labels on the vials of the sustained release buprenorphine instructed it to be administered at a dose of 1.58 mL\nof the 1 mg/mL solution subcutaneously to be administered every 3 days post-biopsy (effective dose of 1.58 mg\nevery three day). The subcutaneous route of administration was different than the approved protocol, which stated\nintramuscular administration. Further, calculation of the buprenorphine, based upon the dosage information within\nthe SOP, indicated that insufficient buprenorphine was administered, e.g. a 9 kg pig at the lowest dose level would\nhave required 2.7 mg in a three-day period.\nIncomplete information regarding analgesic use included in the protocol could result in an incorrect dose, such as\noccurred in protocol 6004, and therefore inadequate pain relief. The change in buprenorphine formulation might\nhave affected the degree of analgesia provided.\nAny proposal to use animals or any significant modifications to such proposals must contain a complete description\nof such activities and must be approved by the IACUC.\nThe noncompliance cited above should be corrected for all future proposals as well as the referenced protocol, if it\nis to be continued to be used."
