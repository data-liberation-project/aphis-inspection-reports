In the enclosure for \"Khonsu\" there is rusted wire mesh above that results in\npieces of wire dropping into the enclosure.

In the small shed where the hay for the goats and alpaca are stored, there were\nmany rodent droppings throughout the shed, and the hay is clearly not being adequately protected from vermin\ncontamination.\nFood and bedding should be stored in a manner which adequately protects it against deterioration, molding, or\ncontamination by vermin. Failure to properly store animal food could be detrimental to the animals.\nThis inspection was conducted on 3/12/19 with a facility representative. Paperwork was reviewed, and an exit\ninterview occurred with the director on 3/18/19."
