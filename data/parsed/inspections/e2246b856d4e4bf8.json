Although it has not been determined how the bear was able to enter the enclosure and despite the fact that the\nNature Center has an 8 foot perimeter fence encircling the property, it was not effective in preventing access by the wild\nbear. A perimeter fence of at least 8 feet is required for potentially dangerous animals. The fence must be constructed so\nthat it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it\nand having contact with the animals in the facility. Correct by June 15, 2023.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Animal Curator.\nn"
