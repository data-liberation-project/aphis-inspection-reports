      "narrative": "***An adult, female, black and white Jacob sheep was missing approximately one-third of her wool. Multiple patches\nof wool were missing over her chest, her armpit area, both sides of her belly, her outer thighs, and around her tail\nhead. Due to the lack of wool, her skin was visible in those areas, especially on the lower portion of her belly and\nthighs. There were two scabs visible in the area of the right flank. The licensee stated that every year the goats in\nthe enclosure chew the wool off of one of the sheep, as they try to eat bits of alfalfa that fall into the fleece. At the\ntime of inspection, APHIS inspector did not observe this behavior from any of the goats. The licensee was aware of\nthe wool loss, however the sheep had not been separated from the other animals, nor had the attending\nveterinarian been notified about the sheep\u2019s condition.\nWool loss can be an indication of health issues, including parasitism, infection, and nutritional deficiencies. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the licensee must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the\nanimals at the facility. The licensee was notified verbally that she must have the sheep examined by a veterinarian\nto obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans to address the issue cited above.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by\nthe attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care\nshall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nWool loss can also be an indication of bullying or incompatibility with the other animals in the enclosure. Animals\nhoused in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere\nwith their health or cause them discomfort.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
