Tartar build up\nwas observed to be impinging on the gums but the gums were not observed to be thickened nor reddened at this\ntime.\nAdditionally, one adult female King Charles Cavalier Spaniel identified as \"Schotzie\" (id tag #7), was observed to\nhave an accumulation of thick brown/black pasty debris with noticeable odor within the left ear canal and on the\ninside of the left ear flap.\nExcessive tartar buildup on teeth may lead to dental disease issues and may directly impact the health and comfort\nlevel of animals.\nDischarge and odor from ears may be an indication of an ongoing ear infection. Ear infections may lead to\ndiscomfort and may progress to more serious issues impacting the overall health of the animal. Untreated, ear\ninfections may also lead to chronic long term conditions affecting the integrity of the ear and well-being of the\naffected animal.\nExaminations by a licensed veterinarian should be scheduled and appropriate treatments implemented to address\nthe ear issue (Schotzie) and dental tartar issues (Millie). Appropriate methods should be in place to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose and treat diseases and/or injuries.\nTo be corrected by: Nov 3 2016"
