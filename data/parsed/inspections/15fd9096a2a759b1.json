      "narrative": "At the time of inspection, the facility identified that Bobby, a ten plus year old male bobcat, had not been eating well\nrecently. The veterinarian had evaluated Bobby on February 8, 2017 for vomiting, diarrhea and a swelling on the\nright shoulder area, and it was documented in the records at the facility. The vomiting and diarrhea had resolved,\nand on February 22, it was recorded that Bobby was not eating. The facility spoke with the vet, and the vet\nre-evaluated Bobby on March 8th. The written records were not available at the facility, but the vet recommended\ngrinding food, offering cat food or other appealing foods in order to tempt Bobby to eat, and consulted with another\nvet with bobcat experience. The Inspector called the vet regarding Bobby on the day of inspection, and the vet was\nconcerned with the significant weight loss and the prominence of the swelling on the right shoulder seen on March\n8th. Since March 8th, Bobby has continued to eat only a few bites of food daily and the facility needs to\ncommunicate with the veterinarian that he has not improved and continues to lose weight.\nThe exhibitor must ensure that all animals are observed every day, and that any problems or signs of decline are\nreported to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate diagnostics and care can be provided. Bobby the bobcat\nmust be re-evaluated by a veterinarian for the shoulder swelling/weight loss by March 25, 2017, and daily\nobservation of all animals, with appropriate follow-up and communication to the veterinarian, should be conducted\nfrom this time forward.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative."
