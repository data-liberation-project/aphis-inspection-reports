The two juvenile brown bears are housed\ntogether in one metal barrel that measures 4\u2019 wide by 5\u2019 long. The female black bear is housed in a metal barrel that\nmeasures 4\u2019 wide and 5-6\u2019 long. All six of these bears are locked into these metal barrels with no ability to move out of the\nbarrels if desired. At the time of inspection, these bears were awake in their barrels with no access to food or water.\nAdditionally, the climatic temperatures were 34 degrees F.\nBears that are awake and locked into these metal barrels are in a state of unrelieved suffering as they have no ability to\nmove out of the barrels, no access to food and water and have limited ability to self-regulate temperatures during winter\nweather conditions. Bears that are awake during their hibernation period and housed in metal barrels are susceptible to\nhypothermia as the metal barrels are not insulated and provide no warmth.\nHandling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nAll animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Appropriate\nspace, housing, food, and water must be provided to these bears to relieve undue suffering.\nTo be corrected by January 29, 2021 at 10:00 AM, EST."
