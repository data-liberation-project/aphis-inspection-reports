Her nails are overgrown, and her teeth are\ncovered with a thick layer of brown-to-grey material, with slightly swollen gums.\nA red and white female Basset hound with USDA tag #715 has hazy eyes. A blue tinge is apparent over the brown\ncolor, with an increased redness over the surrounding area of the globes.

Dental disease is also painful and can\nprogress to affect multiple body systems. Overgrown nails are more prone to injury and affect the dog's mobility.\nLicensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
