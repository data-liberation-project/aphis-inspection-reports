Upon examination after lifting the ears there was a large amount fluid filling up both ear canals, spilling over\nthe rim of the ear into the fur. The liquid was cloudy and drained out of the ears during examination. There was a slight\ngreenish tinge of the liquid located at the hairline by the right ear. The right ear had a brown gummy substance inside the\ncanal and crevices, while the inside of the left ear appeared to have some redness, thickening and irritation. Both ears\nappeared sensitive to the touch as the dog would pull away or lean into any handling of the ears. The hair coat had a dull\nappearance, and the body condition appeared very thin. Upon examination all of the ribs, spine and hips could be felt\neasily, and the dog appeared to be underweight and warm to the touch. The ears and loss of condition had not been\nobserved before the inspection, and there had been no veterinary contact or treatment for these conditions.\nAll health issues must be identified in a timely manner in order to prevent a treatable condition from becoming more\nserious or causing unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animal.\nThe licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the ears and lack of body\ncondition. Daily observations need to be increased and more thorough of all regulated animals.\nTo be corrected by: The attending veterinarian was contacted by the end of the inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.\nEnd Section"
