The protocol states that rubber mats and shavings will be placed on the floor of the enclosure to minimize\npressure on the hind limb incision and soft bedding will be used to prevent ulceration of the skin from knuckling.\nAt the time of the inspection at least 4 of 5 sheep were observed with bandaged fetlocks because they had\ndeveloped ulcers/pressure wounds as a result of knuckling. Although rubber mats were observed in the enclosures,\nno shavings or soft bedding were provided. The clinical veterinarian stated no shavings or special beddings had\nbeen used for these sheep.\nFailure to provide soft bedding as outlined in this IACUC approved protocol may have contributed to the\ndevelopment of pressure wounds on these four sheep. Any significant protocol changes must be reviewed and\napproved prior to implementation.\nCorrect by: All research studies must be conducted in accordance with IACUC approved guidelines."
