The following issues were noted:\n- This was a major surgical procedure conducted in a prep area not a surgical suite.\n- Post-operative care was inadequate.\nThe protocol allows the cows to be returned to the farm the day after surgery, or the following day. While these\ncows stayed at the VM hospital for 3 days post-surgery, it is unclear how closely they were observed once they\nwere returned to the farm. At the farm, the Animal Caretakers are the people performing the daily observation.\nThere are only 2 caretakers at the farm, and they are responsible for feeding, cleaning, observing all animals at the\nfarm (horses, cows, sheep), maintenance of the buildings/fences, and all pasture maintenance. Their time for\nobservation is limited and not adequate for animals recovering from a major surgery.\nPerforming a major surgical procedure in a prep area (not a dedicated surgical suite) and the lack of adequate daily\nmonitoring and observation when the cows returned to the farm may have contributed to the post-operative\ncomplications and death of the animals.\nMajor operative procedures must be conducted in facilities intended for that purpose and those facilities must be\noperated and maintained under aseptic conditions. Animals post-surgery must be properly monitored and observed\nto detect and treat or prevent any complications.\nTo be corrected from this day forward."
