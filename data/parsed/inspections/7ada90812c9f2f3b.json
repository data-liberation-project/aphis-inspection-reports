On\ncloser observation, there was clear discharge and the appearance of darkened stained fur around the entire eye.\nThe third eyelid appeared elevated and, along with the squinting, it was difficult to observe the right eyeball/globe\nitself. According to the licensee, she had not noticed the puppy(cid:25)s eye prior to the inspectors pointing it out. This\npuppy(cid:25)s eye condition could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be painful.\nThe licensee must have this puppy seen by a licensed veterinarian, by December 4, 2014, in order to ensure that an\naccurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed."
