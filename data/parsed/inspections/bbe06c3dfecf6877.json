The medication was intended for a different group of animals covered by that protocol. No adverse effects were\nnoted in these animals as a result of this error.\nA group of 8 cynomolgus underwent anesthesia and procedures not described in the protocol covering the use of these\nanimals. The anesthesia and procedures were intended for a different group of animals covered by that protocol. No\nadverse effects were noted in these animals as a result of this error.\nDuring a routine semiannual veterinary evaluation of a group of 5 cynomolgus monkeys, 2 animals were determined to\nhave poor body condition scores (BCS) of 1.5 of 5. The IACUC-approved protocol outlining the care for these animals\nstates that the group were to be weighed monthly, with the weight maintenance goal of 95% of free-feeding body weight,\nwhich equates to a BCS of 3 of 5. The remaining 3 animals in the group maintained adequate body condition.\nSubsequent investigation of the animal care records showed that the animals had not been weighed per protocol between\nMarch and October, allowing the two animals\u2019 BCS to deteriorate unnoticed. The research staff did not follow the protocol-\nprescribed weight measurement criteria and failed to observe the declining health condition of the animals. Upon\ndiscovery of the animals with the poor BCS, the Attending Veterinarian reviewed and amended the dietary plan to ensure\nreturn to adequate BCS for this group of animals. The animals are returning to appropriate body condition.\nSelecting and utilizing the wrong cohorts of animals for protocol-directed activities and not completing protocol-directed\nactivities indicate that the personnel utilizing these animals were not properly qualified to perform these duties and their\nactions put the animals at risk of unnecessary discomfort, harm and increased stress.\nPer the regulations, it shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians,\nanimal technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.\nThis responsibility shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel.
