The PI did not follow the instructions of the veterinarian and the procedure continued 10 hours rather\nthan the veterinarian recommended 2-3 hours. The animal subsequently died ~33 hours post procedure.\nThe research facility must ensure that the attending veterinarian has the appropriate authority to ensure adequate\nveterinary care is provided and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Failure to follow\napproved protocols and veterinary recommendations can result in outcomes such as occurred with this animal.\nPrior to the inspection, changes to the protocol were made to incorporate corrective measures, and new procedures\nwere put in place to prevent a recurrence.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSecor Thomas, Veterinary Medical Officer"
