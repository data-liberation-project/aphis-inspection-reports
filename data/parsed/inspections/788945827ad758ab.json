The\nsemi-annual facility inspection checklist shows several minor deficiencies none of which are described or have a\ncorrection plan/date.\nThe semi-annual report to the IO dated 12/13/16 does include a description, correction plan and correction date for\nall minor deficiences. However, the facility inspection review evaluation has only been signed by four of eight\nIACUC members.\nThe semi-annual evaluation report to the IO is an important document that updates the IO on the status of the\nfacility's animal care and use program and allows the IO to know when to intervene to ensure that the facility meets\nthe federal guidelines. The IACUC's semi-annual reports of evaluations of the program of animal care and use and\nfacility inspection must identify specifically any departures from the Animal Welfare Act Standards and Regulations,\nmust state reasons for each departure, must distinguish significant from minor deficiencies and must contain a\nreasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency. The evaluations must be\nreviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members."

Records show that when she arrived on 1/4/17\nfrom a shelter she weighed 17.4 kg and was given a 2/5 body condition score by the examining veterinarian.\nRoutine intake fecals and bloodwork were performed but there were no clinical notes regarding her thin body\ncondition or any plan for addressing it. The next weight recorded was on 1/24/17 at which time she weighed 17.6\nkg. Review of her food logs shows that she is being fed 1 1/4 cup of Purina EN twice daily and that she is eating.\nReview of Purina EN feeding recommendations show that the amount she is being fed is the recommended\nmaintenance amount for a dog her current weight. It does not appear from the records that she has been receiving\nany supplemental calories while at the facility. Thin shelter/rescue dogs are common but their underweight body\ncondition should be noted and addressed to ensure that the dogs gain weight and health. Animal records should\nreflect all medical conditions including body weight conditions/concerns to ensure that a proper diagnosis has been\nmade and any necessary treatment/husbandry changes instituted.
