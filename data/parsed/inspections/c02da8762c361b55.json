During the transfer process, the transport box\nis connected to the door of the primary enclosure. The doors of the primary enclosure and the transport box are an acrylic\npanel that slides up or down in a track. When the doors of the enclosure and the transport box were lifted, the marmoset\nmoved from its primary enclosure into the transport box and the investigator staff lowered the acrylic panel doors of the\nenclosure and transport box. The distal portion of the animal\u2019s tail was still inside the primary enclosure when the acrylic\ndoor panel of the enclosure was lowered; the distal end of the tail was caught under the enclosure door panel\napproximately 4\u201d from the tip. Investigator staff immediately contacted veterinary staff who examined and treated the\nanimal for a superficial minor wound to the skin of the tail. The animal recovered uneventfully.\nPer this Section, the handling of animals by all personnel, including investigator research staff, should be done as\ncarefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. The marmoset was not\nhandled as carefully as possible when investigator staff was transferring the animal from its primary enclosure to the\ntransport box resulting in a minor injury to the tail. The research facility addressed this incident prior to the inspection by\nimplementing corrective measures including review of animal transfer and handling practices with investigator staff. To\nremain corrected from this date 6/26/24 forward."
