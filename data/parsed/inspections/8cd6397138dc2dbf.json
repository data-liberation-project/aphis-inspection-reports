No tunnels were noted to breach the exhibit\nperimeter, and no opening could be found in the exhibit walls that would have facilitated the animals\u2019 escape. None of the\nanimals or their carcasses were found, but a feral cat had been seen around the area and the exhibit is mostly uncovered,\nmaking predation a possibility. The facility discontinued use of the enclosure for any animals and has not procured\nadditional prairie dogs for the collection.\nOn 10/22/2021, zoo keepers noted that an ~7-year-old female slender-tailed meerkat, named \u201cPink\u201d (202226) was\nmissing from the meerkat enclosure. A search of the enclosure did not reveal a potential means of escape for the animal,\nand the remaining three meerkats in the enclosure were all accounted for. The remaining meerkats were moved out of\nthe enclosure for excavation efforts and the El Paso Animal Control Department was notified in case the animal had\nescaped. Despite these efforts, the animal was never recovered and predation by a raptor or other animal was a\nremaining possibility.\nThe floors, a gate and some of the metal posts within the barn used for housing one adult male and one adult female\nMalayan tapirs are in disrepair; the barn floors have eroded concrete, and some of the metal posts and one gate are\nrusted, with sharp points in some areas with which the animals can come into contact.\nFailure to provide enclosures that keep zoo animals contained and safe, and which are built to prevent entry of other\nanimals from coming over or under walls or fences of the primary enclosure can lead to animal injury, escapes and\npredation events. Sharp points and other damaged surfaces pose a risk of injury to the animals and prevent proper\ncleaning and sanitization.\nThe licensee must ensure that housing facilities are constructed in a manner and of such material and strength as\nappropriate for the animals involved; they must be sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury\nand to contain the animals.
