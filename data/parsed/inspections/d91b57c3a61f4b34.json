      "narrative": "There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of\nVeterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian.\nIn Building 1, pen 118, there was a newborn black and white guinea pig housed with 10 other guinea pigs. The\nnewborn was lethargic and minimally responsive with sunken and partially closed eyes. The newborn was very thin\nwith easily palpable ribs and minimal fat layer present. The animal was observed to be sitting in one position and\nnot moving and exhibited limited reaction to being handled or when approached by other guinea pigs in the pen.\nAlso, in Building 1, pen 110 housing 12 guinea pigs, there was a tan and white adult guinea pig with a skin\nabnormality. There was a circular area approximately 2 cm in size on the bridge of the nose with hair loss and red\ncrusty skin. The program of veterinary care did not specifically address these conditions and the licensee had not\ncontacted the Attending Veterinarian nor were any treatments being administered. In addition, there were several\ndead guinea pigs observed including 1 adult and 1 newborn in Building 1 and 2 adults and 4 newborns in Building 2.\nNewborns that are lethargic and depressed can rapidly worsen if not evaluated and treated. Skin conditions with\nhair loss and redness can be a sign of numerous infectious and non-infectious causes and requires examination by\na veterinarian and appropriate diagnostic testing to determine the underlying cause and determine a treatment plan.\nFailure to identify and treat health conditions can lead to worsening of the condition including death.\nThe licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an\nappropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.\nCorrect by: January 16, 2020"
