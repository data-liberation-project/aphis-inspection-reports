Review of room logs for the past few days in June\n2014 showed minimum humidity readings of 73-94% and maximum humidity readings of 96-98%. Review of room\nlogs for 17 days of Jan 2014 showed that the average minimum humidity level was about 20% with a range of\n3-32% and the average maximum humidity level was about 47% with a range of 29-98%. Review of the last four\nsemi-annual IACUC facility inspection evaluations and reports showed that the humidity issues were noted as a\nminor deficiency on three of the four evaluations. A note had been made in the corresponding documentation that\nthe odor was stronger in the rooms than usual in the most recent evaluation (May 2014). Humidiy levels of indoor\nfacilities should be able to be maintained between 30 and 70% and in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional and husbandry practices to provide for the health and well-being of the animals and to minimize odors,\nammonia levels and moisture condensation. Correct by 8/5/14.\nExit conducted with undersigned facility representative."
