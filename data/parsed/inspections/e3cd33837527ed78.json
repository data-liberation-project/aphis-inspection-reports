He was informed that, since we are within the licensee\u2019s optimal hours, not\nallowing an inspection would be a refusal of inspection. He said to give him a couple of minutes and shut the kennel door\nwithout offering to let the inspector enter. He returned a few minutes later and said that he had someone there that he\nwas paying to do painting and did not want to do the inspection today. He was informed that the licensee would receive a\ncitation for refusing inspection. The inspector then left the facility.\nA licensee\u2019s refusal to allow inspection of the animals, facility and records interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to\nensure the welfare of the animals and to enforce of the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act, the regulations, and the\nstandards. The licensee must provide access for inspection when requested by APHIS officials.\nCorrection Date December 1st, 2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
