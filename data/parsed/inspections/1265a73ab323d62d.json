      "narrative": "At the time of this inspection, June 20, 2017 at approximately 10:30 am at the American Priority Parcel center at\nDallas/Ft Worth International Airport, two employees were trying to determine why 2 cats had been left in their\ncovered outdoor area that morning by American Eagle/Envoy Air. Apparently these cats had arrived on American\nAirlines flight 387 from Honolulu at 6:20 am that morning. They were scheduled to connect with an American Eagle\nflight chartered by Envoy Air for El Paso, TX. It appears the flight going to El Paso had problems with the cargo\narea and could not take animals. Instead of keeping the cats at Envoy and rescheduling them as soon as possible\nas per their SOP\u2019s they took the animals to Priority Parcel and left them with no explanation.\nAny entity subject to the Animal Welfare regulations who transports animals must do so as quickly and efficiently as\npossible. Taking animals to another carrier that has no way of tracking the animals in their computer system and\nleaving them with no explanation is not transporting animals quickly and efficiently.\nEnvoy Air needs to ensure their SOP\u2019s for transporting animals are being followed. If the animals need to go to\nanother facility for temperature or other reasons that should be communicated to the other carrier prior to delivery of\nthe animals.\nTo be corrected by: June 30, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
