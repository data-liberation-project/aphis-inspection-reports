The inspector was able to reach across the barrier and grab onto the chain link fence. For the\nsafety of the animals and guests the barrier needs to be moved back so there is a sufficient distance and guests are\nnot able to touch the enclosures or potentially the animals.\nThe facility has made progress in funding and planning out the removal of old fence and construction of new fence\nthat will be further back and higher to prevent guests from being able to touch the primary enclosure. The facility\nhas plans for the project to be completed by mid August.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection."
