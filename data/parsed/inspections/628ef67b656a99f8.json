No treatment has been provided. It is important to notify the\nveterinarian of issues so appropriate treatment plans can be developed and followed. The daily observation of\nanimals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian but a mechanism of direct and\nfrequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior,\nand well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian."
