I knocked on the door of the residence and was answered by a\nyounger male. When questioned about the presence of Brad or Stephanie he informed me that neither were home\nand he did not expect them for a while. I told him I had their cell phone numbers and I would try calling them.\nSitting in my vehicle on the driveway I called and left a message on Stephanie's phone. And then did the same on\nBrad's phone. Within a short period of time Stephanie called me back and confirmed that both her and Brad were\nworking late that evening and would not be home for a while."
