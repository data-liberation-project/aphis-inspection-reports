According to the senior curator, on the morning of the incident the male repeatedly manipulated the gate\nseparating the two animals\u2019 habitats by moving it back and forth which resulted in failure of the locking mechanism on the\ngate allowing it to slide open. The locking mechanism was of insufficient strength to keep the gate closed and contain the\nmale rhinoceros. The curator also indicated that upon the male entering the female\u2019s habitat, the female approached the\nmale, they interacted exhibiting sparring behaviors, then he aggressed her resulting in the fatal injuries. The male has\nsince been moved to a separate habitat and the calf is under veterinary care. Records show the facility took immediate\ncorrective action to ensure the safety of the animals.\nFailure to provide structurally sound enclosures may allow for the escape of animals and lead to possible injury or death.\nThe facility must be constructed of such material and such strength as appropriate for the animals involved to protect the\nanimals from injury and contain the animals.\nCorrected from this day forward, November 18, 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nALEXANDRA ANDRICOS, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER\nKATHLEEN GARLAND, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist n"
