A lift was necessary to free the animal from the mesh, but since it could not be moved into the\nenclosure, it was positioned as close as possible to the outside. Prior to freeing the animal from the mesh, it was\nassessed by staff. It was flapping its\u2019 wings and appeared to be strong. Based on that assessment, the decision was\nmade, to avoid additional stress, to simply untangle the animal rather than cutting the mesh, capturing, and crating it.\nCrews were standing by, if necessary, to catch the animal in large blankets as he came down. Unfortunately, once freed,\nthe flying fox impacted the roof of the public viewing area on the way down. He was immediately wrapped in a towel and\nbrought into the night house for evaluation by veterinary staff. Due to the animal's presentation after the event, his\nadvanced age, and the fact that he was already undergoing quality of life assessment for age related issues, the decision\nwas made to have the animal humanely euthanized. Enclosures should be constructed with such material and such\nstrength as to be appropriate for the animals housed within and to protect the animals from injury.\nCorrected prior to inspection.\nIn December of 2023, a 1yo Wallaroo was brought into the facility veterinary hospital with acute neurologic signs and a\nprior history of being uncharacteristically calm with a minimal flight distance. The animal received appropriate diagnostic\ntesting and medical care. After almost 3 weeks in the veterinary hospital and an improvement in symptoms, the veterinary\nteam decided to discharge the animal to a holding pen within the original habitat for monitoring and possible transition\nback into the habitat. Unfortunately, on the 3rd day of observation in the holding pen, the animal was found deceased,\nstuck in a gap between a sliding gate and the associated fencing.
