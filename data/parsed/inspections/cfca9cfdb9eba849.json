      "narrative": "A female blackbuck antelope was found in the drive thru section of the facility limping and not bearing weight on its\nleft rear leg. This animal was observed to be walking holding the left rear leg off of the ground and only placing the\nleg onto the ground once it stopped walking. The farm manager was not aware of this condition in the animal when\nasked. The facility has not started any treatment for this animal. Non-weight bearing is a sign of pain. This animal\nrequires veterinary attention. Correct this by contacting your attending veterinarian and following recommended\ntreatment.\n*** This animal was examined and treated by the attending veterinarian on March 26th, 2018.\nThe program of veterinary (PVC) has been updated since the last inspection. It states the current primary method\nfor tranquilization will be the drug mixture known as BAM and that the previous protocol will be used in the case that\nBAM is not effective. The previous protocol is the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29)\n(without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support). The farm manager stated\nduring this inspection that they intend to continue using succinylcholine on elk, fallow deer, sika deer, and zebra.\nSuccinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this\ndrug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered\ndistressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug\ncan also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated\nthey can die of suffocation. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities, or training to intubate or\nmechanically ventilate animals in this event. Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and\nassociated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary\nadministration, oversight and care (including the use of general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent\nwith providing adequate veterinary care.\nCorrect by working with your attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical\nimmobilization protocol that provides adequate care for all species being handled."
