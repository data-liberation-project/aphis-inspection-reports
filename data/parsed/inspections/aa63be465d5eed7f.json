Necropsy showed bruising from the animal trying to free himself, with no other\nsignificant findings that would have caused death.\nThis incident was reported to USDA Animal Care. The facility promptly instituted preventative measures, including\nthe use of chains/locks to prevent inadvertent activation or animal manipulation of squeeze mechanisms, and\nreminding staff to check the squeeze mechanisms several times a day.\nPrimary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the nonhuman primates from injury.\nCORRECTED PRIOR TO INSPECTION.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
