After this prelicense inspection, I\ninstructed the facility manager to contact me for his second prelicense inspection.\nApproximately one year later, the facility is still open to the public for tours as well as private interactions with 1 red\nkangaroo, 1 black-tailed wallaby, 2 black and white lemurs and 1 common brown lemur. Individuals can sign up online on\nthe facility's website for the tours and interactions. Additionally, their social media page posts pictures of public members\ninteracting and feeding their animals. After speaking with the head keeper and the facility manager, they confirmed they\nwere conducting regulated activity. I made them aware that they were conducting regulated activity without a license and\nthat they would need to be licensed in order to continue to conduct regulated activity.\nConducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that APHIS\nofficials can assess the care of the animals. The facility manager must either cease regulated activity or obtain a license\nfrom the USDA to continue conducting regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act.\nNo regulated activity may be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the head keeper initially with a follow up call to the facility\nmanager.\nEnd Section"
