The skin in these areas appear red and inflamed. The wolf was seen randomly biting, scratching, and chewing at both\nflank areas multiple times during the inspection and pacing around the primary enclosure in obvious agitation and\ndiscomfort. The wolf was also seen rolling around on the ground to scratch the affected areas. When inquiring with the\nfacility representative about this condition he stated the wolf has been treated by the AV for this condition in the past. Last\nyear the wolf was prescribed two different medications that appeared to improve his symptoms temporarily while on\ntreatment but has not been on any therapy for several months. When asked if the AV has been contacted as the condition\nappears to have worsened the representative was not able to provide any documentation of this communication. The\nattending veterinarian was contacted to discuss the wolf\u2019s condition and he stated there has been no communication from\nthe facility for this animal since October 2023 where it was stated that the wolf was improving on therapy. The wolf does\nhave a history of self-mutilation according to the attending veterinarian which is suspected to be due to underlying\nneurologic or musculoskeletal disease.\nFailure to provide adequate veterinary care and treat conditions that have worsened such as neurological disease which\nhave resulted in secondary skin trauma from self-mutilation can cause unnecessary distress, pain, secondary infections,\nand negatively affect the animal\u2019s health and well-being. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed\nveterinarian so that an accurate diagnosis can be made, and an appropriate treatment plan can be developed and\nfollowed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times by providing the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nCorrected by 14 August 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nEric Irvin, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
