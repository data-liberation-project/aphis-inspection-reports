The dampness could have been from excessive rain water seeping up through the concrete or inadequate\ncleaning of the cages. Either way the bedding and the floors were damp with most of the rabbits having no way to\nescape the damp floor and remain dry and clean. Primary enclosures must allow the rabbits to remain dry and\nclean.\nThe licensee needs to determine exactly what is causing the dampness and excessive odor and correct\naccordingly. If it is caused by inadequate cleaning then the number of rabbits should be reduced or the rabbit runs\nneed to be cleaned more thoroughly and frequently. If the cause is seepage of water through the concrete then the\nconcrete needs to be water proofed. Changing the type of bedding and providing more elevated areas for the\nrabbits to get off the floor may also assist with allowing the animals to remain dry and clean.\nTo be corrected immediately.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee."
