The poodles had access to 2\nshelter structures but one shelter was a medium igloo that could not fit both dogs at once and would limit the normal\npostural adjustments of a single dog. The second shelter structure was a small lean-to with only a roof and 3 walls; it\nlacked a floor, a fourth wall, and a wind break. Adequate shelter is important for dogs to stay warm and dry and escape\ninclement weather. All outdoor-housed dogs must have access to a shelter with a roof, 4 walls, and a floor, and is large\nenough for each dog to make normal postural adjustments. The shelter must also have a wind break at the entrance and\ncontain clean, dry bedding if the temperature is below 50 degrees. Correct by 2/8/25 by ensuring all outdoor housed dogs\nhave adequate shelters that meet the regulations."
