These gaps and sharp\npoints are within contact of the animals and could cause injury.\n***An entire wall of fencing of the enclosure containing 1 zebra and 2 camels is leaning at an approximately 70\ndegree angle away from the enclosure. This fencing structure is not structurally sound and is not adequate to\nsecurely contain the animals within.\n***The walls of a metal shed in the daytime enclosure of two camels have sharp, rusted edges at the base, where\nthey are not in contact with the ground. Two of the walls are coming off of the frame of the shed, creating sharp\nedges that pose a risk of injury to the animals.\n***A portion of the fencing of the daytime enclosure of two camels is in disrepair. A wooden pillar was uprooted from\nthe ground and is causing the section of fencing around it to sag. The pillar has created a problem with the current\nin the electric fence and there is no electricity running through the wire.\n***The metal gate in the daytime enclosure of two camels is tilting between the fence posts. It is attached to the\nfence posts with rope and chains. This fencing structure is not structurally sound and is not adequate to securely\ncontain the animals within.\nAll housing facilities must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in\norder to protect the animals from injury. A routine schedule of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance\nmust be in place to protect the animals from injury, contain them, and ensure that these items do not repeat.\nTo be corrected by: November 15, 2016"
