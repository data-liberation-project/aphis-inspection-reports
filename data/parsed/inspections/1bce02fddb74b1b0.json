Sections of chain-link are fastened to metal posts approximately eight to ten feet apart,\nand four sections were affected. In two of the sections the chain-link is crumpled down so low that it is easy to step\nthrough the fence.\nAlthough the bison have been moved to an adjacent pasture, and there is another fence separating them from the\ndamaged section, that fence is not dog-proof, as there are gaps under gates, of eight inches or more, and there is\nno barrier to prevent an intruder from having contact with the bison through the fence, once inside.\nThe damage to the fence reportedly occurred more than seven days ago, and was caused by a falling tree branch.\nImmediate temporary measures should have been taken to prevent people and animals from being able to pass\nthrough the fence. The police barricades and yellow plastic caution tape do not achieve this goal.\nThe perimeter fence must be maintained so as to protect the animals within by preventing outside animals and\npeople from entering the enclosure. Failure to keep animals and people out could put the health and well-being of\nthe bison at risk.\nNote: The exhibitor has recently completed an extensive project to improve the existing perimeter fence by\neliminating gaps underneath the fence, and these modifications are excellent.\nThis is a repeat citation which previously involved recurring gaps underneath the fence, and was cited previously on\nJanuary 11, 2012, January 4, 2013, and April 18, 2013.\nAn exit interview was completed with a facility representative."
