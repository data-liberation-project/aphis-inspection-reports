A fence segment of 30-60 yards along the southwest\ncorner of the park where the bear is housed reaches only 5 feet 7 inches in height. Additionally, a long expanse of the\nperimeter fence along the western border of the park, from the public entrance to the Roosevelt elk enclosure, has large\nshrubs and trees growing along, through and over the fence.\n**Black bear are housed in a primary enclosure at the southwest corner of the park; the primary enclosure is constructed\nwith a chain link interior fence and a solid retaining wall sits 3.5 feet beyond it. According to facility officials the latter\nstructure is the bear perimeter fence. The bear perimeter fence is 8 feet 9 inches in height from the animal side however it\nis only 3 feet 3 inches in height from the public side of the fence. Perimeter fences are required both to function as\nsecondary containment and to prevent unauthorized people and animals from entering. Therefore, the perimeter fence for\ndangerous animals must meet the minimum fence height on both sides of the fence. Additionally, the space between the\nprimary enclosure fence and the perimeter fence along the southern aspect of the black bear enclosure is severely\novergrown with trees and shrubs, functionally eliminating the distance between the two fences.

Dense and sturdy vegetation growing though and over the perimeter fence may\ncompromise its ability to make an effective barrier by reducing structural integrity and make it easier for unwanted animals\nand people to pass over and through the fence. Dense foliage obstructs the view and precludes careful inspection and\nmaintenance of the fence.\nCorrect by ensuring the perimeter fence is in good repair and of sufficient height to restrict unwanted animals and\nunauthorized people from going through it, and to also act as an effective secondary containment system for animals of\nthe facility in the event they escape their primary enclosure.
