The black male alpaca, the two black female alpacas, and the cinnamon\nfemale alpaca with a black face all have little or no hair growth on the skin over the top of their nose. The white\nfemale alpaca did not have hair loss on the bridge of her nose. The APHIS official was informed during the\ninspection that the facility personnel were aware of the hair loss, but there was no documentation of this condition in\nthe records for the animals or of the attending veterinarian being consulted. Hair loss can have many causes such\nas parasites, infectious, nutritional, and may be a sign of a more serious health concern. The alpacas must be\nevaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.\n2) The female mottled colored red fox housed with a female red colored red fox has a large area of hair loss in the\nmiddle of her back. The under coat is still present but the top coat is gone. The APHIS official was informed during\nthe inspection by the facility escort that it was too early for the fox to be shedding out her winter coat. There was no\ndocumentation of the hair loss in the records for the animal and the attending veterinarian was not consulted. The\nhair loss has many health care causes (see alpacas above) or may be a result of incompatibility with her enclosure\ncompanion. The fox must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.\n3) At least four of the eight prairie dogs had patches of hair loss on their heads and/or bodies. No skin wounds or\nbleeding were seen in the areas of hair loss. There was no documentation of the hair loss in the records for the\nanimals and the attending veterinarian was not consulted. The hair loss has many health care causes (see alpacas\nabove) or may be a result of incompatibility with enclosure companions. The prairie dogs must be evaluated by the\nattending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.\nCorrect by having the above animals evaluated by the attending veterinarian and separate any incompatible\nanimals. The licensee must document and maintain records of the examination, treatment and outcome for future\ninspection by APHIS officials. Correct by March 21, 2016.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility vice president."
