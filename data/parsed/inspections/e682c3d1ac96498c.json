      "narrative": "- The male rhinoceros \"Tank\" was visibly thin and lethargic during the inspection. He appeared to have lost muscle\non his sides and hindquarters, and had loose skin rolls on both flanks. Tank had a clear sticky discharge from both\nnostrils. His barn was filled with abnormally soft stool, which caretakers stated had been occurring for\napproximately two weeks. There was no knowledge of when Tank had last been evaluated by the attending\nveterinarian. There was no feed, including hay, present anywhere in the enclosure and the pasture has little to no\ngrass other than dry weeds.\nTank's current physical condition is considered to be an emergency, and requires immediate assessment and\ncorrection. At a minimum, Tank must have free access to good quality hay at all times. He must also be assessed\nby the attending veterinarian within 24 hours, and any veterinary recommendations followed strictly. Tank must be\nrechecked as often as the attending veterinarian deems necessary, but not less than weekly until his body condition\nhas improved.\n- During the drive through inspection, a black male llama (approximately two months of age) was noted off the side\nof the road in sternal recumbency. The animal did not respond to auditory stimulus, and was approached on foot by\ninspectors and facility personnel. The llama appeared barely conscious, and his attempts to stand were weak and\nspastic. Physical palpation of the animal showed him to be in very poor body condition, extremely thin with muscle\nwasting and little to no body fat. The upper palate was tinged blue, and the saliva thick and ropey. The inspection\nwas immediately stopped and facility personnel directed to contact the attending veterinarian for emergency care.\nWhile the veterinarian was en route, the animal was offered food and water but did not or could not respond. With\nthe attending veterinarian on the way, employees moved the llama to the medical barn. One employee stayed with\nthe animal while the other employee rejoined inspectors to continue the inspection. Upon the attending\nveterinarians arrival, the inspectors and accompanying attendant went to the medical barn to observe treatment\nefforts. Unfortunately, the llama had died before the veterinarian arrived on the premises. A field necropy was\nimmediately conducted by the attending veterinarian. Her initial impressions were that internal organs appeared\nrelatively normal, but the animal was very thin and muscle wasted. She believed the animal likely had a heavy\ninternal parasite load, and suspected the llama had entered a \"negative energy balance\" which it could not recover\nfrom. She estimated the llama to be approximately two months old. Samples were submitted for histopathology\nand fecal analysis, and results are pending."

There is no indication in records that\nanyone in the park has noticed any problems with thin animals in the preceding weeks. It was clear that no\nemployees had noticed any problems with this young llama prior to finding him on the inspection. Young, small\nanimals as well as thin animals are extremely susceptible to environmental stresses, parasite loads, and other\ndangers. A young animal in poor body condition is in a gravely dangerous situation, and any amount of stress can\nquickly overload a weakened animal. The animal caretakers were aware that there is a natural \"hierarchy\" among\nthe various species in the park which determines access to available food. Young animals in general, and\nespecially members of a less dominant species, will often have difficulty eating especially when food supplies are\nlimited (such as during the winter). Employees must be aware and diligent in finding and observing younger\nanimals to ensure they are eating sufficient amounts of wholesome food to maintain body fat and muscle. The\nfacility clearly failed to properly observe, evaluate, and care for the llama which died on the inspection date.\nGreater care must be taken with all park animals, and especially younger and more vulnerable animals. Body\ncondition must be evaluated constantly for all animals in the facility. When possible, animals that will permit\nthemselves to be touched should have their body condition assessed by physical palpation, as observation through\nthick wool or hair coats can be difficult. The facility must also give more consideration to methods of feeding, and\nmust consider methods of feeding that will ensure smaller, weaker animals are able to reach food without being\npushed away by larger, stronger animals.\nCorrect by: 13 February 2015"
