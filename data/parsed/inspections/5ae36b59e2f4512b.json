  "narrative": "No non-compliant items identified during this inspection. \nA focused inspection was conducted regarding the direct nci involving the 15 year old female reindeer named\nStriker. The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian (AV) had been at the facility on 8/13/14 to look at the\nreindeer. The AV confirmed that the animal was limping and showing signs of lameness. The AV also confirmed\nthat the hooves were long and needed to be trimmed. The AV went on to state that the animal had a history of\nlameness and classified Striker as a chronic lame cow.\nThe AV evaluated the animal and determined that she is moving well with the herd, was in good body condition with\ngood coat color and thickness. The AV determined that the animal was not showing signs of pain. \nThe AV recommended monitoring the animal for any changes in her condition. The AV stated to the licensee if any\nchanges are noted, the AV should be contacted for further evaluation. The AV recommended to the licensee to\nhave the hooves trimmed as soon as the animal was finished rubbing the velvet off of her antlers (to avoid any\ndamage to the velvet during the trimming process). \nExit interview was conducted with the owner.",
