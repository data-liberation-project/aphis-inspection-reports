The licensee stated she had not observed the injury in this animal and was not administering any treatment.\nThe degu observed with an injury on the back above its tail on the inspection on 3/2/22 was separated and was being\ntreated with Animax ointment but the licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian.\nHealth conditions such as abnormal eyes, skin wounds, and lameness can cause pain and distress and worsen if not\ntreated appropriately in consultation with a veterinarian.\nThe licensee must ensure that daily observations are being performed and that a mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication is in place so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian."
