The licensee stated that the day before, the pup had been used in 12 to 15 public encounters.\nEncounters are advertised as lasting 30 minutes, but the licensee stated that they usually lasted 5 to 15 minutes each.\nDuring public encounters, members of the public could hold and play with the otter pup. The licensee stated that the otter\npup appeared to be normal and had a normal appetite the evening before it died. The licensee stated that after\ndiscovering the dead pup he contacted the attending veterinarian, and both he and the veterinarian believe that the pup\ndied as a result of stress from the previous day\u2019s public encounters and handling. The attending veterinarian was\ncontacted and confirmed this conclusion.\nYoung otter pups can be easily stressed. Behavioral or psychological stress can occur due to separation from the mother\notter and litter mates, as otters are known to be highly social animals. Stress to the body can occur easily: Due to their\nsmall size and young age, otter pups can easily become dehydrated, injured, exhausted, or cold. The excitation and\nactivity caused by public encounters can also lead to low blood sugar, which can be deadly. Prolonged stress can lead to\ndecreased function of the immune system, increased susceptibility to infections, increased risk of diarrhea, and reduced\ngrowth.\nCorrect by handling young or immature animals in a manner and for periods of time that are consistent with maintaining\ntheir health and well-being. Correct by October 28th, 2020."
