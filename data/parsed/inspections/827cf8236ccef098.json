The first lame Aoudad\nnoted in the enclosure was reluctant to stand, electing to crawl along the ground instead of standing upright. Once\nstanding, a marked, minimally weightbearing lameness was identified on the right forelimb, making it difficult for the sheep\nto walk.

The facility representative stated none of the affected animals were lame yesterday, yet they were unable to\nconfirm when daily observations were completed the day of the inspection.\nFailure to observe all animals daily can result in deterioration of the animal's health, particularly when daily routine\nobservations are not clearly established. Daily observation of all animals shall be done to assess their health and well-\nbeing. Timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being noted during daily\nobservations must be communicated to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided."
