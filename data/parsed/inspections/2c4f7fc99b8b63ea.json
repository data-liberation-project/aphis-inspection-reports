      "narrative": "***Direct - there was an adult male Bichon Frise (#081779872) with a dental condition and overgrown rear dew\nclaws. The left and right rear dew claws had grown, curled around and appeared to penetrate into pads underneath\nthe nails on each foot. The tissue which the right rear dew claw had grown into appeared swollen, reddened and\nsplit. The tissue which the left rear dew claw had grown into also appeared thickened and split. Overgrown nails\nthat have curled around and penetrated tissue underneath them can increase the risk of infection and pain. The\ndog was also observed repeatedly sticking its tongue out and the fur around the dog's mouth was wet and\ndiscolored dark brown, especially on the left side. On the inside of the dog's mouth, there was an approximately 3/4\ninch by \u00bd inch, irregular shaped, smooth, pinkish red, mass-like piece of tissue present, which appeared at least\npartially attached to the gums, behind the upper left canine tooth. A band of greyish white material was present\nabove this piece of tissue. Many of the teeth surfaces were partially to mostly covered with a heavy amount of grey\nto dark brown to tan material. The gums surrounding some of the upper left teeth appeared reddened and swollen.\nWritten documentation dated 7/29/2014 at the facility, which had been initialed by a veterinarian, stated the dog\n\"(cid:28)needs dental\"(cid:29). When the licensee was asked if the dog had received a dental, he replied \"(cid:28)no\"(cid:29). The abnormal\nbuild-up of material on this dog's teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. The mass-like\npiece of tissue could indicate an illness or other veterinary medical condition. This dog's dental condition could be\npainful, may decrease the dog(cid:25)s ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal.\n***There were two, approximately 9 years old, female Schnauzers (#087) and (#121) with patchy hair loss along\ntheir backs. One of the females (#087) had an irregular shaped region of hair loss between the shoulder blades\nextending down the back to behind the shoulder blades into thinner amounts of hair. Regions of patchy hair loss\nand thinner hair were also present over the dog(cid:25)'s right rear leg, hip and abdominal region. The other female (#121)\nhad a large patch of hair loss over her rear back extending over the hips. For each of the dogs, the skin in these\nregions of hair loss appeared flakey. According to the licensee, he had not noticed the hair loss on these dogs prior\nto the inspectors pointing it out. Hair loss and flakey skin could be due to parasites, allergies, infection or other\nveterinary medical conditions which may cause discomfort.\n***An adult female chocolate Poodle (#0A02201570) was observed consistently holding its left rear leg up and not\nbearing weight on it. According to the licensee, he had noticed that the dog would sometimes limp, however, he\nhad not contacted a veterinarian regarding this animal'(cid:25)s condition. This dog(cid:25)'s condition could indicate an injury or\nother veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than February 11, 2015 in order\nto ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The\nlicensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary\ncare for the animals in the facility."
