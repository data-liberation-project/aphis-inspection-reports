The devices were\nconstructed out of the following: thin, plastic water bottles (16.9 fl oz), with the labels and tops intact, hanging by a piece\nof twine tied around the neck of the bottles, with numerous tiny hair beads (approximately 2-3 mm in size) inside the\nbottles. The facility representatives confirmed they utilized the bottles by hanging them inside the birds\u2019 enclosures, and\nsome of the bottles were crushed up \u2013 indicating possible usage by the birds. These devices were not amongst the list of\napproved options in the Bird Enhancement binder, nor were they approved by the veterinarian, and the small bag that the\nbeads came out of had a \u201cChoking Hazard \u2013 Small Parts\u201d warning label on the front of it. Larger bird species (in this case,\nmacaws and cockatoos) have sharp and powerful beaks that can easily puncture/tear such plastic water bottles, which\ncould injure the birds if they ingest plastic pieces, the bottle top, and/or the tiny beads. Primary enclosures must be\nenriched by materials or activities that would provide the birds with the means to express non-injurious species-typical\nactivities. Species differences should be considered when determining the type or methods of enrichment. The facility\nremoved the enrichment devices during the inspection.\nCorrect by: January 28, 2025"

On top of a white First Aid Kit that was nailed to the right wall where part of the\nshelving unit was attached just above the kit; and 3. On the lower shelf of a metal shelving unit surrounding additional\nplastic containers of bird food. All food was actively being utilized for the birds. Facility employees indicated, in the weeks\nprior, there was a pest control treatment/fumigation to eliminate the cockroaches; whereby none were seen since.

Lack of adequate cleaning can facilitate such\na hazard, which could negatively impact the health and well-being of the birds.
