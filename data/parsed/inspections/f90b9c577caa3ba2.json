Upon my approach to the\ngiraffe\u2019s enclosure, there was a family (husband, wife, and child) petting the giraffe (in the area between his enclosure and\nthe arcade building). After the family left, the giraffe was also able to reach his head and neck out to where I was standing\n(the same area as the family), providing me the opportunity to pet him without an attendant present. Lack of a\nresponsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable attendant or employee during periods of public contact, especially\nsince both animals are accustomed to public feedings, pose a significant risk to the health and well-being of both the\nanimals and the public.
