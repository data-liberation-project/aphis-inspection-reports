She asked if I could\nget the inspection done in that time. I explained to her that would not be enough time and I would have to send out\nanother repeat attempted inspection report. I asked for her optimal hours to which she answered that any day of\nthe week would work for her. I suggested to her that she should start emailing me her schedule so I can conduct an\ninspection the next time I come out. She said she would start doing that.\nEnd of report."
