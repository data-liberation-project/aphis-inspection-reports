The heat lamp had a basic 4 prong guard on it, but the bird may still be able\nto come into contact with the bulb if they perch on top of the shelter box. Additionally, there is a metal strap material that\nused to hold the heat lamp in place, it has been cut and has sharp edges pointing up onto the shelter box in the turkey\nvulture enclosure. Electrical cords pose a significant health risk to birds that may chew or pull on them. Unprotected\npowered electrical cords that are within a bird\u2019s enclosure allows access to an electrical hazard that can cause\nelectrocution, injury and/or death. Sharp edges may cause injury to the animal. Contact with a heat lamp bulb may cause\na significant health risk such as burns, injuries and/or death.
