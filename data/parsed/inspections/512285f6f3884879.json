Both care takers were unaware of this\ncub's lameness. It was stated stated that the cub had recently been seen by a local veterinarian. No documentation\nwas available during this inspection of the cubs recent visit to the veterinarian so I contacted him by phone. The\nveterinarian was not aware of any lameness problems nor notified of her limp while walking. All animals need to be\nobserved daily and medical problems need to be addressed and conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely\nmanner.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: MARCH 20, 2014."
