      "narrative": "An adult, black, female Newfoundland Dog (ID# 7E10064278), has an abnormal skin condition. The affected areas\nof skin are located along the inside of the hind legs, base of the ears, around both eyes, and slightly above the paw\non the left-hind leg. These areas appear mostly devoid of hair, dry and crusty. The dog is continuously scratching\nareas around its left ear, lasting approximately 19 seconds. Immediately afterwards, the dog starts biting at areas\nalong its back. The facility representative stated that a veterinarian has yet to evaluate the dog. The facility\nrepresentative also stated that he first noticed the hair loss on 11/23/18 and made the decision to treat the dog with\na single dose of oral ivermectin the same day. The facility's program of veterinary care lists the use of oral\nivermectin as an approved treatment for specific conditions, however, the licensee and facility representative have\nnot obtained an official diagnosis from a veterinarian and therefore are unsure of the exact cause. In addition, there\nis a moist greenish-colored discharge and dry crusty matter present around the dog's left eye.\nSkin problems in dogs can be caused by inadequate nutrition, parasites or other underlying medical conditions. The\nlicensee must consult with a veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan\nfor this dog's condition. Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that the treatment plan is followed and that all\nanimals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: December 7, 2018."
