There is a dark discolored spot in the center of the surface of\nthe right eye. The licensee stated that this was noticed a couple of days ago and that he is treating the dog with\ninjectable penicillin every other day, triple antibiotic ointment on the eye lid, and \"Refresh\" eye lubricant drops in the\neye. The licensee has not consulted a veterinarian regarding the medical care for the problem in this dog. Eye\nproblems can be a result of trauma, genetic and other medical problems and can be painful. This dog also has\nheavy accumulation of brown discharge completely coating the upper \"cheek teeth\" (premolars and molars) and\nmost of the upper canine teeth. The gum line of the upper left \"cheek teeth\" has recessed up from the surface of the\nteeth. There is a white discharge and some grass like material trapped along the gum line of the left upper \"cheek\nteeth.\" A few of the upper \"cheek teeth\" are loose on left side. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue\nand tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall\nhealth of the animal. The licensee must have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on\n9 April 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is\ndeveloped and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the\ninspector upon request.\nAdult, female, black and white Havanese (unable to read microchip) has a matted coat. Approximately 75% of her\nlimbs, rear end, and torso were matted. The mats were tight against the skin on the legs and rear end. Matted coats\ncan cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted coats do not provide complete protection against\nthe elements. The licensee must remove the matted hair from this dog. As part of the facility's program of veterinary\ncare, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance to ensure that animals are cleaned\nwhen their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a regular basis. To be corrected by end of\nbusiness on 9 April 2014.\nThe licensee is using a bottle of injectable penicillin on one dog in the facility. There are no directions approved by\nthe attending veterinarian for the use of this medication in dogs on the bottle, in the program of veterinary care, or in\nthe animal housing areas. Lack of directions from a licensed veterinarian for use of medications can result in\nimproper use and potential harm for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility\nare labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices and have directions for their use.
