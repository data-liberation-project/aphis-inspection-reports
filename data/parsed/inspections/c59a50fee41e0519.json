      "narrative": "The licensee reported that two kittens have perished on the premises since the last inspection. According to veterinary\nrecords provided to the inspectors by the licensee, as well as the Attending Veterinarian (AV), feline panleukopenia was\nan underlying cause of death for one kitten (male, Bengal, ~4.5 months), and suspected feline herpes virus (feline\nrhinotracheitis) was an underlying cause of death for the other kitten (female, Asian Leopard Cat, 4 months). The written\nprogram of veterinary care approved by the AV has a vaccination protocol that includes immunization against these two\nviral diseases. The licensee and AV have confirmed to inspectors that she is not vaccinating in accordance with the\nprotocol. Failure to follow the vaccination protocol leads to increased susceptibility of the animals to preventable infectious\ndiseases. The licensee must follow the written program of veterinary care\u2019s vaccination protocol to ensure the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent diseases.\nThere were several cats (two enclosures in the cattery \u2013 one housing three adult cats and the other housing two adult\ncats - and one enclosure in the living room housing two kittens, of which had fresh, bright red blood in the stool) with\nunresolved diarrhea whereby the AV had yet to be notified of their condition. The diarrhea in all enclosures was the color\nand consistency of melted chocolate. The kittens housed in the living room enclosure were seen by the AV on January 5,\n2023, for diarrhea, among other things, that had yet to resolve. Both kittens (one of which had the microchip #:\n985141005230533) had thin body condition with body condition scores of 2.5-3/9 and exhibiting visible spinal processes,\nshoulder blades, and hip bones despite seemingly healthy appetites. The licensee was following a diarrhea protocol\nverbally agreed upon with her AV where she was actively treating the animals. However, the AV instructed her to contact\nhim if there was no resolution of the diarrhea after 5-7 days, and the licensee had not done so at the time of the\ninspection. Not contacting the AV for unresolved veterinary health problem within the timeframe directed by the AV\nprevents the AV from being able to properly address the health problems and increases the chances that the animals\u2019\nhealth will worsen and lead to severe discomfort, pain, or death. The licensee has a history of infectious diseases\naffecting her colony - of which some animals have perished - including, but not limited to coccidia, giardia, panleukopenia,\nand herpes. With proper veterinary care and other aspects of animal care as directed by the AV, said diseases are\npreventable. The AV has confirmed with the inspector that due to the licensee not following all his directions for veterinary\ncare and other aspects of animal care, the animals at the facility are at an increased risk of becoming seriously ill and\nperishing from preventable infectious diseases. Failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries can foster an unhealthy environment that contributes to the animals contracting preventable\ndiseases/conditions, delay the onset of diagnosing and treating ailments, and can consequently lead to unnecessary\nsuffering. Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. All cats that the inspector identified\nwith diarrhea need to be examined by a veterinarian immediately."
