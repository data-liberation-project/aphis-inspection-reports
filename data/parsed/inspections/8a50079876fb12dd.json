      "narrative": "During this inspection, the following animals and conditions were observed:\n- In the 5th pen of stack 8A, there is a brown, tan, and white guinea pig with hair loss near it\u2019s right eye.\n- In the bottom pen of stack 8A, there are 3 dead juvenile guinea pigs that have been partially cannibalized by the other\nguinea pigs in the enclosure.\n- In the bottom pen of stack 8A, there is a dead adult guinea pig.\n- In the 4th pen of stack 5A, there is a tan and white guinea pig with hair loss and moderate ulceration near the right eye.\n- Also in the 4th pen of stack 5A, there is a brown and tan guinea pig with hair loss and ulceration near the right eye.\n- In the 2nd pen of stack 3A, there is a tan and white guinea pig with hair loss on it\u2019s nose.\n- In the bottom enclosure of stack 2A, there is a decaying carcass of an adult guinea pig.\n- Also in the bottom pen of stack 2A, there is a light brown and white guinea pig with hair loss, crusting skin, and mild\nulceration near it\u2019s right eye.\n- In the top pen of stack 1A, there is a brown, white, and tan guinea pig with hair loss, crusting skin, and mild ulceration\naround both eyes.\n- Also in the top pen of stack 1A, there is a black, brown, and white guinea pig with hair loss and moderate ulceration near\nit\u2019s left eye and extending over it\u2019s nose.\n- In the 4th pen of stack 4B, there is a brown, tan, and white guinea pig with a markedly swollen left eye surrounded by\nmoderate hair loss, ulceration, and crusting skin.\n- In the top pen of stack 3B, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with marked hair loss, crusting skin, and ulceration\naround it\u2019s right eye.\n- In the bottom pen of stack 3B, there is a dead adult guinea pig.\n- Also in the bottom pen of stack 3B, there is a brown, tan, and white guinea pig with marked hair loss, crusting skin, and\nulceration around it\u2019s right eye.\n- In the 5th pen of stack 1B, there are two dead juvenile guinea pigs that have been partially cannibalized by the other\nguinea pigs in the enclosure.\nAll of these animals were still in their original enclosures at the time of inspection and had not been identified by the\nlicensee. Animals with missing hair were not separated as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care and treated with\nMiconazole Nitrate. Animals with ulcerations and the animal with the swollen left eye were also not identified, segregated,\nor discussed with the Attending Veterinarian.\nThe licensee was also asked about the animals identified on the USDA Inspection Report dated December 8, 2021. The\nlicensee stated that the Attending Veterinarian did visit on December 22, 2021 but the licensee only asked about the\nfollowing two animals:\n- The tan and white guinea pig with a right-sided head tilt (originally in the 4th pen of stack 2B) was examined by the\nAttending Veterinarian and antibiotics were prescribed. However, the Attending Veterinarian states that she instructed the\nlicensee to separate the animal and add the antibiotics to the water. At the time of inspection, this animal was still in the\n4th pen of stack 2B and had not yet received any treatment by the licensee as the water source in this pen is not treated.\nWhen the licensee was asked about the plan for treatment of the animal, he showed that the botte of antibiotics was still\nunopened (sealed) and he was unsure how to administer it even though instructions for adding to the water are included\nin the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal still displays a right-sided head tilt.\n- The Attending Veterinarian was asked to euthanize a guinea pig with severe ringworm. Records at the facility and a\ndiscussion with the Attending Veterinarian describe that it was a tri-colored male approximately three months of age. The\nlicensee stated that this animal was noted on the last inspection report as being the animal in the top enclosure of stack\n5A with a left eye that was sealed shut with crusting green mucous and missing hair around it\u2019s right eye and back. When\nthe Attending Veterinarian was shown a photo of this guinea pig, she could not confirm that this was the animal that was\neuthanized but did not recall any issues with the eyes.\nWhen the licensee was asked about the other animals included on the last inspection report, many of whom had\nulceration present with hair loss, he stated that they were all treated with the Miconazole Nitrate spray and returned to\ntheir enclosures as all of the lesions had cleared up. Only one guinea pig, listed on the last inspection report as having\nmissing hair on it\u2019s back and nose (initially in the 3rd pen of stack 5A and found in the same pen today) was located as it\nstill has hair loss on it\u2019s face and back. None of the other animals identified on the last inspection report were located\ntoday, despite the licensee\u2019s statements that all recovered with treatment and were returned to their enclosures.\nFinally, the licensee stated that a guinea pig listed on the last inspection report (top pen of stack 3A, tan and white guinea\npig with a left eye that was discolored yellow/green/white with a red border and thick, green mucous) was not seen by the\nAttending Veterinarian as the eye resolved on it\u2019s own without treatment and the guinea pig was returned to the pens. The\nAttending Veterinarian confirmed that she did not see this animal and does not fit the description of the animal she\neuthanized yesterday. When shown a picture of the eye, the Attending Veterinarian did not believe that this condition\nwould clear up on it\u2019s own without treatment.\nA failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the Attending Veterinarian can result in delay of\ncare, worsening of health issues, and further spread of disease. Instructions provided by the Attending Veterinarian must\nbe followed to prevent further pain and distress to the animals as well as limiting the spread of disease.\nCorrect by having the Attending Veterinarian exam all animals listed in this Inspection Report, observing all animals on a\ndaily basis, and following the instructions provided by the Attending Veterinarian, either given verbally or stated in the\nProgram of Veterinary Care, including the segregation of animals requiring antibiotics for a head tilt and topical\nmedications for hair loss."
