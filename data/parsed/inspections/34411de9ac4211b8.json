One alpaca, \"Demi\" has overgrown toenails on both front feet such\nthat they curl inwards towards each other and almost touch. If left uncorrected, overgrown toenails and hooves can\nlead to joint or foot problems. To avoid future problems a regular program of hoof/foot observation and trimming\nneeds to be maintained. Trimming should occur as frequently as is necessary to maintain a normal hoof and foot\nposture. Correct by June 19, 2017 then continuously thereafter.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager."
