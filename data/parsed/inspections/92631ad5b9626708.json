At this time two neighbors arrived and one went to his residence and called\nto him as his car was there, however no response. The second neighbor advised she would let Mr. Peveler know of\nour arrival and ask him to call us if she heard from him that day. A message was left on his voicemail to call this\ninspector in order to discuss best times of inspection and the option for there to be a second person that could be\ncontacted for inspections if he is unreachable. At this time there has been no contact made by the licensee to this\ninspector.\nPlease call 618-315-3649 ASAP AnnMarie Houser, ACI and leave all home and cell numbers that you can be\nreached and please leave any information of best times and days of the week for inspections. Thank you.\nAdditional Inspectors\nYager Cody, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
