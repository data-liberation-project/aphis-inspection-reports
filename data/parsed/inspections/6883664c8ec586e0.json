      "narrative": "***There was an adult male Maltese \"Tibits\"(#10 plastic collar, dog recently purchased, microchip # 057005780 on\ndisposition form) which was not bearing weight on the left front leg. On closer observation, the skin on top of the left\nfront paw was discolored reddish-purple and swollen. When the licensee picked up the dog and touched the left\nfront paw, the paw started oozing a blood like discharge. On top of the paw, there was an approximately 3 mm open\nskin lesion which was oozing a bright red bloody-like discharge. The lesion on the left front paw could be the result\nof injury, infection or a variety of veterinary medical conditions which may be painful. The licensee must have this\nanimal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that a accurate diagnose is obtained and appropriate\ntreatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary\ncare at all times.\nThe licensee had medications at the facility that were past the labeled expiration date. The expired medications\nincluded: Oxytocin injection (Expired 6/13), Exceed (Expired 7/12), Panacur (Expired 10/13), and Ivomec (Expired\n10/13). These medications were stored with other medications that were currently being used, and therefore ready\nto use. Expired medication may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated or harm the animals. Licensee\nmust establish and maintain a program that ensures medications are not used past their labeled expiration date.\nTo be corrected by: April 8, 2014.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
