      "narrative": "There were several enclosures housing rabbits that contained a heavy build up of dirt, grime, debris and/or hair.\nInside most of these enclosures there was a PVC pipe with access to water via a lixit in the back of the occupied\nenclosures. Portions of the flooring, PVC pipe and areas around the lixits, where animals access their water, were\nheavily soiled with a build up of dark brown to black material, excreta, hair and/or debris. Some of these enclosures\nhoused female rabbits with their litters and some contained singly housed adult rabbits. Also, there was a large\naccumulation of hair along the tops of these enclosures and some with hair on the fronts of the enclosures as well\nas around the feeders. At least one of the rabbits was heard sneezing. According to the licensee, the enclosures\nwere cleaned weekly, however, the regions with a build up of grime were in areas that were described as difficult to\nreach for cleaning. The build up of dirt, grime, debris and/or hair can increase the risk of disease hazards in the\nanimals. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs\nand other debris. To be corrected by: March 21, 2020.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
