Exposed pieces of sheetrock or holes\ncan also provide easy access for & could be used as a living area for any vermin that might be living with the dogs.\nCovering all chewed holes in the walls is necessary to ensure the health & well being of all dogs. To be corrected by\n06-12-15.\nAt time of inspection the east wall of the inside of the building around the hole had been scratched and was not\nimpervious to moisture. The sheet rock was exposed and needs to be sealed to prevent any deterioration of the wall\nwhere one adult dog is being housed. Wall needs to be covered with a material that is impervious to moisture or\npainted to protect the animal and the wall. To be corrected by 06-12-15."
