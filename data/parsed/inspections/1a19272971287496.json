Long nails\ncan pose a hazard to the dog if they get caught in the wire mesh. These nails need to be trimmed on a routine basis\nto prevent this issue. In addition, matted fur pulls and separates from the skin and can be painful and cause skin\nirritations. These dogs need to have these mats trimmed out and groomed more frequently to prevent this issue.\n*** A shitzu # 32 needs to be seen by the vet to evaluate the right eye which is blue in color with an upper eye lid\nthat is red and swollen.
