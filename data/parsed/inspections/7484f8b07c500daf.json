In most of the incidents, Chewy consumed at least part or all of the items including a lunchbox,\na baby shoe, toddler-sized shoe, adult human's glove, and toddler-sized baseball caps. According to facility\nrepresentatives, there has been no ill effect on Chewy from eating these unplanned items. The public barrier for this\nenclosure consists of metal wire panel fencing approximately 4 feet high that is intermittently lined in the front with taller\nwooden rods of varying height and allows guests to lean over and see down into the tiger enclosure. Because of this,\nguests can easily drop items or have their items blown into the tiger enclosure. Barriers between the public and\ndangerous animals should be effective including during reasonably expected weather conditions such as wind. During\npublic exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the\nanimals and the public.\nCorrect by 05 February 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
