On the night of 25-April-2022, Osborn and Bruiser were housed\ntogether overnight. These animals were placed together while maintenance was conducted on one of the main\nenclosures. On the morning of 26-April-2022, Osborn presented with a facial wound consistent with raking. At the time of\nthis incident, trainers were aware of negative interactions between these animals and had procedures in place to distract\nBruiser with enrichment items so Osborn could drink fresh water. It was determined at this point that these two animals\nwere incompatible to be housed together.
