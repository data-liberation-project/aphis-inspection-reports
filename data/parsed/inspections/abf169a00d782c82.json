The area presents several hazards for the animals. The motor\nvehicles present a risk of running over, or striking the animals when they are moving, and also the risk of leaking\nfluids, such as antifreeze, which is palatable and lethal to animals. Additionally the area includes some discarded\nitems, such as a roll of wire fencing and sheets of corrugated metal, which have sharp surfaces and an\nentanglement risk, and bags of trash in plastic bags which could be torn open and ingested by the animals.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical\nharm. Handling the animals in this manner - allowing them access to this parking area which was not intended as an\nanimal enclosure, puts the animals at risk of trauma or physical harm. The facility should ensure that the animals\nare handled in a manner which protects them from harm, and this includes safe surroundings in their enclosures.\nTo be corrected by 8/15/18.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
