      "narrative": "On the afternoon of 2 April 2014, a male black bear named \" Crybaby \" was found injured with a single 4-8 inch long\nlaceration located on his lower back. The attending veterinarian arrived that afternoon for initial treatment, which\nincluded suturing the wound. On 5 April, the facility discovered the wound had dehisced. On 14 April the wound was\nopen and bleeding heavily per facility personnel. The facility contacted the veterinarian and it was decided that\neuthanasia was the appropriate choice. The attending veterinarian arrived at the facility in the late afternoon of 15\nApril and the bear was euthanized.\nThe attending veterinarian physically observed this animal twice throughout the length of the treatment period, once\non the date of the original injury (2 April) and again on the date of euthanasia (15 April). When the sutures dehisced,\nthe licensee re-sutured the wound closed. The attending veterinarian did not re-evaluate the injury during this time.\nWhen the sutures dehisced a second time the veterinarian was called to euthanize the animal. When an animal\ndoes not adequately recover from an injury or respond to treatment, there must be timely and appropriate follow up\nexamination by the attending veterinarian so as to evaluate the health and welfare of the animal. Documentation of\nthe veterinarian(cid:25)'s follow-up evaluation or treatment shall be documented.\nThis was a focused inspection following an official complaint on an injured black bear. Inspection and exit interview\nconducted with facility personnel.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCunningham Debbie, Veterinary Medical Officer\nTygart Michael, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
