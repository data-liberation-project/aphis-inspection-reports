The inspector called veterinarian A, who confirmed they were the attending\nveterinarian of the licensee and it had been \"several years\" since their site visit of the facility. Failure to maintain a written\nprogram of veterinary care with a part-time attending veterinarian impedes the ability of APHIS Officials to carry out their\nduties in assessing welfare of animals and ensuring the licensee is giving appropriate authority to the attending\nveterinarian. Each exhibitor shall have an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements who shall provide adequate\nveterinary care to its animals in compliance with all components of 2.40. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian,\nthe formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises\nof the exhibitor.\nCorrect by 17 April 2024."
