The facility representative\nstated to avoid direct contact, pads and blankets were used between the patient and the electric heating pad. A water\ncirculating heating pad was initially used but began to leak and was replaced with the electric heating pad. Once the skin\nulcerations were observed, the veterinary staff was notified, and the pig was treated and given supportive care. The\nprincipal investigator has been advised by the veterinary staff to use water circulating heading pads on animals for heat\nsupport. The use of an inappropriate heating source may result in unexpected pain and distress to the animals.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected for all future inspections.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
