This is a potential source of injury to the animals, and also\nweakens the support pole. The pole must be repaired or replaced.\n- In the third enclosure of the western housing area, the wall of the shelter itself is damaged and most the wall\nsection is missing. This is not an effective shelter, and does provide adequate protection for the dogs. This wall\nmust be replaced and maintained.\n- On the north side of the main shelter building, two runs are missing the indoor/outdoor flaps. This allows wind and\nrain to enter the sheltered housing area and could negatively impact the animals. These weather flaps must be\ninstalled and maintained.\nAll items were corrected by the facility on the day of the inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nWhiteley Robert, Animal Care Inspector"
