Oral antibiotic treatment was prescribed by the AV and this animal, along with another from this site, had\nbeen transferred to site 001 by the licensee for monitoring and administration of antibiotics but no records were\nmade to show this was done and the animals had been sold by the licensee at the time of this inspection. There is\nno mechanism to determine that the animals were appropriately treated and had the veterinary condition resolved\nprior to release for sale.\n**A female hedgehog from site 001 noted on 9/23/15 to have lost a significant amount of weight (13% of total body\nweight) was transferred to this site by the licensee and had not been monitored nor reweighed to determine if she\nhad recovered. All four female hedgehogs on site were evaluated and weighed during this inspection. One female\nwith pinto markings similar to the one see at site 001 from Bin#43 on 9/21/15 and 9/23/15 weighed 390 grams which\nwould be improved if this is the same animal but there was no mechanism or records by which this could be\ndetermined.\nEach dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of\nemergency, weekend, and holiday care.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM."
