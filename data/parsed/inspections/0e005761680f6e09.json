The pigs had\ncircular lesions that were various color shades of brown to red and had a crusty appearance like seen with scabs.\nThe pig with ID number 5400644 had dime size lesions mostly around the eyes, mouth, and head. The pig with ID\nnumber 5399123 had an approximate 1 to 2 inch lesion on the right side of the neck along with several smaller red\nlesions on the inside of the left leg. The pig with ID number 5401772 had a cluster of approximately 1mm size\nlesions on the outside surface of the right hip. All three pigs were bright, alert, and responsive with no signs of\nsystemic disease. Other than occasionally scratching, the pigs did not appear to be in distress. The lesions were not\nexpected adverse reactions from any procedure. According to staff in charge of the pig's care, lesions were noticed\non 9/2/2014, but thought to be healing sores. At the time of inspection, the animals had not been seen by a\nveterinarian and were not being treated for any medical condition. The daily observation records were marked (cid:28)N(cid:29)\nfor normal for all three pigs the entire time the pigs were present at the facility. Delays in providing necessary\nveterinary care negatively impacts the welfare of the animal and can lead to the worsening of the original condition\nin addition to the development of secondary infections of the skin.

      "narrative": "On June 17th 2014, a group of three guinea pigs were found dead in a cage from preassumed drowning. The night\nbefore a staff member correctly recognized a leak in the cage(cid:25)'s watering system. The staff member thought she\nhad repaired the leak; however, the leak continued overnight and flooded the cage. On July 18th 2014, a guinea pig\ncage flooded overnight resulting in the death of one guinea pig. A similar incident was cited on the previous\ninspection report dated 19 August 2013. The facility must ensure the handling of all animals is done as carefully as\npossible in a manner that does not cause physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Proper training and functional\nwatering mechanisms must be in place to protect all animals from injury, discomfort, and death. Since the two\nadverse events, the facility identified both adverse events and reported it to OLAW while implementing changes to\nprevent similar occurrences. All animal care staff have been reminded the importance of inspecting the watering\nsystem daily and are now trained to immediately call cage wash staff, who are instructed that all cage repairs are\ntop priority, if there is a cage watering system malfunction. Also, the facility has contacted and hosted a cage vendor\nabout obtaining a more leak-resistant watering system along with contacting a vendor that designs acrylic blocks\nthat can be used by the animals to stand on to be out of the water should a cage flood. Furthermore, the facility is\nstarting nightly inspections of all guinea pig enclosures to prevent any water leaking from accumulating that could\nresult in a drowning. Although the IACUC is currently taking steps to minimize the chance of reoccurrence, the\ncurrent cage watering system is still a risk to the animals at this time.\nThe facility inspection was conducted on 9/3/2014 and the exit interview was conducted on 9/5/2014 with facility\nrepresentatives that includes the IO, AV, clinical veterinarians, IACUC members, and other animal care staff."
