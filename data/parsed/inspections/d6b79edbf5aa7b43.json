The licensee said that he noticed its poor condition yesterday (8/25) and that its dam\nprobably stopped letting it suckle but he was busy with other chores and hadn't attended to it. We had the licensee\nseparate it with its own food and water and explained he must contact the attending veterinarian for treatment\ninstructions. Delay in treatment of poor condition and an ear problem can cause discomfort in the rabbit and if from a\ncontagious cause could spread to other rabbits. Ensure that when health conditions are identified they are promptly\ncommunicated to the attending veterinarian and treatment instructions are followed.\nCorrect by: August 27, 2021\nIndirect Non-Compliances:\n*A pot-bellied pig in the back pen had a tusk (canine tooth) on its right side that has grown back and into its right upper\ncheek. Animal Care Inspector Rivera was able to gently and carefully push the skin back by the tooth and we could not\nsee where the point ended, although we didn't see any signs of infection or a wound. Pig tusks (canine teeth) grow\nthroughout their life and the direction of this pig's tusk growth will cause pain and health problems if not addressed.\nEnsure that this pig's tusk is thoroughly evaluated by the attending veterinarian and a treatment plan is made and followed\nto prevent future problems with this (and other) tusks on this pig.\n*An African-crested porcupine had problems observed in both eyes. The surface of each eyeball appeared pale in color,\nit had mild amount of pale-colored discharge in the corners of the eyes. The conditions we observed today indicate that it\nhas problems with both eyes. Ensure that this porcupine's eye conditions are closely evaluated and treated per the\nattending veterinarian's instructions.\n*A white goat housed with the Barbados sheep had an abnormally growing hoof (his right back hoof). An older red alpaca\nwas observed to have front toenails that are overgrown. The other alpaca's toes were seen to have been trimmed but this\none's nails didn't appear to have been trimmed. Overgrown/abnormally growing hooves in goats and toenails in alpacas\ncan cause gait abnormalities and lead to painful conditions. Ensure that these two animals' feet are trimmed by an\nexperienced and knowledgeable person and that a routine of regular trimming of hooves and toenails is completed and\nmaintained.\nCorrect By: September 1, 2021"
