Per the facility representative, their policy would be to fill out\nan incident report if the public member is at the least marked/scratched by an animal. There was no incident report made\nby staff concerning this encounter on this day. The positioning of the child and the wallaby without adequate distance or\nbarriers did not appear to assure the safety of the public or the animal. The public may be scratched or injured if the\nanimal unexpectedly becomes startled or stressed. Also, the animal may become injured when placed in this position and\nduring an unexpected harmful or stressful event.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the\nanimals and the public.\nCorrect by close of business 06/07/2023.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
