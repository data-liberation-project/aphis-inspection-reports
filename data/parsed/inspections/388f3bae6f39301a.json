They were housed on an\nisland-like peninsula in the tapir exhibit located in the Rainforest of the Americas exhibit; however, the design of this\nenclosure allows several areas or access points which would permit entry of un-authorized animals. According to a\nfacility representative, the remains of one tamarin was found, and despite repeated extensive searches of the\nsurrounding areas and hillsides, no evidence of the second animal has been found and it is now presumed dead.\nThe facility representative stated footage from the cameras in the area showed a bobcat carrying off one tamarin,\nheading in the direction of where the remains were found. The facility representative stated they have spotted a\nbobcat, but have been unsuccessful in capturing it. The remaining animals in the Rainforest of the Americas exhibit,\nincluding non-human primates and other mammals, are in closed enclosures and/or are brought in at night. The\nfacility has been actively trying to contain the bobcat and have sought and secured professional help. Increased\nsurveillance in this area after hours has been implemented.\nGiven that the bobcat is still loose, the facility cannot exclude the possibility of other animals being at risk. Failure to\nappropriately construct and/or design animal housing facilities which prohibit entry of unauthorized animals poses\nrisks or hazards to all animals at this facility. Housing facilities for non-human primates must protect the animals\nfrom injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. A system should be in place and\nmaintained to ensure this.\nTo be corrected from this day forward\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.\nAccompanied on inspection by Dr. Kathleen Garland, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGarland Kathleen, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
