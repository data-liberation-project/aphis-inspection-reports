      "narrative": "The facility has not identified 3 adult dogs with medical issues at the time of inspection.\n*King Charles Spaniel (microchip #7E1-007-1171) had matted ears and was in poor dental health. The left upper cheek\nteeth are completely encased in a hard, light brown organic buildup. The three teeth directly behind the canine tooth have\na layer of grey organic material at the gumline. The gums above these three teeth is also receded. Both ears had matted\nhair present that was close to the skin. The inspector could not observe the underlying skin. Matted hair and poor dental\nhealth may cause discomfort, pain and distress.\n*Red Poodle (microchip #941000022878551) was observed by inspectors frequently shaking his head. When examined\nby the inspectors, both ear canals had a buildup of dark brown organic material and hair so much that the ear canal could\nnot be observed. The facility representative was unaware of this dog\u2019s ear condition. This dog had last had its ears\ncleaned on 29-September-2022. Ears with a buildup of organic matter may be a sign of illness and cause the dog\ndiscomfort and pain.\n*Bichon (microchip #7E10064001) was observed by the inspectors to be holding its right rear leg up and hopping around\nthe enclosure. When examined by the inspectors, the toe pad had been partially torn away revealing reddened tissue.\nAdditionally this dog was found to be in poor dental health, the left upper cheek tooth (fourth premolar) was loose and\ntooth roots exposed. The gums surrounding that tooth were also red and inflamed. The facility representative was\nunaware of the limping or poor dental health in this dog. This dog had last received a dental cleaning on 4-October-2022.\nDogs with dental problems may experience pain while eating, may not eat enough, and can be stressed or uncomfortable.\nSkin problems can also cause pain and distress.\nThe facility has identified one adult dog in need of grooming on 20-February-2023 and has not completed the necessary\ngrooming at the time of inspection.\nMale Shih Tzu (microchip #93-304-100-004-644) was examined by inspectors and had at least two overgrown toenails\nthat were curled and touching the dog\u2019s toe pad. Additionally, this dog had several matts on its feet and belly and overall\ncoat was severely overgrown. Matted hair and overgrown toenails can be a source of discomfort and pain in dogs.\nThe facility is required to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in the\nregulated animals. The facility must ensure each animal receives adequate veterinary care and grooming at all times. The\nfacility must remove the matted hair from the above-mentioned dogs and have all four dogs evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian to access their health to develop an effective treatment plan. These medical records must be available for\nAPHIS inspection.\nTo be corrected by: End of Business 3-March-2023\nSeveral medications were found to be expired or had no expiration date:\n*Three bottles of Fish-zole- expired on September-2022 and December-2022\n*Ivermec mix- no expiration date\n*Three bottles of Pyrantel/Stongid- expired 13-April-2022\n*Secnidazole- expired October 2022\n*Dextrose- expired September 2022\n*22-gauge needles- expired October 2019\nExpired medications do not ensure that the medications are effective at treating disease or illness and the health of the\nanimal may suffer. Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and\ninjuries. The facility must ensure all medications are not expired.\nTo be corrected by: This was corrected at the time of inspection"
