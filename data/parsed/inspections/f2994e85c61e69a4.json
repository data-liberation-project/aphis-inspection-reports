The left front paw appeared swollen and was larger than the right front paw. On closer examination\nthere was a skin abrasion near the metacarpal pad. The animal put weight on the limb. The son of the licensee had\nidentified the injury earlier that day but no treatments were given and no veterinarian was contacted in regards to\nthe puppy(cid:25)s condition. According to the son, the puppy got its foot caught in between the food receptacle and\nflooring. The animal had discharge around both eyes, but was receiving treatment for the eyes according to the\nProgram of Veterinary Care. Animals not provided appropriate veterinary care will often not improve and will lead to\nthe worsening of the original condition along with secondary infections. Injuries to the foot often lead to secondary\ninfections and can cause permanent loss of function in that affected limb. All animals must be provided appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in a timely manner and all treatments must\nbe approved by the veterinarian either by the Program of Veterinarian Care or by direct communication. At the time\nof the exit interview the attending veterinarian arrived and treated the animal. Corrected at time of exit.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMchenry Kerry, Veterinary Medical Officer"
