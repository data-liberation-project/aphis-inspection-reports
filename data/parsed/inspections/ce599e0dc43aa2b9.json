One experimental group in this study is\nsubjected to a 48-hour fast (abrupt removal of food completely from an ad libitum feeding schedule) and the second\nexperimental group has their total daily food ration severely decreased. The abrupt nature of this transition is expected to\ncause more than momentary or slight distress not only to the nursing dam, but also to the puppies as their food supply will\nalso decline during that period (female\u2019s negative energy balance from lack of food is intended to decrease her milk\nsupply). The principal investigator did not address this as a source of distress for the female dogs or the puppies in the\napproved written protocol; as such, the protocol neither describes any means to alleviate this distress, nor scientifically\njustifies in writing the withholding of any such means.\nThe lack of this required information in the written protocol (reviewed and approved by the IACUC) prevents the IACUC\nfrom ensuring that the proposed activities related to the care and use of the animals will avoid or minimize discomfort and\ndistress to the dogs and puppies.\nCorrect by ensuring that the IACUC, for all future proposals, is able to determine that all proposed activities will avoid or\nminimize discomfort, pain, and distress when conducting a review of the activities related to the care and use of animals\nin order to approve the proposed activities.
