      "narrative": "Lesions were seen on two rabbits housed together in a wire enclosure:\n-One rabbit, light grey in color, had an approximately 1 inch in diameter circular lesion on his lower back right above\nhis tail. The area around the lesion was hairless. The top skin layer was missing exposing pink tissue below. A\nmoderate amount of yellow crusty material could be seen coating the lesion.\n-His cage mate, a tan and black rabbit, had a small circular white spot on the surface of his left eye. The skin\naround the eye was hairless and slightly reddened.\nThe licensee had not identified the condition affecting these two rabbits, therefore had not contacted the\nveterinarian for guidance on care. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and\ndistress in animals with such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be\nimplemented in order to properly assess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the\nattending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. These two rabbits need to be\nseen by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.\nTo be corrected by January 15th 2020."
