He said he called the AV and that over\nthe phone the AV presumably thought hypothermic shock that led to drowning was the cause of death. The climatic\nconditions that morning were likely a role in the tiger cubs' death. If climatic conditions create a threat to an animal's well-\nbeing, appropriate action must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions, such as preventing access to water\nfeatures that can become unsafe in winter.\nThe facility reported this incident to the USDA on 11/20/2022 and took immediate corrective action for the mother and\nremaining 2 cubs by preventing their access to the pond.\nCorrection: Ensure corrective actions are maintained to protect animals from unsafe conditions created by weather\nconditions.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd of Report\nn"
