      "narrative": "On 4 March 2025 there was a self-reported incident to the IACUC committee involving dairy cattle on an IACUC approved\nactivity. An animal caretaker noted on 4 March 2025 that 4 dairy cattle were left overnight in the head stanchions after\nreceiving teat dipping during the 3 March 2025 PM chores and room spray down. The cows were immediately let out of\nthe head stanchions the morning of 4 March 2025 and were observed with no lameness or cuts, but all went to the waters\nto drink. The caretakers did not double-check that the dairy cattle were let out after PM chores resulting in the cows\nhaving been restrained in the head stanchions for approximately 16 hours. Upon further investigation and review of the\nroom video, all 4 cows tried to get out of the head stanchions on and off until the lights went out at 6:00 PM. In the\nmorning at 6:00 AM, video showed one cow laying down with the feed bin knocked out of place and 2 other cows laying\ndown, but no video footage showed the 4th cow laying down. This lack of freedom of movement did not allow the cows to\nbe able to make normal postural and social adjustments, such as resting with its head pulled back alongside its flank and\na limited ability to groom the back of its body, along with freedom to access the entire primary enclosure and the waterer,\ncausing the animals distress as demonstrated by their behavior. Ensure that animals requiring short term restraint during\na research activity are released from restraint and provided enough space to allow each animal to make normal postural\nand social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. The incident documented above was investigated by the\nIACUC. Corrective measures had been implemented prior to inspection, to remain corrected from 8 May 2025 forward."
