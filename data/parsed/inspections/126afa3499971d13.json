Upon closer\nobservation, the cornea was blue, opaque and appeared to have a roughened area. She was squinting and avoiding\nsunlight. The licensee stated that Whiskey had been playing rough with another dog and the dogs were placed in\nseparate enclosures. The other dog had a slight injury and was taken to the veterinarian for examination. This eye injury\nwas not seen thus not provided with diagnosis and treatment. Eye injuries are painful and can quickly worsen if not\ntreated properly. Squinting is a significant indicator of pain and the discharge indicates that the eye is irritated. This dog\nmust be examined by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment. The medical records must be available for APHIS\nofficials upon request."
