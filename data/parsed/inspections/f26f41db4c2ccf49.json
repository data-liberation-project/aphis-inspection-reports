The document also refers to the overall good physical\nand behavioral health of the animals.\nA complete primate enrichment plan at a minimum should address social grouping and the physical environment in\nthe enclosure that is enriched to provide safe expression of species typical behaviors. Examples of environmental\nenrichment can include perches, swings and other cage complexities/furnishings, objects to manipulate, varied food\nitems, foraging or task oriented feeding methods and care-giver interactions.\nThe enrichment plan must be in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the\nattending veterinarian. Exhibitors must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environmental\nenhancement that demonstrates adequate promotion and maintenance of the psychological well-being of\nnon-human primates housed at the facility."
