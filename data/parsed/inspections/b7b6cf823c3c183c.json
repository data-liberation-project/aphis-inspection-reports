The ammonia in the air in the\nenclosure can irritate the eyes and airways of the ferrets causing discomfort to the animals and making them\nsusceptible to respiratory and eye infections. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as\nnecessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to\nreduce odors.\nCORRECT BY: immediately\nThis inspection done on 04 June 2019 and exit interview done on 05 June 2019 were conducted with facility\nrepresentatives."
