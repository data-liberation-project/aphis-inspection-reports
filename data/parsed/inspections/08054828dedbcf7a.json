This can be\na sign of dental disease which can be painful and contribute to health problems. The dog must be evaluated by a\nveterinarian to determine if treatment is needed. The dog also had matted hair under/around the eyes, the matting\ncan irritate the eyes and can contribute to eye problems. The owner must remove the mats and maintain the hair\ncoat in a healthy manner.\nThe attending veterinarian and licensee established a dental maintenance protocol for the kennel dogs on\nNovember 5, 2015. The protocol states that the licensee will bring in 1-2 adult dogs needing dental cleaning once\nper month. The licensee did not bring in dogs for dental cleaning in January and February 2016. The licensee must\nfollow the instruction of the attending veterinarian and follow the dental maintenance protocol to ensure that the\nanimals are receiving proper veterinary care and to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.\nAll dealers must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries."
