The other Prevost whose tail\nhad been amputated appeared to be in good health. The two additional Prevosts had normal hair and normal-appearing\ntails. The AV had not been made aware of the tail wound until after the inspector noted the wound during inspection.\nThe three wolves on the premises each have open wounds and thick crusty scabbing along the tips of their ears. These\nwounds appear consistent with chronic fly strike. An employee at the facility stated that staff flysprays the ears of the two\nmore compliant wolves almost daily with and applies SWAT ointment about once a week. One wolf cannot be handled\nwithout sedation so receives more limited care. The wolves were not under the medical care of the AV and no medical\ntreatment for the wounds had been prescribed at the time of inspection. The AV had not been notified about the severity\nof the flystrike wounds on these three animals at the time of inspection.\nUnresolved self-trauma and ongoing flystrike can result in significant distress and discomfort for the animals. Per the\nregulations, each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: Daily\nobservation of all animals to assess their health and well-being; Provided, however, That daily observation of animals may\nbe accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a mechanism of direct\nand frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior,\nand well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian."
