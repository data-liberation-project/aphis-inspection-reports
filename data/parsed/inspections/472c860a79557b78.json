The leg was noticeably swollen. On the inner upper part\nof the dog's arm, there was a small amount of hair loss with what appeared to be a scab or dried up blood. The\nlicensee had not noticed the dog was limping prior to inspection. A swollen leg can be painful and can lead to an\ninfection which can be deadly. The dog must be seen by a Veterinarian no later than 11-10-15.\nAnother dog, a Poodle (microchip #018-637-584), had a scab with hair loss on its left side. A scab with hair loss\nindicates the dog may have been injured somehow. Injuries can be painful and can become infected. This dog\nmust be seen by a Veterinarian no later than 11-16-15."
