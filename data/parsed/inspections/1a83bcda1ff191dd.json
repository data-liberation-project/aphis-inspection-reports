The facility owner when asked when the last dose was applied first\nstated (cid:28)in January(cid:29) and then later after the inspector showed her the PVC she amended it to (cid:28)in June(cid:29). The written\nPVC also states that all new (cid:24)Old World and New World monkeys(cid:25) should be TB (tuberculosis) tested when\nacquired. The facility has acquired 34 marmosets in the last couple of years (most of these in 2015/2016) from at\nleast three different facilities. No records of TB testing being done at this facility are available for review. One of the\nfacilities from whom 19 marmosets were acquired wrote a letter stating the marmosets came from a closed TB\nnegative colony however no testing was done at this facility. The attending veterinarian(cid:25)s office was contacted. They\nstated that their computer did not have any record of any TB tests conducted or Selemectin purchased. A written\nprogram of veterinary care completed by a facility(cid:25)s attending veterinarian states the measures to be used by a\nfacility to prevent and control internal and external parasites and contagious diseases such as TB. Failure to follow\nthe preventative measures may lead to disease and health issues. The facility shall ensure the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases as stipulated by the attending veterinarian in the written\nprogram of veterinary care.
