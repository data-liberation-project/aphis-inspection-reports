Closer observation showed that this dog has reddening of the gum line above the canine tooth and\nsome of the upper front teeth on the left side. These teeth were mostly covered with a dark colored substance. On\nthe upper right side there is reddening of the gum line above the cheek teeth and there are also small pockets of\nwhitish colored creamy substance at the gum line of these teeth. These teeth were also mostly covered with a light\nbrown to tan colored substance. As the inspectors were observing the mouth of this dog he was producing bubbles\nof a clear discharge from his nose. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease, can be painful,\nlead to the development of other health problems, and can inhibit the ability of the animal to eat normally.\nThe licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must\ndocument the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must\nestablish and maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 26 June 14\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nProctor Chad, Animal Care Inspector"
