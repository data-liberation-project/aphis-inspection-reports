      "narrative": "Several guinea pigs were identified at the time of inspection with problems of animal health.\n1. In the second rack of enclosures, there is one black and white adult female guinea pig in the second enclosure\nfrom the floor on the side of the row closest to the door with an abnormal right eye. This eye has a greenish white\nopaque area on the surface of the eye, taking up approximately 30-40% of the surface of the globe. The visible\nbottom half of the globe is red in color, and the redness appears to be on the inside of the globe itself. The fur\naround the eye is wet with clear discharge, and a small amount of opaque green discharge is present at the corner\nof the eye. These changes are consistent with a severe eye injury or infection. Eye injuries and infections are\nusually painful conditions that require rapid identification and treatment to ensure the provision of adequate\nveterinary care. This issue had not been identified by the licensee prior to inspection. There is a treatment plan for\nthis condition outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal was treated at the time of inspection.\n2. In the second rack of enclosures, there is one brown, tan, and white adult female guinea pig in the second\nenclosure from the floor on the side of the row farthest from the door with an abnormal right eye. The animal is\nobserved to be blinking more frequently over this eye and holding it partially closed intermittently. There is a small\namount of green disharge in the corner of the eye, and the fur beneath the eye is wet with a clear discharge. These\nsigns are consistent with an eye injury or infection, and the squinting and blinking is consistent with eye pain. This\nissue had not been identified by the licensee prior to inspection. There is a treatment plan for this condition outlined\nin the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal was treated at the time of inspection.\n3. In the weaning pens downstairs, there is one juvenile black and white guinea pig in the top pen on the side\nfarthest from the door with an abnormal left eye. The animal is blinking this eye more frequently and holding it\npartially closed in a squint. The fur around this eye is crusted with a clear to light tan discharge, and a small amount\nof green discharge is evident at the back corner of this eye. These signs are consistent with an eye injury or\ninfection, and the squinting and blinking is consistent with eye pain. This issue had not been identified by the\nlicensee prior to inspection. There is a treatment plan for this condition outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care.\nThis animal was treated at the time of inspection.\n4. In the second rack of enclosures, there is one tan and white adult female guinea pig in the second enclosure\ndown from the top on the side of the row farthest from the door with a patchy hair loss on her lower back. There are\nsmall areas of disrupted skin that are pink with a dark red crusted material over them, consistent with scabbed\nwounds. This problem had been identified by the licensee prior to inspection, but the licensee had not initiated\ntreatment according to the guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal was treated at the time of\ninspection.\nDaily observation to assess the health and well being of the animals must be conducted to identify health issues\nthat require treatment or veterinary consultation. Any health problems that are identified must be treated according\nto the guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care, or the veterinarian must be contacted to provide guidance, to\nensure the provision of adequate veterinary care. The licensee initiated the treatment according to the Program of\nVeterinary Care after these animals were identified by the inspector.\nCorrected at the time of inspection."

Many of these enclosures also\nshow wear along the edges of sealed wooden panels that has revealed raw wood surfaces, especially around the\nopenings for the waterers. The sanitation procedures and schedule are appropriate, but these worn and unsealed\nsurfaces cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized due to the rough and porous nature of the material. This has\nresulted in staining and warping of the wood where moisture has penetrated it and an accumulation of debris on the\nrough wood surfaces despite appropriate cleaning.\nPrimary enclosures for guinea pigs must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair, and they must be\nconstructed of smooth material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. These enclosures must be\nrepaired, modified, or replaced.
