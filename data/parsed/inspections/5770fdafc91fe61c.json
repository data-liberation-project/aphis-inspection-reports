Laboratory personnel told the APHIS inspector\nthat litters are separated from the dam between 21 to 30 days of age. The following issues were noted:\n*The dam weighed >100grams, 11 of the young weighed 60-80 grams, and 8 of the young weighed 80-100 grams. The\nenclosure provided 288 square inches of floor space, but the minimum amount of floor space required for the number and\nweights of hamsters housed in the enclosure is at least 290 square inches.\n*There was an area of bedding that covered approximately 1/5 of the available floor space, moistened from liquid waste,\nthat was compacted into a solid mass at least 3 inches deep. The interior height of the enclosure in that area of the\nenclosure was less than 6 inches.\nPer this Section, primary enclosures for hamsters shall provide a minimum amount of floor space per animal based on\ntheir weight, and the interior height of the enclosure shall be at least 6 inches. Provision of a sufficient amount of floor\nspace in the enclosure along with an interior height of at least 6 inches allow the animals to make normal postural\nadjustments with adequate freedom of movement. This item was corrected at the time of the inspection by separating the\nhamsters and placing them in enclosures that provided required minimum amount of floor space and interior height."
