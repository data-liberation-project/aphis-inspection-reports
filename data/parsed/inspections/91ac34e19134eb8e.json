The veterinarians and other staff were immediately\nnotified. The first veterinarian on the scene pronounced one rhino deceased.\nSince this incident the protocol for lock placement has been modified to prevent this from happening again. Retraining the\nzoo staff on the importance of checking locking mechanisms was also conducted.\nFacilities must be structurally sound and must protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
