      "narrative": "***There was an individually housed male English Bulldog (#0A0*202*4128) with a right eye that was red. Upon\ncloser observation, a cloudy bluish grey circular-like area was present on the central portion of the eye. The entire\narea of the eye that is normally white was red. The tissues surrounding the bottom portion of the eyelid also\nappeared slightly inflamed and red. A small amount of yellowish green crusty discharge was present mostly on the\noutside corner of the eye. The licensee stated she had been cleaning the eye out every couple days with a wet\ncloth to clean off yellow crust but this had not been done for a couple of days. When asked if the dog had been\nseen by a veterinarian for the right eye condition, the licensee stated that the dog had been seen by a veterinarian\n\"months ago\" for the right eye and it had been treated for a scratch on the eye. There was no documentation\nprovided by the licensee regarding the veterinarian's evaluation of this dog's eye condition. However, according to\nthe licensee, the attending veterinarian had also been onsite and had examined all the dogs on September 28,\n2015. There was written documentation from this onsite visit initialed by the veterinarian and it stated that there\nwere \"no problems\" under the notes section for this dog. The condition of this dog's eye could indicate an injury,\nillness or other veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable. The licensee must have this dog seen by\na licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan\nis developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals recieve adequate veterinary care a all times."
