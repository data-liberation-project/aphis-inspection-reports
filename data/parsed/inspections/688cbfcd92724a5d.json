The individual animal records reviewed do not clearly indicate\nwhy these animals remain singly housed. A structured program for the evaluation and re-evaluation of social\nhousing shall be developed. Any attempts at pairing, scientific justifications, veterinary exemptions, additional\nenrichment provided, etc. shall be clearly documented. The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted\nprofessional standards and must address the requirements as described in this Section of the Regulations.\nFocused Inspection conducted February 10 - 12, the exit briefing conducted on February 12, 2015 with the IACUC\nChair and the Vice President for Research.
