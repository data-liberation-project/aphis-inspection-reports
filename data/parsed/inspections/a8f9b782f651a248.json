A rodent was observed\nrunning across the floor, and many were heard running in the ceiling above, inside the off exhibit holding area for a\nmacaque, ring tailed lemur, skunk and opossum. A possible rodent burrow was observed inside the lemur's off\nexhibit enclosure. A rodent was observed on top of the housing unit for the muntjac's primary enclosure.\nRodents can carry parasites and various diseases that could compromise the health and well-being of non human\nprimates, as well as any other animals on exhibit. An effective pest control program must be established and\nmaintained to promote the health and well-being of the animals on exhibit and reduce contamination by pests in\nanimal areas.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
