It is possible the employees were\nsomewhere in the tent. The employee assigned to work the tent was difficult to identify due to the number of people in the\ntent and the fact that she is not easily identifiable as an employee. In addition, due to the number of members of the\npublic present at this travel site, one person did not appear to provide sufficient coverage to be able to monitor and\nobserve all the human/animal interactions that were going on in the tent. 6 employees were working to cover all the\nregulated animals that were on site. Three of the employees were working animal rides. One employee was bouncing\nback and forth between the animal rides and the main tent where the majority of the regulated animals were housed. One\nemployee was working in the main tent (northeast side of tent) where the majority of the regulated animals were, but she\nwas behind a table focusing on taking payment for feed to be handed out. With all the people and animals in the tent she\nwould not be able to adequately monitor the south side of the tent. Another employee (and only employee) had the\nprimary duties of working underneath the tent where the majority of the animals were housed. Not having enough\nemployees and not having the employees being readily identifiable as employees doesn't ensure animal/human safety for\nall the regulated animals that were present. If a member of the public were to get injured, they may not be able to find help\nfrom the staff in an adequate amount of time. All employees need to be easily identifiable and there needs to be a\nsufficient number of employee to be able to adequately monitor all the human-animal interactions going on.
