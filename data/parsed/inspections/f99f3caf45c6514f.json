Facility records noted that the kangaroo got\naway from caretakers on 10/31/24 while the group was being moved from their outdoor enclosure to inside a heated\nbuilding for winter. The facility knew where the kangaroo was within the perimeter fence but was unable to catch it until\n11/13/24. The attending veterinarian (AV) reported to us that the facility consulted him during the time it was out of its\nenclosure regarding its welfare, but was not involved in the capturing process. Facility representatives said on the\nmorning of 11/13/24, they were able to catch the animal by cornering and throwing a tarp over it; and then brought it\ninside and noticed that it was acting stressed and weak. According to the AV, the facility contacted him immediately and\nwere instructed to provide supportive care. The facility noted that they followed the AV's instructions, checked on the\nkangaroo often throughout the day and did not note problems, but it died around midnight.\nConditions that require wild and exotic animals to be captured are known to cause stress in the animals. Allowing the\nkangaroo to be out of its normal environment and group for 2 weeks while temperature lows approached freezing can\ncause unnecessary stress, discomfort, and illness. Ensure that movement methods (between different enclosures) and\ncapture methods are done with care to avoid conditions that cause behavioral stress and physical harm to the animals.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nSCOTT WELCH, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
