The 3rd upper left cheek tooth is loose and the gum line has receded from the surface of the tooth.\nThere is a white discharge along the gum line of the first few upper left cheek teeth.\nAdult, male, black and tan Yorkshire terrier with chip number 072 288 804 has a heavy accumulation of brown\nmaterial completely coating the entire surface of the upper and lower \"cheek teeth\" (premolars and molars) upper\ncanine teeth. The upper canine tooth on the right side is broken. The gum line has receded from the upper cheek\nteeth on both sides, exposing some of the tooth roots and a white discharge. This dog also was observed not\nbearing weight on his left forefoot when not walking. He would bear weight on the leg when walking but the gait was\nshort and \"choppy.\" Abnormalities in gait and limping can indicate possible injury and/or a painful condition.\nAdult, male, red Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with chip number 941000014848609 has a light accumulation of\nbrown material coating the upper cheek teeth. The gum line over the first two upper right cheek teeth has severely\nreceded away from surface of the teeth. The gum is red in this area and the redness extends into the inside of the\ncheek in the mouth. There is a build-up of discharge and foreign material along the gum line in this area as well.\nDental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the\nability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The licensee must have these animals\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on 5 May 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must\ndocument the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request."
