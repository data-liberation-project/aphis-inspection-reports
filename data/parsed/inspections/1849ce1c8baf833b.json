Gaps along the perimeter fence can allow unwanted animals to enter the facility and potentially\nharm the animals within. Also, if an animal escapes their primary enclosure, the perimeter fence may not be able to\ncontain the animal with these size gaps. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the\nfacility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the\nanimals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
