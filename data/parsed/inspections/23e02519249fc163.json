The cavies' indoor enclosure is still under construction, so the cavies have been housed in their\ntransport kennel container that is not large enough to adequately allow both cavies to walk around more than a few\nsteps at the same time if they wanted to. They also have little space to avoid walking in excrement in this small\narea. The licensee reported to be in the process of finishing the larger enclosure and planned to have them out into\nthe larger enclosure later this day. Housing animals in spaces that don't allow adequate movement could cause\nanimals discomfort and may lead to health problems for the animals. The facility must ensure that animals are\nhoused in areas with spaces large enough to allow adequate freedom of movement and allow normal social and\npostural adjustments.\nCorrect by 1/26/2016.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative."
