Brian was then able to push underneath the divider\nmesh and attack the two adult male black lemurs (named \"Buddy\" and \"Junior\") in the adjacent outdoor exhibit area.\nBoth lemurs received significant trauma and were transported to the veterinary hospital for examination and\nsurgery. One male lemur named \"Buddy\" survived the siamang attack after surgery (amputation of half of his tail)\nand treatment for multiple bite wound lacerations. The male lemur named \"Junior\" also had surgery and treatment\nfor his wounds, but died on January 10, 2015 due to complications from his injuries. \"Buddy\" has been moved to\nanother enclosure and it was stated that he will not be placed in the exhibit adjacent to the siamang exhibit.\nThe spacing (at approximately 12-15 inch intervals) and type of attachment device (hog rings) used to secure the\ndivider mesh to the frame in the outdoor exhibit area between these two different species of primates appears to\nhave been a factor this incident. The male siamang was able to loosen and/or remove several hog rings and push\nunderneath the divider mesh in order to attack the two lemurs in the adjacent exhibit. All enclosures housing\nnon-human primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species housed\ninside them, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. This is a Critical Noncompliance\nItem (NCI).\nInspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel."
