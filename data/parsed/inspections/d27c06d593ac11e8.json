Animals of Walton's Hollow were exhibiting multiple animals including 8 goats, 2 ferrets, 2 pigs, 1 cow, 1\nLlama/alpaca cross, 3 ducks, 4 chickens, 1 sheep, 2 guinea pigs, and 2 rabbits. An admission fee is charged to get in to\nthe Renaissance Fair. Exhibiting a combination of these species in these numbers is an activity that requires a license\nunder the AWA.\nAn application for licensure was received by USDA APHIS Animal Care in March/April 2022, but the applicant never\nscheduled a first prelicense inspection and has to date failed to obtain a license. Conducting regulated activity without a\nUSDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that APHIS officials can assess the care of the\nanimals. Continuing to conduct regulated activity without a license is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act. No\nregulated activities may be conducted until a USDA license/registration is obtained."
