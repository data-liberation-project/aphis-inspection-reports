The camel also had 2 small circular areas of hair loss (1 viewed from the back right, 1 viewed from the\nback right side) that appeared to be scabbed over sores on the right hip. The facility representative stated he had\nnoted the camel seemed thin but was eating well. The facility representative attributed the thin body condition to old\nage (the camel is approximately 16 years of age). The attending veterinarian had not been contacted nor had any\nother actions been taken to address the loss of body condition despite a normal appetite. Thin body condition can\nbe an indication of an underlying disease. This animal must be seen and evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, with\nwritten diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up plans, no later than 2/14/2014."
