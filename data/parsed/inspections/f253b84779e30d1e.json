Subsequently the\nchild(cid:25)s mother and father were able to jump into the enclosure and retrieve the child. The viewing wall is\napproximately 8 feet 3 inches from the ground inside the exhibit. According to the zoo staff, the two male cheetahs\nin the exhibit stayed to the back side of the exhibit and did shift into holding without issue. The observation deck is a\nlarge open area with an unobstructed view. There is a cement ledge with a wood slat extension that is between the\nchain link fencing. At the far right of the deck the inspector was able to reach over and touch the primary enclosure\nfence. The ledge has some small educational graphics but the area is very open and easily accessible for children\nto sit on or guests to place items. There is no signage deterring guests from sitting on this ledge. This exhibit was\npart of an overall zoo planning process last summer to have secondary containment and have Plexiglas installed in\nthe deck area. The glass has been ordered for this deck area but has yet to arrive and be installed. Due to the child\nfalling into the enclosure and the ability for the inspector to touch the primary enclosure fence to the right of the deck\nthere are insufficient barriers for this exhibit. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the guests and the\nanimals.\nCorrected at time of incident by blocking off the deck from guests. Will be corrected permanently when the glass is\ninstalled.\nThis was a focused inspection on the cheetah exhibit.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the executive director via phone prior to being sent this report."
