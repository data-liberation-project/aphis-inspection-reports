Upon examination of the upper holding pen, the keepers found a small hole at the\nbottom of the cage frame. The facility believes rust created the hole in the metal wire fence, which was not initially\nvisible to the staff because it was covered with rocks, dirt, and large pieces of bark chips.\nOn the morning of September 25, 2018, Digby was caught in a trap that was placed near his enclosure. He was\nseen by the attending veterinarian and no medical issues were reported.\nEnclosures for all animals must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in order to\nprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nThe staff has blocked the hole by securing an additional metal fencing to the base of the enclosure, ensuring any\nanimal housed in this enclosure cannot escape. The facility should continue to monitor all enclosures to ensure that\nthey adequately contain the animals housed within. A system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of\nfacilities must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of all animals.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
