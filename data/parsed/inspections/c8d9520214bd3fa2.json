Facility representatives stated that the injuries were sustained during anesthetic\nrecovery earlier in the day. When asked exactly how the pigs were injured, the member of the laboratory staff present\nduring the post-anesthetic monitoring relayed that, while padding and supervision were employed, the animals hit metal\nparts inside the recovery enclosure that were not padded while attempting to move and stand during recovery.\nFailure to provide safe conditions for post-anesthetic recovery resulted in four pigs sustaining self-induced injuries.
