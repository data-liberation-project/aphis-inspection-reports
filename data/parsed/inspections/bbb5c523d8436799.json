Failure to provide a sufficient number of appropriately trained personnel does not ensure a\nprogram of adequate veterinary care.\nAppropriate facilities and a sufficient number of trained employees are necessary for providing the adequate veterinary\ncare required for the proper husbandry, treatment, and maintenance of the health of the animals.\nEach exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the availability of\nappropriate facilities and personnel to comply with the provisions of the Animal Welfare Regulations and Standards."
