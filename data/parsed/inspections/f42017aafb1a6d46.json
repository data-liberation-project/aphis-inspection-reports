The primary symptom exhibited by the kangaroo is weight loss and little\nimprovement has been seen after treatment according to the licensee. There is no available diagnosis or current\ntreatment plan in place for this animal.\nDuring this inspection the kangaroo was noted to be thin with hip bones protruding and little visible muscle mass\nand body fat especially in the hindquarters and tail. General body condition appeared poor.The animal was initially\nsternally recumbent and when invited to rise by the licensee did so slowly and reluctantly and appeared unsteady in\na standing position.\nBecause the kangaroo has shown little improvement to prior treatment and continues to exhibit symptoms that can\nindicate compromised health status and/or continued illness the animal should be re-examined by a veterinarian\nand a new treatment plan formulated for ongoing care.
