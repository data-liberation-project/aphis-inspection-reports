The open wounds were dark red on the left side of the guinea pig that extended around to his rump. There were\nno records present that this animal was observed with wounds prior to this inspection. This animal was not on any\ntreatment plan and there were no medications on hand to treat these injuries. Animal was removed from the group\nenclosure and place in an isolation enclosure during the inspection. The current program of veterinarian does not address\nopen wounds. Licensee contacted a new veterinarian during the inspection on Wednesday and scheduled a veterinary\nvisit for the guinea pigs to be examined and to establish a new written program of veterinary care for the facility.\nAn adult black & white guinea pig in enclosure # 15 housed with 8 other adult guinea pigs was observed with hair loss on\nthe right side of the nose that was approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.\nAn adult brindle guinea pig in enclosure # 15 was observed with hair loss around the left eye approximately 1/2 of an inch\nin diameter. The underlying skin was crusty.\nAn older weanling tri-color (brindle, tan, and white) male guinea pig in enclosure # 59 housed with 39 other weanlings was\nobserved with hair loss on the bridge of his nose approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with\nscabs present.\nAn older weanling tri-color (black, tan, and white) guinea pig in enclosures # 59 was observed with hair loss above the\nnose approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.\nThere were no records to determine if these animals with hair loss, crusty skin, and/or with scabs were observed prior to\nthis inspection. There were no treatment records or medications present to treat these animals.\nA failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of\ncare provided to animals and can prolong animal health problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their\nhealth and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.\nThese 5 guinea pigs with veterinary conditions identified above require examination by a veterinarian to prevent\nworsening of the conditions and unnecessary suffering. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such\nexamination and treatment to APHIS officials upon request. Correct by November 1, 2021."
