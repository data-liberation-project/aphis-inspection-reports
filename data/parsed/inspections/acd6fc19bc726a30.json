Another rabbit which was not subjected to the procedure, did receive a pain medication.\nAccording to the protocol, Meloxicam (oral or SQ) will be administered once daily for 3 days postoperatively. A discussion\nwith the veterinarian confirmed it was not given per the protocol.\n- On February 23, 2023, there was a last-minute decision, that was approved by a DLAM veterinarian, to switch one rabbit\nfrom a non-survival to a survival surgery, which resulted in the rabbit not receiving the pre-procedure antibiotics as\nrequired by the protocol. According to the approved protocol, on the day prior to surgery, the rabbit will be given a\nprophylactic dose of Orbax antibiotic. Medical records reviewed for the rabbit confirm Orbax was not administered to the\nrabbit prior to the surgery and confirmed by the veterinarian. Medical records and discussion with the veterinarians\nconfirm there were no post-procedural complications due to the deviation from the protocol. Immediate correction action\nhas been implemented to prevent reoccurrence.\nFailure to follow the protocol\u2019s pre- or post-procedural directions may affect the health and well-being of the animals. This\nis a significant change regarding the care of animals in an ongoing activity that was not reviewed by the IACUC.

      "narrative": "On July 22,2022, two guinea pigs on a covered protocol were placed in a temporary holding cage for a terminal procedure\nconducted by the DLAM veterinary staff. According to the facility, precautions were taken to ensure the safety and well-\nbeing of the animals while awaiting to undergo this procedure. Although precautions were taken, approximately two hours\nafter these animals were moved to the temporary cage, it was discovered that a single cage containing the two guinea\npigs had not received sufficient airflow, resulting in premature death of the animals due to asphyxiation. Failure to use a\ncage with appropriate airflow, for an extended period of time, may have caused these animals to experience behavioral\nstress and unnecessary discomfort before death. The veterinary staff immediately reported the incident and has taken\ncorrective action to ensure temporary holding cages have lids with larger openings to increase airflow. Handling of all\nanimals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,\nexcessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nOn January 23,2023, research personnel inadvertently mixed up the number identification for two rabbits on an approved\nprotocol. One rabbit underwent a procedure but did not receive its required dosage of Meloxicam as stated in the protocol,\nhowever, it did receive an alternative post operative analgesic for pain control by the DLAM. Another rabbit which was not\nsubjected to the procedure did receive a pain medication. Failure to accurately identify and handle the rabbits may have\npotentially caused one of the rabbits to experience unnecessary distress, pain or discomfort following the procedure. The\nDLAM has since taken appropriate corrective measures to prevent this from reoccurring.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected by close of business June 7, 2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nTYLER FIELDS, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
