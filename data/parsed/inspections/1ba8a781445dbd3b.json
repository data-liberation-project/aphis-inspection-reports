Skin conditions with colored\ndischarge can be the indication of an infection and may be painful to the animal. The licensee shall have the dog\nevaluated by a licensed veterinarian to obtain a written diagnosis and treatment plan. Follow up care should be\nprovided as prescribed and recorded in the animal's health records. TO BE CORRECTED BY:3/16/2016\n**There were 5 un-weaned Pug puppies that were born on 2/11/2016. The cage card on the outside of the\nenclosure listed that the dam had given birth to 7 puppies and 3 of the puppies were noted to be deceased. While\nthe licensee had not recorded the dates the puppies had died she stated that they were at least two weeks of age\nwhen they died. She described the puppies as being smaller in size than the rest of the litter but was unsure for the\nreason for death as, they were never evaluated by a veterinarian or provided additional care. One of the 5\nremaining puppies was 1/2 the size of its litter mates and appeared lethargic and weak. It's litter mates chewed on\nits ears and repeatedly climbed over its body rolling the smaller puppy around while it remained motionless. When\nthe inspector asked the licensee why there were 7 puppies listed on the cage card, 3 of which were marked as\ndeceased and there were 5 puppies remaining, the licensee and staff explained that they \"expected the small puppy\nto die soon\". The licensee and staff were not providing any individualized or veterinary care to the puppy. The\nlicensee shall provide adequate and timely veterinary care to all animals at the facility. The licensee was verbally\ninstructed to contact a licensed veterinarian and provide emergency veterinary care to the puppy immediately. TO\nBE CORRECTED BY: 3/14/2016\nNote: The licensee left during the inspection to take the puppy to the veterinarian and the inspector confirmed care\nwas received.\n*** On 3/2/2016 an adult English Bulldog named \"Casper\" was taken to the attending veterinarian for a lack of\nappetite. The veterinarian documented the animal as having a body condition score of a 3/9 and confirmed the dog\nwas positive for whipworms. The licensee was instructed to provide Fenbendazole, clean, and feed a high protein\ndiet. The licensee stated she provided Fenbendazole for 6 days, as well as feeding the dog raw hamburger on the\n6th day. On the 7th day the dog was found dead with blood draining from its rectum. Upon further inspection it was\ndiscovered that the licensee has been mixing her own Fenbendazole wormer by using a large tube of Safegaurd\nBeef and Dairy Cattle paste wormer (100mg/g) and diluting it with tap water. The licensee had no formal instructions\nfor adding water to the worming mixture and the attending veterinarian had not authorized its use. Mixing or diluting\nmedications can alter their desired effect and potency. The licensee shall provide prescribed care as directed by the\nattending veterinarian by using appropriate medications in their desired formulation. TO BE CORRECTED\nBY:3/16/2016"
