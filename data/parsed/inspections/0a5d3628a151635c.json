      "narrative": "The protocol titled \"Dissecting the Neural Control of Social Attachment\" includes a surgical procedure on voles that\nwould be expected to cause moderate pain. In the protocol there is a section describing post-operative analgesia,\nbut it is worded in a way that is unclear as to whether additional doses of analgesia will be administered after\nsurgery. Two staff veterinarians were asked to read the section, and explain its intent, and they disagreed on its\ninterpretation. A review of surgical records between November 2015 and May 2016 showed that ten voles did not\nreceive any additional analgesia following embryo transfer surgery, and this omission of post-op analgesia is not in\naccordance with the institution's document titled \"LARC Veterinarians' Guidance for Pain Management for UCSF\nLaboratory Animals\".\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) must ensure that protocols include a clear description of\nprocedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be minimized whenever possible, in order to\nsafeguard the well-being of the animals under study.\nAssessment of adequate pain management to be completed immediately, and protocol issue to be corrected by\n8/17/16.\nThis inspection was conducted on 6/13/16 and 6/14/16 by Veterinary Medical Officers P. Smith and M. Schnell.\nOnly the Parnassus Complex facilities and animals were inspected during this inspection. Overall program and\nprotocols reviewed.\nAn exit interview was conducted with the facility's representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
