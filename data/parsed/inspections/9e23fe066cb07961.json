      "narrative": "A male, black and white Shih Tzu (ID number 10) has severely cloudy eyes. Closer examination revealed a\nbrownish crusty material around the right eye and a yellowish mucus covering nearly the entire surface of the right\neye. The surface of the left eye also has a mildly brown discoloration with blood vessels present on the surface of\nthe eye. The white of both eyes is mildly reddened.\nThis dog also has a severe build-up of a thick, yellow/tan material encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth\nand about half of the surface of the canines and front teeth. The majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot\nbe visualized due to the excessive build-up of the yellow/tan material. All of the gums are severely red and swollen\nand in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth. The hair surrounding the mouth is mildly wet due to the dogs\nexcessive drooling.\nThis dog had been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian on August 27, 2015 for poor eye health. The veterinarian\nhad prescribed Vetropolycin and the licensee stated that they had been putting it in the dog's eyes once a day but\nwere no longer using it. The tube of Vetropolycin that was shown to the inspectors was half full.\nOne female, grey and white shih tzu (ID number 30) has a severe build-up of a thick, grey/tan material encasing all\nof the upper and lower cheek teeth and nearly half of the surface of the canines and front teeth. The majority of the\nsurfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the grey/tan material. All of the\ngums are severely red and swollen and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth. In many areas of the\nmouth, there is a creamy discharge present along the gum-line. The hair surrounding the mouth is severely wet due\nto the dogs excessive drooling.\nDental and eye conditions such as these can be painful and/or distressful to the animal and may lead to further\nhealth complications. Both animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that\nan accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,\nincluding the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the\ninspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.\nExit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Heather Cole, VMO and the facility representative\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
