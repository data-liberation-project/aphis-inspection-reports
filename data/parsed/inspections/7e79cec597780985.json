There was one individual working with\nthree rabbits under varying stages of anesthesia. One rabbit was lying in a plastic container, presumably recovering from\nanesthesia. Around the corner, the technician was working with two other rabbits. One of those rabbit was in an induction\nchamber and the other was fully anesthetized on the procedure table being maintained with a mask and inhalant\nanesthesia. When entering the area, the rabbit in the plastic container appeared dead.\nThe protocol for this procedure states:\n\u201d Animals will be placed on a warming pad following removal from anesthesia and continued visual monitoring will be\nperformed until the animal is recumbent.\u201d\nThe SOP for procedures involving anesthesia for the facility states:\n\u2022 The animal must be monitored carefully during the surgical procedure: i.e. the animal\u2019s respiratory rate and\ncharacteristic, response to noxious stimuli (e.g. tail pinch, toe pinch), and when possible heart rate and body temperature.\n\u2022 The animal may not be left unattended anytime during surgery.\nAccording to the attending veterinarian, anything involving anesthesia is consider surgery and falls under this SOP.\nThe rabbit in the plastic container did not have a warming pad and was not being monitored continuously since the\ntechnician was working with 2 other rabbits around the corner. There were no records or notes indicating that heart rate or\nbody temperature were being monitored.\nDuring the walk thru of one of the rabbit rooms, the cage card for a rabbit that had recently undergone a procedure was\nreviewed. The cage card indicated an Azlet Pump had been replaced for the 3rd time. The protocol for this procedure\nstates \u201cA syringe pump may be used with any of the above injection techniques to precisely control article delivery\u201d.\nThere was no mention of the pump needing to be replaced or the time frame for the replacement in the protocol. When\nthe attending veterinarian was asked about this procedure, he was unaware that the pumps were being replaced.\nThe facility needs to ensure the principal investigator for these protocols is conducting activities in accordance with the\ndescription of that activity outlined in the protocol and approved by the IACUC.\nTo be corrected by: July 25, 2022\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
