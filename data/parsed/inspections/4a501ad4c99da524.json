      "narrative": "Appropriate methods were not used to diagnose and treat a male California Sea Lion in December 2014. The\nanimal was found dead on December 30, 2014.\nFacility records show that the animal first exhibited signs of diminished appetite on December 18 and refused to eat\nthe following day. Calls were made to several veterinarians on 12/20 and the attending veterinarian dispensed an\noral antibiotic recommended by a consulting veterinarian on that day. On 12/22 facility staff contacted the attending\nveterinarian to ask about an injectable form of the antibiotic, however no change in medication was made at that\ntime despite the fact that the animal would not eat and thus was not able to take the medication. Additional calls\nwere made to both the attending and consulting veterinarians over the next several days regarding the facility's\ninability to administer the medication, but no action was taken beyond trying to feed a different type of fish on 12/26.\nThere is no record that a veterinarian observed the animal during the 11 days he was sick. No physical examination\nor diagnostic tests were ever performed to determine a cause for the illness or provide an appropriate treatment. A\nnecropsy was performed and the report stated that the animal died of severe, chronic pneumonia.\nAnimals with health concerns should receive prompt veterinary care that is appropriate for their circumstances. In\nthis case, while treatment was attempted, the animal ultimately did not receive any treatment. Appropriate treatment\nin this case may have prevented the death of the sea lion. The facility should ensure that prompt and appropriate\nveterinary care is provided for the remaining animals.\nCorrect immediately for any future animal health concerns.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative."
