The licensee provided first aid and then took to animals to the Attending Veterinarian\u2019s (AV) clinic\nwhere they were hospitalized. The AV was contacted and reported that the two animals were severely dehydrated,\nemaciated, hypothermic (low body temperature), hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) and not responsive upon presentation at\nher clinic, with one animal markedly worse than the other. Despite aggressive medical interventions, one kinkajou\ndeteriorated and was euthanized the night of February 13th, 2023. The second animal remains hospitalized in intensive\ncare. The licensee brought two additional kinkajous (cage mates of the first two) in to the veterinary clinic on February\n13th, 2023 at the AV\u2019s request and these animals were observed by the AV to be extremely thirsty and were given fluids\nby mouth before they were sent home.\nAccording to the owner, the facility had been short staffed for approximately 1 week before February 13th. After this\nincident, the licensee determined that the staff member in charge of caring for the kinkajous had not been adequately\nfeeding or watering them.\nStaff members who not adequately trained and/or supervised may neglect or improperly care for animals. Animals who do\nnot have adequate food or water may suffer from thirst, hunger, weight loss, dehydration, or even death.\nCorrect by February 15, 2023 by ensuring that an adequate number of properly trained employees are utilized to maintain\nprofessionally acceptable levels of animal care and husbandry. Animals must also be fed and watered adequately, and\nhandled carefully, in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.\nThis inspection was conducted with the facility manager and exit interview was conducted with the owner.\nn"
