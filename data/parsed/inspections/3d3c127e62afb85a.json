No dog shall be offered for transport before 56 days (8 weeks) of age.\nRemoving animals before this age can cause additional stress and may increase the animal(cid:25)s likelihood of\ncontracting a disease or becoming ill since young puppies immune systems have not fully developed before this\ntime. The licensee must ensure that birth dates are crosschecked properly before offering a puppy for sale or\ntransporting, to prevent animals from leaving the premises before they reach the required minimum age.
