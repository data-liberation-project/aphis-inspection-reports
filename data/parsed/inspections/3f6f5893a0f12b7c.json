      "narrative": "One female black and white shih tzu (Microchip # 047 375 552) has excessively long toenails and was seen walking\ncautiously with a slight limp in her hind end. Nearly all of the toenails on both back feet are excessively long and are\ncurling back under the foot pads. The nails either touch or nearly touch the underside of the pads. Some of the pads\nare excessively thickened/roughened where the toenails are touching and a few of the pads have indentations in\nthem from where the toe nail is pushing into the pad. The licensee trimmed the toenails at the time of inspection.\nNearly all of the cheek teeth have a moderate amount of dental tartar covering nearly the entire surface of each\ntooth and the gums appear mildly red and swollen. Two of the cheek teeth on the lower right side of the mouth are\nseverely covered with thick dental tartar and the teeth move easily when touched. The gums below these teeth are\nseverely pulled back from the surface of each tooth. The licensee has documentation that the dog\u2019s teeth were\ncleaned in April 2016, but there is no documentation that the teeth have been observed since that time.\nOne female shih tzu (Microchip # 839 321 845) has a cloudy right eye. The entire eye is mild to moderately cloudy\nand there is a small indent/defect located in the middle of the eye. The defect on the surface of the eye is circular\nand is just slightly larger than the head of a pin. The white of the eye is mild to moderately reddened. The animal is\nexcessively tearing and the hair around the eye and on the top of the muzzle is wet and matted together.\nConditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. The animals listed above\nmust be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an\nappropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and\nresolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee\nmust ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times."
