The panels were observed not to be secure with the\nbinder twine and there are wide gaps between the ends of the panels. Enclosures that are not properly maintained\ncould allow animals to escape or cause injury. Enclosures must be maintained so that they are structurally sound\nand are free of sharp points, loose panels, and loose wire.\n**The climbing structure that is in the larger of the two goat enclosures housing six goats was observed to have\nseveral rotted boards, missing boards, and exposed nails on both of the ramps and the bridge connecting the two\nramps. Structures that are not properly maintained could cause injury to the animals. The climbing structure must be\nmaintained so that it is structurally sound and free of sharp points and missing boards.\nCorrect By: October 15, 2014\nInspection and exit interview conducted with manager."
