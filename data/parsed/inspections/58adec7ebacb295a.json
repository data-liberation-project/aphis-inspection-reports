One was\nremovable, but the other was not, which would make it very difficult to clean. This box had unidentifiable debris\ninside. Both had interiors comprised of bare plywood, which cannot be readily cleaned and disinfected.\nAll surfaces in the housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be\nadequately cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces should be kept in good repair and maintained or replaced on a regular\nbasis, in order to facilitate adequate cleaning and disinfection, and to protect the animals from harm. Peeling paint\nand corrosion could present an ingestion risk, could threaten structural integrity, and impede adequate cleaning and\ndisinfection. Bare wood nest boxes cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected.\nThis issue has been cited previously, with correction dates previous to this inspection.\nAn exit interview was conducted with the facility representative."
