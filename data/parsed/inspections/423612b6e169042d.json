The first protocol included a terminal blood collection of ferrets. The approved protocol,\nPROTO201800250 dated 5/12/21, specified sedation with ketamine at a dosage of 10-30 mg/kg. However, on 5/6/22 it\nwas discovered a higher dosage was being utilized in the study than in the approved protocol during investigation of 2\nferrets that died after sedation and prior to euthanasia after terminal blood collection. The cause of death of the 2 ferrets\nwas undetermined. The IACUC reviewed the matter and approved an amendment to the protocol dated 6/28/22 which\nincreased the dosage of ketamine to 20-50 mg/kg. There were no further deaths of ferrets reported after the protocol\nchange. The second protocol, PROTO202001688 dated 1/21/21, specified capture of a particular species of vole,\nsouthern red-backed voles, for use in a study. However, on 7/8/22, it was discovered that, in addition to red-backed\nvoles, another species of vole, meadow voles, were also captured and used in the study. The IACUC reviewed the matter\nand approved an amendment to the protocol dated 8/2/22 which changed the study to include capture of voles to include\nany species.\nMaking changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC to perform adequate\noversight into the use of animals for medical research.\nCorrect by 11/11/22 by allowing the IACUC to review and either approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval of\nproposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC representative.\nn"
