      "narrative": "*** A cavalier # H73 in the whelping area had matted fur behind the ears and along the back legs. The dog also had\nlong nails that need to be trimmed and tarter build up on the teeth and along the gum line. Matted fur pulls away\nfrom the skin and can be painful and cause skin irritations. Long nails can begin to splay outward or could curl under\ninto the pad of the foot. Grooming needs to be done on a routine basis to prevent these conditions and for the\ncomfort of the dogs.\n*** A dog in the whelping area with puppies identified as # 169 \"Wendy\" had spray \"Blu-Kote\" on all four feet used\nto treat inter-digital cysts. This spray was also on the fur along the nipple region where puppies nursed. The\ndirections on the bottle state that \"the dogs should not be allowed to lick the sprayed area\". Although this spray was\nidentified by the vet as a treatment for cysts, since the manufacturer of the spray does not advise animals having\naccess to lick it, another option should be used on dogs that are in the whelping room. This needs to be addressed\nfor the safety of the puppies.\n*** Additionally this dog # 169 has red, inflamed gums and extensive tarter along the teeth and gum line. Dogs #\nH73 and # H77 also have mouths where the gums are receding, red and irritated with extensive tarter along the\nteeth. The current program of vet care states that dogs indicated to have teeth in this condition considered Grade\nIII/IV should have a dental cleaning performed by the veterinarian. The licensees have not contacted the attending\nveterinarian about a dental cleaning for any of these dogs and is not following the instructions of the vet. These\ndogs need to be assessed by the vet and plans made for the care of their teeth.\n*** Three dogs # C71, #187 and # C38 were all observed shaking their heads repeatedly and # C71 was scratching\nthe back side of the ear and had a small open wound. The licensee's are currently treating with a 50 percent dilution\nof apple cider vinegar and water. The licensee's state that the ears seem to have gotten worse since she started\ntreating the ears. The program of vet care states that apple cider vinegar may be helpful but that a 50 percent\ndilution of white vinegar and water should be used or Oti-clear for the ears. Ear infections, ear mites and yeast build\nup are all very uncomfortable conditions as seen by continuous scratching and head shaking of these dogs. The\nlicensees are again not following the attending veterinarians guidance in the PVC for treatment of the ears and has\nnot communicated that the current treatment is not working to receive further guidance. This needs to be addressed\nfor the well being of the dogs.\n*** The program of vet care states that the facility should have a quarantine area for dogs coming to the kennel. The\nlicensees recently took back a puppy that was gone for several weeks with pink dye on the fur and put it back into\nthe puppy room with other puppies. The quarantine procedures stated in the program of vet care are not being\nfollowed which are in place to protect all the dogs in the kennel.\nThe program of veterinary care for this facility is extensive with a lot of guidance for the care of the dogs given by\nthe attending veterinarian. The licensee's are currently not using the program of care as directed or communicating\nwith the attending vet conditions of the dogs. This does not assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate\nauthority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and does not use appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This needs to be addressed for the welfare of the dogs in the\nkennel.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHadjis Tonya, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
