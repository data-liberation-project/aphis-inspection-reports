According to the licensee the attending veterinarian has evaluated and\nprovided a treatment plan in the past. It was unclear at the time of inspection how long ago the treatment was\nadministered. The licensee found an expired medication bottle containing a mixture of a steroid and antibiotic\nsolution from 2011 that was used for treating the eye after it was evaluated by the veterinarian. The inspector called\nthe attending veterinarian for additional information. The veterinarian stated it had been awhile since she had\nexamined the eye on this dog. The veterinarian also stated she recommended the dog be seen and a treatment\nplan be administered. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, trauma, etc and can\nbe painful. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian an appropriate treatment plan administered.\nDocumentation should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must\nbe part of this documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all\ntimes.\nTo be corrected by: October 13, 2014."
