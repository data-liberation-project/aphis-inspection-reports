He began to talk to a zoo visitor, and opened the \"shift door\" which gave the primates\naccess to the holding area.\nThe male primate hit the door and it sprung open, allowing the male monkey to escape from the holding area. The\nstaff member immediately closed the door, slid the slide bolt closed and put the pad lock back on, which secured\nthe door. The female was now securely contained. However, the male was now loose on the zoo grounds.\nThe male monkey was successfully re-captured by zoo staff after 2.5 days loose on the zoo and park grounds. The\nanimal sustained no injuries while he was loose nor during the re-capture.\nPrimary enclosures for non human primates must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the\nnonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.\nTherefore, safety procedures / protocols must be reviewed with all staff members.\nA different door knob mechanism may also need to be considered by the facility.\nThese corrective measures are important to ensure the safety and containment of the animals.\n***To Be Corrected By: June 25, 2016\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the licensee."
