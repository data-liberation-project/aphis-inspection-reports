The facility representative stated\nthat he believes that she has had a miscarriage. It is unknown whether the substance is stool, vomit or another\ndischarge. This dog was also limping on her left front leg. Upon further observation, there was a pad that had a\nlaceration. She also had an area on the top of her head approximately the size of a quarter in diameter that had hair\nloss. This area was red and appeared to be wet in the center. The facility representative stated that \"she had a little\nhot spot.\" Hair loss is an abnormal situation that could indicate a serious medical condition. Loose substances\nwithin the enclosure can be an indication of a serious medical problem. Limited weight bearing or non-weight\nbearing limbs are an indication of discomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the risks of further deterioration if\nnot properly diagnosed and treated or left if left unattended.\n***There was a female Rottweiler, identified as #4 \"Damsel\" that had a raised area on the top of her head\napproximately the size of a quarter in diameter and raised approximately .5 centimeter. Raised areas can be an\nindication of a serious medical condition and could cause pain or discomfort to the animal.\nThe licensee must have these three animals evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by July 22, 2014, follow the\ntreatment plans and assure that all regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.\nThis inspection began at 1115.\nThe inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.\nEnd of report.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRoberts Kelly, Animal Care Inspector"
