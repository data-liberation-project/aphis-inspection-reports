Exotic\nanimals, especially prey species such as opossums will often hide or mask pain and going off food was a clear indicator\nthat the animal was not feeling well. She was seen by the AV on June 23rd when the vet was at the facility for rounds in\nwhich she was found to have a tongue swollen with ulcers and she was bloated. Notes indicate the AV was concerned\nwith her kidneys and that she may be in renal failure. The facility provided subcutaneous fluids and Baytril IM. The rest of\nthe day she was very lethargic and could not hold herself upright, her breathing became shallow by the evening, and she\ndied overnight.\nDirect and frequent communication about her behavior and condition should have been provided to the AV in a timely\nmanner and if the vet was not able to provide care to the animal including humane euthanasia after her condition was\nassessed, the facility should have sought out emergency care to reduce suffering. The facility must correct this going\nforward and a mechanism of direct and frequent communication must be conducted so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. This is to\nassure a timely diagnosis and treatment can be implemented for the welfare of the animal."
