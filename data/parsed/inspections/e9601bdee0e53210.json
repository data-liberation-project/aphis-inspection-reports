      "narrative": "-The outdoor facility housing adult dogs contains ground enclosures with chat-like gravel flooring. The majority of\nthese outdoor enclosures have flooring that is wet and mud-like in a large portion of the enclosures. According to\nthe National Weather Service, there had been a light rain, fog and/or mist in the area for much of the previous day\nand into the morning of inspection. Many of these enclosures also had large chunks of frozen ice, which had been\nremoved from the water receptacles and left inside the enclosures to melt. Many of the dogs housed in these\nenclosures had dirty and very wet fur mostly on their paws, legs, chest and on abdominal areas. It appeared difficult\nfor some of the dogs to walk through the enclosures without walking in the wet and muddy flooring. When dogs' hair\ncoats become wet and dirty it can decrease the comfort and well-being of the animals, increase the risk of\nhypothermia as well as increase the risk of skin lesions and other disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that\nall primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that all the dogs remain clean and dry. To be corrected\nby: January 11, 2018.\n*Note - The two Maltese (0A02492440 and 037890890), the Dachshund (0A02093065) and the Schnauzer\n(0A02624979), which were included on the report for the October 25, 2017 inspection under 2.40 (b)(2), had been\naddressed.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees."
