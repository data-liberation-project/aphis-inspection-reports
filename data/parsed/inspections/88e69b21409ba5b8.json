Multiple episodes of variable duration, at least one over thirty seconds, were observed during inspection of the\nholding facility.

The\nfacility shared that it takes a variable amount of time to resolve over the course of the winter and the zebra is otherwise\nhealthy. The Attending Veterinarian shared that they were alerted to the problem when it first arose, at which point no\nintervention was deemed to be needed, but no updates have been given since. Recurring repetitive behaviors, however,\nespecially in response to environmental changes, may indicate psychological stress and failure to communicate changes\nor recurrence may limit the veterinarian's ability to provide updated guidance towards control or treatment. The facility\nmust provide for timely and accurate information on animal problems with the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by December 5, 2024."
