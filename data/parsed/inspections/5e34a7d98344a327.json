The licensee transported \u201cYukon\u201d\nto the attending veterinarian. Despite veterinary care, \u201cYukon\u201d was found dead the following morning.\nFailure to address potential concerns of housing reindeer together during rutting season can result in animal injury or\ndeath. The licensee must ensure that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Licensee.\nn"
