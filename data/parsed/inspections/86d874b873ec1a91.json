During this show, a licensee brought a five month old, female, brown bear named 'Dottie' out of the transport\nvehicle and onto the stage. The bear was wearing a 1\" wide, red nylon-type dog collar around its neck. A black\nleash was attached to the collar and was being handled by a licensee. During the exhibition, the bear was observed\nstruggling and did not seem accustomed to/acclimated to the collar restraint being used. The bear was trying to pull\naway from the handler, tossing its head and biting at the leash. Additionally, the bear appeared distressed and was\ntrying to bite the handler. When asked about the weight of the bear, a licensee stated that it weighed about 65 lbs.\nA wild animal that size, especially when distressed and trying to bite, cannot be adequately controlled with a collar\nand leash. The struggling and biting at the collar are signs of behavioral stress.\nHandling of all animals shall be done expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. During public exhibition animals must be\nhandled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.\nTo be corrected this day forward.\nInspection and exit interview was conducted with licensees at the Linn County Fairgrounds in Central City, IA."
