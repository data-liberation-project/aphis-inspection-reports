The run-in shelter had large holes in the interior wall of the\ndouble-wall construction on the west (back) and north sides.\nThese holes are large enough to allow for a limb of an animal to become entrapped in the cavity between the walls.\nThere is also what appears to be rigid insulation in the cavity that does not appear to fill the entire cavity, which can\ncontribute to an entrapment, or could possibly be consumed by the animals.\nHousing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.\nThis was corrected immediately, on the same day as the facility inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted on December 19-20, 2018 with facility personnel."
