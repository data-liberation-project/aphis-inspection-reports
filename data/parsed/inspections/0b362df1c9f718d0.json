The perimeter fence was constructed of 6-foot-tall wire mesh (secured\nby metal T posts) that, per the licensee, goats in the pasture surrounding this enclosure push on, which has created\nmultiple bowed areas in towards the lemur\u2019s outdoor portion of their sheltered enclosure. The bowed in areas were\nobserved along three sides (front and both sides), such that in some areas, the perimeter fence was only 29 inches away\nfrom the primary enclosure and 60 inches high from the wire mesh being pushed in and/or down. Also, by the access gate\ninto the lemur enclosure, the fence was damaged creating about a 12 x 12-inch hole in the mesh approximately 2-3 feet\nfrom the ground. The lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility due to an\ninadequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures, or a sufficient\nbarrier to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The facility must ensure that the outdoor area of their sheltered\nnonhuman primate housing is enclosed by an adequate perimeter fence, 6-feet tall, that is constructed so that it restricts\nunauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or under it and having\ncontact with the nonhuman primates.
