The following areas were identified during this inspection\nto be damaged or lacking adequate maintenance:\n*The concrete floor adjacent to the marine mammal food storage freezer door and frame is damaged and missing\npieces on the exterior side. Continued deterioration of the floor can affect structural integrity and functionality of the\nfreezer. Holes in the floor prevent adequate cleaning and trap debris that could be tracked into the interior surface of\nthe freezer contributing to food contamination. The floor should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: March 31,\n2018.\n*The concrete floor on the exterior side of the marine mammal work room is painted. The paint is damaged, peeling\nand chipped adjacent to the work room door. The damaged floor can inhibit appropriate cleaning and loose paint\nchips can be tracked to animal areas and accidently ingested. These consequences could compromise animal\nhealth. The floor should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: June 30, 2018.\n*The metal latch on the exterior side of the main door to the animal exhibit area is obviously rusted with significant\npitting and structural compromise noted. Continued deterioration could cause the latch to fail and compromise\ncontainment of the animals. The latch should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: January 31, 2018.\n*The metal wheel casters on both stainless steel tables in the kitchen area were rusted with resulting flaking of the\nmetal. Excessive rust can inhibit the required level of cleaning and sanitizing in the food preparation area. The\nwheel casters should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: January 31, 2018.\n*The large metal brackets on the wall of holding room 3 are excessively rusted with resulting flaking of the metal.\nThe brackets are no longer used for any purpose and can be removed according to the facility. The large metal\ngates in this room are also excessively rusted at the bottom. The metal gates are used for animal containment.\nBreakage or failure of the gates could cause injury to the animal. The gates should be repaired or replaced. Correct\nby: March 31, 2018.\n*The bottom of the metal door on the training kennel used for the harbor seals is rusted with pitting and flaking of\nthe metal noted. Damage to the door could cause injury to the animal or compromise containment. The door should\nbe repaired or replaced. Correct by: January 31, 2018."
