Although a dental plan was written and some of the dogs had dental cleanings, the dogs\nhave not all been checked and graded and there is no follow up of the dental plan at this time.\nSome measures to treat the water that can help in the prevention of dental problems have been taken, although\nthese can help in the initial cases of dental disease are not a solution for advanced cases.\nLicensee shall trim nails on all dogs. All the dogs in the kennel shall be checked by the attending veterinarian for\ndental issues and grade, also a plan for the dogs with dental issues must be documented.
