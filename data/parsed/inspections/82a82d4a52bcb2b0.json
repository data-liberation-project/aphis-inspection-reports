The skin did not appear to be red or irritated. The licensee stated the animal had\nbeen evaluated by a veterinarian in February of this year but there was no supporting medical documentation. The\nlicensee stated that the hair loss has worsened since the evaluation by the veterinarian. Hair loss can be an\nindication of bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections as well as a psychological stress. This prairie dog must be\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment\nplan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector\nupon request.\n**** To be corrected by 8/5/2014."
