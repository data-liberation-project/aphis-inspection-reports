      "narrative": "In the facility, there were a number of animals the licensee identified as having a medical condition that had not\nbeen evaluated by a veterinarian:\n-One black and white rabbit had a 90 degree head tilt, referred to as wry neck by the licensee that was creating an\nabnormal posture and gait. Three more rabbits were observed with the same condition. These rabbits were not\ngiven medications. If their condition worsened, the licensee stated that the rabbit will be euthanized. The licensee\nexplained that he tried treatment in the past on other animals with the same condition, per the veterinarian\u2019s\nrecommendation, but that did not work. When the inspector spoke with the veterinarian, he explained that he had\nrecommended treatment with fenbendazole, dexamethasone and vitamins. The veterinarian was not aware that the\nlicensee was no longer using this treatment and was not consulted on the new method of care.\n-One grey rabbit was identified at the time of inspection with an excessive accumulation of thick brown crusty\nmaterial in the right ear that was being held low. The licensee referred to the condition as being caused by ear\nmites. Two more rabbits were observed with the same condition. The licensee treated these rabbits with pour-on\nivermectin during the inspection. The veterinarian did not advise the licensee on this method of treatment and was\nnot aware that the facility\u2019s rabbits were affected with this condition.\n-Several rabbits were heard sneezing throughout the facility. The licensee explained that he has given treatment in\nthe past for respiratory disease per the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation but found that many affected and treated\ndied. At this time, the licensee did not communicate this respiratory incident with the veterinarian, was not treating,\nand was contemplating forgoing treatment.\n-The licensee is supplementing his water with hydrogen peroxide as a preventative measure that was not approved\nby the veterinarian.\nThe licensee has not sought veterinary care for these animals and is not currently treating or preventing medical\nconditions per a veterinarian\u2019s instruction. This could lead to inappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose\nand treat diseases that can be detrimental to animal\u2019s health and well-being.\nIn cooperation with his attending veterinarian, the licensee must develop an adequate program of veterinary care\nthat includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nCorrected at the time of exit briefing."

Additionally, there\ndoes not appear to be a mechanism in place for direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian. During the\ninspection, the following animals were identified in need of veterinary care, of which the licensee was not aware and\nwas not treating:\n-One black and white rabbit had a 90 degree head tilt towards the right resulting in abnormal posture and gait. A\nsticky yellowish opaque liquid was seen oozing out of his right eye. The skin around the eye was red and appeared\nirritated and inflamed.\n-A white rabbit, huddled up in a corner, appearing lethargic, had a large amount of thick sticky yellowish opaque\nliquid oozing out of a mostly shut left eye. A significant amount of yellowish crusty material was attached to the top\nand bottom eyelid. The skin around the left eye was red and appeared irritated and inflamed.\n-Another white rabbit had thick sticky yellowish opaque liquid oozing out of a mostly shut left eye. The skin around\nthe eye was red and appeared irritated and inflamed.\n-One white and tan rabbit, that was heard sneezing, had white opaque mucoid nasal discharge covering his right\nnostril.\n-One tan rabbit had dried white mucoid discharge and hair mats around his nostrils\n-One grey rabbit had an excessive accumulation of thick brown crusty material in the right ear that was being held\nlow.\n-A tan rabbit was found dead in his enclosure with fecal staining around his anus and the back of his hind limbs.\nIn addition to the rabbits listed above, two more rabbits were seen with a moderate amount of dried brown opaque\ndischarge staining the area about the nostrils and two more had an excessive accumulation of thick brown crusty\nmaterial in an ear that was being held low.\nThe conditions affecting these rabbits were not identified by the licensee, therefore the veterinarian had not been\ncontacted and care had not yet been provided. Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment\nand causes undue pain and distress in animals with conditions such as these listed here.\nA more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to assess their health and\nwell-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and\nadequate medical attention. The currently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an appropriate\ndiagnosis and treatment plan.\nTo be corrected by October 14, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and Dr. Heather Cole, Supervisory Veterinary\nMedical Specialist, by phone conference.\nA second exit interview will be conducted in person next week to discuss non-critical non-compliances."
