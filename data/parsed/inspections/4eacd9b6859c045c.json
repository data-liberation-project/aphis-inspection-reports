      "narrative": "A macaque was found to have necrotic lesions at three of six subcutaneous injection sites of an experimental\nsubstance. The facility(cid:25)'s follow-up to this incident determined that the animal received a series of six subcutaneous\ninjections instead of a single intramuscular injection as was described in the approved protocol. An additional\ndeparture from the approved protocol was that the injection sites were not shaved. Shaving the area was to allow\nobservation of the site post-injection.\nThe protocol also states that the clinical veterinary staff was to be notified when the injections were given and the\nIACUC was to be notified regarding the results of the study at 72 hours post-injection. A facility representative\nstated that the veterinary staff was not notified until 3-4 days post-injection and the IACUC was not notified until four\ndays post-injection.\nThis incident resulted in injury to the animal and delay in evaluation and treatment.\nThe facility must ensure that from this day forward all significant changes to protocols are reviewed and approved\nby the IACUC prior to implementation by the Principal Investigator and research staff.\nCorrection date: The facility corrected the NCI prior to the time of inspection by retraining all personnel involved in\nthe incident on the importance of following a protocol exactly, as well as on the chain of communication for working\nwithin and between departments to ensure all experimental procedures are conducted according to approved\nprotocols.\nThis adverse event was self-reported to OLAW.\nA high incidence of alopecia was reported on a previous inspection report. The facility's alopecia incidence was\nreviewed as well as supporting documentation regarding their extremely comprehensive investigation into potential\ncauses and, therefore, remedies for the cases of alopecia at the facility.\nThe inspection was conducted on March 24-26, 2015, accompanied by facility representatives.\nThe exit briefing was conducted on March 26 with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
