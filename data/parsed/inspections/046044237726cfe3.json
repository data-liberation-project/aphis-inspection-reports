The dog allowed his head to be petted but was continuously\npulled away when his mouth was touched. Showing discomfort, he pawed at my hand when I was taking\nphotographs.\nThe female Bichon had moderate tartar build up and had upper incisors with pronounced root exposure. Several\nincisors moved when touched. The gum around the incisors bled when touched. The dog allowed herself to be\npetted but continuously ducked her head in discomfort and tried to pull away while examining her mouth.\nBoth dogs had been examined over a year on 12/2/16 by the attending veterinarian. No dental disease was noted at\nthat time. The licensee had scaled the dog\u2019s teeth on 8/25/2017.\nAppropriate methods must be used to treat, control and diagnose dental disease in your dogs as the condition can\nbe painful and cause further systemic illness.\nThe veterinarian arrived at the end of the inspection for reasons unrelated to the inspection. He was able to\nexamine the dogs. The veterinarian agreed the dogs needed treatment. The animals are scheduled for treatment\nwith the veterinarian for next week.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee's wife"
