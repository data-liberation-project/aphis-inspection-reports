The giraffe is confined to the barn when the outside temperature is\ntoo cold, which could potentially last multiple days depending on the weather. In a barn this size, the current\namount of lighting is not sufficient. This lack of light could potentially affect the giraffe's mental and physical\nwell-being. It also hampers the ability of facility personnel to properly clean the area, and to adequately evaluate\nthe giraffe.\nThis affects one giraffe.\nIndoor housing facilities shall have ample lighting, by natural or artificial means, or both, of good quality, distribution,\nand duration as appropriate for the species involved. Such lighting shall be uniformly distributed and of sufficient\nintensity to permit routine inspection and cleaning. Lighting of primary enclosures shall be designed to protect the\nanimals from excessive illumination.\nCorrect by May 26, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nTygart Michael, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
