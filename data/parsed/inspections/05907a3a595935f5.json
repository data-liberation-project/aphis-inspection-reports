The (NHP) was freed and taken immediately for evaluation by a\nveterinary technician. A veterinarian assessed and initiated treatment a few minutes after presentation to the\nveterinary technician. The NHP responded to initial treatment but later developed neurological signs. The NHP was\neuthanized based upon the follow-up veterinary evaluation. The necropsy and histopathology revealed signs that\nappeared consistent with the entrapment and subsequent events.\nThe facility installed a device to decrease the side-to-side movement of the PVC pipes of the perch. Their\nevaluation of other perches did not reveal any similarly affected. All other perches were evaluated to assess\nstability, the potential for entrapment, ease of sanitization as well as to identify and prioritize possible refinements of\nthe perches. They have instituted a policy of daily checking of perches for damage, wear or\ninstability.\nPrimary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound for\nthe species of nonhuman primates contained in them. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so\nthat they protect the nonhuman primates from injury\nCorrected prior to this inspection.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nForbes Diane, Veterinary Medical Officer"
