      "narrative": "During the inspection, the licensee knowingly provided USDA Officials false information regarding the veterinary care for\ncertain animals and fraudulent documentation of a program of veterinary care. USDA Officials identified a female\nGeoffroy\u2019s cat with generalized hair loss on the left side of its body, a squinting right eye and a small, scabbed wound\nwithin a dime sized area of alopecia over the right eye. The licensee stated that he had taken the cat to be examined by\nthe AV for the generalized hair loss a few months ago. He said the attending veterinarian attributed the hair loss to\nbehavioral issues associated with the loss of the animal\u2019s male partner. Later discussions with the AV contradicted the\nlicensee\u2019s claims; she had not evaluated the cat and the licensee had not contacted her regarding this animal. The\nlicensee stated that his attending veterinarian conducts regular site visits and that those visits usually take about an hour.\nThis was difficult to believe since the inspection with USDA Officials took approximately over 2 hours just to view all the\nanimals on the property. The attending veterinarian later denied that the licensee regularly requests annual site visits and\nthat she is usually called for the occasional animal wound or abnormality. Furthermore, the licensee stated that his AV\nhad observed an obese male jaguar several times and suggested that the solution was to cut back his diet. The AV\nexplained that she had been called to the facility one evening to evaluate an injured male lion and had never physically\nseen an obese male jaguar. The licensee had mentioned in passing that he believed the animal was overweight, and she\nsuggested the first start would be to cut back his diet. No further follow up or thorough examination was conducted by the\nAV. Ultimately, discussions with the AV revealed that she had not been given a program of veterinary care to review and\nsign in over two years. The agreement as explained by the AV was that the licensee was supposed to alert the\nveterinarian whenever he acquired a new species of animal that was not included on the current program of veterinary\ncare. She would then create a PVC specific to the new species. This review had not been conducted in approximately two\nyears. Therefore, the PVCs provided during previous inspections have been fraudulently provided to USDA inspectors for\na variety of species that the licensee has recently acquired. Furthermore, the licensee asked the AV if a veterinary student\nwere to create the PVC, would she feel comfortable reviewing it and signing off. The AV agreed to that suggestion but has\nyet to receive a PVC to review.\nKnowingly providing false information and fraudulent programs of veterinary care impedes USDA Officials ability to\naccurately assess animal welfare as well as the facility\u2019s ability to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals in its\npossession. Not only are these actions in violation of this section, but they also impede the working relationship between\nthe licensee and the inspector. From this point forward, the licensee must cooperate with the inspection procedure."

      "narrative": "During a follow-up discussion with the attending veterinarian, the AV admitted that she had not reviewed or signed any\nprograms of veterinary care for the licensee in over two years. USDA Officials reviewed the licensee\u2019s program of\nveterinary care for the species listed on the property \u2013 specifically the sections regarding the spotted hyena and the\nprairie dogs. The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian had reviewed and created these documents for these\nrecent animal acquisitions. The suggested vaccination schedule included a yearly rabies vaccine; when USDA Officials\nasked if the attending veterinarian was comfortable with him giving vaccines, the licensee replied \u201cYes.\u201d\nDuring the inspection, USDA Official identified a female Geoffroy\u2019s cat with generalized hair loss on the left side of its\nbody, a squinting right eye and a small, scabbed wound within a dime sized area of alopecia over the right eye. The\nlicensee stated that he had taken the cat to be examined by the AV for the generalized hair loss a few months ago. He\nsaid the attending veterinarian attributed the hair loss to behavioral issues associated with the loss of the animal\u2019s male\npartner. The licensee admitted that the eye abnormality was new and had not been identified previously. Later\ndiscussions with the AV contradicted the licensee\u2019s claims; she had not evaluated the cat and the licensee had not\ncontacted her regarding this animal. Furthermore, two geriatric female tigers were observed with ocular issues, neurologic\nsigns and slim body weights. The licensee was asked if a quality-of-life discussion regarding these two animals had taken\nplace with the attending veterinarian; the licensee did not respond. When asked if the attending veterinarian had been\ncontacted regarding an obese male jaguar, the licensee explained that she had seen the animal several times and simply\nsuggested cutting back the jaguar\u2019s diet. The licensee further commented that he had reached out to other facilities\nexhibiting the jaguar\u2019s siblings and said that those siblings also had weight issues. The attending veterinarian later\nexplained that she had never physically examined a male jaguar but did admit that the licensee had asked her what he\nshould do for an obese jaguar. She suggested cutting back his diet but was never asked to conduct a physical evaluation\nor thorough workup for the animal.\nMost importantly, discussions with the attending veterinarian identified a complete lack of communication between the\nlicensee and the attending veterinarian regarding proper veterinary care, nutritional and supplementation requirements,\ninternal and external parasite control, and other aspects of animal care and use. The licensee does not have regularly\nscheduled visits by the attending veterinarian to the premises and routinely disregards the AV\u2019s medical advice. For\nexample, the licensee previously contacted the attending veterinarian regarding a limping cougar. The AV requested that\nthe licensee bring the animal into her clinic; however, the animal was never transported to the clinic. No follow up\ninformation regarding the animal\u2019s condition was communicated to the attending veterinarian. Additionally, the AV feels\nthat the licensee\u2019s current facility is not conducive for performing proper routine physical examinations that would\nnecessitate sedation and immobilization. There are no squeeze chutes or small lock outs where an animal could be safely\nsedated and evaluated. Conversely, the licensee is unable to transport the larger and more dangerous animals to the\nveterinary clinic for necessary medical care.\nAn authentic & current written program of veterinary care was not available for inspection. Abiding by a program of\nveterinary care that has not been reviewed and approved by the facility\u2019s attending veterinarian withholds adequate\nveterinary care from animals in the facility\u2019s care. Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal\narrangements that include a program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.\nAdditionally, the exhibitor shall assure that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary\ncare and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. The exhibitor shall provide the availability of\nappropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to comply with the provisions of this subchapter. A mechanism\nof direct and frequent communication must be maintained so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal\nhealth, behavior, and well-being must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by March 22nd, 2022."

The licensee admitted that the facility occasionally uses volunteers with previous exotic animal\nexperience but could not provide any documentation of their previous experience or volunteer paperwork. One of the\nmore frequent volunteers was identified by the licensee as a veterinary student at the local CVM and had a provisional\npermit to work under the licensee\u2019s state permit. After speaking with admissions at the local CVM, this individual was\nidentified as an undergraduate pre-veterinary student with no formal veterinary training. The second frequent volunteer\nhas over 5 years of experience as a zookeeper at a USDA regulated facility. There was no paperwork identifying\nexperience requirements for these volunteers, their duties and responsibilities or any SOPs for handling and interacting\nwith the animals on the premises. The licensee also admitted that some of the individuals depicted in the social media\nphotos are former or current employees of other USDA regulated facilities but are not employees or volunteers for Single\nVision. Furthermore, the licensee allows family members, personal friends and other exotic animal exhibitors to interact\nwith dangerous animals over 12 weeks of age without being under the direct control of a knowledgeable and experienced\nanimal handler. At approximately 12 weeks of age, dangerous animals, such as tigers, lions, bears, and wolves become\ntoo big, too fast and too strong to be used public contact.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public\nwith sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of\nanimals and the public. The facility should ensure the well-being of both parties by not allowing members of the public to\nhandle potentially dangerous animals. Additionally, the facility\u2019s volunteers and/or employees should be readily identifiable\nand have the appropriate documentation showing their training/experience with handling dangerous animals.\nCorrect prior to the next public interaction."

She suggested cutting back his diet but was never asked to conduct a physical evaluation \nor thorough workup for the animal. \nMost importantly, discussions with the attending veterinarian identified a complete lack of communication between the \nlicensee and the attending veterinarian regarding proper veterinary care, nutritional and supplementation requirements, \ninternal and external parasite control, and other aspects of animal care and use. The licensee does not have regularly \nscheduled visits by the attending veterinarian to the premises and routinely disregards the AV\u2019s medical advice. For \nexample, the licensee previously contacted the attending veterinarian regarding a limping cougar. The AV requested that \nthe licensee bring the animal into her clinic; however, the animal was never transported to the clinic. No follow up \ninformation regarding the animal\u2019s condition was communicated to the attending veterinarian. Additionally, the AV feels\n\nthat the licensee\u2019s current facility is not conducive for performing proper routine physical examinations that would \nnecessitate sedation and immobilization. There are no squeeze chutes or small lock outs where an animal could be safely \nsedated and evaluated. Conversely, the licensee is unable to transport the larger and more dangerous animals to the \nveterinary clinic for necessary medical care. \nAn authentic & current written program of veterinary care was not available for inspection. Abiding by a program of \nveterinary care that has not been reviewed and approved by the facility\u2019s attending veterinarian withholds adequate \nveterinary care from animals in the facility\u2019s care. Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal \narrangements that include a program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor. \nAdditionally, the exhibitor shall assure that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary \ncare and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. The exhibitor shall provide the availability of \nappropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to comply with the provisions of this subchapter. A mechanism \nof direct and frequent communication must be maintained so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal \nhealth, behavior, and well-being must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian. \nCorrect by March 22nd, 2022. \n2.131(c)(1)  Critical\n   \nHandling of animals. \nThe licensee exhibits dangerous animals in a manner that does not pose minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the \npublic and without sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure \nthe safety of animals and the public. \n\u2022 On January 4th, 2022, a member of the public posted a series of photos on social media of herself interacting with a \njuvenile black jaguar at the licensee\u2019s facility.

There is an additional photo that shows an adult male \npublic member standing next to a juvenile white lion on a wooden platform. There is no method of direct restraint (i.e. \nharness or collar) or an established public barrier in the photos with the public members and the lions. \n\u2022 On July 16th, 2020, a member of the public posted a video of himself on social media interacting with an adult male bear \nat the licensee\u2019s facility. The bear was contained in its enclosure; however, the public member was allowed to stand close \nenough for the bear to allegedly reach through the enclosure wire and remove the public member\u2019s sunglasses from his \nneck. There was not an identifiable and effective public barrier in the video. \nUSDA Officials showed the licensee an assortment of these social media photos with individuals handling big cats over \nthe age of 12 weeks. The licensee admitted that the facility occasionally uses volunteers with previous exotic animal \nexperience but could not provide any documentation of their previous experience or volunteer paperwork. One of the \nmore frequent volunteers was identified by the licensee as a veterinary student at the local CVM and had a provisional \npermit to work under the licensee\u2019s state permit. After speaking with admissions at the local CVM, this individual was \nidentified as an undergraduate pre-veterinary student with no formal veterinary training. The second frequent volunteer\n\nhas over 5 years of experience as a zookeeper at a USDA regulated facility. There was no paperwork identifying \nexperience requirements for these volunteers, their duties and responsibilities or any SOPs for handling and interacting \nwith the animals on the premises. The licensee also admitted that some of the individuals depicted in the social media \nphotos are former or current employees of other USDA regulated facilities but are not employees or volunteers for Single \nVision. Furthermore, the licensee allows family members, personal friends and other exotic animal exhibitors to interact \nwith dangerous animals over 12 weeks of age without being under the direct control of a knowledgeable and experienced \nanimal handler. At approximately 12 weeks of age, dangerous animals, such as tigers, lions, bears, and wolves become \ntoo big, too fast and too strong to be used public contact. \nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public \nwith sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of \nanimals and the public. The facility should ensure the well-being of both parties by not allowing members of the public to \nhandle potentially dangerous animals. Additionally, the facility\u2019s volunteers and/or employees should be readily identifiable \nand have the appropriate documentation showing their training/experience with handling dangerous animals. \nCorrect prior to the next public interaction. \n3.125  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, general. \nUSDA Officials identified several enclosures in need of repair. \n\u2022 There was an exposed metal fence sub-floor in many of animal enclosures on the property. Some portions of the fence \nwere flush with the sand/dirt while others left metal protrusions exposed due to the changes in substrate height. \nEnclosures housing two new guinea singing dogs, two wolves, one spotted hyena, five ringtail lemurs, one jaguar and \ncougar, one leopard, two African crested porcupines, two tigers, a jaguar and lion, and the two exercise yards have areas \nin need of attention.\n\n\u2022 An enclosure housing one coatimundi had a wooden platform where one of the edges had come apart from the 2x4 \nbelow. There was an exposed screw still in the 2x4. \n\u2022 An enclosure housing one kinkajou had an exposed screw approximately 2 inches in length positioned down from the \nwooden board above. The screw was meant to hold a climbing branch in place but the branch had broken free. \n\u2022 An enclosure housing five ringtail lemurs contained a wooden platform that was separating from its base. The plywood \nportion of the platform was deteriorating from exposure to the elements and animals. There were also two long \n(approximately 2in) screws sticking out of the 2x4 portion of the platform. \n\u2022 An enclosure housing one Geoffroy\u2019s cat had a wooden platform with a worn away section in front of the den opening. \nPortions of the wood 2x4 were completely scratched away leaving splintered holes. \n\u2022 An enclosure housing a tiger and lion had a den box with a small bottom corner section of its plywood missing. \n\u2022 An enclosure housing one black leopard had a den box with a section of its plywood roof caved in. The roof the den no \nlonger provided adequate protection from the elements. \n\u2022 An enclosure housing two bears, one tiger and a lion had a loose door hinge on the door to the enclosure. The top two \nhinges were still intact and two metal chains were being used as additional security measures; however, the door stood \nslightly ajar. \n\u2022 One of the two den boxes for two African Crested Porcupines had a small hole in the plywood that appears to have been \nchewed away. Additionally, approximately 75% of the substrate of the enclosure had been dug away exposing the metal \nwire subfloor. The openings of the wire were approximately 2in by 4in and posed an entrapment risk. \n\u2022 An enclosure housing 3 silver foxes and 1 red fox had sections of the metal wire subfloor exposed due to the animals \ndigging. The openings of the wire were approximately 2in by 4in and posed an entrapment risk. \n\u2022 The licensee currently houses an adolescent female spotted hyena within his personal residence. The animal has free\n\naccess to the home when the licensee is home. There are numerous dangers in a house setting that can cause harm \nand/or death including exposed electrical cords and many chewing surfaces that could potentially become foreign body \nconcerns. \nExposed screws and defective wood pose injury hazards to the animals that have access to these defects. Loose door \nhinges affect the enclosures\u2019 integrity and its ability to safely contain the animals. The facility must be constructed of such \nmaterial and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be \nstructurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. \nAppropriate housing for the species must be provided and maintained to prevent injury or death to the animals possessed \nby the licensee. \n3.131(a) \n   \nSanitation. \nUSDA Officials identified two areas in need of additional cleaning. An enclosure housing two oriental small-clawed otters \nhad an accumulation of feces, mud and leftover food portions behind the den box. The two small holes in the enclosures \nthat acted as a drainage system were clogged and did not allow the accumulations to flow out during hose downs. \nAdditionally, an enclosure housing a Geoffroy\u2019s cat had a build up of feces and leftover food products directly adjacent to \nthe den box outside of the enclosure fence. This had attracted numerous flying insects to the location. \nAll enclosures shall be kept clean to reduce odors, disease hazards, and reduce pests. \nCorrect by March 14th, 2022. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and authorized personnel.\n\nAdditional Inspectors: \nKRISTIN NAPOLI, SUPERVISORY ANIMAL CARE SPECIALIST \nTANESHA WILKINS, SACSEnd Section",
