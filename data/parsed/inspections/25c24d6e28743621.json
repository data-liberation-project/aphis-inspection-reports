The roof and ground of the enclosure housing the red fox and Artic fox are in disrepair. The roof of the enclosure is\ncomprised of 4ft x 8ft plywood. Two sections of the plywood have bent and cracked downward into the enclosure. The\nlicensee stated the weight from the winter snow caused the damage. The current condition of the roof is a safety hazard\nto the animals as it could collapse and injure them.\nA portion of the enclosure floor/ground is covered in 12in x 12in concrete pavers. Two different areas of pavers have\npartially collapsed into holes dug by the foxes. The larger hole was approximately 1ft x 2ft in diameter. The holes\ncombined with the collapsing pavers are a safety hazard as the animals could be injured.\nAdditionally, the holes have unearthed a portion of buried chicken wire used to prevent the animals digging out of the\nenclosure.

In the enclosure housing the coati and two skunks, a section of partially unattached wire is exposed to the animals.\nThe wire, located near the top of the enclosure and approximately 2 feet in width, has been used to patch the enclosure\nfencing.
