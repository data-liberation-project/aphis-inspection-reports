The two primary enclosures and the animals were observed and inspected as soon as they arrived\nat the cargo handling facility after having been unloaded from the transporting aircraft. The enclosures did not have\ncertification from the consignor that the animals were offered food and water within 4 hours of delivery to the carrier.\nFailure to provide this information could put the animals at risk. Carriers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in\ncommerce unless the consignor provides this certification, which must include specific feeding and watering\ninstructions for a 24 hour period. This certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure\nin a manner that makes it easily noticed and read to enable the carrier and intermediate handlers to provide\nadequate care and husbandry to the animals while in transit.\nThis inspection was conducted at the Lufthansa cargo facility in Boston. A representative from CBP and airline\nrepresentatives were present for this inspection. A final exit interview was conducted with an airline representative\nby phone on 8/7/19."
