      "narrative": "A red kangaroo with unknown age and sex about 46lbs, Boomerang, was found laying on it\u2019s side in the morning on May\n12, 2024 Boomerang was brought into the emergency hospital and veterinarian discussed that the prognosis for\nBoomerang is poor. It was highly recommended referral to a specialist for MRI and further evaluation. The veterinarian\nstated that they can provide fluid therapy and administer medication, but Boomerang most likely will pass overnight\nwithout intervention. The veterinarian advised that they cannot send an IV catheter home with the patient because it is\nagainst hospital policy, Boomerang would have to be hospitalized. The licensee declined treatment and stated that they\nwould take Boomerang home to give fluid therapy. Veterinarian stated several times that Boomerang may pass overnight.\nBoomerang passed on May 13, 2024.\nA 5 year old male neutered red kangaroo, Pickles, was brought into the emergency hospital on September 20, 2025 for\nswelling in his jaw, which was noticed about 3-4 days prior. His appetite decreased about 10 days before bringing him into\nthe veterinarian. Pickles went home without medication, because it was stated that the facility had Meloxicam on hand.\nPickles went back to the veterinarian on October 1, 2025 for radiographs and Metronidazole was prescribed. On\nNovember 3, 2025, Pickles came back in for a recheck and he was doing much better. On November 10, 2025, the facility\ncontacted the veterinarian because Pickles\u2019 mouth was swollen again with a \u201cfoul smell\u201d. The Veterinarian advised that\nthey continue to flush the mouth daily and give Metronidazole. Medication was declined because staff stated that they\nalready had Metronidazole on site. Roughly an hour after they spoke with the vet about a \u201cfoul smell\u201d and swelling, Pickles\nhad \u201cpus discharged from his nose and mouth\u201d. The in-house medical paperwork further states he wasn\u2019t eating. The\nlicensee didn\u2019t follow back up with the veterinarian after the new symptoms. No documentation or notes were written\nagain until November 21, 2025, when Pickles\u2019 face swelled again. He was brought back to the veterinarian on November\n21, 2025 and on arrival, Pickles was weak and his heart began to slow down. The handler asked for approval from the\nlicensee to start CPR, but it was declined. Humane euthanasia was recommended and the licensee approved.\nA 5 year old male neutered red kangaroo, Erwin, was brought into an emergency hospital on September 7, 2025 for an\nopen infected wound with dead tissue on his tail that had flies and ants, including maggots per statement from the\nveterinarian to APHIS officials. The licensee is unsure what caused the wound. Erwin had not received any medication\nand did not want to use his tail. The emergency veterinarian discussed the treatment options with the licensee. Either they\nmedically manage it by removing necrotic flesh with sedation or amputation. The veterinarian discussed the risks of\namputation due to the location of the wound and possible complications post operation. The licensee selected\namputation. Erwin had his tail amputated on 9/10/25 and went home with medication. Necrotic tissue does not appear\novernight. The presence of dead tissue, infection, and fly maggots indicate that the tail wound was not addressed in a\ntimely manner, and appropriate veterinary care was not provided when the injury first occurred.\nAt the time of inspection, staff stated that they noticed an emu got scratched up on the left side of its abdomen, but the\nattending veterinarian was not notified. Staff is unsure what happened to the emu, but they proceeded to give treatment\nwithout notifying the attending veterinarian.\nFailure to provide adequate veterinary care and treat conditions in a timely manner can cause unnecessary distress, pain,\nand negatively affect the animal\u2019s health and well-being. The licensee must have these animals evaluated by a\nveterinarian to properly diagnose the medical conditions and develop an appropriate plan for treatment. The licensee\nmust ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times by providing the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nCORRECTION DATE: 22 JANUARY 2026"
