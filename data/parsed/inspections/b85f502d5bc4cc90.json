      "narrative": "At the previous inspection in early January, \"Shyra\" the young tiger born at the facility on Father's Day 2023, was\ndocumented to have weakness in the hind end and the attending veterinarian referred the animal to UC Davis for\nevaluation. On 7 February 2024 the weakness and muscle loss in both her back legs was evaluated at UC Davis and\n\"findings suggested that Shyra has metabolic bone disease and that she has sustained several fractures due to this\nmetabolic condition... Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is a general term for conditions that cause weak bones and is\ncommonly due to calcium-deficient diets such as boneless meat without appropriate supplements.\" Preliminary findings of\nthe radiology report included: a complete short oblique comminuted fracture of the right femur with slight remodeling,\nchronic fractures of both tibia in several locations, fracture of the right ilium, and right metacarpal as well as angular\ndeformities of the long bones bilaterally that appear chronic (greater than two weeks ago). During inspection, facility\nprovided the labeled bags of supplements they were feeding that were not available during the last inspection: Mazuri\nslab meat vitamin manufactured March 11, 2019 and Mazuri whole prey vitamin manufactured July 1, 2020. Typically\nMazuri supplements are considered expired 1 year after manufacture.\nAt the last inspection a plastic container was produced that was hand labeled Mazuri slab meat vitamins, and 2 grams\nper meal (2-3 lbs of various meat) of the supplement was demonstrated as the supplementation. The label guidelines for\nMazuri slab meat supplement is 9 grams/pound of meat, so each meal should have been supplemented at 18-27 grams\nper meal. The facility does not have any records of the amount of supplement provided or the mix of meat/bone in chicken\nfed to this animal, including the addition of whole rabbits since the last inspection.\nThe Animal Welfare Act requires that the food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of\nsufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. \"Shyra\" has metabolic bone disease most\nlikely caused by lack of calcium supplementation in the diet which has caused her weakness and the radiologically\nconfirmed chronic fractures. On inspection \"Shyra\" did not have normal ambulation, she had progressive weakness,\nwalking a few steps with her hind end lower than her front end and then dragging her hind legs behind her. Multimodal\npain medication was prescribed by UC Davis, as it is presumed that the fractures associated with her condition are\npainful. Appropriate supplementation must be provided to maintain animals in good health.\nCorrect by noon Pacific time 14 February 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and manager.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nGeoffrey Olsen, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER\nLaurie Gage, Field Zoological Species Specialist n"
