However, weaned chinchilla\u2019s\nare provided access to dust baths for 30 minutes each day. A Licensee stated that the weaned chinchilla\u2019s receive\ndust baths because it makes them look better and puffs their coats up. In communicating with the attending\nveterinarian, he stated that he was unaware of the adults not being offered an opportunity for dust baths. The\nattending veterinarian agreed that dust baths are essential for their normal grooming techniques and overall health\nand wellbeing. Without access to dust baths, chinchillas have no ability to rid themselves of excessive moisture. In\naddition, it exposes them to potential health issues such as hair loss, dry skin, fungal infections and hairballs.\nSeveral health issues identified on today\u2019s inspection could be a direct result of the lack of dust baths. The facility\nmust communicate with their attending veterinarian to ensure that they are using appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose and treat all health issues.\nCorrect By: 11/26/2019"

      "narrative": "A female beige chinchilla, Z6633, has red/brown bloody crusts on both ears. Loose hairs are trapped within the\ndried crusts. The right ear is more severely affected and significantly reddened. On the right ear, crusting is present\non the inside and outside of the ear. The ear edges are irregular in shape.\nA female standard chinchilla, 2470, is thin. Her right eye is unrecognizable. The tissue surrounding the eye is\nswollen. A portion of the tissue is red. The affected tissue is covered by a brown/yellow dry and crusty material.\nApproximately 1 inch of the animal\u2019s collar is covered with matted fur and a dry yellow crust. Upon further\nexamination, at least \u00bd inch of the animal\u2019s collar is embedded into the top portion of her neck. The skin around the\naffected area is covered in a thick yellow/green crust. Blood is present and muscle can be identified in the open\nwound.\nA male standard chinchilla, M-W122, was noticed to be inactive and in the back corner of the enclosure. Both of the\neyes are crusted shut. A dry green discharge is observed surrounding the eyes and the fur is wet. A white creamy\npus-like material is expressing from the eye socket upon manipulation. The animal also has dry white/green crusts\non its nose.\nThe right eye of a female standard chinchilla, RN1822, is sunken and dry. The eye and its surrounding tissue is\ncovered with a green discharge. Portions of the green discharge are dried and crusty. The anatomy of the eye is\nunrecognizable.\nThe left eye of a female ebony/violet chinchilla, 16011F, has at least a 5mm round growth extending from the front\nportion of the bottom eyelid. The growth is obstructing approximately \u00bc of the animal\u2019s eye. A scab is observed in\nthe center of the growth. The growth is in direct contact with the outer surface of the eye. A wet green discharge is\npresent within the eye and on the surrounding skin. Approximately a \u00bd inch diameter of skin is missing hair on top\nof her head.\nThe right eye of a female ebony chinchilla, 14-147F, is cloudy. The normal anatomy of the eye in unrecognizable.\nThe entire circumference of the eye has a significant amount of blood vessels that are extending toward the center\nof the globe.\nThe left eye of a female mosaic chinchilla, 07-220F, is significantly enlarged. It is at least twice the size of the right\neye. The left eye is cloudy and the normal anatomy is unrecognizable. Near the center of the left eye is a dark\ncircular opacity. A white/creamy discharge is present in the right eye.\nThe tail tip of a female standard chinchilla, Y6363, is swollen with hair loss. The skin is extremely reddened, bloody,\nand scabbed. A large portion of the tail is missing with only approximately 1-1.5 inches of tail remaining. The\nchinchilla is painful, screaming when picked-up at its tail base. A piece of white material, bone, is extending from the\ntip of the tail.\nA male standard chinchilla, TE-7924, has blood on the middle of his tail. The fur with the blood is matted and\ncrusted. Under the matted fur is an open wound. The skin is reddened and thickened with hair loss. The center of\nthe wound is bright yellow and surrounded by a white creamy pus-like material. The chinchilla is extremely painful,\nscreaming when picked-up and when matted fur is manipulated.\nAll of the health issues identified above are significantly impacting animal health and wellbeing. Daily observation of\nthese animals is not effective. Thus, health issues are not identified within a timely manner. It is the Licensees\nresponsibility that daily observations are completed appropriately and effectively. Additionally, there must be a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure all health issues are\naddressed within a timely manner, to include the animals identified above.\nCorrect By: Close of Business 11/20/2019"
