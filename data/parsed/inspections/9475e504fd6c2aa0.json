Consignor certifications are required to ensure that animals in transit, especially young animals, are\nadequately fed and watered before and during transport.\nShipment #1: Label on crate stated (cid:28)Last feed and water: 30.01.2014 11.00 A.M. Pls feed and water at transit\npoint(cid:29). An additional label stated (cid:28)ZRH datum/time 31.01 2014 / 10:30 Water Food(cid:29). These labels did not\ncontain the consignor(cid:25)s signature with date and time, and specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and\nwatering(s) for a 24-hour period, as required.\nShipment #2: There was no label indicating time last fed and watered before shipping; no feeding instructions; and\nno signature of consignor with date and time as required. It is not possible to determine if puppies were fed and\nwatered within 4 hours before being transported in commerce. A label was present stating (cid:28)ZRH datum/time 31.01\n2014 / 10:30 Water Food(cid:29). As no food was attached to the crates, it is not known if the puppies were both\nfed and watered at the time indicated."
