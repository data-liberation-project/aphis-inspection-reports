The facility shall ensure that the outdoor housing facilities are enclosed by a perimeter fence at least six feet high\nand more than three feet in distance from the primary enclosures or receive written approval for fencing that does not\nmeet those requirements.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nEnd Section"
