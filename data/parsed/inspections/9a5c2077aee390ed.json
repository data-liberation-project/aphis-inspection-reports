Hair loss and skin changes can result\nfrom several medical conditions which have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the affected animal. The\nfacility must have \"Fido\" seen by a licensed veterinarian no later than December 5, 2025."

Large numbers of live and dead roaches were present inside the enclosures. Roaches were seen in and around\nthe food and water containers, along the ceiling, and in the interior areas of the kennel buildings. Large numbers of\nroaches were noted on cage cards and records located on the cages. Numerous kennels had clusters of roaches directly\nabove food and water bowls. Multiple bowls of water and food had roaches inside the containers. The licensee stated that\nan exterminator had visited the facility on 22 September 2025 and was scheduled to return on 19 December 2025. Based\non the sheer number of roaches present in the facility, current control methods are not nearly adequate to control the pest\npopulation. Roaches and other insects are a source of contamination to the enclosed animals, as well as being a potential\nvector for numerous diseases that could negatively impact the welfare of the kennel dogs. An effective program for the\ncontrol of insects must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and\nreduce contamination by pests in animal areas.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nMICHAEL TYGART, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
