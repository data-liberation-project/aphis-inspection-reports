      "narrative": "* One blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound with number 933 has a loose canine tooth with a recessed\ngum line on the lower right side. The lower left canine tooth is not mobile but is protruding out of the mouth at about\na 45 degree angle to upright and has a recessed gum line. There is a coating of tarter on the lower left premolar\nteeth (cheek teeth). One of the lower left premolar teeth is loose and has a collection of white discharge at the gum\nline.\n* One white colored adult female Schnauzer with number 653 has a buildup of tarter on the canines and premolars.\nThe gum line over all of the upper premolar teeth on both sides is recessed with copious amounts of white, creamy\ndischarge present in this space. There is a collection of matted hair lodged at the base of the lower left incisors and\ncanine tooth.\nLoose teeth, recessed gums and discharge at the gum line are some of the signs of dental disease in dogs. Dental\ndisease can cause damage to the gum tissue, tooth and mouth structures (such as bone loss in the jaw), can be\npainful, and can impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animals\nlisted above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained\nand an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment\nand resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\n*******************************************\n* Two black and tan colored adult male Dachshund (numbers 1004 and 006) and one salt and pepper colored\nadult male Schnauzer number 64 have matted hair. Matted hair was observed on the ears and back legs of the two\nDachshunds and over the entire body of the Schnauzer. The matted hair was balled and ropey in appearance and\nwas tightly adhered to the skin. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture and can\nfoster skin infections. The matted hair on these dogs must be removed and a program of coat maintenance must be\nestablished at the facility.\n****************************************\n* Italian Greyhound numbers 135 and 138 cited on the December 8, 2015 inspection report under 2.40 b 2 are\ncurrently under a treatment plan with the attending veterinarian."
