Its\nright hind limb had become entrapped between the plastic water bottle and the wire support. An area of the skin on\nthe inside of the affected limb (approximately 0.5\" x 0.5\") was red and irritated in appearance and the distal part of\nthe limb appeared swollen. After being freed by the licensee, the animal was noted to be bearing weight abnormally\non that limb, consistent with injury or pain. The facility veterinarian was contacted to direct treatment.\nThe water bottle in this enclosure does not fit snugly into the wire holder, and this lack of structural soundness\nleaves gaps between the water bottle and the wire. An animal was injured subsequent to entrapment in one of these\ngaps.\nPrimary enclosures shall be structurally sound to protect hamsters from injury. The licensee stated that he has\nordered new watering devices and plans to replace all the waterers of this type to prevent further injuries.\nTo be corrected by February 17th, 2020.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted on site with the licensee."
