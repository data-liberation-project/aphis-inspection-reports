Although the Turkish airlines representative stated\ntemperatures in airplane cargo ranges from 59 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (F), the temperature, altitude, flight time, and\ncabin temperature values can vary between the minimum and the maximum values, depending on the amount and type of\ncargo. Therefore, short temperature deviations may occur during flight.\nOn November 17, the temperature In Moscow ranged between 27-34 degrees F, 85% Humidity (H), in Istanbul 48-59\ndegrees F, 78% H, and at LAX, upon arrival between 10 and 11 am ranged between 50-71 degrees F, 61% H. According\nto the registered handler, upon offloading from the plane, the 2 Sphynx kittens were dead. The deceased cats were in the\ncrate lined with a litter pad with fecal matter on their bodies. There were no indications of added measures taken to\nprotect the cats or reduce the effects from the potential rigors of travel including temperature fluctuations during this\ntransport.\nWhen climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to\nalleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,\nand time, that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's\nage, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
