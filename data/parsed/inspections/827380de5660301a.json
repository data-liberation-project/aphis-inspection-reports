The most recent IACUC semi-annual inspection report, dated January 06, 2017 and submitted to\nthe IO on January 09, 2017, stated that during its semi-annual review of the institutional animal care and use\nprogram and facilities inspection, the Stahl Farm was not inspected since there were no animals currently on study\nat the site.\nA review of animal health records showed research cattle were last housed at the Stahl Farm facility on April 04,\n2016. Discussion with research facility representatives during the inspection indicated that the Stahl Farm was still\nan active research animal site and would continue to house research cattle as research studies necessitate.\nFailure to conduct semi-annual facility site inspections are not in compliance with 9 CFR 2.31 (c) 2. The failure to\nconduct semi-annual research animal facility site inspections may hinder the ability of institutional officials to identify\nproblems and take needed corrective actions to prevent animal facilities and animal study areas from falling into\ndisrepair and non-compliance.\nThe IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the facility's\nresearch animal facilities, including animal study areas.\nCorrect by March 07, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the institutional chief compliance officer and another facility\nrepresentative."
