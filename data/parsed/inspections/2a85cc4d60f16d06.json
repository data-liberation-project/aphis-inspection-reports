The gums along the bottom edge of the affected teeth were\nred, swollen and irritated.\nA male tan colored Chihuahua \"Caesar\" has moderate accumulation of tartar on all molars. The gums along the\nedge of the back cheek teeth were red and swollen. The left front foot had a small round red draining lesion in the\nspace between the toes.\nA female Dachshund \"Reba\" (microchip #057-561-007) has an extremely severe accumulation of gray to brown\ndental tartar and hair and/or debris on all outer surfaces of the teeth. There is a creamy white discharge along the\ngum line of all the upper teeth. The gums were swollen and very red with areas of erosion. The gum line above the\nleft upper incisor and canine was severely eroded such that a space between the jaw and tooth was visible. A firm\nswelling about 2-3cm in size was felt under the skin under the jaw on the left side of the neck. The right rear foot\nhad a toenail that had curved under to touch the foot pad.\nDental and foot conditions such as these can be painful or distressful to the animal and can lead to further health\ncomplications. The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an\naccurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate and effective treatment plan is developed and followed. This\ninformation, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made\navailable to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at\nall times."
