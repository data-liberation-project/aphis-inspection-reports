This animal does not appear to be thriving compared to other young llamas in the park and could be indicative of\nillness. This animals condition was not observed until the inspectors identified it to the park owner. This animal should\nhave its condition monitored and communicated to the attending vet for guidance in treatment and care.\n*** A large female pig in the animal adventure area has overgrown front hooves. Overgrown hooves do not properly\nprotect the pig\u2019s foot and added pressure on the front hooves can be painful and can cause lameness. In addition, this\nanimal also has dry flaky skin and some hair loss on the sides. This animal was recently purchased at an auction and\nwhile it\u2019s observed through daily feedings and watering, the condition of the front feet and skin were not identified as a\nconcern by the attendant and therefore information on the condition of this animal has not been communicated to the\nattending veterinarian.\n*** The facility recently acquired a litter of piglets from the same location as the adult female. Several of the piglets also\nhad dry flaky skin and were itching themselves or rubbing against items in the enclosure. One piglet appeared to have red\nirritated skin and was continuously rubbing against a bar for an extended period. Again, the condition of the animals was\nnot noted or communicated to the vet for assessment and potential treatment.\nDaily observation at the facility for animal welfare must be conducted by employees and attendants who can recognize\nwhen animal health or condition is compromised and then communicate that information to the attending veterinarian so\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal well being are being properly diagnosed and treated.\nCorrect by: July 25, 2021"

Guests can drive their own vehicles through or ride in a facility driven vehicle. The USDA inspectors drove\nthrough the park and stopped frequently to wait for other vehicles or observe animals. During one stop, the USDA\ninspector\u2019s vehicle had six llamas around the vehicle including two babies that were too small to be seen when they were\nin front of the car. The USDA inspector\u2019s vehicle could not move for 15 minutes due to safety concerns of the babies and\nthe potential hazard of driving into a small, young llama. The USDA inspectors noted that the following car behind was\nalso unable to move for an extended period due to llamas around their vehicle. After an additional 7 minutes a park\nemployee came over in a 4-wheeler to help move the llamas so the cars could pass. During the self-guided park tour, only\none employee was observed moving around the area between the three park areas, while 7-8 vehicles of guests stopped\nto feed and interact with various animal species without a readily identifiable employee present.\n*** The facility has a small animal adventure where guests can go into a large fenced area with domestic species of goats,\npigs, alpaca, deer, etc. and feed the animals. The area is staffed with one attendant outside the animal area who is also\nselling tickets and food items. At one point during the inspection, there were 16 guests in the area with the animals. This\narea is too large with several blind spots where the one attendant cannot see all the animals and guests during periods of\npublic contact. In addition, this one employee is expected to watch animals and guests down a pathway approximately 50-\n60 feet in length with animals on both sides of the path behind fences. The facility needs to address this and add\nadditional staff to the area to ensure the safety of the animals.\nThe facility must ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee is always present during\nperiods of public contact to be able to ensure the safety of the animals.\nCorrect by: July 31, 2021"
