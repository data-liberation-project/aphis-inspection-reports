These areas of hair loss are in the same areas that domestic dogs\nmay have lick granulomas. There is no documentation of this condition in the records for the animal and the\nattending veterinarian was not consulted. Hair loss may have many causes such as parasites, infectious,\nnutritional, may be a sign of a more serious health concern and/or be self-inflicted (licking). The New Guinea\nsinging dog must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.\n2) The female white and black pot-bellied pig has hair loss and flaky skin on the top of the head between the ears,\non the back behind the shoulders to the hips, and an area on the right side over the rib cage. There is no\ndocumentation of this condition in the records for the animal and the attending veterinarian was not consulted. Hair\nloss may have many causes such as parasites, infectious, nutritional, may be a sign of a more serious health\nconcern and/or be self-inflicted (rubbing). The pot-bellied pig must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to\nprovide appropriate veterinary care.\n3) The male Dromedary camel has a circular wound/sore about a quarter inch in diameter on his left front leg at the\ntop lateral edge of the callus on his carpal joint (at the 1 o\u2019clock position). The tissue is red and there appears to be\ndried blood in the area. There is no documentation of this condition in the records for the animal and the attending\nveterinarian was not consulted. Wounds may become infected. The camel must be evaluated by the attending\nveterinarian to provide appropriate care.\nCorrect by having the above animals evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must document and\nmaintain records of the examination, treatment and outcome for future inspections by APHIS officials. The\nattending veterinarian was previously scheduled to come to the facility today and evaluated and treated the above\nanimals while at the facility. Corrected during the inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted with a facility animal caretaker and the facility vice president. The exit interview\nwere conducted with the facility vice president."
