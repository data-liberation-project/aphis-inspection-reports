The main door to the enclosure where the work was to take place was unlocked by\nthe park manager to allow the maintenance man access to the work area.\nAt the time of this incident the gate did not have a latch attached to it and was secured by a chain looped around\nthe gate and padlocked to the adjacent fence. The maintenance man left the job site without finishing the job and\nwithout telling the park manager he had left the job site. The park manager stated the maintenance man was\nalways very good at locking gates in areas he was working in. This day it appears the gate was not locked when he\nleft.\nLater that day around 2 P.M. it began to rain and the park manager asked an employee to let (cid:28)\"Scooby\"(cid:29) the male\ntiger into the den area to get out of the rain.\nThe park manager assumed the den gate was locked. The employee entered the den area and without checking\nthe lock, pulled the cable control and allowed (cid:28)\"Scooby\"(cid:29) into the den area. At that moment the employee and\n(cid:28)\"Scooby\"(cid:29) realized the gate was not secured by the chain and padlock. \"(cid:28)Scooby\"(cid:29) grabbed the employees arm as\nshe was desperately trying to close and secure the gate. As a result she was badly bitten and hospitalized.\nThis series of events points to a three phase brake down in animal security at the park.\n1. The gate was not locked and secured when the maintenance man left the job site.\n2. The park manager assumed the gate to the den area was locked.\n3. The employee was negligent in not verifying the gate was locked before allowing (cid:28)\"Scooby\"(cid:29) into the den.\nThe park could not produce written verification documenting adequate training and the following of park protocol by\nall personnel involved. All employees must receive adequate training to ensure the security and safety of animals,\nthemselves, and park visitors.\nA written log of employee training documenting the type of training given, duration of training, the frequency of\nrefresher training drills, and signed off by a park supervisor should be in place, as well as a written protocol\noutlining work procedures and security measures to ensure all animal enclosures are secure and safe for\nemployees at the park.\nThis type of accident is preventable and the park must take steps to implement new protocols and training to ensure\nthis type of accident never occurs again.\nCorrect by: Immediately\nAn exit interview was conducted with the park manager at close of inspection."
