Surfaces (chewed wood) that are not impervious to moisture cannot be readily cleaned & sanitized. If\nanimal waste or urine comes in to contact with an untreated surface it could create a disease risk & or health\nproblems for the dog. The structural strength of an untreated surface is also affected when the untreated surface\nbecomes soaked with animal waste or urine on a continual basis. Surfaces that are impervious to moisture can be\nreadily cleaned & sanitized. This affects forty three dogs and five puppies. To be corrected by 08-20-15."
