      "narrative": "During this auction inspection, the inspectors identified two animals that were in need of acute veterinary care:\n1) During a walk through of the back barn area a male mini Highland bull on 5/5/17 was noted lying on its right side\nand minimally responsive to the opening of its stall door at approximately 10:15 am. A few minutes later the bull had\na seizure. The inspectors notified an auction staff member and the attending veterinarian. No one was observed\ngoing to evaluate or treat the bull. Over the rest of the day the bull was observed again by the inspectors at 11:15\nam, 12:20 pm, 4:40 pm and 6:00 pm. Seizure activity of varying intensity and duration was observed at multiple\ntime points. The attending veterinarian was asked about the bull at about 2 pm and stated that he gave a penicillin\ninjection about 1 pm. The inspectors again talked to the veterinary staff about the bulls declining condition and\nasked if the veterinarian was considering providing any pain relieving medication or treatment. The inspectors\nlearned later from the veterinarian that a steroid injection was administered. By the 6:00 pm observation point the\nbull was completely unresponsive with fixed eyes but was still warm and breathing. On the morning of 5/6 the bull\nwas no longer in the stall. The veterinarian stated that it had died overnight. No documentation of veterinary care\nwas available for review.\n2) On 5/5/17 one brown and white goat was noted lying down on its side in a pen housing multiple goats. The other\ngoats were stepping on and over the goat with no response by the goat. An auction employee was notified and\nasked to remove the goat. The goat was rehoused in a pen by itself. It was noted to be weak but was able to sit up\nby leaning against a solid wall. The auction staff did not contact the veterinarian to obtain an evaluation of the\ntrampled, weak goat.\nAdequate veterinary care is necessary for acute conditions that can lead to distress and suffering of the animals.\nThe facility is responsible for identifying veterinary issues, communicating with the veterinarian about the issues and\nensuring adequate veterinary care to include treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the\nauction."

      "narrative": "On the morning of 5/4/17 the inspectors watched the auction staff moving llamas from the auction ring back into\ntheir holding pens. One adult male auction staff member was noted kicking and using a short crop to move the\nllamas into their pen. One particular llama that was deemed to be aggressive was shoved into a separate pen using\nthe pen fence by the same adult male auction staff member.\nA young male auction staff member was observed relocating a lamb by grasping the wool on its back with one hand\nand dropping it over a 4 foot high fence into a pen.\nOn the afternoon of 5/5/17 a Watusi was observed by the inspectors running loose in the parking area at the rear of\nauction building. The animal escaped during the loading process. Several auction staff members were seen to be\nchasing the animals on foot as well as with a fork lift. The inspectors lost sight of the animal when the Watusi ran\noff the auction property. The animal was eventually secured.\nKicking, whipping, shoving and mishandling of animals causes behavioral stress, discomfort and can result in injury\nto the animals. All animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not\ncause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort."

The weather on 5/4/17 started out grey, overcast, and\ncool. During the day it remained cool and rained most of the day. The weather remained cold, windy and rainy on\n5/5. The watusi, cattle, bison, and water buffalo were noted to be wet and several were seen shivering. One very\nyoung nearly newborn watusi calf housed by itself was noted to be wet and shivering and lying curled up in the mud\nin the corner closest to the barn on 5/5. Another watusi calf was also noted shivering in a pen by itself. The very\nyoung calf was watched for 10 minutes and was noted to be full-body shivering throughout the observation\nperiod.The inspectors notified an auction worker about the calves. The worker moved the calves into stalls in the\nsheltered area of the barn.\n*Several wire cages of very young pigs including pot belly piglets were placed on the ground just inside the arena\nbarn loading area. The large door was open and a strong wind was blowing in cold air and rain. Multiple pigs were\nnoted shivering especially those with wet bedding. All the employees in the area were wearing jackets/coats. The\npiglets had no protection from the cold wind. The inspectors notified staff and asked that the situation for the pigs be\nimproved and the staff built a windbreak out of bales of hay and closed the damaged door as far as was possible.\nCold weather coupled with wind and rain makes it difficult for animals, especially young animals, to maintain their\ncore body temperature. Inability to maintain appropriate body temperatures can predispose animals, especially\nyoung animals, to increased risk of disease due to stress, discomfort and hypothermia. When climatic conditions\npresent a threat to the animals health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of\nthese conditions."
