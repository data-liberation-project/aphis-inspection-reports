The refrigerator was\n\"supposed to be locked\" and was stated to only have medications for the absent licensee's dogs, therefore was not\nsubject to inspection according to the licensee. There were at least two medications prescribed for sloths in that\nrefrigerator, as well as a 25-dose package of feline vaccines. There is one bobcat at the facility and there have been\na couple domestic cats at the facility. There were several boxes of acyclovir said to be for a monkey no longer at the\nfacility. A bottle of Amoxi-drops is not labeled as to when it was mixed, and there is no prescription label on it.\nAmoxi-drops must have a prescription from a licensed veterinarian, and it must be discarded 10 days after it is\nreconstituted.\nOutdated medications may not be effective, and may even become harmful. They must not be used.\n- Several medications were found that were not labeled for use in the covered animals present at the facility.\nExamples: Revolution is said to be used on the sloths. Gas relief drops on a shelf are labeled for humans, and are\nsaid to be used for bloat in the sloths.\nUse of medications in exotic species is difficult in that there is rarely, if ever, a medication that is labeled for them.\nLimited information is available regarding dosage and potential toxicities. Off-label use of medications must be\nunder prescription of the attending veterinarian, with clearly written instructions."

This grimy\ncoating can result in growth of disease-causing bacteria, and can result in odors that attract insects and other\nvermin.\nThoroughly cleaning all surfaces at each cleaning for scent-marking species can be stressful to the animals. A\nsolution is to do rotational cleaning. For example, thoroughly clean half of the surfaces one week, then the other half\nof the surfaces the following week. The entire shelter is then cleaned often enough to prevent problems associated\nwith grimy buildup without undue stress on the animals. Daily spot-cleaning to remove food and animal waste must\nstill be done.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a licensee.\nSue Orham, IES Investigator, accompanied this inspection."
