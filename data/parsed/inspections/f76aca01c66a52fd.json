The sharp points at the bottom of the fence were facing into the\nenclosure where the animals could come into contact with them.\n***A portion of the ceiling of the coati enclosure was in disrepair. Several of the wires were broken, creating gaps in\nthe structure. Additionally, there were loose metal wires with sharp points that were protruding into the enclosure.\nThese damaged wires are in close proximity to the top of the coati\u2019s night house, where the animal was observed to\nbe laying during the inspection.\n***On the bottom of the back side of the nesting box in the coati enclosure there were several exposed screw tips\nthat could injure the coati.\n***The fencing surrounding the enclosure of one male camel, \u201cHumphrey,\u201d was in disrepair. Parts of the enclosure\nconsisted entirely of four metal cables that were strung horizontally in order to contain the camel. The bottom most\nstrand of cable was loose in some areas and either hanging low or entirely on the ground. These structural issues\ncause the fence to be less effective in containment of the animal and can lead to entrapment or escape of the\nanimal. Other portions of the enclosure had a wire mesh surrounding the metal cable. This wire was not securely\nfastened to the fence either at the top of the bottom in numerous areas, allowing it to curl and fold over, creating\ngaps and sharp points that were pointing into the enclosure.\n***An enclosure that housed both sheep and goats had a broken wood board that was hanging down into the\nenclosure. The edges of the broken wood boards were jagged and splintered, and were directly exposed to the\nanimals in the enclosure and present a risk of injury.\n***An enclosure that housed eighteen sheep had broken metal fencing with sharp points and broken wooden boards\nwith jagged, splintered edges. There were gaps in both the metal and wooden fencing that were large enough for\nthe animals\u2019 horns, head, or limbs, could become stuck.\n***In the enclosure housing two pigs, there was an exposed nail head on the lower portion of the night house that\nwas pointing outward where the pigs could easily come into contact with the edge.\n***An enclosure housing one Dromedary camel, \u201cCoco,\u201d contained sharp points and had fencing in disrepair. Metal\nwires, which were in place to tie wooden boards to the bottom of the chain linked fence for support, had sharp\npoints that were protruding out into the enclosure. A segment of the lower portion of the chain linked fence on the\nopposite side of the enclosure was not secured to the cable running along the ground. This created gaps between\nthe ground and the chain linked fencing large enough for the animal\u2019s limb to become entrapped.\n***An enclosure that housed a Dromedary camel, \u201cPinkie,\u201d had fencing in disrepair. A metal wire panel was attached\nto a portion of the fencing separating \u201cPinkie\u2019s\u201d enclosure from the enclosure containing two adult female\nDromedary camels, \u201cFreya\u201d and \u201cAlexa\u201d. The top of this wire was damaged, creating sharp points that pointed\nupward and outward, into the enclosure containing \u201cFreya\u201d and \u201cAlexa\u201d.\n***In an enclosure housing seventeen sheep, a portion of the metal fencing material, along the bottom, was bowing\nout of the base of the pen. This has created a gap large enough for the animal's horns or head to become stuck and\ntherefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.\n***In an enclosure housing seventeen sheep, one of the metal legs stabilizing the shade structure was severely\nrusted, creating sharp edges which could injure the animals, as well as potentially affecting the stability of the\nstructure.\n***In an enclosure housing seven goats a portion of the wire fencing was in disrepair. The lower edges of the metal\nfence was bent upward with sharp points protruding toward the animals that could cause injuries.\n***In an enclosure housing seven goats, there was an exposed screw head on the lower portion of a wood structure\nin the exhibit that could come into contact with the animals.\n***The enclosure housing nine goats in the barn had rust along the lower parts of the metal walls, which extended\nup the wall at least 10 inches in height in some areas. The rusted metal exposed many areas of jagged, splintered\npieced of wood underneath. In the areas where the metal was rusted through, sharp metal edges were created and\npointed into the enclosure.\n***There was a hole in the floor along one side of the indoor enclosure housing nine goats. The hole was several\nfeet long and approximately 2 feet deep. A facility representative had placed a wooden beam across the hole,\nhowever, portions of the hole remained uncovered and were large enough for an animal to become entrapped or\ninjured.\n***In an enclosure housing fifteen goats, several panels of the chain linked fencing were in disrepair. The bottom of\nthe chain linked fence was not secured to the ground, creating a gap between the bottom of the fence and the\nground. The sharp points at the bottom of the fence were facing into the enclosure where the animals could come\ninto contact with them.\n***In the enclosure housing fifteen goats, there was a blue plastic bin in the middle of the pen. This bin was cracked,\nhad holes, and broken sides with jagged edges which could injure the animals.\nAll enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in\norder to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to\nensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape."

It must be\nof sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside\nthe enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.\n3.131(c)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \n***A gopher carcass was observed to be lying in an enclosure housing seven goats. A dead animal has the potential\nto transmit disease to the regulated animals. The facility representative removed the carcass at the time of\ninspection.\n***In the enclosure housing twelve goats, there was a bundle of baling twine on the ground. This is a hazard, as the\ntwine could be consumed by the animals in the enclosure. \n***In an enclosure containing five goats, baling twine was used to tie panels of the metal fencing together. Five\n\nstrands of the twine were running into the enclosure along the ground. This twine could be consumed by the\nanimals in the enclosure.\n***In the barn housing nine goats, an accumulation of cobwebs was present in the corners of the enclosure and on\nthe feeders. Cobwebs can be areas for harboring pests which can affect the health of the regulated animals and\nmay be an indication of substandard husbandry practices. \nAnimal enclosures must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate good\nhusbandry practices. A regular program of housekeeping in and around all animal enclosures needs to be\nimplemented and maintained.\nThis report is a continuation of the previous report on February 6, 2018 and contains the indirect citations from the\nroutine inspection conducted at that time.  An additional report containing the direct citations was previously\ndelivered to the licensee on February 6, 2018 and an exit interview was conducted at that time. With respect to the\nnon-compliant items contained within this report, an exit was conducted on February 6, 2018 with facility\nrepresentatives and the undersigned inspector. \nAdditional Inspectors\nEngel D.V.M Dominique, Hpa Gov User",
