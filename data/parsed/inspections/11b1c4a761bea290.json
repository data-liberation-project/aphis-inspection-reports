The IACUC approved protocol states that the IACUC Policy on\nFood and Fluid Regulation will be followed; per this policy the minimum amount of water offered per day must not be less\nthan 20 ml/kg. The NHP had gained weight however the investigator staff did not recalculate the minimum volume of\nwater to be offered per day for the animal. As a result, the NHP received less than 20 ml/kg of water on 3 different days in\nAugust 2024 (8/6; 8/13; & 8/15). Veterinary staff discovered that the NHP had received the decreased amount of water\nduring the routine review of animal watering records on 8/16/24. The NHP was then evaluated by a veterinarian and no\nadverse effects were noted in the animal from the decreased water intake.\nPer this Section, with respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications to\nsecure approval, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing\nactivities prior to implementation by the investigator. Principal investigators are to follow the IACUC approved proposals,\nand any proposed changes shall be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementation. The water intake of\nless than 20 ml/kg water per day in this NHP is a significant change in an ongoing activity that was implemented without\nprior review and approval by the IACUC. The research facility acted promptly to address this incident and implemented\ncorrective measures prior to this inspection, which included additional refresher training of the investigator staff on water\nregulation policy and the monitoring of NHPs during water regulation. There have been no additional incidents. To remain\ncorrected from this day 12/12/24 forward."
