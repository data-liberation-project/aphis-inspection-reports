The animals\nshould have been moved to an appropriate area while this work was being done to not have created behavioral\nstress to the foxes. Handling of all animals should be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner\nthat does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary\ndiscomfort. At the time of this inspection, one of the animals has been caught, and the other is still at large.\nCorrected immediately."
