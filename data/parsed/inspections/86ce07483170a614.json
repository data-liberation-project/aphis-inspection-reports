A Pug(M)\nblack/fawn \"King\" had a cloudy left eye with that appeared misshaped, and possibly the start of an issue with the\nright eye. His teeth were very poor with red gums and excessive tarter, brown in color covering the molars and\ncanine with some gray material at the gumline. A Pug(F) fawn \"#3599\" had an ulcer like formation on her left eye in\nthe center of the eyeball, with the beginnings of another possibly in her right eye. A Pug(M) fawn \"#8682\" had a\ngrowth in the center of his right eye and cloudy in appearance. Both eyes were extremely 'bug-eyed' in appearance\nand appeared misshapen. A male boxer \"Tommy\", brown/white, had a green discharge from both eyes, with the\nmajority coming from his left eye that had a small white ring in the center of the eye, a possible growth or ulceration.\nA shiatsu(F) brindle \"#30\" had a brown crusty material in the corners of both eyes tangled in the hair with increased\ndrainage and white cloudiness in both eyes and possible sore in the center of the left eye. The veterinarian had not\nbeen contacted in regards to these health issues, as they had not been observed at this time.\nIt Is imperative that all eye drainage, cloudiness, bulging or ulcerations and growths be identified and contact made\nwith the veterinarian for immediate diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent a treatable condition from becoming\nchronic and to decrease the amount of pain and/or discomfort of the animal.\nThe licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of any health issues with the\nregulated animals.\nTo be corrected by: February 15, 2014"
