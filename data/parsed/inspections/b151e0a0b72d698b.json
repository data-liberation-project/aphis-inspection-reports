      "narrative": "The facility veterinarians have prescribed daily treatments for three elephants (Nichole, Sara, Rudy) but the\ntreatment logs show that there are gaps of between 1-4 days where treatments have not been given. The\nemployee that signs the treatment log and is the primary individual administering the medications stated that he\nthought the days that the elephants are transported in the train cars may account for missing a day's dose since he\ncannot access the elephants to give the treatments. He could not account for the gaps of 2-4 days where\ntreatments were not administered. The concern that prescribed treatments were not being given as directed was\ndiscussed during a phone call with one of the facility veterinarians. The veterinarian stated that there was supposed\nto be a notation on the records indicating when and why treatments were missed but was not aware that these gaps\nin treatment had occurred.\nTreatments prescribed for the control of medical conditions diagnosed by the facility veterinarians should be given\nas directed and, when unable to be given, that a reason for why the treatment was missed is documented. This can\nhelp the handlers and the veterinary staff to determine if these animals are being adversely affected by missing the\ndoses.\nEach dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nTo be corrected from this time forward.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives and two APHIS AC VMOs at the Bankers Life\nField House, Indianapolis, IN.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMchenry Kerry, Veterinary Medical Officer"
