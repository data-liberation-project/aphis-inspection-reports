Freunds adjuvants (complete\n& incomplete) are known to produce abscesses &/or granulomas at the site of injections. A random sampling of\napprox 25 injected rabbits were selected and felt for any SQ hard or soft swellings, abscesses, lumps &/or nodules.\nRabbits # 32972, 3205, 331138, 31923, 32770, 3773, 32700 32470, 31510 & 33080 had these types of swellings, &\nlumps ranging from pea size to grape size (one of the rabbits had a quarter size lump). The exact etiology of these\nlumps could not be determined during the inspection and will need further veterinary examinations. There was no\nredness, ulceration, hair loss, or other skin abnormalities on the skin surface in the areas of the lumps/swellings.\nThe registrant has an SOP for the treatment of abscesses & granulomas, but these rabbits did not appear to have\nthe treatment outlined in the SOPs since these lumps have not definitively been diagnosed as abscesses.\nThe sites for the injections of adjuvants are not shaved & the skin is not aseptically prepared prior to the injections.\nThere was no records to demonstrate when & the frequency of follow-up observations/palpations after the injections\nare being performed to determine if there are any subsequent swelling that might have formed after the injections\nand to determine if they are treatable or preventable.\nA research facility shall employ the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat injuries.\nHave your veterinarian examine these types of SQ lumps/abscesses observed & treat accordingly. Discuss with\nyour veterinarian about aseptically preparing the injection sites to prevent (or reduce these lumps/swellings) &/or\nsubsequent treatments should these swellings/abscesses/lumps occur in the future. Establish & document a\nroutine for checking the animals post treatment and record care accordingly.\nHave your veterinarian examine these (as well as others) to determine the etiology and treatments if warranted.\nCorrect by October 1, 2016\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institional Official."
