Correct by assuring the indoor and outdoor housing facilities\nare structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nThe facility welded angle iron to the outside of the supports during the inspection process but the structural integrity\nwas not fully corrected by this repair.
