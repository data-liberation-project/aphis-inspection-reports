Koko should not be walked on a leash outside of her enclosure unless a secure method\ncan be devised where she is not at risk of escape and/or harm. To be corrected from this time forward.\nUpon review of records it was discovered that on 3/9/17 Koko was given 1/2 a tablet of NoDoz (caffeine tablets) by\nKoko's owner, reportedly to treat a headache. Koko has a documented history of anxiety and cardiac issues, and\nthe attending veterinarian expressed concern about this incident, when he was contacted. Giving medications\nwithout consulting the attending veterinarian could be hazardous to the animal's well-being. Koko is on several\nprescription medications and herbal supplements, and over-the-counter medications could also have unforeseen\ndrug interactions. The attending veterinarian should be consulted prior to administering medications from this time\nforward."
