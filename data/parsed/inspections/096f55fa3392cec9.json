In most of the\nenclosures, it appeared that the amount of fecal material present made it difficult for the animals to avoid walking in\nit. According to the licensee, the outdoor facility may have last been scheduled for the feces to be picked up on\nSaturday. Floors made of dirt, gravel, grass or other similar material must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient\nfrequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come\nin contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent\naccumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee must remove the accumulated fecal material\nfrom these enclosures and ensure that all excreta is removed daily from primary enclosures to prevent soiling of the\ndogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. To be\ncorrected by: January 18, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
