      "narrative": "On December 13, 2018, at the time of inspection, a male brown spider monkey was observed with a tail laceration;\nanimal appeared normal in all other respects. The laceration was located approximately at mid-tail, and was\ncreating a gap of approximately three (3) inches in length. Reddened tissues were observed immediately between\nthe lacerated edges of the skin. When asked, the facility representative stated that the laceration happened\napproximately 30 days ago, and that they were treating the injury by applying once a day a topical antibiotic\nmedication. Also, the facility representative mentioned that their attending veterinarian (AV) knew about the case,\nbut could not recall the exact date the AV last saw the animal.\nThe Animal Welfare Act (AWA) requires exhibitors to perform daily observation of all animals at the facility to assess\ntheir health and well-being. The licensee must have in place a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to\nensure timely and accurate information on injuries/lacerations and health problems so that is conveyed to the AV.\nFurthermore, the AWA mandates each exhibitor to use appropriate methods to treat injuries/lacerations, as\ndirected/recommended by the facility's AV, in order to provide adequate veterinary care to the affected spider\nmonkey (and all other regulated animals at the facility). The licensee must contact today the AV, to coordinate and\nprovide adequate medical care/treatment of the tail laceration.\nTo be corrected by: December 14, 2918\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
