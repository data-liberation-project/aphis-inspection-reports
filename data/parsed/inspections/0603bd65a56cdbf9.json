Due to the accumulation of feces the\nanimals could not stand or lay in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste material. In the indoor\nportion of the enclosure, the ground was covered with dirty straw and there was a strong odor of ammonia.\nAnimal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to\nreduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must\nensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are\ncleaned as often as necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative."
