  "narrative": "2.40(a)(1)           CRITICAL\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\n***The licensee had no current program of veterinary care for any of the animals. The only PVC that could be found\nwas one specific to hoofed stock last signed by the veterinarian on March 10, 2015.  Complete, species appropriate,\nand up to date programs of veterinary care are essential for maintaining the health of the animals. An associate\nveterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian\u2019s clinic visited the facility to look at the most pressing veterinary care\nissues on the second day of the inspection. The veterinarian stated that he was primarily a large animal practitioner\nand had little interest in zoological species medicine. The veterinarian recommended that the licensee work with a\nveterinarian with experience in the species comprising the collection for animals other than hoofed stock. The facility\nmust have an appropriate program of veterinary care for all species housed at the facility. Correct by November 15,\n2016\n2.40(b)(2)           DIRECT\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\n***The brown nosed coatimundi cited on the June 2016 inspection report appeared lethargic upon the first day of\ninspection and exhibited slightly labored breathing. When the licensee attempted to rouse the animal, it took only a\nfew slow steps and would then lie back down in its enclosure. The animal appeared to have little interest in its\nsurroundings and was poorly responsive to stimuli. While the coatimundi appeared much more responsive the\nsecond day, episodes such as the one described above may be indicative of disease. This animal must be\nassessed by a veterinarian experienced with the species as soon as possible in order to receive appropriate\ndiagnosis and treatment. An associate veterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian\u2019s clinic visited the facility on the\nsecond day of inspection to evaluate the animal, and recommended further follow-up with a veterinarian\nknowledgeable with the species. The recommendation of the veterinarian must be followed as soon as possible.\n***One arctic fox appears significantly thinner than its cage mate, and has what appears to be fecal staining on the\nfur of its hind quarters. The licensee stated that unlike the other fox, this animal has not grown in its new winter coat\nyet, but the combination of lower body condition at a time when the species normally gains weight, possible\nabnormal stool, and slower winter coat development may be indicative of poor health. This animal must be\nevaluated by the attending veterinarian in order to receive appropriate treatment and management. An associate\n\nveterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian\u2019s clinic visited the facility on the second day of inspection to evaluate the\nanimal, and recommended further follow-up with a veterinarian knowledgeable with the species. The\nrecommendation of the veterinarian must be followed as soon as possible.\n***The cougar is somewhat underweight, with ribs slightly visible. In addition the animal has a plantigrade (dropped\nhocks) stance on its front feet, a stiff gait, and appears to have an intermittent right front lameness while walking. \nThese issues may be symptomatic of disease or management issues that can cause pain or distress to the animal.\nThis cougar requires ongoing assessment by the attending veterinarian in order to receive appropriate diagnosis\nand treatment. The licensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to another facility in the near\nfuture. The animal must be promptly evaluated by the attending veterinarian or safely transferred to the receiving\nfacility for evaluation and care. An associate veterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian\u2019s clinic visited the facility on\nthe second day of inspection to evaluate the animal, and recommended further follow-up with a veterinarian\nknowledgeable with the species. The recommendation of the veterinarian must be followed as soon as possible.\nAll of the above must be corrected by October 28, 2016.\n2.40(b)(2)           CRITICAL\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\n***The female Asiatic black bear was observed pacing in an abnormal behavior pattern. Pacing can be indicative of\nphysical or psychological issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modification.  The bear\nwas noted on inspection to be overweight and to have poor muscle tone (as seen when she stood on her hind legs).\nShe also exhibits a marked angular deformity of her front feet, which turn sharply inward. The licensee stated the\nanimal has had this deformity since she came to the facility. These issues may contribute to pain and reduced\nmobility, and must be evaluated by a veterinarian in order to provide appropriate treatment and management of the\npacing, weight and mobility issues. The licensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to\nanother facility in the near future. The animal must be promptly evaluated by the attending veterinarian or safely\ntransferred to the receiving facility for evaluation and care.\n***The bobcat exhibited abnormal pacing behavior in its enclosure. The animal paced very rapidly and continuously\non the partial platform in the rafters of its enclosure. We observed the animal pacing nearly continuously for over 15\nminutes, and this continued even when the licensee walked away from the enclosure and the inspectors moved out\nof the animal\u2019s line of sight. The bobcat remained in the rafters for the duration of the first day of inspection, and\nwhen asked the licensee stated that the bobcat rarely descended from that area, and primarily ventured down to\nground level only to eat and drink. Abnormal behavior patterns can be indicative of physical or psychological issues\nthat may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modification, and must be evaluated promptly by the\nattending veterinarian in order to receive appropriate treatment and management.\n***The cage mate of the coatimundi cited under the direct NCI, exhibited abnormal pacing behavior in its enclosure.\n\nIt paced rapidly by the rear entrance of its enclosure almost continuously for over ten minutes of observation, and\ncontinued the behavior even when the inspectors and owner stepped away from the enclosure. Abnormal behavior\npatterns can be indicative of physical or psychological issues that may require medical treatment or\nhabitat/husbandry modification, and must be evaluated promptly by the attending veterinarian in order to receive\nappropriate treatment and management.\nAll of the above must be corrected by November 11, 2016.\n2.40(b)(3)           CRITICAL                    REPEAT\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\n***The licensee informed us that in April of 2016, a fallow deer doe was gored by a buck. The licensee described an\nabdominal wound with evisceration. The licensee did not seek veterinary attention for the doe, and stated that the\nwound appeared to close over. Approximately five days later he found the doe dead. This doe likely suffered\nextreme pain and distress over the five day period before its death. The licensee must promptly convey timely and\naccurate health information to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate medical care can be rendered and\nsuffering can be alleviated.\n2.75(b)(1)                    REPEAT\nRECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.\n***The records of animals on hand are incomplete. There is no information on the birth of a fallow deer this past\nmonth, nor are the births of the zebu, highland calf, and cavies recorded. There are also no dates on disposition\nrecords. Records must be kept in accordance with the regulations of the AWA to ensure accurate information vital to\nmanaging animal inventories and husbandry. The licensee must keep complete and accurate exhibitor records.\n2.131(a)\nHANDLING OF ANIMALS.\nOn Thursday, October 6, 2016 the licensee was injured by the Asiatic black bear when attempting to feed it. The\nbear has been quarantined for a second time (the first time was due to the handling incident cited in the August 8,\n2016 inspection report). The licensee required a hospital visit and follow up medical care. After the injury the\nlicensee has had difficulty conducting routine husbandry tasks such as lifting the guillotine gate to allow the bear\naccess to her den, and as a result she has been denied access to this portion of her enclosure.\nOn the second day of the inspection, inspectors observed the licensee feeding the cougar. The licensee, standing\napproximately one foot away from the primary enclosure, dropped the meat right next to a six to eight inch gap\nbetween the flooring and fencing, then pushed the meat into the enclosure by hand. The cougar lunged at the meat\nand snatched it away before the licensee could move out of the vicinity. Although there was no injury, this is an\nextremely dangerous practice and demonstrates insufficient knowledge of the behavior, speed, and strength of\n\ncougars.\nAll licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the\nspecies they maintain in order to provide appropriate handling that minimizes distress, discomfort and potential\nharm. Correct by December 15, 2016.\n2.131(c)(1)                    REPEAT\nHANDLING OF ANIMALS.\n***A wood 2-rung plank fence has  been constructed in front of the porcupine enclosure. Chain link fence is placed\nbehind it to close the gaps between rungs. However, there chain link does not extend the full width of the plank\nfencing. This leaves space large enough between rungs that would allow the entry of unwanted persons and\nanimals.  The fence must be constructed in a manner that ensures the public and unwanted animals do not  gain\naccess to an area that will allow direct contact.\n3.31(a)(2)\nSANITATION.\nCleaning and Sanitation of Primary Enclosures\n***A significant portion of the guinea pig enclosure underneath and around the sipper bottle contained wet bedding.\nWet bedding can lead to discomfort. In addition, it can result in microbial growth in the bedding, predisposing\nanimals to disease. For the comfort and health of the guinea pigs, animals in wet bedding shall be transferred to\nclean primary enclosures. Corrected at the time of inspection.\n3.50(a)\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.  \nStructural Strength\nThe boards used to partially block the 1X1 floor openings in the rabbit cages appear to be treated wood and particle\nboard. The particle board has irregular edges that appear chewed. The boards could pose an ingestion or injury\nhazard to the animals. Outdoor housing facilities for rabbits must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair,\nand protect the rabbits from injury. Correct by November 15, 2016  \n3.50(d)                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.  \nWaste disposal\n\n***The enclosures housing three rabbits had an accumulation of fecal material under the raised cages.\nAccumulations of manure may pose a disease hazard for the animals. The accumulation must be removed for\nanimal health and well-being.\n3.53(a)(4)                    REPEAT\nPRIMARY ENCLOSURES.   \nGeneral\nThe floor of the rabbit cage has 1x1 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin rabbit housed in this cage can\npass through easily. Wooden boards have been placed in the cage, however it does not cover the entire cage floor.\nThe rabbit at times prefers to rest and walk on the slated floor. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner\nthat protects the feet and legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to prevent the feet of\nthe rabbit from passing through.\n3.81\nENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.\n***The licensee could not produce a written plan for environmental enhancement. Such plans are necessary to\nensure that non-human primates receive enrichment that is effective and address their species specific and\nindividual needs. The facility must develop a comprehensive written enrichment plan for the lemurs under its care.\nCorrect by November 15, 2016\n3.82(a)\nFEEDING.   \n***The container of monkey biscuits for the ring tailed lemurs had numerous red ants on and inside the container.\nInfested food may compromise nutritional quality and the pests may cause harm to the animals. Provided food must\nbe clean, wholesome, and palatable. Corrected at the time of inspection.\n3.125(a)                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \nStructural Strength\n***The prairie dog enclosure has a mesh floor with approximately 1 inch by 1 inch diamond shaped openings. While\nthere is straw bedding on much of the flooring, some areas are bare and the animals\u2019 feet could become entrapped\nin the openings. Modifications must be employed to prevent entrapment hazards and foot injuries to the prairie\ndogs.\n***Bear enclosure (catch area and den): The bear enclosure is in need of repair, specifically the den and catch area.\nThe gate for the catch area appears to be held together by chains and locks, although one side of the gate has\nmetal hinge attachments at the top and bottom. The catch area latch is secured with a large metal clip that can be\n\neasily opened by a person. An appropriate lock must be used to secure the gate to prevent unwanted entry of\npersons and the potential escape of the bear. The catch gate must be constructed in a manner that will contain the\nbear. The gate must have appropriate hinges installed to ensure the integrity of the gate to contain the bear.\n***One side of the fence surrounding the den is held together with twine and the other side is not attached to any\nsupport pole. The fence must be structurally sound for the overall safety of the animal and public, and to prevent\nescape.\n***The metal den is excessively rusty and holes are present in various areas where the den comes in contact with\nthe ground. The holes in the den increases the risk of the bear being able to escape from this area and also allows\nfor the entry of unwanted animals. The den must be replaced to ensure containment of the bear, to prevent the\nharborage of pests, and to provide shelter for the animal.\n***The goat enclosure fencing has sharp points and loose fence posts that are easily moved by hand. This can\nresult in injury or escape of the goats. The fence must be repaired for the safety of the animals.\n***The squirrel cage has sharp points and gaps between the mesh sides and top. The licensee stated that on\noccasion he has found wild squirrels sharing the enclosure with the regulated animals. These issues may result in\nescape, injury or disease transmission. The squirrel cage must be repaired to prevent escape or access by wild\nanimals.\n***The Fallow deer enclosure has large gaps at the bottom of the fencing that may predispose to entanglement,\ninjury or escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.\n***The zebu enclosure has large gaps at the bottom of the fencing that may predispose to entanglement, injury or\nescape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.\n***A Jacob\u2019s sheep enclosure containing six sheep has loose fencing held together by twine. This may predispose\nto entanglement, injury or escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.\n3.125(c)\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \nStorage\n***One open forty pound bag of dry dog food was stored in the licensee\u2019s SUV. Another open forty pound bag of dry\ndog food was stored on the floor by the meat freezer and the kibble was damp and deteriorated. Improper storage\ncan result in unwholesome food that can cause dietary deficiencies and foodborne illnesses. Compromised food\nmust be discarded and all wholesome food must be appropriately stored to protect against deterioration,\ncontamination and molding. Correct from this day forward.\n3.125(d)                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \nWaste Disposal\nThe squirrel cage has an excessive amount of sunflower seed and peanut hulls, and other food wastes in the feed\n\ntrough and at the bottom of the cage. The waste also extends outside of the squirrel cage.\nExcess waste can become an attractant to pests and must be cleaned on a frequent basis. Animal and food wastes\nmust be removed from cages and disposed of away from animal enclosures. Wastes should be removed and\ndisposed of in a designated area immediately and in accordance with county and state laws.\n3.127(b)           DIRECT                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, OUTDOOR. \nShelter from Inclement Weather\n***The bear repeatedly went to stand or lie next to its den after feeding, but was locked out of the den area. The\nowner is injured and cannot lift the guillotine gate without assistance because it is in disrepair. The enclosure must\nreliably provide den access for this species, which uses dens in it natural habitat. In addition, the den design is\ninappropriate. The metal pipe construction does not possess sufficient insulating properties for this tropical species,\nand the lack of bedding exacerbates this issue. Bedding provides a soft substrate as well as insulation, and is\nparticularly important for bears because of their motivation to build nests and line dens. Failure to provide\nappropriately furnished dens may result in frustration of motivated behavior, and inability to behaviorally\nthermoregulate. The bear must have access to an appropriately designed den and bedding that meets its species\nspecific needs. This was corrected on the second day of inspection, but a long term and effective method of\ncorrection will be required in the future.\n***The pasture containing three Painted sheep has only one calf hutch for shelter, which cannot accommodate all\nthree sheep at the same time. \n***The arctic fox enclosure has one shelter which is not large enough to house both foxes at the same time.\nLack of adequate access to shelter can cause adverse effects from exposure to detrimental weather conditions.\nAppropriate shelters with enough space to house all animals within the enclosures must be provided.\n***The fallow deer enclosure has only two-sided shelters that cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation.\nIn addition, there are holes and sharp edges in the shelter divider. \n***The mouflon shelter has only two sides, and cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation. In addition, the\nshelter has gaps and loose boards. \nFailure to protect animals from detrimental weather conditions can negatively impact their health and ability to fight\ndisease. Appropriately constructed shelters must be provided.\n***The cougar has no bedding in its den. Bedding provides a soft substrate as well as insulation and is particularly\nimportant for this animal since it is slightly underweight and has mobility issues. Soft bedding helps thinner animals\nstay warm in colder weather, and can help reduce discomfort associated with mobility issues. An appropriate type\nand amount of bedding must be provided in the cougar den.\n\n***The raccoon has no bedding in its den. Bedding provides a soft substrate, as well as insulation in colder weather.\nAn appropriate type and amount of bedding must be provided for the raccoon.\n3.127(d)           CRITICAL                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, OUTDOOR. \nPerimeter Fence\nBear Perimeter Fence: The perimeter fence around the bear enclosure was damaged from a fallen tree. Several\nsections of the chain link fence is sagging to the point that that the structural strength of the fence is compromised.\nSeveral sections of chain link fence are detached from the top support pole. The top support pole is not continuous\naround the top of the perimeter fence; some section are missing. The one section of the right half of the enclosure is\nconstructed of a double layer of chain link fence. The two layers are detached from each other. The strength of this\nsection is compromised. There is also a 3\" gap between the perimeter fence support pole and gate where a person\ncould fit a hand through, allowing inappropriate access to the bear. Gaps and damage to perimeter fencing may\nresult in failure to prevent the entry of unauthorized persons and unwanted animals. The perimeter fence must be\nrepaired to restore its functional integrity.\n3.128\nSPACE REQUIREMENTS. \n***The Patagonian cavy cited on the June 2016 inspection report was rechecked and appears to be continuing to\nheal without incident. No fighting was observed during this inspection, but cavies were noted to chase each other in\nthe enclosure. There are no visual barriers and there is insufficient space to allow animals to remove themselves\nfrom unwanted social contact. This results in stress for the animals. Enclosures must be designed to permit normal\nsocial and postural adjustments for the species in question. Correct by December 15, 2016\n***The Arctic foxes appeared hyper vigilant, agitated, and paced nearly continuously when we approached the\nenclosure. The enclosure has one igloo style shelter that cannot fit both animals comfortably at the same time, and\nthere are no visual barriers that allow them to remove themselves from view, which is a social behavior for foxes. \nNormal postural behaviors for foxes include a motivation to dig, create dens and jump onto elevated areas. Inability\nto engage in highly motivated behaviors such as hiding and digging results in stress to the animals. This enclosure\nis on a concrete slab and does not provide these normal social and postural adjustments for the species in question.\nSuitable dens, visual barriers, and provisions for safe digging must be provided. Correct by December 15, 2016\n***The enclosure for the bear is a corn crib on a concrete slab and this bear exhibits behavioral and orthopedic\nabnormalities. Asiatic black bears are biologically designed to be smaller and slimmer to have the mobility to climb\n\ntrees, so excess weight on this species of bear can cause additional health and behavioral issues. The bear\nenclosure has insufficient space and furnishings (such as climbing structures, and a water feature suitable for\nswimming) to promote exercise. In addition, the substrate is concrete flooring, which can exacerbate mobility issues\nand does not allow for digging, an important normal postural adjustment for bears. In light of the bear\u2019s behavior,\nweight issues and front limb angular deformities, the amount of space, furnishings, and the substrate are not\nappropriate for this bear. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to provide an enclosure design\nthat facilitates normal social and postural adjustments appropriate for the individual bear\u2019s medical needs. The\nlicensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to another facility in the near future. The animal\nmust be promptly evaluated by the attending veterinarian or safely transferred before the correction date. Correct by\nDecember 15, 2016\n3.129(a)\nFEEDING.    \n***According to the licensee, the diet for the cougar includes deer carcasses, hamburger, whole store bought\nturkeys, and chicken leg quarters. The diet for the bobcat consists of consists of raw chicken, turkey and deer meat\nwith some bones. Neither felid is receiving whole carcasses on a regular basis and the licensee stated that the meat\nis not supplemented.  The diet as stated may result in nutritional issues including, but not limited to amino acid\ndeficiencies, calcium deficiencies, calcium/phosphorus imbalances, and vitamin deficiencies. The diet should be\nevaluated by the attending veterinarian, preferably with consultation from a nutritionist. Correct by November 15,\n2016 \nOn the second day of the inspection we observed the cougar being fed chicken parts. The animal rapidly ate the\nfood and when it was finished it licked the concrete flooring where the food had been. An associate veterinarian of\nthe Attending Veterinarian\u2019s clinic observed the animal and recommended feeding to satiety. Food must be offered\nin appropriate quantities as per the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation. Correct by November 15, 2016\n***The diet for the bear includes dog food, fruit, and corn. The bear appeared very agitated and hungry when the\nlicensee offered food, and inspectors observed the bear finishing all the scattered dog kibble within a few minutes.\nBears require a large variety of foods, and in the winter they should have a seasonally appropriate diet and be\nallowed to feed to satiety, as per their normal seasonal metabolic requirements. Consult with the attending\nveterinarian on an appropriate weight reduction program that takes into account the bears seasonal nutritional\nneeds. The licensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to another facility in the near future.\nThe animal must have its diet evaluated by the attending veterinarian (preferably in consultation with a nutritionist)\nor safely transferred before the correction date for diet evaluation. Correct by November 15, 2016\n***According to the licensee, the diet for the Patagonian cavies is approximately 90% rabbit pellets, with about 10 to\n15% orchard grass/clover mix hay. Fresh fruits and vegetables are provided only sporadically. Caviids require\nvitamin C in their diet, and insufficient amounts may result in deficiency and disease. In lieu of a vitamin C\n\nsupplemented pelleted diet, these animals require appropriate types and amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables or\nanother effective method of supplementation to meet this nutritional need. The animal must have its diet evaluated\nby the Attending Veterinarian. Correct by November 15, 2016\n***The potbellied pig was fed chow directly on the enclosure floor, which was contaminated with damp straw mixed\nwith feces and urine. Contaminated food may compromise health and lead to disease. Provided food must be clean,\nwholesome and palatable. Correct by October 14, 2016\n3.130\nWATERING.  \nThe bear\u2019s water receptacle had about one half inch of water at the bottom of the approximately 2 foot by 1 foot by\nsix inch pan. We observed the bear visiting the water receptacle a few times but it did not appear to drink. When the\nwater receptacle was refilled the bear promptly went to drink. Insufficient fresh potable water may result in\ndehydration. Water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Corrected at\nthe time of inspection.\n3.131(a)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \nCleaning of Enclosures\n***The bear enclosure contained several piles of fecal waste and puddles of urine.\n***The Patagonian cavy enclosure contained numerous fecal pellets.\n***The potbellied pig enclosure contained damp straw mixed with feces and urine.\n***The Cape porcupine shelter contained damp, dirty straw bedding.\n***The cougar\u2019s bathing receptacle contained greenish water filled with debris.\nExposure to excessive amounts of feces and urine, soiled bedding and dirty water my pose a disease hazard to the\nanimals. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals with excreta,\nminimize disease hazards and reduce odors.\n3.131(c)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \nHousekeeping\n***There is pokeweed in and around the zebu enclosure, and also scattered in other areas of the facility. Pokeweed\nis poisonous to livestock. The pokeweed must be removed for the safety of the animals.\n***The old coatimundi enclosure (no animals present) is in disrepair and has not been cleaned of old bedding and\nempty feed bags. Empty dirty enclosures can become living areas for pests and need to be cleaned in a timely\n\nmanner to promote health and well-being of the animals. \n***The rhea shelter (side adjacent to sheep enclosure) has metal that is bent upward, exposing a sharp edge. The\nsharp edge is accessible to the sheep in the adjacent enclosure and could cause injury. The sharp edges from the\nsiding must be removed to prevent injury to the sheep.\n3.131(d)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \nPest Control\nNumerous rat holes were observed around the bear enclosure in the area of the den, the prairie dog enclosure,\ncavy enclosure, cape porcupine enclosure, and pheasant enclosures. Rats are known to carry various disease\nhazards and a safe and effective pest control program is required for animal health. Additional measures to prevent\nharborage, i.e. filling in holes to prevent recolonization, must be implement to ensure an effective means of\ncontrolling the rodent population.\n3.132                    REPEAT\nEMPLOYEES. \n***There are currently 55 mammals and several non-regulated animals housed at the facility. Based upon the\nnumber animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal, maintenance, and\nveterinary care there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry\nresponsibilities of the facility on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out\nthe day to day husbandry duties and maintenance or the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to\nensure that cleaning, animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at\nprofessionally acceptable level for the current number of animals housed at the facility.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the undersigned VMO, Dr. Nicolette Petervary, Animal Care\nSpecialist, and the licensee.\nThe incident involving a Patagonian cavy death and gunshot euthanasia of a doe are under review.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPetervary Nicolette, National Animal Care Specialist",
