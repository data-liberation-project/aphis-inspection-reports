The electric fence is not in use. There are two stands of wire on only\ntwo sides of the enclosure and no wire on the other two sides. The inspector reminded the licensee that a two strand\nelectric fence outside the primary enclosure does not meet the requirement for a 6 foot high perimeter fence surrounding\nthe primary enclosure. The licensee said he had tried using the electric fence inside the 6 foot chain link fence, but the\nkangaroos had gotten entangled in it.\nAll outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient\nheight to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals,\nsuch as, but not limited to, large felines (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc.), bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and\nelephants, or less than 6 feet high for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be\nconstructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going\nthrough it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary\ncontainment system for the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary\nenclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter\nfence. Such fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the\nAdministrator. The facility must have a perimeter fence appropriate for the species being housed, 6 feet high, or have an\napproved variance by the Administrator.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
