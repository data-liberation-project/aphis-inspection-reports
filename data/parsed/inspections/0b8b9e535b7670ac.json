      "narrative": "In many aspects, the attending veterinarian (AV) has not been given appropriate authority to ensure provision of adequate\nveterinary care. Both the former and current attending veterinarians stated to USDA inspectors that they did not have the\nfinal say over animal care decisions. They explained their role as to provide recommendations which the facility could\nchoose to uphold or disregard. Events demonstrating this are listed as follows:\n\u2022 The attending veterinarian recommended all female animals be spayed to prevent future complications such as\npyometras. This proposal was not consistently upheld as Runty, an 11yr old female tiger, remained intact and died of a\npyometra the evening of April 19th, 2022.\n\u2022 Ms. Shalope, an estimated 16yr old intact female bobcat, was sedated on October 3rd, 2021, and diagnosed with a\nsevere pathologic fracture of the right ulna due to suspected neoplastic processes. The attending veterinarian strongly\nrecommended immediate euthanasia while under sedation. The facility refused and requested the animal be reversed\nfrom sedation. The following day, acknowledging the severe deterioration of the animal\u2019s condition, the facility allowed\neuthanasia.\n\u2022 Reynard, an estimated 10yr old intact male canine/fox hybrid, was evaluated on July 18th, 2021, by the attending\nveterinarian. After taking into consideration his chronic kidney disease, liver disease, neoplasia, lethargy, lack of urine\noutput and overall decline in health, she recommended humane euthanasia. The facility disagreed with the veterinarian\u2019s\nrecommendation and did not authorize Reynard\u2019s euthanasia. Reynard\u2019s health continued to decline for 10 more days,\nand he was subsequently found deceased in his cage on July 28th, 2021.\n\u2022 Dolly, a 5yr old intact female mountain lion, sustained an injury to her right eye due to a snake bite on July 30th, 2020.\nSince the condition of the eye was not improving with treatment, the attending veterinarian suggested enucleation might\nbe necessary. The facility opted to consult an ophthalmologist. The findings of this consultation were not communicated\nwith the attending veterinarian, and she was not given the authority to decide if enucleation was the best course. Dolly\u2019s\neye condition worsened per the attending veterinarian, at times protruding and exuding purulent discharge until the facility\nallowed enucleation about 1.5 years later in February 2022.\n\u2022 The current attending veterinarian started as the official veterinarian on record 3 months ago in January of 2022. She\nhad been this facility\u2019s veterinarian in the past but took a leave of absence for 2 years during which time another attending\nveterinarian was contracted. During that 2-year period, the previous veterinarian diagnosed several animals with chronic\nconditions and instituted new treatment plans. The current veterinarian was not asked to review all the ongoing treatments\nthat were instituted by the previous veterinarian. The current AV has stated she has not reviewed the fluid treatment plan\nthat is currently ongoing for several foxes. Since the treatments continue to be given as previously prescribed, without\napproval or oversight from the current AV, authority has not been transferred. More specifically, the current AV is not\nafforded the opportunity to establish that the treatments continue to be adequate. Additionally, some of the information\nregarding diagnoses established by the previous AV have not been transferred to the current AV. Without that, the\ncurrent AV cannot make an educated decision about the best way to proceed for these animals.\nWhen the Attending Veterinarian is not given the appropriate authority, the provision of veterinary care may be inadequate\nor inappropriate. Refusing to proceed with treatments or procedures recommended by the AV can lead to unnecessary\npain, discomfort, and suffering. The licensee must assure that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of\nadequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.\nCorrect by May 6th, 2022."

Per the medical records, she remained in poor health for a period of 6\ndays. Facility staff stated that Runty\u2019s sickness was tied to her heat cycle. The attending veterinarian was not consulted;\nrather, the facility\u2019s medical director attempted to provide Runty treatment prescribed by a consulting veterinarian but was\nunable to complete the entire course of medication.

A year later, the\nevening of April 19th, 2022, Runty died and a necropsy conducted by the attending veterinarian noted the cause of death\nas pyometra.\no Colby, an 11yr old intact male tiger, sustained a deep wound on his tail base on August 3rd, 2021. The facility\u2019s medical\ndirector worked with facility staff to sedate Colby and repair the wound without the attending veterinarian\u2019s knowledge.\nAfter the procedure had been completed, the attending veterinarian was notified, but was not given the opportunity to\nassign and approve the treatment plan. The sutures subsequently dehisced two days later.\nFailure to promptly communicate findings with the attending veterinarian delays proper treatment and may cause undue\npain and distress in animals with such conditions. The facility must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication with the attending veterinarian in order to timely convey accurate information on problems of animal\nhealth, behavior, and well-being. This communication is essential for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention.\nCorrect by May 6th, 2022."
