      "narrative": "***A male Burmese Mountain Dog \"Spencer\" that was squinting his right eye, had reddened tissue and clear\ndischarge. On closer observation, the lower eye lid was thickened and what appeared to be a 1/4 inch tear in the\nlower eyelid. The surrounding tissues (conjunctiva) of the right eye also appeared reddened and inflamed. There\nwas also a abrasion under the right eye below the tear that was about 1 inch long. This dog was also observed\noccasionally limping and favoring its right rear leg. Licensee stated this dog probably was injured by another male in\nthe enclosure. The lesions on this dogs eye and limping could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical\ncondition which may be painful. This dog had not been examined by a veterinarian for current conditions nor was\nunder any type of treatment at the time of inspection.\nThe licensee must have this dog seen by a licensed veterinarian no later than September 27, 2014 in\norder to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and\nfollowed."
