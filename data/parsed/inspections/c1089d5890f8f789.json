The temperature at the\ntime of the inspection was 29 degrees F and the previous nights' temperatures have been in the teens. One Boston\nTerrier was observed to be shivering. Lack of sufficient bedding in cold environments increases the risks of sickness\nand hypothermia situations. Clean, dry bedding material is important to provide added protection from the effects of\ntemperatures less than 50 degrees F. More bedding material is necessary when the temperature is less than 35F\ndegrees for the dogs to burrow into and remain clean and dry and have better protection from the cold. The owner\nmust provide more bedding for the dogs and maintain it at sufficient levels any time the temperature is less than 50F\ndegrees and additional bedding must be added when the temperature is less than 35F degrees.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted by the inspectors with a facility representative. Further\ndiscussion was done when the report was delivered.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPlumlee Konnie, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
