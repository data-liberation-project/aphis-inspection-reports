He\nhas a large amount of a brownish green discharge in the hair around the inside of both eyes near the muzzle. Upon\ncloser inspection, both of his eyes appear normal.

As part of the facility's program of\nveterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance to ensure that animals\nare cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a regular basis.\nTo be corrected by August 29, 2015\nInspection and exit interview conducted by Lynn Clarke and Randall Wagner with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nWagner Randall, Animal Care Inspector"
