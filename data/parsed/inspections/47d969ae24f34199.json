      "narrative": "On July 30, 2018, a Yorkshire boar (#10) weighing 563 lbs.was removed from its primary enclosure at\napproximately 8 a.m. and placed in a connecting alleyway. No shade or water was provided for the animal and the\ncaretaker forgot to return the pig to the enclosure after the cleaning procedure. At approximately 1:20 p.m. the pig\nwas discovered dead in the alleyway. Historical reports of ambient temperatures that day ranged from 75-101\ndegrees. Large pigs are particularly sensitive to heat stress and hyperthermia. The presumed cause of death,\nundisputed by necropsy results, was heat stroke. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight and lack of water likely\ncontributed to the death of this animal.\nWhen sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of an animal sufficient shade shall be provided to allow\nan animal kept out doors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.\nThe information regarding this adverse event was not previously reported to the USDA and was provided to this\ninspector during the inspection process. Review of IACUC documentation from the August 2018 minutes and a\nrelated adverse event document indicate that the responsible employee was terminated and the location director\nwould review facility policies and procedures. It could not be determined during this inspection if sufficient\ncorrections and preventative measures had been implemented to prevent re-occurrences of this non-compliance.\nThe IACUC should review and evaluate all corrections and preventative measures associated with this\nnon-compliance. Correct by: October 10, 2018.\nThis inspection was conducted with multiple CMP and compliance staff September 4-6, 2018.\nThe exit interview was conducted on September 10, 2018 with the IO, IACUC chair, interim CMP executive director,\ncompliance director and other compliance staff."
