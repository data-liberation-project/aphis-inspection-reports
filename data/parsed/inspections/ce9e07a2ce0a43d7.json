Matted fur pulls and separates from the\nskin potentially causing pain and skin irritations and decreases the ability of the animal to regulate body\ntemperature. This dog should be groomed on a routine basis to prevent matted fur and for the comfort of the dog.\nThe dog was also observed with her tongue hanging out of mouth. On closer examination the dog was observed to\nhave no teeth. Under the mouth saliva was clumped into the fur. Lack of teeth can impact an animal\u2019s ability to eat\nnormally and maintain appropriate body weight. Additionally the dog had a 1.5 inch irregular shaped mass under the\nnipple region. This dog needs to be seen by the attending veterinarian in a timely manner to diagnose and provide\ntreatment options.\nCorrect by: Dec 5, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional inspector\nKatie Steneroden, DVM"
