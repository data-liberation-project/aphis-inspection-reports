      "narrative": "There was a lionhead rabbit with small scabs and moderate skin redness extending \u00bc of up the way up the rabbit(cid:25)s\near. It was explained that the attending veterinarian had been consulted over the phone and had recommended\ntreatment with anti-parasitic medication. This treatment was applied by the owner as directed by the vet. However,\nthis animal has not been physically examined by the veterinarian and diagnostics have not been performed.\nConversation with the licensee revealed that a rabbit with more severe ear disease and a head tilt had died about a\nmonth ago. Cause of death was not determined. The attending veterinarian had been consulted over the phone\nseveral times regarding this rabbit(cid:25)s issue, and advice had been followed, but the rabbit had not been physically\nexamined or diagnosed by veterinary staff. Lack of appropriate diagnostics for a problem which may be recurrent\nmay contribute to the spread of illness among other animals within the population.\nThe goat Mariah remains visibly very thin with spinal bones and ribs visible. Conversation with the licensee revealed\nthat the attending veterinarian had been consulted over the phone on several occasions (5/6/14 and 6/9/14) and\nhad given recommendations regarding treatment and progress of this animal'(cid:25)s illness. Treatment recommendations\nhave been followed and the licensee reports that the animal has gained a little weight. This animal had not been\nphysically examined by veterinary staff during this time frame. Lack of appropriate diagnostics for a problem that is\nchronic may contribute to use of a suboptimal treatment plan for the animal and continuing illness.\nThough veterinary phone consultations can provide valuable information regarding maintenance of animal health,\nthey are not appropriate for the diagnosis, control, and treatment of serious conditions such as those which are\nrecurring, chronic, or result in the death of an animal within the population. Animals with serious, chronic, or\nrecurrent conditions must be physically examined and diagnosed by veterinary staff.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Licensee and the Authorized Person."
