I then had to explain that the veterinarian employed by the facility must be\nconsulted and provide the veterinary care to the animals. It was then that licensee's called the veterinarian. The\nlicensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented. The licensee must ensure that all animals\nreceive adequate veterinary care at all times. The veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and the\ninspection was discontinued at that time. The licensees followed the veterinarians instructions. The piglet died but\nthe female pig is doing well. It was corrected on the first day of the inspection.\n** There is a brown rabbit that had excessive matting covering its entire rear end. The mats are so dense that you\ncan not differentiate its tail from the accumulated mats. Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal.\nIn addition, matting can foster skin infections and can hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. The\nlicensee needs to have the matted fur removed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate\nveterinary care at all times. Correct by October 4, 2015"
