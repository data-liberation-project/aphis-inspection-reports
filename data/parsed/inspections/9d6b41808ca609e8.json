It was a moist looking, reddish in appearance, 1\u201d\nprolapsed growth of tissue protruding from the lower corner of the right eye. It was inflamed, had a milky-green\ndischarge, and was impairing her vision in that eye. This could be caused by infection, allergies, injury, irritation or\nother medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee stated that this mass of skin had been on her eye for\nabout a year. The licensee also stated that Aris had been seen by a veterinarian within that year, but no\nimprovement had been made to the condition of the eye and there was no documentation proving that a visit to the\nveterinarian had been made. The licensee scheduled an appointment for Aris to go to the veterinarian the following\nday (10/27) at 2pm.The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis\nand appropriate treatment plan.
