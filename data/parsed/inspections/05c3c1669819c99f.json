The inspectors also identified that\nthis dog has redness in both ears along with a black discharge in the ears during the inspection on 2/13/24. The medical\nrecord reviewed on 2/15/24 shows that a veterinarian diagnosed an ear infection on 2/14/24 and started the dog on\ntreatment.\n*Dog #19423 was identified by the inspectors as having a large amount of thick hard brown grey material (tartar) on the\nteeth. The medical records, including the last annual exam, do not note this finding or any method of prevention or\ntreatment.\nThe facility shall ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases such as dental\ndisease and ear infections to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.
