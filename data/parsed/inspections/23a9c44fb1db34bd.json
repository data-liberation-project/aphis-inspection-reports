When the APHIS\nofficials identified these guinea pigs, the licensee moved the guinea pigs to a new enclosure. The licensee informed\nthe APHIS officials that he had not seen guinea pigs before with similar skin conditions. Hair loss, thickened skin,\nand red inflamed skin has many causes such as parasites, infection, and other medical problems. The guinea pigs\nmust be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate\ntreatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the\ncondition, must be documented and made available to the APHIS official upon request. Correct by November 19,\n2016."
