      "narrative": "Over the last two years, a total of four animals have been found dead in their enclosures in conjunction with recent\ncardiac bleeds and a gross necropsy has been performed. The two earlier animals were found dead the day after a\ncardiac bleed was performed and the cause of death was recorded as a cardiac tear in July of 2015 (12 previous\ncardiac bleeds) and July of 2016 (26 previous cardiac bleeds). In the last four months, two animals have been found\ndead in their enclosures. On 23 January 2017, animal 764 (38 previous cardiac bleeds) was found dead, 12 days\nafter the last cardiac bleed on 11 January 2017 and the necropsy noted \"Thorax noted w/ hemorrhage. Cardiac\ntampanade. Spontaneous myocardial rupture\". On 22 April 2017, animal 781 (4 previous cardiac bleeds) was found\ndead, 3 days after a cardiac bleed on 19 April 2017 and the necropsy noted \"pericardial sac full of hemorrhage -\nsecondary to needle sticks most likely\".\nThis recent increase in unexpected mortality related to cardiac abnormalities on necropsy in animals undergoing\nrepeated cardiac bleeds is a change in the previous pattern. Adequate veterinary care includes guidance regarding\nthe care and use of animals during the conduct of research. Repeated anesthetized cardiac bleeds is not a widely\nused method for survival blood collection in guinea pigs and in conjunction with the recent animal deaths after 4-38\ncardiac bleeds in individual animals, additional guidance needs to be provided by the veterinarian regarding the\ncare and use of animals.\nCorrect by 30 May 2017.\nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives over several days. The exit interview was conducted\nover the phone."
