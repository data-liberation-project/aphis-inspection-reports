      "narrative": "A young Boston puppy, in an enclosure with 2 of its litter mates, was observed with a yellowish discharge from both\neyes and the tissue around and in the inner corner of the eyes was reddened. It was also noted that this puppy also\nhad several small puncture like wounds on its muzzle and ears. The licensee was not aware of this puppies\ncondition until it was pointed out to him by the inspectors. The licensee must have this puppy examined by a\nveterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\nIn the outdoor enclosures there are 11 Labrador Retrievers with varying degrees of open wounds, from\napproximately 1/4 to 2 inches in diameter and generally located on the back side of the ear flaps. 1 male #5863 and\n8 females #1522, 5607, 7116, 5535, 1901, 0011, 6B6C, 2223, and 2 females with no IDs found. The licensee was\ntreating these dogs with a medicated spray which included written instructions to apply it every 48 hrs. When\nquestioned by the inspectors as to when the dogs were last treated the care taker stated it was \"Last Friday\", which\nwould be closer to 72 hrs since treatment was given to these dogs. The licensee must follow the labeled instructions\non the medications at all times to ensure it works as intended.\nInside of a medicine cabinet there were 2 unlabeled bottles of medicine, When questioned the licensee said that\nthe blue liquid was \"Ivermect\" and the other yellow liquid was \"Albon\".\nAn expired bottle of Pyrantel (05-14) was found intermingled with the other medications in the cabinet and therefore\nready for use.\nExpired medications may be contaminated, may not work as expected, and could harm the animals. Proper\ninformation and dosage is essential information so the animals are not undermedicated or overmedicated. All\nmedications used on the animals must not be expired and all bottles need to have the proper labels as to what the\nproduct is and the expiration date on the bottle in order to protect the health of the animals. Licensee must ensure\nthat all medications maintained for and used on the animals are properly labeled and not expired at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 22 Sept 16."
