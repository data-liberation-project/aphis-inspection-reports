Metal wires, which were in place to tie the metal sheet to the post for support, had sharp points that were\nprotruding out into the enclosure. At the lower edge, the metal sheet wasn't securely tied to the metal post and was\nsticking out, creating sharp jagged edges that were facing into the enclosure where the animals could come into\ncontact with them.\nAll enclosures and structures within the enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding\nedges, holes, and gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and\nmaintenance should be in place to ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the\nanimals from injury.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
