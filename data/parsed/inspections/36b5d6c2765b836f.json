The skin under the mats appeared normal, however, one of the animals withdrew and\nseemed irritated upon gentle manipulation of one of the mats near its abdomen.\nExtensive matting can cause discomfort to animals and lead to illness. For example, matted hair may eventually pull\non an animal's skin, impede normal movement, or serve as a substrate for disease organisms.\nAppropriate methods, such as a program of haircoat maintenance, should be used to appropriately prevent, control,\nand treat discomfort and/or disease issues that may arise from excessive matting.\nCorrect by 6/30/2014.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Authorized Person."
