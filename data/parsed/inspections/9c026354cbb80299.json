The enclosure (S-10),\ncontains two adult Wheaten Terriers that can come in contact with the broken and rusted wire. The affected area is\nlocated in the outdoor run near the front of the enclosure. The plastic coating on the wire has been damaged and is\nnow exposing bare metal that is rusty and sharp. There are eight sharp points protruding upward from the floor. The\nsharp points are between approximately one to two inches in length.\nThe licensee moved the dogs from the enclosure at the time of inspection.\nSurfaces that are not free of excessive rust cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust and pitting can\nalso affect the structural strength of the surfaces. Sharp points that the dogs can come in contact with could\npotentially cause injuries. The licensee must repair or replace the rusted wire flooring and ensure all surfaces of the\nhousing facility are maintained on a regular basis.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
