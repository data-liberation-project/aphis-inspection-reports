During discussions with facility owners, it was\nnoted that this is a frequent occurrence for this particular goat and is corrected when observed.\nTwo areas of the enclosure fencing had a large enough gap between the bottom of the fence and the ground which\ncould allow for small animals to escape or unwanted animals to enter.\nFencing that is not structurally sound does not provide adequate protection from escape, injury, and entrance of\nunwanted animals.\nThe facility shall ensure that the enclosure fencing is structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect and\nthe contain the animals.
