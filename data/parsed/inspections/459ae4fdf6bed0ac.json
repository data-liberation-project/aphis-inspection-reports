There is NO fourth side. Perimeter\nfences must be properly constructed as a secondary containment so as to protect and contain the regulated species\nand prevent unwanted entry by animals and unauthorized persons.\nThe inspection and exit interview was conducted with APHIS personnel Dr. Simone Tomlinson, VMO and the facility\nmanager."
