Originating air transportation from Bucharest, Romania\n(OTP), the dog flew four hours and 30 minutes (+/-) arriving safely at Qatar's Doha International Airport (DIA). The dog\nthen flew for another 15 hours and 26 minutes (+/-) on Qatar Airways flight QR-0777 to MIA at 20:49 hours on July 26,\n2023; dog was found dead in crate at approximately 06:30 hours the next day (July 27, 2023). Following CDC and USDA\ndirections, the facility manager contracted a USDA intermediate handler who took the cadaver and delivered to a local\nlicensed veterinarian, who arranged for a necropsy.\nDuring air transportation of dogs/cats, it is the responsibility of the air carrier to observe the animals as frequently as\ncircumstances allow, but not less than once every 4 hours if the animal cargo area is accessible during flight. If the animal\ncargo area is not accessible during flight, the air carrier must observe the dogs/cats whenever they are loaded and\nunloaded and whenever the animal cargo space is otherwise accessible to make sure they have sufficient air for normal\nbreathing, that the animal cargo area meets the heating and cooling requirements of \u00a7 3.16(d) under the Animal Welfare\nAct (AWA), and that all other applicable standards of this AWA subpart are being complied with. The air carrier must\ndetermine whether any of the dogs or cats are in obvious physical distress, and arrange for any needed veterinary care as\nsoon as possible. Also, if a dog or cat is obviously ill, injured, or in physical distress, it must not be transported in\ncommerce, except to receive veterinary care for the condition. Furthermore, the transportation regulations contained in\nthis AWA subpart must be complied with by the air carrier until a consignee takes physical delivery of the dog/cat if the\nanimal is consigned for transportation, or until the animal is returned to the consignor.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
