The removable wire floor became wedged in\nplace preventing the ferret from becoming unstuck. The facility found the back corner of the track that holds the\nremovable floor to be slightly warped allowing the wire floor to drop out of the track when manipulated. The cage\nmust be maintained in good repair to prevent injury. At the time of this inspection the facility has already repaired\nand modified all existing ferret cages to prevent a recurrence of this problem, thus correcting the noncompliance.\nThe exit briefing was conducted with Dr. Sutherland, Associate VP of ARP, Senior Clinical Veterinarian and Director\nof IACUC.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSutherland Bart, Veterinary Medical Officer"
