The presence of the den box against the fencing effectively reduces the height of the perimeter\nfence. A substantial perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required\nfor all outdoor housing facilities that contain potentially dangerous animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals\nin the facility by ensuring in the event of an accidental escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to\nprevent the animal from leaving the property and endangering public safety thereby placing the animal(cid:25)s life in\njeopardy. Correct by removing all material that is in close proximity to the perimeter fence that an animal can climb\nonto or by extending the perimeter fence so there is an effective 8 feet in height fencing from the surface.\nNO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED FROM THIS SITE UNTIL THIS SITE IS APPROVED.\nThe site inspection and exit interview were conducted by VMO Cody Yager and CS Patrick Keith with the licensee\nand facility representative/property owner.\nAdditional Inspectors\nKeith C.S Patrick, Compliance Specialist"
