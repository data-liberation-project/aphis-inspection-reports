On the\nsecond feeding, the participant extended her hand past the barrier railing and was admonished by the employee. This\npole-feeding process was observed four times at the time of the inspection\nCurrent guidance states that the above method of public feeding does not adequately minimize the risk of harm to assure\nthe safety of the animals and the public as the tiger could attempt to pull the pole into the enclosure and potentially harm\nitself on its sharp points or a person could push the pole through the disc and into the enclosure, potentially injuring the\ntiger.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals\nand the public.\nCorrect by November 30, 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility staff.\nn"
