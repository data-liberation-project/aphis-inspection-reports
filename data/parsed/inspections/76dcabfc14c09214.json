After finishing routine husbandry in the Dall sheep enclosure, the employee did not secure the\nenclosure gate properly. The sheep was able to gain access to a goat enclosure and while in that enclosure,\nsuffered a terminal injury from an encounter with a male goat. Since the incident, the facility has retrained the\nemployee and modified the gate with additional security measures.\nThe handling of this animal was not conducted in a manner that prevented trauma, behavioral stress, and physical\nharm. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not\ncause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The\nfacility must continue to handle all animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible.\nCorrected at the time of inspection.\nInspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility C.O.O."
