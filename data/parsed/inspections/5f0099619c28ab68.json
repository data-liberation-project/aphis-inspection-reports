Some holes are dug back underneath the\nconcrete allowing rough edges to be exposed. The holes are large enough that a dog could become entrapped if\nconcrete cracks and collapses into the hole or if the dirt collapses. This affects the ability of enclosure flooring to\ncontain the dogs securely. It could lead to potential injury if the dogs try to escape under the fencing or if material or\ndirt collapses affecting the safety and health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure all enclosure dirt flooring is kept\nin good repair to protect the dogs from injury and contain the dogs securely at all times.
