Observation records and necropsy submission information show that the ewe was observed by\nresearch personnel on September 25, 2019 to be less active than normal. On September 28, the ewe was\nrecumbent and not displaying normal avoidance behavior when personnel entered the pen. On September 29, 2019\nthe ewe was found dead in its pen. Diagnostic laboratory necropsy findings on the ewe included pulmonary edema,\nmycoplasma infection, copper deficiency, aspiration pneumonia and mild suppurative hepatitis.\nThe IACUC approved research protocol for this study states: \u201cWith our observation schedule we expect to\nrecognize most all severely affected individuals so that they can be captured, examined, and then humanely\neuthanized to alleviate pain and distress rather than dying of disease. For practical purposes, euthanasia will be\nperformed when the animal becomes sufficiently weak, lethargic, or moribund that they are not able to rise and flee\nto avoid restrain (sic) by an approaching research or animal care member.\u201d\nThe ewe died without the benefit of euthanasia despite observations recorded by research personnel on September\n28, 2019 which support the ewe had reached the described endpoint for euthanasia as outlined in the approved\nresearch protocol. This is an unapproved deviation from the IACUC approved protocol and not in compliance with 9\nCFR 2.31 (c)(7).\nTo ensure the well-being and humane treatment of all research animals, it is important for the IACUC to review and\napprove any significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing research activities\nCorrect by February 06, 2020\nThis inspection was conducted on 29JAN2020 and 30JAN2020 with the facility Attending Veterinarian.\nThe exit interview was conducted on 05FEB2020 with the Attending Veterinarian and the facility Research Integrity\nand Compliance Officer."
