Unfortunately, the keeper's left index finger\nslipped through along with meat, and consequently the tiger bit off the tip of the finger. The keeper did not follow\nestablished safety and hand-feeding procedures and policies. The facility's established policy is for keepers to not\nhand-feed carnivores; keepers must use tongs and/or other tools to feed carnivores.\nEven tough the tiger was always contained and was not physically harmed, the used training protocol (painting) may\nhave caused unnecessary behavioral stress to the animal. Officials at the facility communicated that safety,\nhand-feeding and training protocols/policies will be re-examined, and to prevent similar incidents, if needed, these\nwould be amended.\nThis was a focused inspection limited to the tiger incident, the associated tiger's primary enclosure, housing areas\nand exhibit.\nThe particulars that led to the incident and interaction between the tiger and keeper are currently under internal\nreview by officials at Zoo Miami.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Mr. Matthew James, Chief of the Animal Science Division at\nZoo Miami."
