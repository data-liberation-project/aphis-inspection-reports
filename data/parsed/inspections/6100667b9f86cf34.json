      "narrative": "On inspection, a 16 month old male Dromedary camel named Bulla was found to be in need of veterinary care. The\ncamel(cid:25)s left rear leg had multiple cuts above the foot on the outside surface of the leg. The multiple cuts ranged in\nsize from approximately 0.5 to 3 inches and displayed hair loss in the areas of the wounds. Some of the cuts were\nblack in color while other cuts were pink to red in coloration. The camel was observed shifting its weight to the right\nrear leg while also picking up the left rear leg periodically. The left hind leg appeared swollen compared to the right\nhind leg. According to staff, the injury was being treated with a topical spray, but no documentation was available to\nverify the treatment. A veterinarian had not been contacted about the injury to the camel leg because the licensee\nstated he thought it was a minor cut and it didn(cid:25)t need veterinary involvement. The Program of Veterinary Care did\nnot have any listed medications or treatments for cuts, wounds, or any injuries. By not appropriately treating the\ncamel(cid:25)s injury not only is it causing pain and discomfort in the animal but also it exposes the animal to secondary\ninfections and further medical complications. This animal must be seen by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation\nof examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained by the Licensee and made available for further\ninspection by APHIS officials. In addition, the licensee must have frequent communication with his attending\nveterinarian for all health issues within a timely manner. All medications and treatments must be approved, in\nwriting, by the attending veterinarian before use on any animal.\nCorrect By: Corrected at time of Exit\nInspection conducted by Staff and Exit conducted with Licensee on 7/30/2014.\nInspection sent by Certified mail at Licensee(cid:25)s request on 7/31/2014.\nAdditional Inspectors\nYager Cody, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
