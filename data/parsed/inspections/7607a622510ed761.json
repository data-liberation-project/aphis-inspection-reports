An indoor housing primary\nenclosure was observed to contain a single juvenile Yorkshire Terrier adjacent to an enclosure housing 3 juvenile\nYorkshire Terrier puppies from the same litter. When the facility representative was asked why the single puppy was\nbeing housed alone, they responded that the puppy likely jumped over the divider into the adjacent enclosure. During the\ninspection one of the three puppies was observed jumping over the divider into the adjacent enclosure with the single\npuppy. Additionally, it was noted that a single enclosure in the sheltered housing section of the facility was housing 8 adult\nYorkshire Terrier dogs where the rest of the enclosures were housing between 2-4 dogs. When inquiring about why this\nenclosure is housing more dogs than is being observed in the rest of the facility, the representative stated the dogs have\njumped into this enclosure from adjacent enclosures.\nThe primary enclosures not effectively containing the animals could lead to the animals being injured while jumping over\ndividers, compatibility issues between dogs, or an animal escaping the facility. Housing facilities for dogs must be\ndesigned and constructed so they are structurally sound. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the\nanimals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.\nCorrect by 23 October 2025"
