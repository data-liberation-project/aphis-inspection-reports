      "narrative": "There are 10 puppies from 4 four litters whose vaccination and parasite prevention records show that the licensee is not\nfollowing the schedule approved by their veterinarian in the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). Falcore has 5 puppies\nborn on February 26, Fiona has 1 puppy born on March 7, Molly has 1 puppy born on March 22, and Lacey has 3 puppies\nborn on March 24. The PVC schedules puppies to be treated with Pyrantel at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age. There\nare medical records for the puppies written on a physical calendar in addition to records recorded in a computer program.\nThe calendar shows that all puppies were treated with Pyrantel on April 6 and April 26. On the respective dates of each of\nthose treatments, Falcore\u2019s puppies were 5 and 8 weeks old, Fiona\u2019s were 4 and 7 weeks, and Molly and Lacey\u2019s were\nabout 2 and 5 weeks. The computer records show all litters were treated separately at with Pyrantel at 3, 5, 6, and 7\nweeks of age.\nThe PVC also includes a schedule for treatment with fenbendazole for three consecutive days starting at 2 weeks of age\nthen repeated every two weeks until 12 weeks old. Three-day treatments of fenbendazole were given for all puppies\nstarting on April 13 according to the calendar. Falcore\u2019s puppies were 6 weeks old, Fiona\u2019s 5 weeks, and Molly and\nLacey\u2019s about 3 weeks. There are no other fenbendazole treatments for the puppies on the calendar. The computer\nrecords show the three-day fenbendazole treatments given at 6 and 7 weeks for all litters.\nThe PVC schedule for vaccinations has puppies\u2019 getting a parvovirus only vaccine (Neopar) at 6 weeks of age and then\nevery 14 to 21 days until 18 weeks old. The calendar shows that \u201c12 puppies\u201d got the vaccine on April 13, but Falcore\u2019s\npuppies were 6 weeks old, Fiona\u2019s were 5 weeks and Molly and Lacey\u2019s were about 3 weeks. The facility also has 3\nweaned puppies about twelve weeks old from another litter that may be included in the \u201c12 puppies\u201d. Falcore\u2019s puppies\nwere 5 and 7 weeks old on those dates respectively, Fiona\u2019s 4 and 6weeks, and Molly and Lacey\u2019s were not yet 5 weeks\nold when either were given. The computer records, like those for parasite treatments, have a different schedule for these\nvaccines, but do not record that any vaccines were given. The PVC also includes a schedule for Bordetella vaccine, but\nthere is no record of Bordetella being given to any of the puppies.\nParasites, especially intestinal worms, are very common in puppies. Contagious diseases like parvovirus and distemper\nare also very common. These diseases can cause serious illness and are a common cause of death in puppies. Because\nof the nature of these diseases, the content and timing of the prevention programs is extremely important.\nThere is no record of the annual sampling for heartworm in at least one dog as scheduled in the Program of Veterinary\nCare (PVC) approved by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian confirmed in a phone conversation with\nthe inspector that this has not been done in the last year.\nAnnual sampling for internal parasites like heartworms is an important part of health monitoring since these parasites\ncannot be detected without testing and the illness they cause can only be seen when the damage to heart or lungs has\nalready begun.\nEach dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and\nsigned by the attending veterinarian and it must include Vaccinations for contagious and/or deadly diseases (including\nparvovirus and distemper) and sampling and treatment of parasites to be done in accordance with the schedule approved\nby the attending veterinarian.\nTo corrected by: May 9, 2025\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
