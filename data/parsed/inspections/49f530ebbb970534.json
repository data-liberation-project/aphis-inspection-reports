The thick buildup of material on the\nsurface and encasing the affected teeth make it difficult to visualize the normal shape of the teeth. An upper right\ncheek tooth is loose and .has a crack extending down from the gum line. The dog is also missing some lower and\nupper teeth.\nTarter buildup, loose and missing teeth can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to health problems for the\ndog. The abnormal buildup of material on the teeth can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally. The\nlicensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. The\noutcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must\nensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: October 2, 2015.\nExit interview conducted with licensee."
