      "narrative": "The following dogs were cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on the inspection report dated June 06, 2016 and were not\nevaluated by a licensed veterinarian as required on the inspection report. The licensee did attempt to clean the\nteeth of these dogs (#84 and #78) on his own.\nOne adult, female, Yorkshire terrier (\"Little Daisy\", Tag #32, DOB 2008) has hair-loss on both ears. Nearly all of the\nhair is gone on both ears and both ears are moderately thickened and dark in color. There is dark scabs/crusting on\nthe inside and outside of both ears.\nOne adult, female, Yorkshire terrier (\"Fluffy\", Tag #84) has hair-loss on both ears and had severe dental tartar.\nNearly all of the hair was gone on both ears. Both ears were mildly thickened with dark scabs/crusting present on\nthe surface of the skin. The severe dental tartar covered nearly all of the remaining front and cheek teeth. In some\nareas the gums were pulled back from the teeth and there was a creamy white discharge present along the\ngumline. One of the upper left front teeth was severely loose and moved when the dog stuck her tongue against the\ntooth. The licensee removed a significant amount of tartar from this dog's teeth himself.\nOne adult, female Yorkshire terrier (ID #78) has a buildup of a thick dark brown tartar encasing the entire surface of\nthe cheek teeth and the majority of the upper canine tooth on the left side of the mouth. A light brown tartar was\nencasing the entire surface of the upper and lower cheek teeth and the majority of the upper canine tooth on the\nright side of the mouth. The gums are moderately reddened and a creamy white substance is located along the\ngum line of the upper left cheek teeth.\nOne adult, female, Maltese (\"Dolly\", Tag #82) had severe dental tartar. The severe dental tartar covered nearly all of\nthe remaining cheek teeth and part of each front tooth and canine. The gums were severely red and swollen and in\nsome areas the gums were pulled back from the teeth with a creamy white discharge present along the gumline.\nThe inspectors observed this dog excessively licking. The licensee removed a significant amount of tartar from this\ndog's teeth himself.\nHair loss can be an indication of an underlying health problem. Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to\nthe dog and lead to further health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be\ndocumented and available to the inspectors upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate\nveterinary care at all times.\nThis was a focused inspection concerning only the non-compliant items cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on inspection report\ndated June 06, 2016. The following dogs were evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and received treatment:\nMorkie puppy (DOB 4/13/16, Microchip # 7E10033722)\nFemale Yorkshire terrier (\"Jewel Sue\", Tag #97, DOB 2009)\nFemale Yorkshire terrier (Tag #80)\nFemale, Yorkshire terrier (\"Dolly Ann\", Tag #89, DOB 2006)\nThe following dog received toenail maintenance:\nFemale Yorkshire terrier (#78)\nExit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, IDALS and the facility representative."
