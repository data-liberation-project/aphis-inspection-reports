      "narrative": "On the morning of Saturday March 26, 2022 the animal care technician found that one rack of squirrel monkeys (housing\n5 monkeys on study) was askew and the water line to the rack was disconnected from the water supply. The monkeys\nappeared fine and the water supply was reattached and flow verified. A vet tech checked on the monkeys that morning-no\nissues identified. On the morning of Sunday March 27, 2022 the animal care technician noted that one squirrel monkey\nwas lying on the floor of its enclosure. The vet tech started triage and called the veterinarian who arrived quickly. The\nmonkey was hypothermic, in lateral recumbency and appeared dehydrated. Supportive care was provided and due to lack\nof response the monkey was euthanized a few hours later. A second monkey was found to be alert but with ataxia and\ntremors of the hind limbs. Treatment and supplementation were supplied, and this monkey made a full recovery. The\nother three monkeys remained clinically normal. A necropsy report for the monkey that died showed changes consistent\nwith low fluid volume and/or low blood pressure such as severe dehydration. The review of husbandry records conducted\nby the IACUC showed that the monkeys most likely did not have access to water for a period of up to 17 hours which with\nother factors such as age and study procedures may have contributed to the clinical presentation of the two affected\nmonkeys.\nAccess to a sufficient quantity of potable water is necessary for the monkeys to prevent dehydration and provide for good\noverall health. If potable water is not continually available to the nonhuman primates, it must be offered to them as often\nas necessary to ensure their health and well-being, but no less than twice daily for at least 1 hour each time, unless\notherwise required by the attending veterinarian or research approved by the Committee. The facility has conducted\nretraining of husbandry staff and instituted additional daily checks of the watering system. Corrected prior to inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, the Director of the Office of Animal\nWelfare Assurance and other facility representatives.\nn"
