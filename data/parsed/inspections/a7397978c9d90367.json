The staff discovered feathers present within the aviary, and later identified burrowing holes under the\nground of the exhibit, suspecting a rodent as the cause of predation event.\nOngoing threats due to predation are a concern for all birds housed in their respective enclosures, as these opportunities\ncontribute to unnecessary stress, injuries, fear, and occurrences of trauma for all birds on-hand. The facility must ensure\nthat bird enclosures are maintained in good repair, protect the birds from injury, contain the birds, and restrict other\nanimals from entering that may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within.\nCorrective actions were promptly taken by the facility following this occurrence.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
