The rabbit was\nindividually housed on the bottom level with another enclosure above.

The rabbit tried to get out of the\nenclosure in this gap and became entrapped with the neck being compressed between the metal support and the\nenclosure above. The facilities\u2019 investigation revealed the cause of death to be asphyxiation from becoming entrapped.\nThis enclosure was not constructed of such material and of such strength to safely contain the rabbit.

Two additional enclosures were identified\nwith small areas of brown fecal staining in the back corners of the enclosure.
