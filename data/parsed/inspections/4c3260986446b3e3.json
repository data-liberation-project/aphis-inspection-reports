According to\nthe licensee, the door of the rabbit's enclosure had inadvertently been left open and the rabbit was able to get out.\nThe licensee returned the rabbit to its original enclosure.\n***An adult dog was observed in an enclosure housing a rabbit. The dog had not been present in the enclosure\nwhen the area was first inspected. The rabbit had a large shelter structure with a small access opening to get away\nfrom the dog. The rabbit's enclosure had cattle panels for walls along with chicken wire that reached up the majority\nof the height of the panels. The top of the enclosure was covered with wire panels. There was an approximately 3\ninch horizontal gap between the access door and a vertical support pole, which was large enough for a dog to fit\nthrough, near the top of the enclosure. The licensee removed the dog from the enclosure during the inspection.\nEnclosures which do not adequately contain the animals or restrict other animals from entering increase the risk of\ninjury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that enclosures for rabbits are structurally sound and are kept in\ngood repair to protect the animals from injury, are maintained to contain the animals, and restrict the entrance of\nother animals at all times. To be corrected by: August 5, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee on July 31, 2017."
