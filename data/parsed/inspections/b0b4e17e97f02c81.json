The licensee acquired the animal on 12/27/2019 from an individual that had\npreviously treated the animal for an upper respiratory infection, but still appeared to have residual clinical signs.\nThe licensee\u2019s Program of Veterinarian Care specifically states that \u201cif a puppy does not respond to the first choice\nof antibiotic then seek veterinary advice\u201d. Prior to today\u2019s inspection the licensee did not communicate the upper\nrespiratory issue with his Attending Veterinarian. In communicating with the Attending Veterinarian he confirmed\nthat the licensee should seek veterinary guidance to develop a treatment plan for this animal and that could take\nplace on 01/08/2020. If repertory issues remain untreated, they can become increasingly uncomfortable or painful to\nthe animal. The Licensee must have methods in place to prevent, control and diagnose all health issues.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee."
