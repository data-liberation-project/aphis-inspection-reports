      "narrative": "On the night of 12/6/21, the low temperature in Como, Mississippi was 30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n**Overnight, two male giraffes were shut in a heated giraffe shelter with the heater operating. The shelter is approximately\n24 feet long and 36 feet wide, with a dirt floor with heavy bedding, and one large door. According to facility staff, the\ngiraffe shelter usually has 2 wall-mounted propane heaters but one was out for repairs, so there was only 1 heater which\nwas the only source of heat for the shelter. Facility staff did not have a method of monitoring the temperature overnight.\nFacility staff had let the giraffes out of their shelter prior to 10AM. At 10AM the ambient temperature outside the giraffe\nshed was 42 degrees Fahrenheit, and the two male giraffes were walking around on the pasture in the safari park. The\ntwo giraffes and numerous other safari park animals had access to the heated shelter, and according to facility staff the\nshelter\u2019s doors were left open all day. Inside the heated shelter, with the doors open and the single heater running, the\nambient temperature was 53 degrees Fahrenheit measured inside the barn, 5 feet off the ground, approximately 12 feet\nfrom the front of the heater which was on (this is the location where the facility employee usually measures the\ntemperature using an IR gun pointed at the floor). The giraffes did not use the heated shelter while inspectors were\npresent but a camel did enter the structure. Facility staff stated that while other animals including buffalo use the heated\nshelter throughout the day, it does not appear to prevent the giraffes from using the shelter and multiple species have\nbeen observed in the shelter together.\n**Overnight, one adult female giraffe and one 7-month-old female giraffe calf were housed in a 60 foot by 80 foot heated\ngiraffe barn with 1 parrot and 3 caracal cats. The giraffe barn contains 3 stalls, each with their own narrow roll-up door to\nthe outside. The giraffes were located in the middle stall. The roll up giraffe doors are located on the north side of the\nbarn, and within the barn the giraffe stalls take up the north half of the barn. The heaters are mounted on the south wall of\nthe barn. Facility staff reported that the calf had been nervous to enter the barn in the past but had begun entering the\nbarn more often recently; staff also reported that the calf appeared to be nervous when the barn doors were shut with her\ninside, so the roll-up door to the central stall was left about 2/3 raised (open) all night. An enclosure housing 3 caracal\ncats is located approximately 6 feet in front of the central giraffe stall with no visual barriers between the giraffes and the\ncats.\nThe female giraffes had access to the outdoors and to central stall overnight and throughout the day. The other doors to\nthe barn were kept closed and the wall-mounted propane heaters were left running all night (the only heat source in the\nbarn). Facility staff did not have any means of measuring the temperature in the barn overnight, and they had not yet\ntaken the temperature in the barn that morning. At 10AM the ambient temperature outside the giraffe barn was 42\ndegrees Fahrenheit. The female giraffes were observed to be inside the center stall in the giraffe barn with their heads\nintermittently poking out of the roll-up door to look outside. The calf stood next to the open roll-up door for the duration of\nthe inspection (approximately 15 minutes, observed first from a distance and then from within the barn). The temperature\nwithin the barn, measured at a height of approximately 5 feet, at the center of the barn immediately in front of the stall\nhousing the giraffes, was 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature was likely cooler next to the open roll-up door where\nthe calf was standing due to the draft from the door, but it could not be measured without stressing the animal.\nGiraffes are very sensitive to cold temperatures. Giraffes who do not have adequate shelter from cold weather may suffer\nfrom discomfort, frostbite, hypothermia, and decreased ability to fight off infections. Giraffes who are young, sick, or\nstressed are especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of cold weather. Young giraffes are especially susceptible to\ncold stress due to their small size and large surface area.\nCorrect by providing adequate shelter from cold weather for all giraffes at the facility. Correct by December 8th, 2021 at\n8PM.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.\nThis inspection report documents the direct noncompliant item identified on the inspection beginning 12/6/21. A second\ninspection report containing non-direct noncompliant items will be issued.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nNIANET CARRASQUILLO, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
