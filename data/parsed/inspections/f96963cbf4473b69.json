This guinea pig had a right eye that was being held partially\nclosed and had brown crusty debris on the upper and lower lid accumulating in the corner of the eye closest to the\nnose.\n2. One white and brown male guinea pig was present in pen #30. This guinea pig had an open wound under the\nchin on the left side of the chest. The hair around the wound was matted down with a pink - bloody discharge, and\nthe wound appeared to be fresh.\n3. One brown and white baby pup guinea pig was present in pen #37. The pup stayed huddled in one spot and did\nnot move, even after the rest of the guinea pigs being housed in the enclosure ran around and past it during the\nobservation. The pup had a dehydrated/sunken appearance and was in thin condition.\n4. One black and brown male guinea pig was in pen #38. There was a quarter sized wound on its left side. There\nwas a copious amount of grey brown pus like discharge present in the center of the wound, and the hair around it\nwas dried and crusty.\n5. One brown female was housed in pen #33. This guinea pig had a left eye that was being held partially closed and\nhad brown crusty debris on the hair surrounding the entire eye. In addition, the guinea pig was exhibiting\nrespiratory distress and was making abnormal breathing sounds.\n6. One black female guinea pig with a white and brown face was housed in pen #13. This guinea pig had a left eye\nthat was being held partially closed and had brown crusty debris on the hair surrounding the entire eye.\n7. One brown female guinea pig was housed in pen #23. This guinea pig had a right eye that was being held\npartially closed and had brown crusty debris on the hair surrounding the entire eye.\nThe clinical signs of wounds, eye abnormalities, respiratory issues and general lethargy / depression are all\nindicators of ill-health or disease. These conditions can result from multiple causes including traumatic injury and\ninfectious diseases, or other causes. Depending on the underlying cause, left untreated these conditions may\nprogress leading to additional unnecessary animal suffering. All licensees are required to implement appropriate\nmethods for adequate veterinary care including the use of methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease\nfor all animals. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these animals is necessary to ensure humane care.\nCorrect by having these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and the development of an\nappropriate treatment plan for animal each condition. Documentation of this examination, the treatment plan,\nimplementation of the treatments, and recommendations for prevention / control of disease spread to the remaining\nanimals shall be maintained by the licensee for examination by APHIS Officials upon request.\nTo be completed by: 26 January 2017\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the licensee."
