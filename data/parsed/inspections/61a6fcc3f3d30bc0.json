The outside runs of the primary\nenclosure has fencing that is approximately 34 3/4 inches tall and have open tops. The dog that escaped was not\nrecovered by the facility. Primary enclosures that do not safely contain the animals can lead to animal escape that can\nexpose the animals to injury or death. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed so that they\ncontain the animals securely.
