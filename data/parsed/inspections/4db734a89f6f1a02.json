This is a\npotential source of injury any time the rhino attempts to drink from this bucket. The facility must secure or remove\nthis wire.\n- The inside portion of the kangaroo enclosure has a plywood wall panel that is approximately 1/4 inch thick and 8\nfeet long that is pulled back a foot to 18 inches from the studs exposing insulation and sharp points. The opposite\nwall on the inside portion of the kangaroo enclosure has a metal panel that is secured at the top but not on the sides\nor bottom. This metal panel has sharp points and is curling away from the wall on the horizontal portions. These\nareas allow possible injury or entrapment of the enclosed animals. The facility must secure and repair these areas\nto prevent injury to the enclosed animal.\n- The outside area of the kangaroo enclosure has an unsecured metal panel with sharp points leaning on the\nmedical building. This poses a risk of limb injury or entrapment of the enclosed animal. The facility removed this\nmetal panel during the inspection.\n- In the first section of the drive through park there is a pile of tin roofing material on the ground. This tin has sharp\npoints and edges which is a potential injury to the enclosed animals. The facility must remove or secure this tin\nroofing material to protect the enclosed animals.\n- In the Serengeti area of the park there is a wall in the back shelter that is leaning and has many sharp points. The\nwall could fall and injure the enclosed animals. The facility must secure the wall and remove the sharp points to\nprotect the enclosed animals.\n- Just inside the front cattle guard, there is a section of empty enclosures with an approximate two foot wide fenced\nalley way around these enclosures. This alley way use to be the public barrier when animals were in these\nenclosures. These enclosures have metal angle brackets and metal posts leaning in this alley way making it\ndangerous for the enclosed animals to navigate through this alley way. The alley way is open on each end and\nanimals in the front section of the park have free access to this alley way. This a potential source of injury. The\nalley way must be removed or closed off and maintained in good condition to protect the enclosed animals in the\nfront section of the park."
