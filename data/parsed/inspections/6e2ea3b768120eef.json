The eye is not distinguishable and a large amount of serous &\nmucoid discharges are draining from it. Ocular injuries frequently cause pain and this animal should have been\nseen by the veterinarian for re-evaluation and treatment. This animal still needs to be seen by the veterinarian.\nA wolf/dog hybrid was obtained this past summer and over the next several months, the licensee reported observing\nit have at least three seizures. The veterinarian was not consulted about this animal, no examination was\nconducted and on 1-2-14, it was found dying and was euthanized.\nThis past October, a Patagonian cavy was found non-responsive in the exhibit. According to the records, the\nanimal was taken to the primate barn and given fluids, dewormer, and antibiotics by a caretaker without consultation\nwith the veterinarian. The next day it was dead. Due to the seriousness of this condition, this animal should have\nbeen taken to the veterinarian when first found.\nThe chimps were diagnosed in January 2013 with whipworms and were dewormed for 5 days with Panacur. In\nSeptember 2013 they were diagnosed with whipworms again and received the same course of treatment. This\ntreatment was performed without consultation with the attending veterinarian. These primates need to be\ndewormed again after the initial course of deworming. Licensee needs to consult with the veterinarian on the proper\ndeworming schedules for this parasite to prevent reinfections.\nAlthough there is a written Program of Veterinary Care, most of it is not being followed. The large cats were last\nvaccinated over a year ago. The non-human primates have never been vaccinated. Annual physical exams are\nnot being done on the non-human primates and the dental care is not being provided as recommended by the\nveterinarian.\nAt least two of the ibex are in need of foot trims, including one female with a slight limp on her right foreleg.

This fencing needs to be more substantial and secure.   There are also one foot gaps over the\nequipment entrance gates into two of the big cat enclosures.  These gaps need to be closed.  Some crape myrtle\ntrees are growing too close and through the enclosure fence for the two leopards, providing potential climbing\nescape.  These trees need to be pruned back to a safe height.  Chain link wire is loose and protruding into the gap\nbeing used for feeding one of the tigers in a back up area.  \nThe shift chute for the bear den on the far left of the waterfall bears has chainlink which no longer secure along the\n\nbottom of one side where a cable broke, and a vertical tension bar has been pulled out and bent into the chute area.\nAll of the above items need to be repaired or replaced to prevent potential injury and to contain the animals. \nStructures requiring repairs need to be reported to the appropriate person on a timely basis.  Above items to be\ncorrected by  3-21-14.\n3.127(c)\nFACILITIES, OUTDOOR. \nThere is a large puddle and muddy wet area in front of the gate leading to the shelter for the two elands.  This area\nneeds to drain more quickly so that the animals do not have to walk though it to gain access to their shelter.    To be\ncorrected by  2-21-14.\n3.127(d)\nFACILITIES, OUTDOOR. \nPerimeter Fence:  The 8 foot chain link perimeter fence is pushed over halfway down by tree deadfall along a ten\nfoot piece in the brushy area behind the large cat dens.  This area along the fence line needs to be cleared so that\nregular checks and maintenance of the fence can be done.  In the safari area, there are several double gates in the\nfence which are not 8 feet tall.  One of these gates located near the rhinoceros enclosure measures between 6 foot\n3 inches to 6 foot 8 inches.   This gate was also found open during this inspection, as were the entrance gates for\nthe safari buses which are not running at this time.  Because the park is closed at this time of year, all gates which\nmake up part of the perimeter fence need to remain closed to contain any animals and prevent unwanted animals\n&/or people from entering the park.   To be corrected by 2-28-14\n3.129(a)\nFEEDING.    \nThe walk in freezer is in disarray with boxes stacked and tossed throughout.  There is a gap at the base of the\nfreezer at the back and condensation is forming large ice mounds on some of the boxes of food and on the fan\nblowers.  Dead animals are in the freezer, some for taxidermy, some to be used as food, and at least two parrots\ndead of unknown causes.   Dead animals should be stored separately from all packaged food if the cause of death\nis not known.  The freezer needs to be organized and cleaned.   The band saw outside of the freezer is dirty and\nneeds to be cleaned on a regular basis.   \nAlthough most dry food has been moved out of it, the old elephant barn still has stored boxed crackers which were\nused during the lights display.  At least three feral cats were seen and a pile of cat feces was in one area, near\nsome torn open bags of oyster crackers.  This method of storage does not [protect the food from contamination. \nMineral blocks are provided in several areas, but these are placed on the ground.  To prevent contamination, these\nshould be placed in some type of container.     All above items to be corrected by 2-28-14.\n\n3.129(a)\nFEEDING.    \nThe large felids supplement is not being given according to the approved feeding plan.  Calculations demonstrated,\nand an employee stated that he was not giving the prescribed veterinary recommended daily amount to each cat. \nThe container was dirty, moldy and the powder was hard and not granular.  The vitamin-mineral supplementation\nshall be given as per the veterinarian approved feeding plan for the health and well-being of the felids.  To be\ncorrected by 2-14-14.\n3.131(a)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \nCleaning of enclosures. There is an excess accumulation of old (ash colored) and fresh feces in the two cougar\nenclosures, each with one cougar.    One of the cougars has raked 6 piles of covered feces.  The barn for the three\nyaks has an excessive number of fecal piles. The enclosure with one tiger and one lion also has an empty concrete\npool with large amounts of ash colored feces in it.  Additionally, there are fecal piles and food wastes in this\nenclosure.  There were at least 30 fecal droppings in the enclosure with two leopards.  There were many rotting\ncarcass pieces in the lion Kobis enclosure along with a pile of feces.  One tiger was locked in a backup pen for the\n\"family tiger\" enclosure and the concrete floor also has old white chalky feces and urine soaked straw.  One stall in\nthe testing barn has a dirt floor covered with a layer of goat feces.   Feces needs to be picked up on a regular basis\nto prevent excess accumulations, provide a clean surface to walk and lie down on, and to reduce disease hazards,\npests, and odors.\n3.131(c)\nSANITATION.   \nHousekeeping:  Facility grounds are littered with trash, plastic bags, old bones, plastic gloves, other equipment and\ndebris.  A rotting meat odor was detected in the area behind the big cats' back up dens, and a rotted calf (initially\nfed to the cats) was found tossed in the woods behind this area.   \nAccumulations of these types of materials, old food, plastics and other debris can harbor vermin which are known to\nbe at this facility. Materials can also blow into an enclosure and potentailly cause an animal to ingest harmful\nmaterials.  All areas need ot be to be kept clean to facilitate the husbandry practices, reduce odors, and cleared as\nnecessary to protect the health of the animals.\nTo be corrected by 2-28-14.\n3.132\nEMPLOYEES.\n\nThere are not a sufficient number of adequately trained employees at this facility to maintain the professionally\nacceptable level of husbandry practices required by the standards.   This is evidenced by citations on this report and\nchronic non-compliances in the areas of cleaning and veterinary care. There also does not appear to be adequate\ntraining and supervision of the employees as evidenced by the low level of husbandry and housekeeping. There are\n4 full time animal care employees, and 3 part time animal care employees at this facility.  The facility has 17\nnon-human primates, including 3 chimps, 11 bears, 12 large cats, 20 camelids, 2 zebra, 32 bovine, at least 178\ndeer, 56 goats, 61 ibex and tahrs, 15 sheep, 2 eland, 7 addax, 1 rhinoceros, and a collection of exotic birds for a\ntotal of over 414 animals.   There needs to be enough employees to provide for adequate & thorough cleaning of all\nenclosures, feeding, enrichment activities, and maintenance and repair structural items, as well as to provide other\nhusbandry and housekeeping practices. To be corrected by 3-28-14.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBrandes Robert, Veterinary Medical Officer",
