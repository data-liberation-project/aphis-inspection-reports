The inspector\nwitnessed a small goat stuck between the chicken wire and outer wire mesh, it's head was caught in one of the\nopenings and had to have assistance extricating it's head. There was no outward indication that it was injured. It\nappears to have entered between the 2 fences because the chicken wire mesh was rusted and broken with a large\nhole where it was bent and pulled away from the supports. The mesh fencing also has sharp ends of wires exposed.\nThe fencing is not structurally sound and may not be secure enough to contain the animals housed there. There\nare several broken or loose boards on the outer pasture fence containing the cow, goat and llama. The materials\nused for the enclosures must be of the appropriate material and strong enough for the types of animals housed\nthere. The damaged fence poses a hazard to the health, safety and well-being of the animals and must be replaced\nand or repaired.\nCorrect by March 19, 2015.\nThis inspection and exit interview was conducted with the Business Manager."
