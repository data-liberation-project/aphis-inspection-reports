The upper right lip directly under the nose had a 1-inch long wound. Around the edge of the injury was\npink moist skin and the center having a dry flaky appearance with varying color shades of red to brown. The\nlicensee said the animal had cut the lip fighting thru the chain link fence with another dog. At the time of inspection,\na fight was observed between the male Akita and another dog thru the chain link fence. The licensee said he will\nseparate the dogs so they do not share a fence line. The licensee did not apply any medications listed in the\nProgram of Veterinary Care because he thought any ointment applied to that area would be lick off immediately. No\nveterinarian was notified of the injury. Wounds that are not appropriately treated not only decrease animal welfare\nbut also can lead to secondary infections and further illnesses. It is vital and required that all injuries be treated\naccording to the Program of Veterinary Care or is evaluated by a veterinarian.\nCorrected at time of inspection"

The enclosure had a solid plastic flooring in the back\nhalf and a coated wire floor with 1 inch by 1 inch spacing in the front half of the enclosure. Since there was no\nbarrier between the solid floor and wire floor, the puppy could easily go onto the wire floor. During inspection the\npuppy was observed having its back left leg resting through the wire-floor spacing. The wire flooring is a danger to\nthe puppy and could cause the puppy to get stuck or injured. All flooring needs to be constructed in a manner that\ndoes not allow any dogs(cid:25) feet to pass through any openings in the floor.\nCorrected at time of inspection.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
