      "narrative": "The Raccoon Building has a high ambient temperature and humidity. The building is constructed of metal and is\nonly partially insulated. There are eighteen fans running throughout the building and there are windows that are\nopen along the sides. The temperature as taken by the Kestrel at the beginning of the inspection upon first entering\nthe building is 93.5 degrees F with a heat index 100.7 degrees F. Multiple readings of the temperature and heat\nindex were taken during the inspection in different areas of the building. The temperatures taken were 93.7\ndegrees, 94.1 degrees F, 94.2 degrees F, 94.1 degrees F, 95.7 degrees F, 95.2 degrees F, 95.4 degrees F, 95.0\ndegrees F, 95.2 degrees F. The heat indices in the building are 101.1 degrees F, 101.7 degrees F, 104.9 degrees\nF, 106.0 degrees F, 105.1 degrees F, 106.3 degrees F, 108.0 degrees F, 107.4 degrees F, 107.6 degrees F, 106.8\ndegrees F, 103.6 degrees F, 104.5 degrees F. Nine raccoons are in serious heat distress (too hot) and are\nsuffering from the temperatures inside the building.\nThe behaviors observed in these nine raccoons include panting, open mouthed breathng, and increased respiratory\nrate (fast breathing). The raccoons are lying on their sides, backs, and abdomens with their legs splayed out\ndemonstrating they are uncomfortable with the temperature and are trying to cool off. These nine raccoons are also\nreluctant to move, lethargic, and not alert to activity in the building around them. These signs are indicative of the\nelevated temperature inside the building not allowing the animals to regulate their core body temperature properly.\nThe inability of these nine raccoons to cool off has caused them to suffer. There are approximately 290 raccoons\nhoused in this building. The high temperature and humidity is having a negative impact on the health and well-being\nof the animals.\nWhen climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health and well-being, appropriate measures must be\ntaken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of\ntemperature, humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must reduce the\ntemperature and humidity inside this building to a level that is comfortable for the raccoons in order to support their\nhealth and well-being.\nThis inspection and exit interview was conducted with VMO Scott Welch, SACS Heather Cole, ACI Kelly Maxwell, a\nsafety officer, an IES investigator, the attending veterinarian, local law enforcement, an Iowa Trooper and the facility\nrepresentative.\nThis is a focused inspection concerning the non-compliant item listed on the previous inspection report dated July\n21, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist\nWelch Scott, Veterinary Medical Officer"
