There were no public barriers in place during the exhibition and when the injury occurred.\nFailure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers during public exhibition can be a safety hazard for the animal\nand/or the public. During public exhibition, the animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the\nanimal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the public so as to assure\nthe safety of animals and the public.\nTo be corrected this day forward.\nExit briefing conducted with licensee."
