The process also encourages the tigers to stick\ntheir heads out of the feeding ports/holes.

If there are other tigers\nin the enclosure and one has it's head or leg in the hole, one or more of the other big cats may jump or push and\ncause injuries. The enclosures must be constructed and maintained to prevent injury to the tigers, therefore the\nfeeding holes must be altered to eliminate the animals from being able to put any part of their bodies through them.\nCorrect by 12 July 2015.\nExit interview conducted with Executive Director."
