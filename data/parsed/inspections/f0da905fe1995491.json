      "narrative": "There are two boxer females that were in a fight on 10/4/16 that sustained multiple lacerations and punctures over\nboth front legs, head and chest area. 'Stewert 1' (F) boxer has a 2-3 inch open laceration on her left front forelimb\nrunning parallel to the ground. This wound is open 1/4 to 1/2 inch the length of the laceration, with muscle tissue\nshowing and a red oozing liquid in the wound. There were multiple small flies in the wound. There is an open\ncircular wound, exposing the muscle/flesh beneath the surface approximately 1 inch in diameter on the left front\nchest area. There are 2 horizontal lacerations approximately 1-2 inches long on the right forelimb, exposing the\nmuscle tissue beneath the separated skin (approximately 1/8-1/4 inch wide).\nThe other female boxer in the fight was \"Dance Little Jean\" who has a very swollen left ear that appears to be full of\nfluid, and is painful to the touch. This female was tilting her head and carefully trying to shake her head, however\nwould stop and squint as it appeared painful. There is a 2-3 inch laceration running horizontal on her left forelimb,\nexposing the muscle beneath in a 1/4 inch open incision. There are multiple puncture wounds on her right front leg\nand top of her head between the eyes. Her right leg appears swollen and sore, and her right front chest area\nappears swollen above the leg. She also had a broken upper right front canine tooth, broken down the length of the\ntooth to the gumline.\nBoth dogs appear to be swollen and sore from their injuries. The licensee did separate the dogs and houses them in\ndifferent enclosures. While the licensee did try to provide a herbal topical treatment for the wounds, the severity of\nthe wounds requires a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the multiple injuries and wounds which\nmay require medication for pain and infection as well as possible sutures, which should all be determined by the\nattending veterinarian. Until the inspection the veterinarian had not been contacted or advised of the injuries.\nThere is a white boxer \"Lucky Charm' that has some swelling on her face with irritated skin that is red and hairless\non her face, ears, neck, chest and other sporadic areas on her body. The issue has been a problem since 8/30/16,\nwith inconsistent treatments provided, with no documentation provided of all treatments and medicines given. There\nhas not been any contact with the veterinarian or vet visit for this animal, and the home treatments are not working.\nThere are 9 boxer puppies under 8 weeks of age that are very thin in appearance, with their ribs showing. 8 of the 9\npups were showing signs of runny noses and sniffling during the inspection. There were 2 pups that had liquid\nyellow diarrhea during the inspection. While the licensee was trying to treat the animals for the past few\nweeks/days, there has been no contact with the veterinarian for proper diagnosis or treatment. There is no record of\nhow these pups have been treated during their illness or with what medicine/dosages.\nIt is imperative that all injuries and illnesses are properly diagnosed and treated as soon as they are observed, in\norder to prevent a treatable condition from becoming chronic or fatal and to decrease the discomfort for the\nregulated animal. A veterinarian must be consulted in a timely manner to determine what medical treatment should\nbe given and to consult the Program of Veterinary Care(PVC) for additional information.\nThe attending veterinarian must be contacted immediately for proper diagnosis and care of the regulated animals.\nThe PVC should be followed and the veterinarian should be contacted for any issues not resolving with any\ntreatments provided in a timely manner. All treatments and health issues should be kept on record for proper care\nand management of the animals.\nThe licensee did make an appointment with the attending veterinarian for the next morning during the inspection.\nCorrect by: Oct 6, 2016\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee."
