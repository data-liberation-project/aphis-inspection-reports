Zoo\nstaff responded and found panda in small tree. A perimeter barrier was constructed around the tree and panda was\nlured to ground with food where she was netted and kenneled. She was returned safe and sound to zoo quarantine\narea after being gone for approximately two days. During the interim an in depth inspection of the enclosure did not\nreveal an apparent path of escape. On closer inspection, myself and zoo staff found a Plexiglas wall at the viewing\narea that was just over 4'(cid:25) tall and could have been the escape route for a determined panda. Although published\ndata indicate a slick surface of 4(cid:25)' is sufficient to contain red pandas this wall should be extended to at least 5'(cid:25) to\nensure containment. There should be regular inspection of all enclosures to make sure they are properly\nconstructed to contain the species they house.\nCorrect by: 10/December/2015\nNote:\nThe female red panda that escaped on 19th November had been exhibiting dispersing behavior. Zoo staff had\ncontacted the appropriate SSP with this information and had received a mandatory recommendation to transfer her\nto new surroundings at the Knoxville Zoo.
