If properly motivated the bears could use the trees to\nescape their enclosures. Those trees are still waiting to be trimmed because the only person capable of trimming\nthem has been on extended leave/light duty. The bear enclosures have not been adequately maintained to safely\ncontain the bears.\nThe trees identified by pink ribbons and any other trees that may be close to fences within animal enclosures need\nto be trimmed to prevent possible escapes.\nTo be corrected by June 2, 2017."

The current animal care staff consists of 2 full time animal keepers, 1 keeper that would like\nto be part time but has been working full time in order to make sure all the animals are cared for, 1 full time\nemployee who assists with animal care on a part time basis, and one facility maintenance person.\nAccording to these employees they are working 10 to 12 hour days in order to get all of the animals cared for. On\ndays when one of the animal care employees is off, the remaining 2 \u00bd employees are doubly rushed to ensure all\nthe animals are cared for. Exhaustion and overwork can cause mistakes. Mistakes in this situation can mean\nleaving a gate unlocked or open, not observing the animals for subtle signs of illness, not maintaining the integrity of\nthe enclosures properly, not properly cleaning enclosures.\nRecently the maintenance person sustained an injury that required extended time off and light duty. Because there\nis no one else capable of doing this work many important repairs were not done. For example, during the last\ninspection of this facility it was noted that several trees next to fences inside bear enclosures had been identified to\nbe trimmed back. If the bears were motivated they could escape their enclosures by climbing these trees. At the\ntime of this inspection those trees had not been trimmed.\nA sufficient number of adequately trained employees need to be hired to maintain a professionally acceptable level\nof husbandry and to allow all employees adequate time off.\nTo be corrected by July 1, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility employees."
