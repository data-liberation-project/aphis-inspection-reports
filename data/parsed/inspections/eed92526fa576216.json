      "narrative": "A female reindeer, right ear tag #10, had excessively overgrown hooves on all four feet and was seen favoring her\nleft front leg when she moved. Excessive growth of hooves changes the angle of the toes, changes the gait, and\ncan lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs such as arthritis.\n**A plan needs to be developed and documented, with the input of the attending veterinarian (AV), to address the\nneed for hoof trimming for any animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the development of chronic\nfoot and leg problems. This plan needs to be available for review by APHIS officials.\nA male reindeer calf was noted to be limping on his left hind limb. This animal had been diagnosed by the attending\nveterinarian (AV) in approximately early July as having a fracture that had begun to heal on its own. This APHIS\nVMO had talked by phone with the AV on 7/14/2014 and had been told of this animal's injury and what had been\ndone to diagnose and treat the condition. When asked if there was a plan to recheck the reindeer's leg to assess\nhealing, the AV stated there was not a plan to see the animal again. This APHIS VMO expressed concern that the\nanimal's progress should be assessed by the AV and not to just rely on the licensee's phone reports. The AV had\nstated that she expected to schedule the herd health exam soon and agreed that it would be ideal for her to\nreassess his condition sooner rather than later. At the time of this inspection, the AV had not seen this reindeer calf\nand the herd health exam is not scheduled until 9/9/2014.\n**This animal is still limping and needs to be re-examined by a veterinarian by 8/31/2014 to determine if the animal\nis painful, if the leg is healing, and if further diagnostics and/or treatment is necessary.\nA plan needs to be documented, approved by the attending veterinarian (AV), and be available for review by APHIS\nofficials for the monitoring of this reindeer by the licensee for pain and to recognize changes in his condition. This\nplan should include criteria for when pain relief or other methods for reducing pain and distress need to be provided\nto ensure a good quality of life and to prevent worsening of the underlying condition. The licensee should document\nthat he is monitoring this animal and when pain relief or other methods are provided to reduce pain and discomfort\nso the veterinarian and APHIS officials can evaluate if the plan is effective."

This unsecured material\nposes a risk of injury to the animals if they become entangled or ingest the loose material.\nThe wire and cattle panel fencing separating the reindeer cows and calves from the male reindeer had several\nbroken wires or support posts that had sharp ends protruding into the enclosures, posing a risk of injury to the\nanimals.

      "narrative": "The outdoor enclosure housing 1 llama, 3 sheep, 2 goats had an excessive accumulation of excreta from an\nadjacent pen housing mules and burros along the north fence line. This accumulation extended at least 6 feet along\nthe fence and was as high as 18 inches and could fall into the water receptacle inside the sheep/goat/llama\nenclosure. Inside this enclosure, there was an excessive accumulation of excreta with several large piles in the\nmiddle of the enclosure and very little ground that was free of the waste material. This poses a risk of contamination\nof the feed, water source, and the animals' hair/wool.\nThe excessive accumulation of excreta throughout the facility but especially around and in this enclosure is\ncontributing to the numerous flies seen throughout the facility. The flies and the potential for contamination of the\nfeed, water source, and the animals' hair/wool with excreta puts them at risk of disease.\nCleaning of enclosures. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent\ncontamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors."
