      "narrative": "An adult male blonde colored Maltese approximately two years old and identified by microchip number\n(0A01657878) is shaking its head and pawing at its left ear. The dog's fur appears wet and discolored around the\nleft side of its head. The inspector requested the licensee pull the dog from the enclosure for a closer look. The\ninspector then observed an abnormal growth on the outside of both ear canals. The dog was flinching while the\nlicensee was handling the affected areas. Both growths are flesh colored and appear reddened where the dog has\nbeen scratching them. The growth on the left ear canal is approximately the size of a ping pong ball. The one on the\nright ear canal appears slightly smaller in comparison. The surfaces of the outer and middle portion of both ears,\nincluding the growths, have an excessive accumulation of dark brown and black waxy material.\nThe licensee stated the dog was purchased about two years ago. The licensee called the growths a \"birth defect\"\nand stated they were first noticed about a year ago while grooming the animal. The dog was last seen by the\nattending veterinarian September 4, 2015. According to the document, the veterinarian did not recommend surgery\nat that time due to the procedure becoming \"problematic\". The document describes the condition as \"cauliflower\nears\" and does not include a treatment plan. The licensee stated the attending veterinarian told her to keep the ears\nclean. The licensee stated she had cleaned the dog's ears approximately 10 days ago. A veterinarian has not been\nconsulted about the dog frequently shaking its head and scratching its ears.\nContinued scratching by the dog can be painful. Dirty ears can cause irritation and discomfort for the dog. The\npotential for further health problems exist if the tissue becomes contaminated with excreta causing the affected area\nto become irritated or infected. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate\ndiagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to\nthe inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
