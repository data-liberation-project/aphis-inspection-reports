The\nbuildup of debris/calculus material obscured normal teeth contours. Areas of gum recession and thickening were\nevident in areas of calculus buildup.\nA white and brown intact male Shih Tzu identified as \u201cRomey\u201d ( Microchip # 077 102-111, DOB 10-9-2011) was\nobserved to have a buildup of brown and tan debris/calculus over the upper canine teeth and lower and upper\ncheek teeth. Reddening and recession of gum tissue were evident in areas of debris/calculus buildup over the upper\ncanine teeth.\nAccumulation of large amounts of tartar or calculus on teeth may result in the development of gum disease,\ninfection and tooth loss. In turn, this may also further impact the well-being of an animal by causing chewing\ndiscomfort, inappetence and weight loss.\nThe two dogs described above need to be evaluated by a veterinarian within fourteen days and appropriate plans of\ntreatment established to address the observed dental issues. Written documentation of veterinary evaluation and\ntreatment also need to be available for review upon inspector request.\nCorrect by 07-27-2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
