The\nrecorded expiration date on one 100 ml bottle of Oxytocin was 11/30/15. The recorded expiration date on one 250\nml bottle of Ivermax was 07/2015. These medications are intermingled with other products that are currently being\nused at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or\nsutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute\nadequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are\nadministrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The expected results cannot\nbe guaranteed and the animals may experience pain, distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms or\nunexpected side effects. Failure to properly label medications or other medical products as being expired and\nstoring them with unexpired medical materials could lead to the unintentional use on regulated animals. The\nlicensee must either dispose of all such expired medical drugs and materials or segregate them in an appropriately\nlabeled, physically separate location from non-expired medical drugs and materials. Correct by 6/1/17."
