This courtyard has a\nsolid concrete wall approximately 8 feet high on all sides limiting air circulation at the ground level. A slatted wood\nawning slopes from the roof of the main building to the wall.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the climate and the species needs\nto be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to the animals. A\nmore permanent solution for providing this pig with an enclosure that allows him to stay dry, warm, and out of the\nmud needs to be implemented. One alternative to considered is to cover the slatted awning with a solid material so\nthat the rain does not runoff into the pig enclosure but to the outside of the courtyard allowing the pig enclosure to\nremain dry. The slatted sides between the wall and the awning could be left open for air circulation and a small\nhouse could be provided for additional warmth if needed.\nTo be completed by Aug. 8, 2015\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee."
