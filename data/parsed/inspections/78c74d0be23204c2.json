The wound appears deep and is a dark pink/red color. No\nbleeding was observed from the site at the time of the inspection. Molly appeared alert and active. She is housed\nwith a male capuchin. The tail lesion on Molly was difficult to observe because she would rap her tail around her\nbody so the underside was not visible. The wound may reach the depth of the bone and could become infected.\nMolly has not been seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for her current condition. Once the APHIS official\nidentified the condition of Molly, the animal caretaker made an appointment for today to bring her to the attending\nveterinarian for the small animals. Correct by having Molly seen by the attending veterinarian and following the\nrecommendations of the veterinarian. Correct by January 29, 2016.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the animal caretaker."
