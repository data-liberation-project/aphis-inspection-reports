      "narrative": "The facility continues to have construction and maintenance issues regarding enclosure design, stability and protecting\nthe animals from injury.\n*** The enclosures are comprised of stainless steel or chain-link walls with a \u201ctender-foot\u201d-like flooring that is suspended\nabove a waste gutter using long metal rods to provide support. Due to construction variability, the flooring frequently\nleaves gaps up to two inches along the front and/or sides of the enclosure. These gaps are large enough for a foot or leg\nto pass through the openings. Throughout the inspection, at least 130 enclosures had these gaps present and dogs were\nseen with toes in the gaps.\n*** Several enclosures in Buildings G1 and G2 also have flooring that is not properly supported from underneath. These\nfloors consistently bounce, vibrate, or tilt as the dogs move across the floors.\n*** Gaps were also noticed in the fencing where the chain link had become detached from the frame in Building G1 Room\n4. One gap in the fencing was only a few inches (enough to trap a foot or leg) and located in the corner by the waterer.\nAnother gap was the length of the enclosure sidewall. Two adjacent pens share a common chain-link side wall that is\nunattached at the base of the enclosure. The metal at the bottom of the wall had rusted to the point of breaking off,\nleaving a sharp point at floor level. The entire section of chain link forming the barrier between enclosures is no longer\nattached to the metal frame. This allowed the chain-link to swing easily when dogs were jumping on or pushing against\nthe chain-link. The fencing was so loose that a dog would be able to simply push their way under it to enter the adjacent\nenclosure.\n*** Multiple enclosures in Buildings G1 and G2 have sharp points at the levels of the dogs. These sharp points are\nprimarily caused by metal that has rusted to the point of disintegration and left behind sharp edges.\n*** A review of medical records for dogs treated for injuries between 11/18/21 and 3/8/22 revealed one dog injured by the\nenclosure. A female beagle, CMJCIN, was found on 1/11/22 with her left rear leg caught in the door. There was minor\nswelling associated with the injury and she was treated by the facility and recovered uneventfully. Additionally, another 8\ndogs were treated for tail injuries which varied from minor wounds to tail fractures and bone exposure. (CMECVW,\nCMDCGP, CLHCEW, CMHCAZ, CMHCDK, CMHCJB, CMECTW). The facility stated they are still reviewing these cases\nfor an underlying cause but are looking into possible injury by the new egress doors.\nHousing facilities that have not been kept in good repair, such as unsecured fencing or flooring, gaps around the floor, or\nsharp points may injure dogs by entrapping limbs or may fail to adequately contain the dogs.\nHousing facilities for dogs must be constructed and designed so they are structurally sound, kept in good repair and\nprotect the animals from injury. Correct by repairing or replacing damaged or broken facilities and ensure that all aspects\nof the enclosures are maintained in good repair and are safe for the dogs at all times."

This flooring has\nbeen identified on previous inspections to be dangerous because dogs have been found by inspectors with feet / toes\nstuck in the flooring. Additional instances were identified by the facility that occurred prior to inspection.\n*** On this inspection a total of 2 dogs were found actively stuck in the flooring to the point that the facility representatives\nhad to remove one of them from the flooring.\n- In Building G2, Room 8, after a skirmish broke out in an enclosure housing four male beagles, one of the beagles got his\nback left foot trapped in the flooring for approximately 11 seconds before he was able to pull free.\n- In Building G2, Room 5, a male beagle, CMDCCF was found by inspectors with both rear feet trapped in the flooring.\nThe dog was unable to extract itself and required assistance from the facility representative to free the foot from the floor.\n*** A review of the medical records indicates that at least 12 additional dogs have been entrapped in the floor during the\nperiod of 11/18/21 to 3/8/22. Their injuries ranged from mild soreness to pressure wounds that required treatment for over\ntwo weeks.\nOpenings in the floor that are large enough to allow the feet and legs to pass through can lead to entrapment of a dog\nwhich can be painful, distressful, and may result in serious injury to the animal.\nPrimary enclosures for dogs must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs\u2019 feet and legs from\ninjury.
