There was a fence immediately around the tiger transport enclosures, but it was\nonly 4 feet tall and was within arms reach of the enclosures.

An unauthorized person could have\neasily approached and made contact with the tigers at that time.\n* Perimeter fence gates left open and unattended do not adequately prevent unauthorized personnel from coming in\ncontact with the animals and do not adequately function as secondary containment systems. This could result in\nsomething harmful happening to the tigers or the public.\n*** The licensee must ensure the tigers' primary enclosures are contained within a secure perimeter fence which is\nat least 8 feet tall and 3 feet away from the enclosures OR provide appropriate alternative security measures.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: this non-compliant item was corrected prior to the end of the inspection.\nThe inspection was conducted on 22-23 July 2014 with a facility representative.
