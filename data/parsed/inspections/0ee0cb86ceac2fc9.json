      "narrative": "Between the evening of November 22,2016 and the morning of November 23, 2016 the temporary housing facility\nfor the bat colony flooded. After speaking with the curator it was determined that flooding was caused by the drain\ncover being clogged with excess fruit dropped by the bats as well as the keeper turning the flowing water up to a\nhigher than normal rate. The standing water forced the bats, who typically drink from flowing water, to land in\nstanding water on the floor. 36 Jamaican Fruit Bats were found dead the morning of November 23, 2016. Another\nestimated 6 bats were found to be hypothermic and were able to be rehabilitated and were all returned to the\ncolony. After review of necropsy records it was determined that the 36 Jamaican Fruit Bats died due to hypothermia\nafter exposure to the standing water. After discussion with the curator and veterinary staff, proper protocols are in\nplace to prevent re-occurrence. Curators informed the USDA inspector on the day of this event. Suitable methods\nshall be provided to eliminate rapidly, excess water from indoor housing facilities.\nThis was a focused inspection to follow up on the voluntary reported incident as well as previous NCI.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with animal management staff.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCampitelli D.V.M Kathryn, Veterinary Medical Officer"
