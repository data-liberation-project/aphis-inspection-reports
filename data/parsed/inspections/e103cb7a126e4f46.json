The facility reports that ongoing corrective action measures are in place, including addressing a larger\ngap (approximately 2.5 inches) at the base of the enclosure identified by the inspector during inspection.\nThe facility must ensure that bird enclosures are maintained in good repair, protect the birds from injury, contain the birds,\nand restrict other animals from entering that may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within.\nCorrect from this date forward of 25 August 2025."
