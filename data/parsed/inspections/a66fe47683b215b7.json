      "narrative": "The facility failed to recognize veterinary authority.\n\u2022 An adult male lion was observed with diffuse alopecia and bare skin that was dark, moist and itchy. At least 50% of the\nlion\u2019s mane was rubbed off and many of the remaining hairs were short, frayed and broken. An area above the shoulders\nhad no hair at all and the lion was seen rubbing against the chain-link fencing of his enclosure to scratch himself. After\nrubbing against the fencing, the lion walked unsteadily to the front left corner of his enclosure. His head was down, his\neyes were only partially open, and his ears were hanging loosely as he shallowly panted. The animal looked weak,\ndepressed, and uncomfortable. When asked about the lion\u2019s condition, the licensee said that she thought it was caused\nby biting insects known as no-see-ums. In a medical summary dated June 16, 2025, the attending veterinarian mentioned\nthe lion\u2019s skin condition and said that it improves with topical antibiotic/anti-inflammatory treatment. The licensee is\ntreating the lion with an over-the-counter horse and pet spray that does not have antibiotic or anti-inflammatory\ningredients.\n\u2022 The Parrot Enrichment Program Proposal provided by the attending veterinarian spells out a complete plan to provide\nfor the physical and mental well-being of the parrots housed at the facility. The plan lists numerous enrichment steps to be\ntaken by the licensee, including increased foraging opportunities, spreading the food out in different locations, and the use\nof foraging toys and puzzle feeders. The plan also details sensory enrichment and using bright toys, mirrors, live plants\nthat are all rotated regularly to maintain interest. The plan also discusses safety consideration and specifically mentions\ncare when using rope or hanging material to ensure the birds cannot become entangled. At the time of inspection, the\nparrot enclosures showed little evidence that this plan was being followed. The food bowls were not scattered in different\nlocations, there were no foraging toys or puzzle feeders observed, the toys seen were old, soiled, and often destroyed,\nropes were seen frayed, soiled and hanging in concerning lengths.\n\u2022 A letter dated November 1, 2021, provided to the licensee by the attending veterinarian lists action points he instructed\nher to do. One of these action points states, \u201cPlease see to the issues detailed by me and the USDA inspectors regarding\nfood prep and storage.\u201d The letter states that food items should not be stored directly on the floor of the freezer and to the\nextent possible, all bulk food items should be kept in leak proof containers with lids, and those lids should be kept on the\ncontainers when not being used. The attending veterinarian also suggested that the licensee date meat when frozen and\ninstitute a first in first out policy of using the oldest meat first. At the time of inspection there was one small black rubber\ntote, all other foodstuff was stored directly on the shelves or in cardboard boxes, many of which were torn, broken or\notherwise damaged. None of the meat was dated and there was no evidence of a first in first out procedure being used.\nFailure to ensure the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority over the veterinary care of the animals can lead to\nunnecessary stress, discomfort, and suffering of the animals.\nEach dealer and exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provisions of\nadequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
