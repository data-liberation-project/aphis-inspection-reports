      "narrative": "A buff colored female Cocker Spaniel,tag #141, was walking normally and was then observed momentarily scooting\nher ventral body with her hind legs dragging behind her, as if she were scratching her belly, on the gravel-type\nflooring of an outdoor enclosure. On closer observation of the dog no abnormalities were noted on the dog(cid:25)s\nabdomen, legs or body except the dog(cid:25)s right ear had an excessive amount of discharge. Most of the entire inner\near flap appeared reddened and moist with an abundant thick creamy white to yellow discharge present at the\nentrance to the ear canal and surrounding area. The fur in this area appeared moistened with the discharge; some\nof the fur appeared darker black and matted around the edges of the canal on the inner ear flap. When the licensee\nwas asked if he had noticed the dog(cid:25)s ear condition he replied, \"(cid:28)no\"(cid:29). This dog(cid:25)s ear condition could indicate an\ninfection, allergy or other veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort.\nA white and golden male Lhasa Apso, microchip #0A02201909, was initially observed with a large lesion on the\nright side near its shoulder. On closer observation the lesion on the right side appeared to be a large healed scar.\nWhile the licensee was holding the dog, he was asked to move his hand so the left side of the dog(cid:25)s neck could be\nviewed. The dog had a wound located on the left side of his neck. An approximately 2 inch open linear\nlaceration-like lesion was noted on the neck. The wound was open with exposed red tissue underneath and a thick\ncreamy whitish discharge was present in and around the lesion. Fur was present up to the open wound and did not\nappear clipped. The surrounding fur immediately around the wound and extending down the neck was discolored\nblack and significantly matted. Some of the visible skin under the fur in this area appeared reddened. The licensee\nseemed surprised at first that a wound was present on the left side of the dog(cid:25)s neck. However, when the licensee\nwas asked if he was aware of the dog(cid:25)s condition he said that he had noticed the wound a few days ago and it was\nfrom a dog fight. He stated that he had started treating the dog with peroxide, penicillin and \"(cid:28)Mag-60\"(cid:29). The\ninspection started at approximately 11:00am and the licensee said that he had not given the dog treatment yet\ntoday. The licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian regarding treatment of this dog. There was no\ndocumentation from a veterinarian regarding treatment of this dog(cid:25)s condition. Wounds increase the risk of infection\nand pain.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate\ndiagnoses are obtained and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must document\nthis information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals\nreceive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nThe licensee is currently using a jar of medication (Mag-60 Paste) and a bottle of injectable medication (Agri-Cillin)\non a Lhasa Apso, microchip #0A02201909, with a wound on his neck. The jar of Mag-60 does have a label from a\nveterinarian but it is specifically labeled for use on Bovine. Neither of these medications are labeled for use in dogs\nnor does the licensee have instructions from a veterinarian on the proper use and dosages. Medication not labeled\nfor use in dogs could have an adverse effect and/or may be harmful to the animal if not used as intended. The\nlicensee must consult with a veterinarian and obtain written directions for the use of any medications being used\nother than the way the labels states."
