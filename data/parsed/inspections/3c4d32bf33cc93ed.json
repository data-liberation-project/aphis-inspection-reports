      "narrative": "On 11 February, 2019 one of three skunks was found dead in their shared enclosure. The body was submitted to\nthe attending veterinarian for necropsy. The necropsy report stated that the animal had a body condition score of\nfour out of nine and that \"Stomach and intestines empty, no ingesta or stool present.\" Histopathology findings were\nconsistent with a viral infection. An employee at the facility stated that the attending veterinarian had contacted them\nafter the necropsy and commented on the fact that animal caretakers had failed to notice that the skunk wasn't\neating. Both the curator and the skunk caretaker on duty at the time of the inspection stated that there was no\nprocedure in place to ensure that all animals in shared enclosures were eating.\nFailure to observe animals to assess their health and well-being on a daily basis and failure to adequately\ncommunicate health issues to the attending veterinarian can be detrimental to the health of the animals and cause\nunnecessary pain and distress. Daily observation of all the animals to assess their well-being and direct and\nfrequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues is necessary to ensure that the\nanimals receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensure that all animals receive\nadequate daily observation and that the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary."

A second\nfisher living in the same enclosure died shortly before its cage mate (no necropsy was performed) and that death\nwas likely due to the same cause.\nDuring interviews of facility staff members the animal curator stated that she has requested permission to hire\nadditional help but has not received permission to do so from the Superintendent of Schools. She stated that with\nthe current staffing level it is difficult for animal caretakers to adequately perform their duties.The attending\nveterinarian was also contacted regarding the mortality rate and she stated that she agreed with the curator, that\nstaffing levels were not sufficient at times to provide adequate daily observation and care of the animals.\nA sufficient number of adequately trained employees are needed to maintain a professionally acceptable level of\nanimal husbandry. The facility should ensure that they have a sufficient number of trained employees to care for\ntheir animals.\nCorrect by May 25, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
