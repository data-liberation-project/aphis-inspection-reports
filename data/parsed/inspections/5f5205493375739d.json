The log has no place to follow up on contacting the vet and what the resolution\nof the health concern was. So there is no way to track how animals are progressing after treatment. Daily\nobservation and the method that the information is conveyed and tracked between the farm management and the\nattending veterinarian needs to be addressed for the health of the animals in the park. Additionally daily\nobservations were not recorded after November 2015 and based on vet care invoices multiple animals were seen\nand treated with no coinciding documentation. Daily observations lead to early detections of animal health issues\nand can assist the vet with a thorough history to help with diagnosing problems. This documentation is important in\nthe overall health care of the animals and an ability to communicate issues to the attending veterinarian especially\nfor adequate post procedural care.\n*** The large male red kangaroo in the digester building that is blind in one eye had his head tilted and was walking\nin circles around the pen continuously for several minutes during the inspection process. This circling is an\nabnormal behavior pattern that could indicate potential health care issues. The facility did not recognize that this is\nan abnormal behavior pattern and therefore did not convey this information to the vet in a timely manner. The\nattending vet needs to assess the animals behavior and assist the facility with a plan to encourage normal behavior\npatterns for the animals health and well being."
