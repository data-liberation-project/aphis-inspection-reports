One wooden post had been scratched and chewed by the tigers to a point where it has decreased to half of its\noriginal diameter. There was another wooden upright pole of this same structure that had been scratched and had\ndecreased in diameter by approximately 25%. This is a threat of injury to any animals in the enclosure. The\nlicensee must repair or replace these compromised poles.\n- In the front section of the park two of the metal fence poles for the arena enclosure had broken welds and\nsignificant rust present, to a degree that may affect the structural strength of the pole. Licensee welded the broken,\nrusted weld on the arena enclosure during the inspection. The other broken weld on the arena needs more\nextensive repair. This pole must be straightened and welded to ensure the animals are safely contained and\nprotected from injury, and to ensure the animals are securely contained.\n- In the front section of the park a tiger enclosure had a large natural tree log connecting the tops of two log houses\nfor the enclosed animals. This large, cut tree could act as a bridge for the enclosed animals. This cut tree had\ndeteriorated and appeared weak in areas. The structural intergrity of the cut tree exposed the enclosed animals to\nrisk of injury if it were to break suddenly. This log bridge was cut in the center and secured during the inspection.\n- In the rear of the park, a house contained 3 free roaming tiger cubs with no one present to monitor the animals.\nOne cub was 7 weeks of age and the other two were 12 weeks of age. These unsupervised cubs had free access to\nhousehold furniture,appliances, and fixtures which exposed them to a variety of potential injuries. The cubs could\npull or knock items off of the counter tops and other surfaces. These items could fall onto the cubs and possibly\ninjure the cubs. All animals need a dedicated enclosure which is secure and safe. Licensee needs to maintan the\nanimals in a safe enclosure to ensure the animals are safely contained and protected from potential injury.\n-The fence of the primary enclosures of some of the large cats in the back section of the park is a verticle fence\napproximately 10.5 feet high without a kick-in or a top. This fence height is inadequate to sufficiently contain the\nenclosed animals at all times. The licensee must modify these enclosures or move the large cats to enclosures that\nare constructed of such material that is appropriate for the animals, of such strength that is structurally sound, and\nare maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and securely contain the animals.\nThe facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The\nindoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the\nanimals from injury and to contain the animals."
