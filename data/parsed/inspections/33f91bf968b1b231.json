The one llama has overgrown toenails on the right rear foot. The pig has overgrown\ntoenails on both front feet which is beginning to cause the digits to be in an abnormal position. If left uncorrected,\novergrown toenails and hooves could eventually cause joint or foot problems. To avoid future problems a regular\nprogram of trimming needs to be maintained, with trimming occurring on an as frequent basis as is necessary to\nmaintain a normal hoof and foot posture. Correct by November 30, 2016 and then continuously.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager."
