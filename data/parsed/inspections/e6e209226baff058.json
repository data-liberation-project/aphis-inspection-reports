Hair, cobwebs, and dust was accumulating along the\nsides, tops and fronts of the enclosures affecting 4 adults and 3 puppies. The accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust\ncreate an unsanitary living condition that could impact the health and well-being of the dogs. It indicates a potential living\narea for other pests that are housed with the dogs. The licensee must remove all hair, cobwebs, and dust from the\naffected areas so these surfaces can be cleaned and sanitized to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and\npractices.\nTo be corrected by: July 30, 2021"
