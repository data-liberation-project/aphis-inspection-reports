A six foot high perimeter fence must be provided for this enclosure to keep unauthorized\npeople and animals from coming in contact with the animals on exhibit and provide a secondary containment\nsystem in the event of an escape.\nThe ring-tailed lemurs are currently not being housed in their outdoor enclosure.\nThis was a focused inspection on the animals.\nThis inspection was conducted with a facility representative and the exit interview was conducted with the owner."
