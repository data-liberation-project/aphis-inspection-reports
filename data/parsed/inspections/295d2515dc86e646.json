The licensee did not follow-up with the veterinary clinic and stated that\nthe dog no longer has a bloody stool and that it went away on its own. However, the inspector spoke to the\nattending veterinarian today who stated the fecal was positive for Colitis. The attending veterinarian also stated the\ndog needs to be examined.\nThe dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered. Documentation\nshould be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of their\ndocumentation.
