The student working with this\nanimal on this study, under the principle investigator, disposed of the bat. According to the protocol (attachment on\nbat husbandry) any dead animals are to be bagged, labeled, placed in a designated refrigerator, and reported to the\nveterinary staff immediately.\nThe student did not follow the protocol, which constitutes an unapproved significant change to the protocol. Such a\nchange can have a negative impact on the well-being of the animals. In this instance, the fact that the veterinary\nstaff was not able to examine this animal meant that there were unanswered questions about the cause of death;\nCould the death have been preventable? Could the animal have been affected by something that could be a risk to\nthe others in the colony?\nSteps should be taken to ensure that all personnel follow the approved protocol, in order to safeguard the well-being\nof the animals under study.\nTo be corrected from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
