The 2 damaged areas of the shared fence could cause injury to the animals' face,\nnose, mouth, tongue or the skin on their limbs. This item affected 2 camels and 2 kangaroos.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, outdoor housing facilities should be structurally sound and maintained in good\nrepair to protect the animals from injury.\nNOTE - Exit interview held 9/8/15 on-site with facility representatives.
