As we started the inspection he called a public attendant up to relieve\nhim. Once he was relieved the attendant stood watch in the center of the larger petting zoo area. There were\ncurrently two groups that were feeding the animals in which one group went down and around the corner to feed the\nlarge group of llamas. These llamas were out of the public attendants viewing range and the public interactions\nwere not being monitored. This area was previously blocked off from public contact in the past but for some reason\nwas reopened without enough public attendants to cover said area. If there was one other attendant then the facility\nwould have had an adequate number of attendants to properly monitor all the animals during public contact in the\npetting zoo areas. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at\nall times during periods of public contact for the safety and well-being of the animals and the public. Correct by\nFebruary 18, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Assistant Director."
