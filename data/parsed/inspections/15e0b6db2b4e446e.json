Using a needle and syringe multiple times is problematic because it can\ngreatly dull the needle, thus resulting in more tissue damage at insertion. Additionally, the risk of bacteria contaminating a\ntank of vaccines or being injected into the tissue of a dog is markedly increased. This kind of contamination can lead to\nabscess formation under the skin of a dog, which is a painful process that requires medical treatment.

This is a\npainful disorder and sometimes the mother will not allow the puppies to nurse due to pain. If the mother will not allow\npuppies to nurse, they can become malnourished or starve. The cage card for this litter states 6 of the 7 puppies died\nwithin 3 days of birth.\nWhen the licensee recognizes an abnormal medical condition, a prompt assessment of the animal needs to be made so\nthat pain and suffering can be minimized.
