The prairie\ndog coterie typically spent much of their time in the tunnels and burrows they had constructed in the outdoor habitat,\nconsistent with their natural behavior. On 20 September, the facility explored the tunnel system, recovering one shy\nanimal who did not respond to recall and discovered a collapse in a poorly constructed tunnel and 5 prairie dogs had\nperished. The facility immediately held all the animals off the outdoor habitat as they checked the irrigation systems and\nredesigned the habitat, decreasing the depth of the substrate and improving the drainage, in addition to making\nmanagement changes to prevent future tunnel collapse injuring animals. The Animal Welfare Act and Regulations require\nthat outdoor housing facilities shall protect the animals from injury.\nWhile this additional noncompliant item is also under the same regulation, it is not a critical. Prior to inspection, on 29\nJanuary 2023, a 2 year old Red Panda was not contained by her habitat. She was relatively new to the habitat and\nmanaged to climb past a tree guard and into an adjacent tree outside the habitat. Wildlife Care Specialists were\nsuccessful in voluntarily recalling her back into her primary enclosure and bedroom in apparent good health. The facility\nensured that the tree was trimmed and a larger tree guard was installed prior to returning her to the outdoor habitat to\nprevent further explorations.
