Airway bill number 55500380816. The LACPH veterinarian and CDC\npersonnel were present at the Aeroflot cargo area when the dog arrived.\nA male intact yellow retriever mix displaying neurological signs arrived to the Aeroflot airline cargo area. CDC\npersonnel denied entry of this dog as a rabies suspect and a LACPHV issued a health order to the airline for this\ndog to be seen at a veterinary clinic for evaluation. According to the LACPHV, they cannot rule out rabies and the\ndog needed to be quarantined and observed. The dog\u2019s paperwork included a health certificate and rabies\ncertificate with no information regarding this dog\u2019s neurologic problems.\nLACPHV found a veterinary clinic that would be willing to see the dog and quarantine him. The cargo/ intermediate\nhandler took the dog to an alternate veterinary hospital, but the clinic could not handle the case at that time. The\ndog was taken to the Los Angeles City Shelter the following morning by the cargo/intermediate handler and has\nsince received appropriate veterinary care.\nAs a registered transporter, it is the responsibility of the carrier to arrange for any needed veterinary care as soon as\npossible for any dogs that are in obvious physical distress."
