Fawn male juvenile dog: the floor of this animal's enclosure is covered with a single piece of absorbent paper\npad material. A small amount of shredded, loose material is evident at the back of the enclosure. The paper pad is\nsoiled with both liquid and solid excreta. A strong odor of animal waste is present in and around the enclosure.\nThere is not enough absorbent litter material to absorb and cover the excreta, and as a result the animal is in direct\ncontact with the excreta.\n2. Black and brown brindle female juvenile dog: the solid plastic floor of this animal's enclosure is mostly exposed,\nwith no absorbent material or litter present on much of the surface area. There is an accumulation of some loose,\nshredded material and excreta that was not absorbed or covered by litter around the edges of the enclosure. A\npaper pad, visibly soiled with liquid and solid waste that is not covered or absorbed by litter material, is bunched at\nthe front of the enclosure. Without enough litter material in the enclosure, this animal's chest and forelimbs are in\ndirect contact with the excreta on this paper pad.\nCarriers must ensure that primary enclosures with solid floors contain enough previously unused litter material to\nabsorb and cover excreta. The litter material must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic.\nThis inspection was conducted at the cargo facility serving Turkish Airlines with a cargo handler present. No airline\nrepresentatives were available at this location.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHadjis Tonya, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
