This dog was also cited for a matted hair coat on the previous inspection report and she currently has a\nlarge, thick section of hair that is tightly matted against the skin on the right side of her neck behind the ear.\nPoor dental health and matted hair coats could cause pain and discomfort to the animals, as well as, lead to further\nhealth issues.\nThe above listed dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an\neffective treatment plan.\nThe dog with matted a hair coat must have the matted hair removed and their hair coats must be maintained in a\nmanner that keeps them free of matting, dirt and debris."
