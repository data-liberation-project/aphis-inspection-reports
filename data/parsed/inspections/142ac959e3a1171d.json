The nail overgrowth is causing misalignment\nof the toes.\nSpecific animals noted were Napoleon, Laya, Bentley, Tonto, and Olive Oyl.\nRecords on Napoleon document nail trims on 8/19/15, 6/28/16, and 9/22/17. One month after the latest trim, the\nnails look overgrown.\nRecords on Laya document nail trims on 8/3/16 and 9/26/17. One month after the latest trim, her nails were long\nenough to affect her stride. The nails were first noticed by the inspector after she seemed short-strided in the hind\nlimbs.\nRecords on Bentley document nail trims 10/9/12, 6/30/15, and 6/30/16. Notes from a Sept 2013 stay in the hospital\nnote each day a plan to trim nails, but there was no documentation of a trim before he was discharged from the\nhospital.\nAdditionally, Bentley has a skin condition on his lower legs and ventral thorax first noted in January 2016 when the\nhyperkeratosis, lichenification, and alopecia were documented . It was suggested on a later note to be a result of a\npossible zinc deficiency, but there was no substantiation with exam or diagnostics, or notes of any mineral\nsupplementation to treat any deficiencies. Lack of a definitive diagnosis and treatment, if indicated, of a skin\ncondition can cause unnecessary discomfort to the animal.\nTonto's records show he was donated on 6/24/15, and his only documented nail trim was 6/28/16.\nOlive Oyl was donated on 9/20/10, and nail trims are documented on 7/31/12, 6/30/15, and 6/28/16.\nOffice of Campus Veterinarian (OCV) personnel reviewed records from about 17 additional animals. These records\nshowed intervals similar in length and regularity.\nThe records of these animals show that trimming is inconsistent in frequency and, likely, quality. Improved\nobservation of nail condition with trimming as nail conditions dictate, as well as appropriate training and supervision\nof the personnel doing the trimming should be implemented.\nOvergrown nails to this extent can cause discomfort to the animals and the misalignment it causes can contribute to\ngait abnormalities and degenerative joint disease. Animals that have progressed to the point of anatomical distortion\nneed frequent corrective trimming to get and maintain them as close to normal as is possible.\nCorrect in 30 days, by 11/24/2017.\nThis inspection was conducted on 10/24-25/2017 accompanied by facility personnel, and the exit interview was\nconducted with OCV and IACUC personnel."
