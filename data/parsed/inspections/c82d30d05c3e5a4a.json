After the attending\nveterinarian retired, the USDA inspector was informed that another veterinarian on staff would become the\nattending veterinarian, responsible for over-seeing the facility\u2019s program of veterinary care. That person was no\nlonger on site performing veterinary duties after 2/6/17. A second staff veterinarian reportedly took over as attending\nveterinarian, but as of 4/3/17 that person was also no longer on site performing veterinary duties. This left the facility\nwith a series of intermittent relief veterinarians; seven additional veterinarians in addition to the aforementioned\nformer staff veterinarians have been used from 4/3/17 until present. The veterinarian who had been gone as of\n2/6/17 has now been reintegrated, and stated that he is acting as attending veterinarian, but he is currently only\nworking two to three days per week, and he does not have a signed written program of veterinary care with the\nfacility. When administration was asked who has been acting as the attending veterinarian during the month of April\nthey provided a list showing a different veterinarian each day, with a total of nine veterinarians listed. Veterinarians\nand staff members report that the veterinary department is currently understaffed, and unable to keep up with\npreventive health programs. The lack of continuity creates confusion about veterinary authority and policies.\nFailure to have an attending veterinarian could be detrimental to the welfare of the animals. The facility must\nformally employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements in order to safeguard the welfare of the\nanimals. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall\ninclude a written program of veterinary care.\nTo be corrected from this time forward."
