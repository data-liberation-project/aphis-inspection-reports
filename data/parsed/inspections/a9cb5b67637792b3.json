There is also a health risk to the public if the primates should attack,\nbite, scratch, defecate or urinate on them since they can be on the ground, overhead in the trees, or in the water. It\nis also known that some of the primates on this island are Herpes positive which also poses an additional health risk\nto the jet ski participants.\nThe registrant has hired security to patrol these particular areas, but the security leaves the island mid day and\nbefore these jet ski operations end for the day.\nAdditional security (or other) measures shall be established to ensure that the unauthorized persons cannot get\nclose or gain access to the island and make direct or indirect contact with the primates, so as to ensure both the\nsafety of the primates as well as the public. This can be accomplished (but not limited to) additional security,\nerection of a fence or other type of barrier, or continuous video surveillance.\nCorrect by July 31, 2016\nThe exit interview was conducted on-site with the contact person.\nThe contact person had to leave before this inspection report could be completed.
