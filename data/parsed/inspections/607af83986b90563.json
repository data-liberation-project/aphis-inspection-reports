The inspection continued and the animal was\nlooked at about an hour later and it was still exhibiting the behavior. The licensee states that this condition has occurred\nfor a long period of time and therefore she believes it is \u201cnormal\u201d for this animal. The licensee states that the animal had a\nprior history of painful forelimbs about a year ago and the attending veterinarian treated the condition but the veterinarian\nhas not evaluated/treated it since then. The paddock that the animal was housed in contained excessive amounts of wet\nsubstrate, standing water, and thick mud. Wet conditions can lead to conditions such as foot rot and abscesses. Failure to\nprovide veterinary care when needed can result in prolonged suffering and worsening of the condition of the animal.\nLicensees must ensure that they establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care, including the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. When animals are identified with\ninjuries or illness, they must seek care by their veterinarian to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases.
