The animal enclosure did not have a signed consignor's certification\nregarding when the cat was last offered food and water, and what the feeding and watering instructions were for the\ntrip. This certification should be clearly visible on top of the animal enclosure.\nCarriers must ensure that a certification is signed by the consignor that includes written instructions for feeding and\nwatering, and that this information is clearly visible on the primary enclosure so that the animal can be properly\ncared for during transit.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the intermediate handler representatives at the cargo office."
