Sheetrock is not an appropriate material for animal\nenclosures. Sheetrock can be easily scratched and gouged by an animal and cannot be adequately cleaned and\ndisinfected. In this case the sheetrock was scratched in spots and the area behind the pealing rubber trim is stained and\ndirty and cannot be adequately cleaned.\nThe off-exhibit area for the small-clawed otter has a rotting wall and a piece of plywood being used as a door with an area\nof whitish staining along the bottom that appears to be mold. The door area on the exhibit side has exposed insulation\nand a gap between the piece of plywood being used as a door and the cinder block wall. This gap is large enough for the\notter to stick his front legs through the gap in front of the cinderblocks. The rotting wall cannot be adequately cleaned and\nexposes the otter to possibly harmful materials behind the wall. The plywood door cannot be adequately cleaned as\nindicated by the mold along the bottom. The exposed insulation has the potential to cause the otter harm if ingested .\nAdditionally, the 1-inch gap between the plywood door and the cinderblocks is large enough to allow the animal to slide an\narm or leg between the space which has the potential to cause the otter harm.\nFacilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals and the facilities shall\nbe structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nThe sloth enclosure needs to be constructed of materials appropriate for housing animals or the sloth needs to be moved\nto a more adequate enclosure. The otter holding area and door needs to be repaired so that it can be adequately cleaned\nand is safe for the otter or the otter needs to be moved to an enclosure that is structurally sound and can be adequately\ncleaned.\nTo be corrected by Feb 24, 2021"
