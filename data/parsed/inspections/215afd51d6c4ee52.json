The two affected voles were on the\nside of the divider that had access to a ball bearing water bottle which had become vapor locked. This vapor locked water\nbottle resulted in these two voles not having access to water. Facility standards require that any animals in a divided cage\nshould have access to a water bottle without ball bearings since it is a known issue that the ball bearing water bottles are\nprone to vapor lock. The facility has begun transitioning to a different type of water bottle to avoid this issue.\nLack of access to potable water can cause an animal to experience dehydration and lead to other medical issues,\nincluding death. The facility must ensure that if potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be\nprovided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.\nThis inspection was conducted on 4/21/2021 and the exit interview was conducted on 4/22/2021 with facility\nrepresentatives.\nEnd Section"
