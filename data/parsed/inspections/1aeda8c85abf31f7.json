The reports\nthat were submitted to the IO and reviewed during this inspection were not signed by a majority of the IACUC.\nThe purpose of such reports are to inform the IO of the facility\u2019s adherence to title 9, chapter I subchapter A- Animal\nWelfare including any departures identified by the IACUC; facility issues that the IO can help resolve; and if any\nsignificant/major problems are identified and not corrected in time, the IO will be required to report in writing to USDA the\nfailure to adhere to the plan and schedule for correction of significant deficiencies.\nThe IACUC shall prepare evaluation reports at least once every six months upon completion of the required semiannual\nevaluations which are reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members. The report must identify all deficiencies,\ndesignate each as significant or minor and contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting\neach deficiency.\nCorrect by 30 October 2025 or by the next facility semi-annual evaluation."
