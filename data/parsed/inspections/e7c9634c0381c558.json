This board is now loose and jagged edges of the wire mesh are\nexposed. To ensure that the animals are not injured on this plank or mesh, and other animals are not able to gain\naccess, this door will need to be addressed.\n***To Be Corrected By: April 24, 2014\n2. This same pig enclosure also has a side panel that needs additional support. The entire pen is constructed of a\nwood plank framework and wire mesh. There are two side panels and one panel at each end. However, the 2\npanels on the right side have begun to loosen up and are now leaning into the pen. To ensure the integrity of this\nfencing, these panels will need to be addressed.\n***To Be Corrected By: April 24, 2014\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the licensee."
