The marmoset cages are\nsituated directly adjacent to the furniture items. The marmoset scent odor in the room is fairly strong in spite of all\ncages and items within the cages being clean. Animal areas must be kept neat and free of any furniture or\nequipment not actually used and necessary for proper husbandry practices relating to the animals. This is\nnecessary to allow proper cleaning and sanitization as required by the regulations and standards in order to\nminimize odors and eliminate disease spread and pests. Animal areas inside housing facilities must be kept neat\nand free of any equipment, furniture and stored materials not actually used and necessary for proper husbandry\npractices. Correct by Jan. 20, 2016.\nThe marmoset cited for vet care on the April 28, 2015 inspection report has been seen by a veterinarian.\nExit conducted by Kate Campbell, ACI, Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO and facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBrunkhorst Susanne, Veterinary Medical Officer"
