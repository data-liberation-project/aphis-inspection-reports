According to facility representatives, the\nmacaques were difficult to shift into the catch cage so the guillotine door was open to allow the primates into the staff\nalleyway. While shifting the animals into the alleyway, the two macaques pushed the entry gate creating a 2.5 inch gap.\nThe gap was large enough for both non-human primates to escape.\nThe three animal care staff immediately notified the veterinarian in charge that the escape occurred. Upon notification, the\nfull animal care staff at the facility and veterinarian implemented a plan to capture the macaques. Additional personnel,\nincluding the behaviorist, were called to the facility for support. The plan to recapture the primates included live traps with\nfresh produce, walks around the perimeter of the facility and personnel stationed at the facility overnight.\nOn August 16th, 2023, one primate was caught by facility staff and taken to be examined by the veterinarian in charge.\nAccording to the veterinarian, the macaque was not sick or injured. On the evening of August 17th, 2023, the second\nmacaque was recovered. According to the veterinarian the macaque was immediately examined. The macaque was not\nsick or injured.\nHousing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the\nspecies of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from\ninjury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.\nCorrected on August 16, 2023 by repairing the alleyway gate.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nGLORIA MCFADDEN, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
