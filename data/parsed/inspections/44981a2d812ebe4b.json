At that time, conducting \nregulated activity from any site without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act. \n \nA copy of your license will be sent to you without any additional action on your part. If you have not received your license \nwithin 30 days of all sites demonstrating full compliance, please contact the USDA at 970-494-7478. \n \n n",
