      "narrative": "During inspection, animals were identified with medical conditions that had not been noticed or had been inadequately\ndiagnosed by the facility.\nThe following animals in need of veterinary care were not identified during the facility\u2019s daily observations:\n- In the last row on the parking side towards the center, a white rabbit was found with a large firm circular black mass,\napproximately 1 to 1.5 inch in diameter, below the left eye. Some white swirls could be seen on top of the black mass.\nThe left eye was half closed with some cloudy white discharge in the inner corner of the eye. The skin around the left eye\nwas red and irritated. The rabbit appeared lethargic and was cowering in the corner of the enclosure.\n- In the middle row, across the 4th row on the pecan side, a white rabbit was seen with a small area of black crusty\nmaterial at the intersection between his head and the right ear. This rabbit also had a moderate amount of cloudy white\ndischarge in the inner corner of the right eye and a wet nose. The licensee had identified the ear lesion explaining it\noccurred during a mating session but did not notice the eye and nose discharge. The rabbit appeared slightly dull.\n- In enclosure 220, the left eye of a white albino kit was half closed. All that was visible was a red membrane with a cloudy\nwhite semi-circle curved towards the inner corner of the eye.\n- A white and brown female rabbit in enclosure 763 had a weeping left eye. The hair around the eye was wet and the skin\nunder the eye was slightly flushed pink. The licensee had shaved down the hair in front of her eye to assist with a\nprevious eye infection but had not identified the new occurrence.\n- A white juvenile rabbit in an enclosure with its mother and one other sibling (middle lane on the parking side of the barn)\nhad a swollen right eye that could barely open. The hair around the eye was missing and the visible skin was slightly pink.\n- In the 4th row on the pecan side, the 8th enclosure from the beginning had a black faced brown rabbit with a moderate\namount of cloudy white discharge exuding from the left nostril.\n- In the last row on the parking side, a grey rabbit in the last enclosure was heard sneezing and had a small amount of\nwhite nasal discharge as well as some nasal flaring.\n- In the last row on the parking side, a brown rabbit in the next to last enclosure, had some clear nasal discharge and the\nhair surrounding his nostrils were matted with old discharge.\n- In the 5th row on the pecan side, the 5th enclosure from the end had a grey rabbit with a moderate amount of opaque\nsemi-clear white discharge exuding from the right nostril.\n- In the second building, in the last row on the parking side, a brown/red rabbit had a large amount of crusty black and red\nmaterial inside both ears. The skin inside the ear below the crusty material appeared red and irritated.\n- Several rabbits throughout the primary and secondary barns were noted to have overgrown nails or nails that were on\nthe verge of being overgrown. At least 17 rabbits had overgrown nails that curled to the side or extended far beyond the\nfoot.\nThe following animals in need of care were inadequately diagnosed by the facility and the attending veterinarian was not\nconsulted on adequate care:\n- A brown female rabbit with a black face, in a middle row on the parking side, had a large area of open inflammation\nspanning the length of her back. The hair was wet and matted down from a large amount of thick opaque whitish-yellow\nsubstance that was oozing out of her skin. The skin that was visible in that area was ulcerated, reddened and inflamed.\nThe licensee stated that this occurred during a mating session, diagnosed it as an injury and was inadequately treating as\nsuch without having identified/considered the current skin infection/inflammation.\n- In the middle row, across the 6th row on the parking side, a grey and white rabbit was seen with half of the left eye\ncovered with a pink fleshy membrane starting at the inner corner of the eye. The licensee had been treating the rabbit for\nan eye infection without having identified/considered the protruding membrane significantly affecting the eye.\nThe conditions affecting these animals were not identified or were inadequately diagnosed by the licensee. Therefore,\nsuitable medical care had not been provided and the attending veterinarian was not consulted. Failure to promptly as well\nas accurately identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress in animals with\nconditions such as these listed here. The licensee must ensure that daily observation of all animals occur in order to\nassess their health and well-being. Timely communication with the attending veterinarian must occur to provide proper\ndiagnosis and medical attention. In consultation with the attending veterinarian, a treatment plan must be established for\nthe above-mentioned animals."

A\nlarge amount of small black flies could be seen within and roaming around the red buckets while a moderate amount of\nflies could be seen on the feces. The licensee explained that the feces was last removed 6 months ago and started waste\ndisposal prior to inspection. The fecal waste accumulation was attracting pests which could become a disease hazard or\narea of contamination for the rabbits. Waste accumulation can also lead to odors which additionally can adversely impact\nhealth and comfort of the rabbits.

Additionally, the facility uses thin metal sheets as dividers between primary\nenclosures. In at least 8 enclosures, the rabbits have chewed at sections of these metal sheets and created sharp edges\nthat peeled upwards to protrude into the animal space. Finally, the facility has bought new stainless steel pellet feeders\nand attached them to the primary enclosures using 2 small metal wires, one at each end of the feeder. In at least 15\nenclosures, the newer feeders did not have the 2 metal wires straightened down and they were protruding into the\nenclosure at eye level.

In other enclosures, such as 146, 770,\n771 and 884, larger gaps, about 2 to 3 inches wide, were formed between the strands creating a limb injury as well as\nentrapment hazard.
