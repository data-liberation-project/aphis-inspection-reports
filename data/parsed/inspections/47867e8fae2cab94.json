The attending veterinarian was not notified of any unhealthy conditions in Thumper,\nuntil after his death. The necropsy report indicated that Thumper had a chronic disease condition and was very thin.\nSpecifically, the necropsy report identified that Thumper had extensive localized ulceration and inflammation of the skin\non both feet (focally extensive, bilateral, ulcerative pododermatitis). Second, the report showed Thumper had severe\ninflammation of the forestomach (severe, multifocal, hemorrhagic and neutrophilic gastritis). Third the report showed that\nThumper was negative for Toxoplasma gondii. Finally, the report showed that Thumper has severe loss of fat and muscle\ntissue (emaciation with serous atrophy of fat and diffuse muscle atrophy) indicative of chronic disease or inadequate\nnutrition. Dailly observations performed by personnel at the licensed facility, failed to identify the inflammation in the feet\nor the thin body condition of Thumper.\nInadequate daily observations can lead to the prolonged suffering of animals when injuries or changes in their health or\nbehavior are not noticed in a timely manner.\nAnimals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being. In addition, there must be a mechanism of direct\nand accurate information, conveyed to the attending veterinarian, on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being.\nTo be corrected from this day (4/11/2025) forward."
