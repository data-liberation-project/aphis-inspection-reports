This increase in blood collections has the potential to adversely affect the\nanimals. The principal investigator must ensure that a proposal to make a significant change in an ongoing activity\ninvolving animals contains a complete description of the proposed use. The facility has addressed this issue with\nseveral corrective actions, one of which is the activity is no longer being conducted, and another is further training of\nthe study personnel.\nThis item has been addressed by the IACUC.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative."
