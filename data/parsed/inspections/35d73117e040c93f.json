  "narrative": "No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.  \nThis was a focused inspection to ensure the non-compliant veterinary care items (2.40b2) and the direct\nnon-compliant items (3.1 and 3.7) identified on the previous inspection (24 June 2015) were corrected.  The\nChihuahua (#190) was examined and treated by a veterinarian.  The licensee consulted the veterinarian about the\nShih Tzu (#187), the white Pomeranian (#84), and the Silky Terrier (#162) and provided all three with appropriate\ntreatments.  Construction repairs were made to the dividers between enclosures and dogs were moved to different\nenclosures so there were no more compatability issues.  \n \nThis focused inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee.",
