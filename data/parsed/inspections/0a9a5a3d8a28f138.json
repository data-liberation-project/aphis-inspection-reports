The fecal build-up in the enclosures was enough where the dogs could not\nmove around freely without stepping in it. The wash downs were full of fecal material covering most of the wash\ndown with a several inch thick layer. Licensee said they haven't been able to clean because the drain pipes have\nbeen frozen for about a month. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease hazards and create an\nunhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is removed from the\nprimary enclosures daily as required and from under the enclosure as often as necessary to satisfy husbandry\nstandards, but at least every two weeks.\nTo be corrected by: March 11, 2019.\nThis is the first inspection at a new site.\nRegulated activity may not be conducted at the new site until compliant.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
