The owner also had an acquisition record for a goat on 8/2/2018 but there was no\ninformation regarding where the animal came from.\nAcquisition and disposition records must include name, address, date of acquisition/disposition, species of animal,\nand number of animals in the shipment. Acquisition and disposition records must also include USDA license or\nregistration number (if applicable), or vehicle license number and drivers's license number and state if not licensed\nor registered with the USDA. These records must also include offspring born and animals who died/were\neuthanized while still with the owner.\nFailure to maintain these records can inhibit disease traceback investigations, accounting for animals for health\npurposes, or establishing proof of ownership.
