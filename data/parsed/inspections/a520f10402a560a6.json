Three puppies are in contact with the affected flooring located in indoor\nhousing. Flooring that allows the feet and legs to pass through any openings can be stressful and could lead to\npossible injury. In addition, the daily activity and mobility of the puppies is affected. The licensee must ensure that\nall flooring does not allow any feet or legs to pass through any openings in the flooring.\n** The licensee corrected this flooring issue during the inspection by covering the enclosure floor with a smaller\ngauge wire that wouldn't allow the puppies feet to pass through.\nExit interview was conducted with Brittany Light, ACI, Debbie Cunningham, VMO and the facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCunningham Debbie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
