The frayed carpet edges and/or loose carpet\nfibers could increase the risk of an animal getting entagled, increase the risk of ingestion of a foreign body and/or\nother injury. The licensee must repair or replace the divider panel and carpet flooring, and ensure that all enclosures\nare kept in good repair and must protect the dogs from injury at all times.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative, Erika Leisner VMO, and Chad Proctor\nACI.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLeisner Erika, Veterinary Medical Officer"
