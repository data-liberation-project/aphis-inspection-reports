The\nprimary enclosure consisted of metal wire cattle fencing that were held together by plastic zip ties around metal\nstakes in the ground. In one section of the fence only one plastic zip tie, a couple inches from the ground, was used\nto fasten the 4 foot high cattle fence to a metal stake. This allowed the top 75% of the fence to be easily\nmanipulated to create a gap several feet wide at the top and middle of the fence. Additionally, there were several\nareas in the fence line that were misshaped and bending outwards from the enclosure. It was mentioned by staff\nthat coyotes have been seen on the outside of the perimeter fence. The primary enclosure is not structurally sound\nand does not adequately contain the animals. Furthermore, the goats could easily become trapped inside the gap in\nthe fence, or wild predators could gain access to the goats. The primary enclosure must be structurally sound,\nprotect the animals from injury, and contain the animals.\nCorrected at time of Inspection\nThe inspection was conducted with Animal Care staff and the Exit interview was conducted with the Associate\nDirector."
