Repairs\nhave not been made to prevent the entrance of other animals, such as mongoose, to the enclosure. Gaps are still\npresent around the bottom of the enclosure fencing.\nAdditionally, the only water for the geriatric spider monkey continues to be a lixit near the floor of the enclosure. The\nmonkey is geriatric, with a significant tremor, and is recovering from a recent significant illness where he was\nmoribund for many days, according to staff. The monkey was observed climbing to the bottom of the enclosure with\nsome difficulty. The plywood den for the monkey is near the top of the enclosure, thus the animal has to descend to\nthe floor to access water.\nMetal structures and the chain link fencing that comprised the enclosure sides were covered in rust and the plywood\nden box does not appear to have been sealed, and appears quite soiled. There was a rag attached to the den which\nwas also soiled and discolored. There was no bedding in the den.\nThere was a hole in the chainlink fencing above the monkey's nest box, measuring approximately ten inches in\ndiameter, that provides potential access to the lock-out / entrance area. This hole could be dangerous to the\nmonkey, as he could get caught, or access the exit area of the enclosure.\nPrimate housing should be constructed and maintained to protect the health and well-being of the animal. Rusted\nmetal and unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned and my pose a health threat to the animal. Water should\nbe easy to access for the animal to ensure that it can maintain adequate hydration. Failure to drink because the\nwater source is difficult to access may exacerbate other health problems in addition to causing primary dehydration.\nWildlife entering the enclosure may injure the animal directly or contaminate the enclosure. The facility should\nensure that the primate housing receives regular and timely maintenance, and that this geriatric animal receives\nappropriate care to ensure his comfort, and minimize stress.\nThis issue was cited previously with a previous correction date of January 17th, 2014."
