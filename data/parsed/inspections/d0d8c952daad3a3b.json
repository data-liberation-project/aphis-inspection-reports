The keeper told inspectors that this decrease in appetite started\napproximately three days before the 9th but there are no notations in the keeper records between 1 June and 9\nJune 2016. Records show that the attending veterinarian (AV) was consulted (while keeper was picking up\nmedications at his office) on this day (9 June) and he instructed the keeper staff to try offering the animal a wider\nvariety of food. Keeper notes show that the bobcat was offered a variety of food on 10 June 2016 but no mention of\nwhether the animal did eat the food offered.\nThere were no notations in the keeper records for 11 and 12 June 2016. The keeper record had a notation for 13\nJune 2016 (Monday) stating that the animal \u201clooked like\u201d she had eaten some food over the weekend but that no\nfeces were found in the enclosure over the weekend.\nThe notation in the keeper record for 14 June 2016 states that the bobcat had not eaten any food offered the day\nbefore and appeared weak. The AV was not contacted again until 14 June 2016 and an appointment was\nscheduled for the afternoon of the next day. There was no communication regarding this bobcat with the AV\ndocumented before 9 June or from 10 June until 14 June 2016 depsite the deteriorating condition of the animal. The\nanimal was euthanized at 3pm on 15 June 2016 due to progressing weakness, not eating, and presumed kidney\nfailure.\nDaily observation and direct, frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the health care\nof the animals. The licensee must observe animals daily to asses their health and well-being and establish as part\nof the program of veterinary care, a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian."
