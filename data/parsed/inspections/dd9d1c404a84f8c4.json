Both straps on the tote bag were attached with one clip and the weight of the animal\npulled the straps taut minimizing the opening so that the animal was essentially restrained within the bag.\nMany members of the public were observed crowded around the tote bag handling the animal. Attendants were not\nin close proximity observing the public interactions with the wallaby. The wallaby was unable to move to remove\nitself from unwanted or potentially stressful interactions. Exhibition of an animal while restrained and unable to move\naround an enclosure without observation by an attendant in close proximity is incompatible with requirements under\nthe Animal Welfare Act. Animals must only be exhibited under conditions consistent with maintaining their\nwell-being.\nCorrect by:This non-compliance was corrected prior to the completion of this inspection however all animals must\nbe appropriately exhibited in the future.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted conducted with company employees and on-site managers.\nThe inspection was conducted at the Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show and included petting zoo and animal\nracing venues.\nAdditional Inspectors\nIrwin Bryan, Compliance Specialist"
