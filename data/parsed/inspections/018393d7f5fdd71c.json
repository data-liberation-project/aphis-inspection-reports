The enclosure consisted of two areas divided by metal\nchain link fencing. The dividing fence had an entrance way for the animal to go between the two areas of the\nenclosure. On the ground in the entrance way of the dividing fence was a metal pipe like the piping often used for\nthe framework of chain link fencing. The metal pipe had broken off of one end and was laying several inches away\nfrom its original place of attachment. The broken portion of the pipe appeared sharp and was approximately 1 to 2\ninches long. The animal was observed walking over the broken pipe at least a dozen times. The licensee stated that\nit has been that way for at least several months but the animal had never been injured by it. Sharp ends such as on\nthe broken pipe can be sources of injury and infection if the animal were to step on it. Since the broken pipe was in\nan area of heavy traffic in the enclosure this increases the risk of injury to the animal. All sharp ends must be\nremoved from the enclosure to prevent the animal from injury.\nCorrected at time of inspection\nInspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nBy the licensee signing this document, it is not an admission of guilt or acceptance of the citation but only serves to\nreflect the licensees(cid:25) receipt of the report and exit interview."
