This off-label drug use is not in the PVC.\nThe attending veterinarian needs to approve all routine preventative medications administered by the facility\nincluding those recommended to the facility by the broker to ensure that the drugs are safely administered to the\npuppies. The veterinarian needs to approve the use of all drugs and include directions (dose, route of administration\nand frequency of administration) in the written program of veterinary care.

      "narrative": "Three dogs were identified as requiring veterinary attention during this inspection:\n*One female red and white Cocker Spaniel (microchip #0A01447166) was noted to have some thick tan material\nadhered to her right eyelid margins. The white part of her right eye is very red. The colored part of her right eye has\na slightly bluish haze to it. There is section of reddish tissue swollen in the bottom inner corner of her right eye. In\naddition, she has large amounts of tan brown tarter covering her teeth with her back teeth not visible due to the\namount of tarter. Her gums are redder than normal.\n*One male white maltese (0A01535107) was noted licking his lips a lot. He has a large amount of tan brown tarter\non his teeth. His gums are red and swollen. There is some white/light tan material adhered to junction of the gums\nand back teeth on both sides. Several of his teeth are missing.\n*One white with brown on the head female French bulldog was noted with skin and ear problems. The skin on the\ninside of both ears was red, swollen and thickened. Scabs were scattered on the skin on the inside of the ears\nwhere she has been scratching at the ears. A brown black debris was noted in the ear canals. The ear canals\nthemselves were extremely narrowed. She has several areas of sparse hair on her body including her\nflanks/hindquarters and her feet. The skin of these areas is reddened. The owner reports she was diagnosed with\ndemodex about six months ago and had been treated. The storage room held an old rusted container of Taktic with\na manufacturer date of 2007. The only directions on the bottle were the manufacturer's for large animal species.\nThese three dogs are not currently on any treatment plan. These dogs need to be examined by a veterinarian to\nensure that a diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is instituted. Correct by 3/19/2017."
