The\nconsignments for the June auction from two unlicensed individuals are: one female and two male white nosed\ncoatimundi tag numbers 058, 059 and 067, and a male skunk tag number 062. The consignments for the October\nauction from three unlicensed individuals are: a breeding pair of kinkajous with tag number 210, a male rhesus\nmacaque tag number 234, and a male and female cotton top tamarin pair tag number 150. No official one time\nexemption forms were included in the auction files. In order for APHIS Officials to track animal movement,\ninvestigate disease outbreaks, and to prevent illegal movement the person consigning the regulated animals to the\nauction sale must have a valid USDA License. The auction must not obtain an animal from any person who is\nrequired to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.\nCorrect by December 31, 2014.\nThis is a focused inspection of the records from the June and October 2014 auctions conducted on December 4th,\n2014.\nAn exit interview was conducted with the facility representative, an Animal Care VMO and Animal Care Inspector.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBrunkhorst Susanne, Veterinary Medical Officer"
