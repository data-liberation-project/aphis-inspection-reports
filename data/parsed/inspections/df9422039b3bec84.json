In one corner the sheeting has been peeled up,\nand protrudes about five inches horizontally, into the enclosure. The edge of the metal poses a risk of injury, and\nfurther chewing on the metal poses a risk for ingestion.\nThe indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to\nprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
