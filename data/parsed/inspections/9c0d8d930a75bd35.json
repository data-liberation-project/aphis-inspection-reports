      "narrative": "Eleven animals (2 Mink, 5 Alpaca, 1 Raccoon, 2 Arctic fox, 1 Striped skunk) were found in need of veterinary care,\nresultant from the licensee\u2019s failure to maintain an adequate program of veterinary care. This included:\n- Two singly housed mink had not received adequate veterinary care to treat wounds at the base of their tails. For the\nwhite/light grey mink, the wound covered the majority of the tail base. Hair was crusted and stuck down into the wound.\nThe second mink , a grey colored mink (described by the licensee as a \u201csapphire\u201d) had a wound in a similar location. It\nwas larger, an approximately 1.5cm irregularly shaped area that had dark red crusts (scabs of various sizes) in the wound\nand surrounding it. The wound was seeping a clear reddish-yellow discharge. In each case, the licensee stated that he\nhad seen these minks' injury a few days prior. He suspected that they were caused by fighting between the mink (they\nwere previously housed in an enclosures with another mink). He stated he separated the mink (moving the injured\nanimals to a different enclosure) but that he had not provided any care for the wounds, nor had he sought a veterinarian\nto examine the animals. Failure to properly treat wounds can result in them becoming infected, leading to unnecessary\nsuffering.\n- Five Alpaca have not received adequate veterinary care to treat their matted hair, excess fiber, and poor body condition.\nThe alpaca are all group housed in one enclosure. The black female alpaca has cords of matted fiber hanging off her in\nlong strings. Despite the large amount of matted fiber, her spine is readily apparent even from a distance. Individual\nvertebral bodies can be identified indicating that she is markedly underweight. This alpaca is also nursing a young cria\nwhich adds additional metabolic demand for milk production. The white adult alpaca has excessive fiber present. There\nare long cords of matted fiber hanging from its body. There is enough matted fiber present that inspectors were unable to\nvisually assess body condition. The adult brown alpaca has excessive fiber present. This alpaca had fiber that is dense\nand forms larger mats over its body (rather than hanging in cords), the fiber precludes assessing body condition. The\nadult male alpaca has been shorn more recently, and is clearly excessively thin. There is no fat visible on him. His\npelvis, vertebrae, ribs and shoulder are all readily apparent. Additionally, his nose and mouth appear to deviate to the\nright, off of midline. This type of facial deviation can indicate dental problems, which often makes eating more difficult for\nthe affected animal. The licensee recently acquired this alpaca, approximately 3 weeks prior to inspection. It has not\nbeen examined by a veterinarian, nor have the others, despite the poor body conditions, excessively matted coats, and\nfacial asymmetry. These problems have been pointed out to the licensee on prior inspections. Poor body condition can\nlead to gastrointestinal problems such as ulcer formation and unnecessary suffering, particularly in cold weather, which is\nrapidly approaching. Winters are often severe in this region. Of additional interest, matted fiber can be uncomfortable\nand prevents animals from properly thermoregulating.\n- One unweaned female raccoon is missing its left rear foot from the hock down. The distal end of the stub is covered\nwith non-haired pink skin. Two ulcerated areas are present on two sides of the stub. As she was observed moving\naround, the stub began bleeding. Licensee stated he was aware that this raccoon was missing a foot, and thought that it\nhad either been born that way, or had been injured by its mother. The licensee has not sought veterinary care for her, to\ntreat this injury, nor ensure that appropriate housing is provided (such as a solid floor to prevent the stub from going\nthrough the wire mesh, which would prevent further injury). This raccoon and her mother continue to be housed in a wire-\nbottom enclosure that has several sharp points in front of the nest box. Failure to seek appropriate veterinary care for this\nanimal has resulted in delayed healing, continued re-injury, and unnecessary suffering.\n- One singly housed Arctic fox housed in an enclosure without shelter, remains excessively thin. Its hips, pelvis, and ribs\nare more readily apparent than they should be, especially with the amount of winter fur present. The licensee stated that\nthe fox has been dewormed, and he has increased its daily food ration, since this problem was identified during the last\ninspection. However, the fox has not noticeably gained weight since that time. The licensee stated that he has not\nsought veterinary care for this fox, and that he thought it was just old. Poor body condition can result from illness,\ninadequate feed, or other medical causes, and requires an appropriate veterinary examination to determine the cause,\nproper treatment, and to prevent suffering.\n- One striped skunk and one Arctic fox had extremely long nails at the time of inspection. The nails on both of these\nanimals were long enough to be pointing in abnormal directions and both had been identified to the licensee on the prior\ninspection report. The licensee stated that he had not trimmed their nails yet, however, he trimmed both animal\u2019s nails\nduring the inspection. Excessively long toenails can cause difficulty walking and may become caught in wire-bottom\nenclosures, causing injury. In addition to this skunk and fox, other animals (Arctic fox, red fox, and less severely impacted,\nskunk) have overgrown toenails that require trimming to ensure optimal health, safety, and comfort.\nFailure to provide veterinary care when needed can result in unnecessary suffering and potentially death of animals.\nLicensees must ensure that they establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care, including the use\nappropriate methods to prevent control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. When animals are identified with\ninjuries or illness, they must seek care by their veterinarian to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by\nensuring that the animals listed above are examined and treated by a licensed veterinarian, also ensure all animals are\nprovided with adequate veterinary care."

      "narrative": "Eleven animals (5 mink, 4 striped skunk, 1 red fox, and 1 Arctic fox) were identified during the inspection that required\nveterinary care. These animals were not identified by the licensee prior to inspection.\n- One light grey-blue colored (described by the licensee as \u201csapphire\u201d) mink was observed with an open chest/neck\nwound. The wound was approximately 1 inch diameter and was located on the upper chest and lower neck of the animal.\nThe wound was open with bright red tissue visible in the center. There was yellow, dried discharge caked around the\nwound stuck to and hanging from the surrounding fur. The licensee stated that he had not noticed this lesion prior to\ninspectors bringing it to his attention. He stated that it likely was a \u201cboil\u201d that had broken open, as sapphire mink\nfrequently get \u201cboils\u201d. Left untreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful.\n-One black, pair-housed mink was observed with an open neck wound. The wound was approximately 1X2 inches and\ncrusty with scabs and discharge. The hair in the affected area was wet and matted, trapping debris inside the wound. The\nlicensee stated that he had not observed this injury prior to this inspection, and that no treatment had been provided. Left\nuntreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful.\n- One blue-grey colored mink (described by the licensee as \u201csapphire\u201d) was observed with an open wound on the tip of its\ntail. The wound was bright pink with dark red crusts and scabs around the edge. There was hair loss around the wound,\nwith some extremely short hair, nearly even with the skin, surrounding the wound. Bedding and other debris was dried to\nthe wounded tail tip. The licensee stated that sometimes mink chew on their tails, self-inflicting wounds consistent with\nthis one. He stated that he had not noticed this wound prior to inspection, and had not provided any care for this animal.\nLeft untreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful. Extremely short hair can be a result of barbering,\nwhich is often an indicator of stress or pain.\n- One grey mink, housed in a pair, was observed with injuries to its nose and on both rear legs. There was a line of blood\nor ulcerated tissue on the dorsal surface of its nose, where nose tissue meets the haired surface of its face. The feet of\nthe animal were swollen, with a red discharge that appeared to be dried blood, on both hind feet. It extended to the\nabdomen and tail, with red crusty material dried on those areas. Additionally, there was similar discharge accumulated on\nthe wire floor of the enclosure. The licensee removed the animal from the enclosure for further inspection. When the\nanimal was placed back into its enclosure, it was observed to not be using its back legs properly. The animal appeared\nlame and would fall from side to side with its hips touching the wire floor as it tried to enter the hide box. Leg and foot\ninjuries can be painful, particularly when housed on wire-flooring. In the enclosure housing this animal, the food and\nwater present at the time of inspection can only be accessed when standing on the thin, bare, uncoated wire. This can\neasily exacerbate foot wounds. The only solid flooring is within the nest box.\n- One light colored mink (white with a grey dorsal stripe and grey tips on its hair) was singly housed when inspectors\nidentified a horseshoe shaped wound at the base of its tail. This wound was pink, open, oozing a yellow-red tinged fluid.\nThe discharge crusted the surrounding fur, a wood chip was crusted and stuck to the edge of the wound. Left untreated,\nopen wounds are painful and may lead to infection.\n- One individually housed striped skunk in an enclosure labeled R4 C1, was observed by inspectors holding its mouth\npartially open. The licensee removed the skunk from the enclosure and upon further inspection the animal\u2019s top and\nbottom gums were swollen. The animal was missing multiple teeth. Those that were visible appeared brown and caked\nwith hard mineral deposits, which obscured the view of the teeth themselves. The skunk continued to hold its mouth\npartially open throughout the entire time it was being examined as though it was either unwilling or unable to completely\nclose its mouth. Swollen gums and tooth loss indicates dental disease, which is often painful. Additionally, this skunk had\nextremely long overgrown nails that could easily become entrapped in the wire enclosure floor.\n- One adult brown and white striped skunk housed in enclosure labeled W13, had bilateral eye discoloration. Licensee\nremoved the skunk from the enclosure for a close examination, revealing that both eyes appeared dry with a slightly\nirregular surface. The surface of the eyes were a cloudy/milky white with a dried crusty discharge. The discharge was\nworse in the right eye. This skunk also had a brown-red crusty nasal discharge adhered to both nostrils. The licensee\nstated it was an older animal and that he had not noticed these issues prior to inspection today. He had not sought any\ntreatment or veterinary care for this animal.\n- One adult striped skunk in enclosure labeled W16, also had bilateral eye discoloration. The licensee removed the skunk\nfrom the enclosure. On close examination, the surface of both eyes appeared cloudy with dark irregular streaks. There\nwas small amount of ocular discharge accumulated in the right eye corner, towards the skunk\u2019s nose. The skunk did\nappear to respond to visual stimuli. This skunk also had a distinct linear area of hair loss on the bridge of its nose\nextending into its white hair. The underlying skin was normal, giving this the appearance of a scar. The licensee stated it\nwas an older animal and that he had not noticed this issue prior to inspection today. He has not sought any treatment or\nveterinary care for this animal.\n- One individually housed striped skunk in enclosure labeled W12, had a sunken right eye. The licensee removed the\nskunk from the enclosure and upon further inspection the eye appears sunken with mild swelling present on its cheek.\nSunken eyes in skunks can indicate dehydration, disease, or injury. The licensee stated that he had not noticed this issue\nprior to inspection today and had not sought any treatment or veterinary care for this animal.\n- One white colored red fox has discharge weeping from its right eye. The eye appeared clear and normal. There was an\naccumulation of crusty red-brown debris extending approximately 1cm from the inside corner of the eye towards the nose\nof the fox. Ocular discharge can indicate an eye injury or disease. Many eye conditions are painful. The licensee stated\nthat this issue was not noticed prior to inspection today.\n- One arctic fox, singly housed in an enclosure lacking shelter towards the back of the property, has an eye discharge\naccumulated at the inside corners of both eyes. The eyes appeared clear and normal. There was an accumulation of\nbrown wet debris extending from the inside corners of the eyes approximately 1cm towards the nose of the fox. Ocular\ndischarge can indicate an eye injury or disease. The licensee stated that this issue was not noticed prior to inspection\ntoday.\nFailure to adequately observe animals daily, and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal animal health and behavior\nto the attending veterinarian in a timely manner, is not adequate veterinary care. Without adequate veterinary care, an\nanimal\u2019s condition may worsen, and if infectious, can spread to other individuals. Correct by ensuring that the animals\nand conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be properly examined,\ndiagnosed, and treated. Additionally, ensure that daily observation of animals is adequate to identify all signs of abnormal\nhealth and behavior. Ensure that there is accurate and timely communication of problems of animal health, behavior, and\nwell being conveyed to the attending veterinarian."

      "narrative": "This facility currently has no record of animals on hand. The records of animal acquisition and disposition are incomplete.\nThe licensee was unable to provide the exact number of animals on hand at the facility. He stated that he has a plan to\ncreate records of animals on hand but has not yet had time to do so. The facility is still not tracking offspring born at the\nfacility \u2013 there were several young mink and hedgehogs that appeared to have been born since the last inspection, but\nthere were no records of these births. The licensee acknowledged that records of animals, including deaths, have not\nbeen recorded. The licensee stated that two animals - one older skunk and one Arctic fox - had been found dead the\nweek prior, however, there are no records of these deaths. The licensee was able to produce records for four animal\nsales, which were sold on 9/24/22 and 9/26/22. These records included the sale of 1 raccoon, 7 ferret, 13 hedgehogs,\nand 1 alpaca. The records of disposition contained neither a USDA License number nor a driver\u2019s license number for the\nperson acquiring the animals.\nFailure to maintain disposition records, such as records of pre-weaning deaths, prevents the licensee, attending\nveterinarian, and APHIS officials from evaluating actual animal mortality at the facility. This information helps to\ndetermine the extent of the problem, possible causes, solutions, and/or Animal Welfare Act (AWA) compliance. Failure to\nmaintain complete and accurate records of acquisitions, dispositions, and animals on hand prevents the ability of APHIS\nofficials to accurately trace animal movement across the nation. In the event of a disease outbreak, it would be\nimpossible to determine the source and extent of contaminated animals and/or persons exposed. Correct by ensuring that\nthe facility maintains complete and accurate records of all animals on hand, all animal acquisitions (including the total\noffspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control) and animal dispositions (including those which\ndie, are euthanized, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of). These records must include all information required by\nthis section, must be maintained in an accurate and timely manner, and must be made available for inspection by APHIS\nofficials."

      "narrative": "Many enclosures are in need of repair:\n- Groundhogs continue to be housed in two enclosures which remain excessively rusty to the point that the structural\nsupports are breaking. These enclosures are both constructed of thick-gauge wire with approximately 2x4 inch spaces\nbetween the wire. They are slightly elevated above the ground. In each case there are areas of the wire that make up the\nenclosure floor that have rusted all the way though, leaving holes of 4x4 inches (or greater) with sharp points that could\ninjure the animals. Additionally, sides of the enclosure (made of metal with diamond shaped holes and approximately 2\ninch wide metal supports) have rusted so severely that the metal supports are nearly gone in some areas creating\nnumerous sharp edges that could injure the animals. The licensee stated he has prepared an alternate enclosure for\nthese animals, however, he had not moved them at the time of this inspection.\n- The red fox enclosure towards the back of the facility, which was previously identified as having wire flooring that was\nrusted excessively, continues to house red fox. This enclosure has a linear section of wire flooring where each wire is cut\nor broken resulting in a split in the wire that is approximately 2 feet long. This split is causing a large portion of the floor to\nbe unsupported and flexes when the fox walk near it, creating a larger opening with sharp points that protrude into the\nenclosure. Additionally, there are other areas of broken wires protruding up into the enclosure in front of the feeder where\nthe fox must stand to feed. The feeder itself is rusty and has corroded, creating more sharp points and edges. Sharp\npoints coming up from the floor pose an injury threat. The size of the opening created by the split floor may lead to an\nanimal escape. The licensee continues to house animals in this dangerous enclosure, disregarding their health and well-\nbeing.\n- The Sika deer enclosure continues to have large gaps along the bottom with broken and tangled wire. The licensee\nstated that his employees have begun repairing this enclosure by pounding several posts back into the ground, however,\nlarge sections of the fence continue to be loose, and the post in the back of the enclosure remains broken with the top\nportion hanging into the enclosure. Many areas of the fence are crumpled, some with repair attempts made, but remain\nloose, posing an injury threat to the deer as well as allowing access for other animals, like coyotes or dogs, to enter the\nenclosure.\n- One enclosure containing a female raccoon and her 3-legged offspring has broken wires with exposed sharp points in\nthe flooring. The juvenile raccoon (not yet separated from her mother) began bleeding after she was returned to the\nenclosure following examination. The broken wire on the floor probably contributes to the ongoing injury of the damaged\nlimb.\n- A raised wire enclosure containing a pair of red fox has an excessively rusted floor. There is a 4 inch section of broken\nwire which has rusted completely through, creating sharp points.\n- A raised wire enclosure containing a pair of red fox has rusted excessively. There are multiple areas on the wire floor\nthat have completely rusted through, creating breaks and sharp edges. One of these areas is a 4 x 2 inch hole with\nmultiple sharp points. This is large enough for a foot, leg, or other body part to become entrapped.\n- An enclosure containing a pair of raccoons has cuts or breaks in the wire floor creating multiple sharp points. The floor\nof the enclosure has two layers of wire from previous repairs. An approximately 15 inch break in the wire creates sharp\npoints, especially when the weight of the animals flexes the floor enlarging the opening. As a result, an animal\u2019s feet or\nlegs can become caught in the wire.\n-Approximately 50-60 percent of the mink and ferret enclosures have sharp points surrounding the opening between the\nnest box and the wire portion of their enclosures. The nest box hangs outside the enclosure and has a round hole\nallowing the animals access to the wire portion of the enclosure. A corresponding hole has been cut into the wire;\nhowever, the wires were cut leaving long sharp points that often protrude into the circular opening of the nest box. As a\nresult, the mink and ferrets are exposed to these sharp points, which are a concern every time they enter and leave the\nnest box.\n- Sharp points remain on multiple fox, skunk, mink, and ferret enclosures. Many areas of the wire floors have broken wires\nprotruding into the enclosures. Although the licensee has addressed several areas of sharp points documented on the last\ninspection report, numerous enclosures continue to have sharp points resulting from broken wires, holes, rusted feeders,\netc. In many enclosures, the areas with broken wires and sharp points are frequented by the animals, such as around\nshelter boxes, feeders, and water receptacles.\nSharp points, particularly those in areas that animals frequently contact, increase the risk of animal injury. Correct by\nensuring that all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to\nsafely contain the animals."

      "narrative": "Sixty-nine enclosures housing 94 animals do not have adequate shelter. The enclosures are constructed of\napproximately 1 inch square wire mesh with an ill-fitting (too small) piece of tin siding or wood placed on top. These\nenclosures are arranged in rows with 4-8 enclosures per row. The individual enclosures either have no side walls or have\na small piece of solid blue partition or perforated white plastic affixed to one wall, which the licensee reports is to function\nas a wind break. Twenty-four singly housed Arctic fox and 32 red fox (in 20 enclosures) have a piece of blue plastic\nboard material attached to the wire mesh between enclosures that share a common wall. This provides a partial partition.\nThirty red fox (in 17 enclosures) have a perforated piece of white plastic board material providing this partial partition.\nEight singly housed Arctic fox have no partitions other than the wire mesh. Nighttime temperatures locally have been in\nthe 30s and 40s and there have been significant winds recently. Inspectors noted that since the last inspection, multiple\nlarge tree limbs have fallen onto enclosures due to the intense gusts of wind. These animals do not have adequate\nprotection from inclement weather. Nor do they have visual barriers to avoid perceived threats, such as other fox housed\nin close proximity. Numerous Arctic fox were observed frozen in position, growling and/or attempting to climb the walls of\nthe enclosure to escape, as inspectors approached. This demonstrates their instinctual need to hide in the face of\nperceived danger. Adequate shelter from the elements (such as a hide box) allows animals to make normal behavioral\nadjustments for the species. Lacking this shelter leads to extreme stress and possible exposure injury, especially as\ntemperatures drop with winter coming. The animals suffer psychological and physical harm under these conditions.\nLicensee stated the plan is for the animals to remain in these enclosures for at least two more weeks.

      "narrative": "The majority of the animals on the property were found to be excessively thirsty during inspection because their water\ncontainers were dry. When offered water, most of them drank continuously for an excess of 3-5 minutes. The inspection\nprocess began at approximately 12 pm eastern time. The licensee stated he had last watered the animals the prior\nevening around 7 pm. At the start of the inspection, nearly 100% of the water receptacles for the three fox species,\nstriped skunk, coati, groundhog, mink, and ferrets were empty and dry. The licensee provided water to these animals\nthroughout the inspection. The majority drank for excessively long periods of time, indicating that water is still not being\nprovided as often as necessary for their health and comfort. Throughout the inspection, many of the fox and raccoon\nwere observed pawing at their empty water receptacles. As the licensee approached enclosures while watering them,\nfrequently the fox or raccoon in the next few enclosures were seen frantically digging at their dry water receptacles and\nthose further away were heard vocalizing anxiously. When the licensee finally added water to their enclosures, in each\ncase, the animals ceased those behaviors and immediately began drinking. As animals were watered, those housed in\ngroups were often pushing one another away, competing to access the water. In one case, two co-housed red fox were\nobserved snarling, snapping, and lunging at one another, fighting over the water. The larger male fox drank for\napproximately 2.5 minutes while intermittently guarding the water, preventing the female from accessing it. When the\nfemale fox was finally able to drink, she drank for another 2 minutes emptying the water container. The licensee was\nasked to provide additional water, and again, the female fox drank for a prolonged time (not less than another full minute).\nInspectors estimate that at least 80-90% of the listed species were observed drinking water excessively when it was\noffered. The two coati were observed drinking for more than a full minute. One stopped briefly when the licensee raised\nhis voice, but resumed again immediately when the licensee and inspectors were further away. Numerous fox, skunk,\nand raccoon drank for nearly 2 minutes continuously, or paused briefly when startled by a person\u2019s presence, only to\nreturn to drink again as soon as they felt comfortable doing so. Several fox and skunk drank for an excess of 3 minutes\nand some for more than 5 minutes. One groundhog was also observed drinking nearly continuously for an excess of 4\nminutes despite significant disturbances nearby. The licensee stated that he is now watering twice daily, however, if\nanimals had last been watered around 7 pm (as he stated) that would indicate at least 17 hours passed before the\nanimals were offered water again at the start of this inspection. The licensee repeatedly stated that many of the animals\nfrequently \u201cdig\u201d all the water out of their water receptacles, further stating that some animals \u201cjust drink more\u201d. The\neagerness and length of time spent consuming water when offered indicates that the animals are extremely thirsty, and\nthat the current schedule for watering is not sufficient to meet the animals\u2019 basic needs. The facility must provide water as\noften as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals."

  "narrative": "2.40(a)  Direct Repeat\n   \nAttending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors). \nThis facility no longer has an Attending Veterinarian (AV).  Licensee stated that he has contacted another veterinarian \nwho is willing to become the AV.  However, that veterinarian has not yet entered into a formal arrangement with a written \nprogram of veterinary care.  The licensee stated that the new veterinarian is not available to come to the facility until next \nweek (the week starting 10OCT2022).  When animals were identified in need of veterinary care, the licensee was urged to \ncontact a veterinarian (the future AV, the past AV, or another licensed veterinarian) to provide care.  The licensee told \nAnimal Care Inspectors the day following inspection, that the previous Attending Veterinarian informed the licensee that \nhe was no longer willing to see any of the animals at the property. \n \nEach licensee shall have an Attending Veterinarian who shall provide adequate veterinary care in compliance with the \nAnimal Welfare Act.  Failure to have an AV causes delays in care for treatment of sick, ill, and/or injured animals, and fails \nto prevent illness and injuries leading to unnecessary animal suffering.  Correct by employing a veterinarian \nknowledgeable and experienced with the species maintained by the licensee under formal arrangement in accordance \nwith 2.40(a)(1). \n2.40(b)(2)  Direct Repeat\n\nAttending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors). \nEleven animals (2 Mink, 5 Alpaca, 1 Raccoon, 2 Arctic fox, 1 Striped skunk) were found in need of veterinary care, \nresultant from the licensee\u2019s failure to maintain an adequate program of veterinary care.  This included: \n \n- Two singly housed mink had not received adequate veterinary care to treat wounds at the base of their tails.  For the \nwhite/light grey mink, the wound covered the majority of the tail base.  Hair was crusted and stuck down into the wound.  \nThe second mink , a grey colored mink (described by the licensee as a \u201csapphire\u201d) had a wound in a similar location.  It \nwas larger, an approximately 1.5cm irregularly shaped area that had dark red crusts (scabs of various sizes) in the wound \nand surrounding it.  The wound was seeping a clear reddish-yellow discharge.  In each case, the licensee stated that he \nhad seen these minks' injury a few days prior.  He suspected that they were caused by fighting between the mink (they \nwere previously housed in an enclosures with another mink).  He stated he separated the mink (moving the injured \nanimals to a different enclosure) but that he had not provided any care for the wounds, nor had he sought a veterinarian \nto examine the animals.  Failure to properly treat wounds can result in them becoming infected, leading to unnecessary \nsuffering. \n \n- Five Alpaca have not received adequate veterinary care to treat their matted hair, excess fiber, and poor body condition. \nThe alpaca are all group housed in one enclosure.  The black female alpaca has cords of matted fiber hanging off her in \nlong strings.  Despite the large amount of matted fiber, her spine is readily apparent even from a distance.   Individual \nvertebral bodies can be identified indicating that she is markedly underweight.  This alpaca is also nursing a young cria \nwhich adds additional metabolic demand for milk production.  The white adult alpaca has excessive fiber present.  There \nare long cords of matted fiber hanging from its body.  There is enough matted fiber present that inspectors were unable to \nvisually assess body condition.  The adult brown alpaca has excessive fiber present.  This alpaca had fiber that is dense\n\nand forms larger mats over its body (rather than hanging in cords), the fiber precludes assessing body condition.  The \nadult male alpaca has been shorn more recently, and is clearly excessively thin.  There is no fat visible on him.  His \npelvis, vertebrae, ribs and shoulder are all readily apparent.  Additionally, his nose and mouth appear to deviate to the \nright, off of midline.  This type of facial deviation can indicate dental problems, which often makes eating more difficult for \nthe affected animal. The licensee recently acquired this alpaca, approximately 3 weeks prior to inspection.  It has not \nbeen examined by a veterinarian, nor have the others, despite the poor body conditions, excessively matted coats, and \nfacial asymmetry.  These problems have been pointed out to the licensee on prior inspections.  Poor body condition can \nlead to gastrointestinal problems such as ulcer formation and unnecessary suffering, particularly in cold weather, which is \nrapidly approaching.  Winters are often severe in this region.  Of additional interest, matted fiber can be uncomfortable \nand prevents animals from properly thermoregulating. \n \n- One unweaned female raccoon is missing its left rear foot from the hock down.  The distal end of the stub is covered \nwith non-haired pink skin.  Two ulcerated areas are present on two sides of the stub.  As she was observed moving \naround, the stub began bleeding.  Licensee stated he was aware that this raccoon was missing a foot, and thought that it \nhad either been born that way, or had been injured by its mother.  The licensee has not sought veterinary care for her, to \ntreat this injury, nor ensure that appropriate housing is provided (such as a solid floor to prevent the stub from going \nthrough the wire mesh, which would prevent further injury).  This raccoon and her mother continue to be housed in a wire-\nbottom enclosure that has several sharp points in front of the nest box.  Failure to seek appropriate veterinary care for this \nanimal has resulted in delayed healing, continued re-injury, and unnecessary suffering. \n \n- One singly housed Arctic fox housed in an enclosure without shelter, remains excessively thin.  Its hips, pelvis, and ribs\n\nare more readily apparent than they should be, especially with the amount of winter fur present.  The licensee stated that \nthe fox has been dewormed, and he has increased its daily food ration, since this problem was identified during the last \ninspection.  However, the fox has not noticeably gained weight since that time.  The licensee stated that he has not \nsought veterinary care for this fox, and that he thought it was just old.  Poor body condition can result from illness, \ninadequate feed, or other medical causes, and requires an appropriate veterinary examination to determine the cause, \nproper treatment, and to prevent suffering. \n \n- One striped skunk and one Arctic fox had extremely long nails at the time of inspection.  The nails on both of these \nanimals were long enough to be pointing in abnormal directions and both had been identified to the licensee on the prior \ninspection report.  The licensee stated that he had not trimmed their nails yet, however, he trimmed both animal\u2019s nails \nduring the inspection.  Excessively long toenails can cause difficulty walking and may become caught in wire-bottom \nenclosures, causing injury. In addition to this skunk and fox, other animals (Arctic fox, red fox, and less severely impacted, \nskunk) have overgrown toenails that require trimming to ensure optimal health, safety, and comfort. \n \nFailure to provide veterinary care when needed can result in unnecessary suffering and potentially death of animals. \nLicensees must ensure that they establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care, including the use \nappropriate methods to prevent control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.  When animals are identified with \ninjuries or illness, they must seek care by their veterinarian to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by \nensuring that the animals listed above are examined and treated by a licensed veterinarian, also ensure all animals are \nprovided with adequate veterinary care. \n2.40(b)(3)  Direct Repeat\n   \nAttending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).\n\nEleven animals (5 mink, 4 striped skunk, 1 red fox, and 1 Arctic fox) were identified during the inspection that required \nveterinary care. These animals were not identified by the licensee prior to inspection. \n \n- One light grey-blue colored (described by the licensee as \u201csapphire\u201d) mink was observed with an open chest/neck \nwound. The wound was approximately 1 inch diameter and was located on the upper chest and lower neck of the animal. \nThe wound was open with bright red tissue visible in the center.  There was yellow, dried discharge caked around the \nwound stuck to and hanging from the surrounding fur.  The licensee stated that he had not noticed this lesion prior to \ninspectors bringing it to his attention.  He stated that it likely was a \u201cboil\u201d that had broken open, as sapphire mink \nfrequently get \u201cboils\u201d. Left untreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful. \n \n-One black, pair-housed mink was observed with an open neck wound. The wound was approximately 1X2 inches and \ncrusty with scabs and discharge. The hair in the affected area was wet and matted, trapping debris inside the wound. The \nlicensee stated that he had not observed this injury prior to this inspection, and that no treatment had been provided.  Left \nuntreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful. \n \n- One blue-grey colored mink (described by the licensee as \u201csapphire\u201d) was observed with an open wound on the tip of its \ntail. The wound was bright pink with dark red crusts and scabs around the edge.  There was hair loss around the wound, \nwith some extremely short hair, nearly even with the skin, surrounding the wound.  Bedding and other debris was dried to \nthe wounded tail tip. The licensee stated that sometimes mink chew on their tails, self-inflicting wounds consistent with \nthis one.  He stated that he had not noticed this wound prior to inspection, and had not provided any care for this animal.  \nLeft untreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful.  Extremely short hair can be a result of barbering,\n\nwhich is often an indicator of stress or pain. \n \n- One grey mink, housed in a pair, was observed with injuries to its nose and on both rear legs.  There was a line of blood \nor ulcerated tissue on the dorsal surface of its nose, where nose tissue meets the haired surface of its face.   The feet of \nthe animal were swollen, with a red discharge that appeared to be dried blood, on both hind feet.  It extended to the \nabdomen and tail, with red crusty material dried on those areas.  Additionally, there was similar discharge accumulated on \nthe wire floor of the enclosure. The licensee removed the animal from the enclosure for further inspection. When the \nanimal was placed back into its enclosure, it was observed to not be using its back legs properly. The animal appeared \nlame and would fall from side to side with its hips touching the wire floor as it tried to enter the hide box.  Leg and foot \ninjuries can be painful, particularly when housed on wire-flooring.  In the enclosure housing this animal, the food and \nwater present at the time of inspection can only be accessed when standing on the thin, bare, uncoated wire.  This can \neasily exacerbate foot wounds.  The only solid flooring is within the nest box. \n \n- One light colored mink  (white with a grey dorsal stripe and grey tips on its hair) was singly housed when inspectors \nidentified a horseshoe shaped wound at the base of its tail.  This wound was pink, open, oozing a yellow-red tinged fluid.  \nThe discharge crusted the surrounding fur, a wood chip was crusted and stuck to the edge of the wound.  Left untreated, \nopen wounds are painful and may lead to infection. \n \n- One individually housed striped skunk in an enclosure labeled R4 C1, was observed by inspectors holding its mouth \npartially open.  The licensee removed the skunk from the enclosure and upon further inspection the animal\u2019s top and \nbottom gums were swollen. The animal was missing multiple teeth.  Those that were visible appeared brown and caked\n\nwith hard mineral deposits, which obscured the view of the teeth themselves.  The skunk continued to hold its mouth \npartially open throughout the entire time it was being examined as though it was either unwilling or unable to completely \nclose its mouth.  Swollen gums and tooth loss indicates dental disease, which is often painful.  Additionally, this skunk had \nextremely long overgrown nails that could easily become entrapped in the wire enclosure floor. \n \n- One adult brown and white striped skunk housed in enclosure labeled W13, had bilateral eye discoloration. Licensee \nremoved the skunk from the enclosure for a close examination, revealing that both eyes appeared dry with a slightly \nirregular surface.  The surface of the eyes were a cloudy/milky white with a dried crusty discharge.  The discharge was \nworse in the right eye.  This skunk also had a brown-red crusty nasal discharge adhered to both nostrils. The licensee \nstated it was an older animal and that he had not noticed these issues prior to inspection today.  He had not sought any \ntreatment or veterinary care for this animal. \n \n- One adult striped skunk in enclosure labeled W16, also had bilateral eye discoloration. The licensee removed the skunk \nfrom the enclosure.  On close examination, the surface of both eyes appeared cloudy with dark irregular streaks. There \nwas small amount of ocular discharge accumulated in the right eye corner, towards the skunk\u2019s nose.  The skunk did \nappear to respond to visual stimuli.  This skunk also had a distinct linear area of hair loss on the bridge of its nose \nextending into its white hair.  The underlying skin was normal, giving this the appearance of a scar.  The licensee stated it \nwas an older animal and that he had not noticed this issue prior to inspection today.  He has not sought any treatment or \nveterinary care for this animal. \n \n- One individually housed striped skunk in enclosure labeled W12, had a sunken right eye. The licensee removed the\n\nskunk from the enclosure and upon further inspection the eye appears sunken with mild swelling present on its cheek.  \nSunken eyes in skunks can indicate dehydration, disease, or injury. The licensee stated that he had not noticed this issue \nprior to inspection today and had not sought any treatment or veterinary care for this animal. \n \n- One white colored red fox has discharge weeping from its right eye.  The eye appeared clear and normal.  There was an \naccumulation of crusty red-brown debris extending approximately 1cm from the inside corner of the eye towards the nose \nof the fox.  Ocular discharge can indicate an eye injury or disease.  Many eye conditions are painful. The licensee stated \nthat this issue was not noticed prior to inspection today. \n \n- One arctic fox, singly housed in an enclosure lacking shelter towards the back of the property, has an eye discharge \naccumulated at the inside corners of both eyes.  The eyes appeared clear and normal. There was an accumulation of \nbrown wet debris extending from the inside corners of the eyes approximately 1cm towards the nose of the fox. Ocular \ndischarge can indicate an eye injury or disease. The licensee stated that this issue was not noticed prior to inspection \ntoday. \n \nFailure to adequately observe animals daily, and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal animal health and behavior \nto the attending veterinarian in a timely manner, is not adequate veterinary care.  Without adequate veterinary care, an \nanimal\u2019s condition may worsen, and if infectious, can spread to other individuals.  Correct by ensuring that the animals \nand conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be properly examined, \ndiagnosed, and treated.  Additionally, ensure that daily observation of animals is adequate to identify all signs of abnormal\n\nhealth and behavior.  Ensure that there is accurate and timely communication of problems of animal health, behavior, and \nwell being conveyed to the attending veterinarian. \n2.75(b)(1)  Repeat\n   \nRecords: Dealers and exhibitors. \nThis facility currently has no record of animals on hand. The records of animal acquisition and disposition are incomplete. \nThe licensee was unable to provide the exact number of animals on hand at the facility. He stated that he has a plan to \ncreate records of animals on hand but has not yet had time to do so. The facility is still not tracking offspring born at the \nfacility \u2013 there were several young mink and hedgehogs that appeared to have been born since the last inspection, but \nthere were no records of these births.  The licensee acknowledged that records of animals, including deaths, have not \nbeen recorded. The licensee stated that two animals - one older skunk and one Arctic fox - had been found dead the \nweek prior, however, there are no records of these deaths.  The licensee was able to produce records for four animal \nsales, which were sold on 9/24/22 and 9/26/22.  These records included the sale of 1 raccoon, 7 ferret, 13 hedgehogs, \nand 1 alpaca. The records of disposition contained neither a USDA License number nor a driver\u2019s license number for the \nperson acquiring the animals. \n \nFailure to maintain disposition records, such as records of pre-weaning deaths, prevents the licensee, attending \nveterinarian, and APHIS officials from evaluating actual animal mortality at the facility.  This information helps to \ndetermine the extent of the problem, possible causes, solutions, and/or Animal Welfare Act (AWA) compliance. Failure to \nmaintain complete and accurate records of acquisitions, dispositions, and animals on hand prevents the ability of APHIS \nofficials to accurately trace animal movement across the nation.  In the event of a disease outbreak, it would be \nimpossible to determine the source and extent of contaminated animals and/or persons exposed. Correct by ensuring that \nthe facility maintains complete and accurate records of all animals on hand, all animal acquisitions (including the total\n\noffspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control) and animal dispositions (including those which \ndie, are euthanized, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of). These records must include all information required by \nthis section, must be maintained in an accurate and timely manner, and must be made available for inspection by APHIS \nofficials. \n3.125(a)  Direct Repeat\n   \nFacilities, general. \nMany enclosures are in need of repair: \n- Groundhogs continue to be housed in two enclosures which remain excessively rusty to the point that the structural \nsupports are breaking. These enclosures are both constructed of thick-gauge wire with approximately 2x4 inch spaces \nbetween the wire.  They are slightly elevated above the ground. In each case there are areas of the wire that make up the \nenclosure floor that have rusted all the way though, leaving holes of 4x4 inches (or greater) with sharp points that could \ninjure the animals. Additionally, sides of the enclosure (made of metal with diamond shaped holes and approximately 2 \ninch wide metal supports) have rusted so severely that the metal supports are nearly gone in some areas creating \nnumerous sharp edges that could injure the animals.  The licensee stated he has prepared an alternate enclosure for \nthese animals, however, he had not moved them at the time of this inspection. \n \n- The red fox enclosure towards the back of the facility, which was previously identified as having wire flooring that was \nrusted excessively, continues to house red fox.  This enclosure has a linear section of wire flooring where each wire is cut \nor broken resulting in a split in the wire that is approximately 2 feet long. This split is causing a large portion of the floor to \nbe unsupported and flexes when the fox walk near it, creating a larger opening with sharp points that protrude into the \nenclosure. Additionally, there are other areas of broken wires protruding up into the enclosure in front of the feeder where \nthe fox must stand to feed.  The feeder itself is rusty and has corroded, creating more sharp points and edges. Sharp\n\npoints coming up from the floor pose an injury threat. The size of the opening created by the split floor may lead to an \nanimal escape.  The licensee continues to house animals in this dangerous enclosure, disregarding their health and well-\nbeing. \n \n- The Sika deer enclosure continues to have large gaps along the bottom with broken and tangled wire. The licensee \nstated that his employees have begun repairing this enclosure by pounding several posts back into the ground, however, \nlarge sections of the fence continue to be loose, and the post in the back of the enclosure remains broken with the top \nportion hanging into the enclosure. Many areas of the fence are crumpled, some with repair attempts made, but remain \nloose, posing an injury threat to the deer as well as allowing access for other animals, like coyotes or dogs, to enter the \nenclosure. \n \n- One enclosure containing a female raccoon and her 3-legged offspring has broken wires with exposed sharp points in \nthe flooring.  The juvenile raccoon (not yet separated from her mother) began bleeding after she was returned to the \nenclosure following examination.  The broken wire on the floor probably contributes to the ongoing injury of the damaged \nlimb. \n \n- A raised wire enclosure containing a pair of red fox has an excessively rusted floor.  There is a 4 inch section of broken \nwire which has rusted completely through, creating sharp points. \n \n- A raised wire  enclosure containing a pair of red fox has rusted excessively. There are multiple areas on the wire floor \nthat have completely rusted through, creating breaks and sharp edges. One of these areas is a 4 x 2 inch hole with\n\nmultiple sharp points.  This is large enough for a foot, leg, or other body part to become entrapped. \n \n- An  enclosure containing a pair of raccoons has cuts or breaks in the wire floor creating multiple sharp points. The floor \nof the enclosure has two layers of wire from previous repairs. An approximately 15 inch break in the wire creates sharp \npoints, especially when the weight of the animals flexes the floor enlarging the opening.  As a result, an animal\u2019s feet or \nlegs can become caught in the wire. \n \n-Approximately 50-60 percent of the mink and ferret enclosures have sharp points surrounding the opening between the \nnest box and the wire portion of their enclosures.  The nest box hangs outside the enclosure and has a round hole \nallowing the animals access to the wire portion of the enclosure.  A corresponding hole has been cut into the wire; \nhowever, the wires were cut leaving long sharp points that often protrude into the circular opening of the nest box.  As a \nresult, the mink and ferrets are exposed to these sharp points, which are a concern every time they enter and leave the \nnest box. \n \n- Sharp points remain on multiple fox, skunk, mink, and ferret enclosures. Many areas of the wire floors have broken wires \nprotruding into the enclosures. Although the licensee has addressed several areas of sharp points documented on the last \ninspection report, numerous enclosures continue to have sharp points resulting from broken wires, holes, rusted feeders, \netc. In many enclosures, the areas with broken wires and sharp points are frequented by the animals, such as around \nshelter boxes, feeders, and water receptacles. \n \nSharp points, particularly those in areas that animals frequently contact, increase the risk of animal injury.  Correct by\n\nensuring that all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to \nsafely contain the animals. \n3.127(b)  Direct Repeat\n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nSixty-nine enclosures housing 94 animals do not have adequate shelter.  The enclosures are constructed of \napproximately 1 inch square wire mesh with an ill-fitting (too small) piece of tin siding or wood placed on top.  These \nenclosures are arranged in rows with 4-8 enclosures per row.  The individual enclosures either have no side walls or have \na small piece of solid blue partition or perforated white plastic affixed to one wall, which the licensee reports is to function \nas a wind break.   Twenty-four singly housed Arctic fox and 32 red fox (in 20 enclosures) have a piece of blue plastic \nboard material attached to the wire mesh between enclosures that share a common wall.  This provides a partial partition.  \nThirty red fox (in 17 enclosures) have a perforated piece of white plastic board material providing this partial partition.  \nEight singly housed Arctic fox have no partitions other than the wire mesh.  Nighttime temperatures locally have been in \nthe 30s and 40s and there have been significant winds recently.  Inspectors noted that since the last inspection, multiple \nlarge tree limbs have fallen onto enclosures due to the intense gusts of wind.  These animals do not have adequate \nprotection from inclement weather.  Nor do they have visual barriers to avoid perceived threats, such as other fox housed \nin close proximity.  Numerous Arctic fox were observed frozen in position, growling and/or attempting to climb the walls of \nthe enclosure to escape, as inspectors approached.  This demonstrates their instinctual need to hide in the face of \nperceived danger.  Adequate shelter from the elements (such as a hide box) allows animals to make normal behavioral \nadjustments for the species.  Lacking this shelter leads to extreme stress and possible exposure injury, especially as \ntemperatures drop with winter coming.  The animals suffer psychological and physical harm under these conditions.  \nLicensee stated the plan is for the animals to remain in these enclosures for at least two more weeks.  Correct by\n\nensuring that adequate shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned is provided for all \nanimals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort.  Remains Uncorrected. \n3.127(c)  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nThe areas surrounding the feeders, water receptacles, and entry gate of the Sika deer enclosure continue to have moist \ndirt.  The weather has been dry, with no rain or other precipitation in the region of this facility, since the prior inspection \n(conducted 9/22/22).  The degree of moisture still in these areas, combined with the lack of rain, indicates that drainage \nremains insufficient to rapidly eliminate excess water.  The licensee stated that he continues to be unable to move the \nfeeders to another portion of the enclosure since the male sika deer is in rut, preventing him from safely entering the \nenclosure. The licensee stated he does have a plan for putting gravel in this area to improve drainage and is just waiting \nfor delivery of the stone.  It is unknown when the stone will be delivered.  Standing in the mud can compromise the \nintegrity of the deer\u2019s feet, making them more prone to infection and abscess.  Correct by ensuring that a suitable method \nto rapidly eliminate excess water is provided. \n3.127(d)  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nThe facility continues to not have a perimeter fence.  Several species are maintained outside at the facility including:  \nArctic fox, bobcat, coati, fallow deer, ferret, grey fox, mink, red fox, sika deer, striped skunk, and wallaby.  An Administer \napproved variance has not been secured.  Animals and unauthorized persons have easy access to the animals, which \nmay result in harm to the animals such as undue stress, disease exposure, theft, injury, release, and/or death.  Outdoor \nhousing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized \npersons out and from them having contact with the animals in the facility.  Remains Uncorrected \n3.129(a)  Repeat\n\nFeeding. \nSeveral ferret, fox, mink, racoon, and skunk continue to have loose stool.  Stools accumulated underneath the enclosures \nof these animals range from soft to watery.  The licensee stated that he is feeding the same diet, however, inspectors \nhave noted that  the appearance of the dry food fed to these animals has varied from inspection to inspection over the last \nseveral weeks.  Although solid stool was noted in several enclosures, many animals continue to show signs of diarrhea.  \nDifferent feeds can vary widely in ingredients and nutritive content.  Changing feed often, abruptly, and/or rapidly often \ncauses digestive upset leading to diarrhea and poor health. \n \nOne Arctic fox and a white colored red fox remain underweight.  In each case the hips, ribs, vertebrae, and pelvis are all \nvisible despite a heavy hair coat.  Both of these animals continue to be fed the same mix of dry dog food as the other \nanimals.  The licensee stated that he is also feeding the Arctic fox raw meat, however, this fox does not appear to have \ngained any weight since the prior inspection.  Poor body condition can result from insufficient quantity or quality of feed or \nother medical conditions.  Given that many animals on the property have evidence of diarrhea, it is likely that the diet is \ncontributing to the poor body condition of these animals. \n \nAt least \u00bd of the alpaca remain underweight while the body condition of the others cannot be assessed at this time given \nthat they are too heavily matted. \n \nThe food shall be appropriate, wholesome, palatable, free from contamination, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive \nvalue to maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, \nsize, and type of the animal.  A licensed veterinarian with adequate knowledge of the species involved, must be contacted \nto assist in the development of feeding plans by providing guidance.  Remains Uncorrected\n\n3.129(b)  Repeat\n   \nFeeding. \nThe food receptacle design remains unchanged.  Food containers are entirely enclosed within an approximately 1 inch \nsquare wire mesh \"cage\" where they cannot be easily removed for cleaning and sanitization.  As a result, old food, dirt, \ngrime, and other organic debris collects and persists in and on some of the food containers. This exposes the animals to \nhealth hazards and disease risks.  Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times.  Correct by ensuring that \nadequate measures are taken to prevent molding, contamination, and deterioration or caking of food.  Remains \nUncorrected. \n3.130  Direct Repeat\n   \nWatering. \nThe majority of the animals on the property were found to be excessively thirsty during inspection because their water \ncontainers were dry.  When offered water, most of them drank continuously for an excess of 3-5 minutes.  The inspection \nprocess began at approximately 12 pm eastern time. The licensee stated he had last watered the animals the prior \nevening around 7 pm.  At the start of the inspection, nearly 100% of the water receptacles for the three fox species, \nstriped skunk, coati, groundhog, mink, and ferrets were empty and dry.  The licensee provided water to these animals \nthroughout the inspection.  The majority drank for excessively long periods of time, indicating that water is still not being \nprovided as often as necessary for their health and comfort.  Throughout the inspection, many of the fox and raccoon \nwere observed pawing at their empty water receptacles.  As the licensee approached enclosures while watering them, \nfrequently the fox or raccoon in the next few enclosures were seen frantically digging at their dry water receptacles and \nthose further away were heard vocalizing anxiously.  When the licensee finally added water to their enclosures, in each \ncase, the animals ceased those behaviors and immediately began drinking.  As animals were watered, those housed in \ngroups were often pushing one another away, competing to access the water.  In one case, two co-housed red fox were\n\nobserved snarling, snapping, and lunging at one another, fighting over the water.  The larger male fox drank for \napproximately 2.5 minutes while intermittently guarding the water, preventing the female from accessing it.  When the \nfemale fox was finally able to drink, she drank for another 2 minutes emptying the water container.  The licensee was \nasked to provide additional water, and again, the female fox drank for a prolonged time (not less than another full minute). \n \nInspectors estimate that at least 80-90% of the listed species were observed drinking water excessively when it was \noffered.  The two coati were observed drinking for more than a full minute.  One stopped briefly when the licensee raised \nhis voice, but resumed again immediately when the licensee and inspectors were further away.  Numerous fox, skunk, \nand raccoon drank for nearly 2 minutes continuously, or paused briefly when startled by a person\u2019s presence, only to \nreturn to drink again as soon as they felt comfortable doing so.  Several fox and skunk drank for an excess of 3 minutes \nand some for more than 5 minutes.  One groundhog was also observed drinking nearly continuously for an excess of 4 \nminutes despite significant disturbances nearby.  The licensee stated that he is now watering twice daily, however, if \nanimals had last been watered around 7 pm (as he stated) that would indicate at least 17 hours passed before the \nanimals were offered water again at the start of this inspection.  The licensee repeatedly stated that many of the animals \nfrequently \u201cdig\u201d all the water out of their water receptacles, further stating that some animals \u201cjust drink more\u201d.  The \neagerness and length of time spent consuming water when offered indicates that the animals are extremely thirsty, and \nthat the current schedule for watering is not sufficient to meet the animals\u2019 basic needs. The facility must provide water as \noften as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. \n3.131(a)  Repeat\n   \nSanitation. \nLarge accumulations of feces and fecal piles remain under some of the red fox, arctic fox, raccoon, mink, and skunk \nenclosures. The licensee has made progress cleaning underneath the free-standing enclosures however, several of the\n\nfox, skunk, and raccoon enclosures (particularly those towards the back of the facility) still have accumulations of feces \nthat are approximately a foot diameter and as much as 4-6 inches high.  While the hide box for most of these enclosures \nare wire-bottomed, those that have solid bottoms frequently have large accumulations of feces inside.  The licensee \nstated that the solid bottoms are provided when animals are whelping or nursing and later removed, but that he has not \nremoved all of these floors.  In several instances, the floor of the hide box was nearly 100% covered with dried feces. \n \nApproximately 95% of the mink, ferret, and skunk enclosures located in the mink barn have excessively large \naccumulations of feces, some of which are 4-6 inches high.  Several of the enclosures also have significant \naccumulations of soft stool within the enclosures.  Some enclosures had accumulated piles of feces within the enclosure \nthat were several inches both across and high.  Nearly all enclosures have feces, hair, urine and debris running along the \nsupport beams of the enclosure, and accumulations of soiled bedding between the nest box and wire enclosure.  There is \na significant build-up of brown organic debris on nearly all surfaces of these enclosures. \n \nThe groundhog enclosures that have hay or straw on their bottoms, continue to be heavily contaminated with feces, \ncausing the straw to form a solid mat in most areas.  The licensee stated that he has plans to move the groundhogs, but \nhas not done so yet. \n \nWhile the odor has improved overall, areas remain where there is still a strong odor in the air, consistent with \naccumulations of urine and feces (particularly in the mink/ferret barn and near the enclosures that remain uncleaned).  \nOdors of this strength are irritating, and potentially damaging, to the sensitive lining of the of the respiratory system.  \nFailure to clean excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary can lead to disease, disease transmission within\n\nthe facility, and contribute to odors.  Correct by ensuring that feces are removed from primary enclosures an as often as \nnecessary to prevent accumulation of excreta, contamination of animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors. \n3.131(c)  Repeat\n   \nSanitation. \nThe premises are in disarray.  Plants and grass in the back fallow deer enclosure and around the wallaby enclosure \ncontinue to be so high, the animals cannot be readily observed.  In many areas the weeds are greater than 2-feet tall.  In  \n2 out of the 3 connected fields which house the fallow deer, they are so high that fawns cannot be easily observed in \nthose paddocks.  Weeds that obscure the view of animals can lead to vulnerable young animals, sick, or injured animals \nbeing overlooked, delaying needed or life saving care. \n \nAccumulations of trash and junk, including empty cat food cans, wire fencing, and unused enclosures have collected in \npiles seemingly randomly, among and around the animal enclosures, including within the center isle of the mink/ferret \nbarn.  Rodent holes were seen in several places on the property including the mink/ferret barn.  These accumulations of \ntrash and unused equipment/enclosures provide housing and protection for pests and vermin, which may expose the \nregulated animals to disease hazards. \n \nCorrect by ensuring that premises are be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices.   \nAccumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.  \nRemains Uncorrected \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\n\nAdditional Inspectors: \nKERRY MCHENRY, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER \nMark Sanderbeck, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOR n",
