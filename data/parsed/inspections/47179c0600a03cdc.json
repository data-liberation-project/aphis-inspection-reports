The injured animal and its cage\nmate were similarly euthanized. The cause of the injuries was found to be due to improper cage manufacturing such that\nthere was a previously unobserved small gap between where the water bottle attaches to the cage and the cage wire,\nallowing animals\u2019 legs to get caught. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate\nfor the animals involved.
