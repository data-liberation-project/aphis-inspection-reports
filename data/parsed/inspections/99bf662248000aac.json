      "narrative": "During this inspection, it was observed that several animals are in need of immediate veterinary care.\n***A male Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that was irregular in shape, approximately 4\ninches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth was covered with flies.\nThe licensee was unable to provide documentation of a physical exam, diagnosis, or treatment plan provided by the\nattending veterinarian. The licensee periodically applies fly spray to the area.\n***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, had hair loss over the knuckles of all four feet. A facility representative stated\nthat he had noticed the hair loss, however the fox has not been evaluated by a veterinarian and is not receiving\ntreatment of any kind. The fox also had excessively long nails that needed to be trimmed.\n***A female Ibex, Pixie, was observed to have a patchy, dull haircoat. She appeared to be underweight, as\nevidenced by protruding hip bones and a prominent spine. The facility representative stated that she had always\nbeen like that. Pixie has not been examined by a veterinarian.\n***APHIS employees observed a large, golf ball sized mass on the abdominal region of a female coati named Tuffy.\nThe licensee stated that this was the first time that she had noticed the mass. In addition, the coati was repeatedly\nmoving in a fixed pattern of jumping from one platform to the next and then crawling on the roof of the enclosure\nback to the first platform. This behavior was not interrupted by the position or distance of the observers or when an\nattendant entered the enclosure. The coati has not received veterinary evaluation or treatment.\n*** A sheep with ear tag 00384 had excessively overgrown hooves on her hind feet and was in need of a hoof trim.\n***Three female adult pigs, housed in an indoor barn, are in need of hoof trims. The hooves on the animals were\nexcessively long, extending out approximately four to five inches. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can\ncause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility\u2019s programs of preventative\nveterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.\n***An adult black and white female sheep was observed by APHIS employees to be standing with her head down,\nneck extended and breathing heavily. She had discharge coming from her nose that had dripped onto her front leg.\nHer abdomen was extremely distended and her back was hunched up. When the APHIS inspector pointed this out\nto the licensee, she stated that when she walked up to the enclosure she had noticed the hump on the sheep\u2019s back\nand felt she should call the veterinarian. The sheep has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.\n***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS\ninspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing. The facility\nrepresentative provided documentation showing that the veterinarian had examined and treated the goat on March\n9, 2017. The licensee stated that the veterinarian had rechecked the goat on March 16, 2017, however did not have\nany documentation regarding that visit. A facility representative stated that he had been injecting the goat with pain\nmedication provided by the veterinarian. The licensee confirmed that pain medication he had been injecting the goat\nwith was an oral medication prescribed for a coati and was not intended to be used on the goat. The veterinarian\nhas not examined this goat since March 2017.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals\nat the facility.\nThe animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plans for the problems cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the\ninspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests, and the\noutcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing\ninstructions and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is\nadministered to the animal.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and\nthe need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate\nveterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for\nproviding adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted on May 23, 2017. This report is limited to direct noncompliant items\nidentified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items will follow.\nBoth the inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative on May 23, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nTheodorson Elizabeth, Director\nBolinger Jean, Compliance Specialist\nTims Tanya, Assistant Director"
