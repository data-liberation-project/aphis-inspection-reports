In protocol VETY2803, section III B indicates that 48 animals will be needed for\nthe semester, while section IV A indicates 32 will be used for the study. In protocol VETY3844, section III B indicates 56\nanimals will be needed for the semester, while section IV A indicates 22 will be used.\no Further confusion arises from the fact that for both these protocols, in section III B, the calculation done using the\njustification provided does not result in the total number identified in the protocol. For example, protocol 2803, with 3 to 4\nanimals per session and 7 weeks per semester, 21 to 28 animals should be needed. However, the protocol in that\nsection, indicates that 48 animals will be needed for the semester.\no Both these protocols, as well as protocol 2824, do not separate the rationale for the number of animals per species\nand do not provide a rationale for the number of animals needed per session.\nWith so much confusion in the protocols surrounding the rationale for the number of animals, the IACUC cannot\ndetermine if too many or not enough animals are being used in order to optimize animal health and comfort.\n- Protocols VETY 2854 and VETY 2873 do not provide a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. Only a\nshort, concise general goal is provided but not a complete description of animal use.\no In protocol VETY2854, the abstract section mentions doing vaccinations while section V indicates that no\nimmunizations will be done. The principal investigator (PI) explained that horses will be vaccinated for routine diseases\nbut that is not described in the protocol. Further confusion arises from this protocol in section VI where information is\nprovided, such as the anesthesia regimen, for non-study related procedures while section V indicates no surgical\nprocedures will be done for this study. The PI explained surgical procedures are not a regular part of the study but only\ndone when medically needed.\no Protocol VETY 2873, indicates that no pharmacologic materials will be used. Yet the PI explained that some animals\nwill be sedated while others will be under general anesthesia for this study but this is not described in the protocol.\n- Protocol VETY 3924 does not provide the method of euthanasia to be used if necessary.\nWithout the required information regarding animal usage, the IACUC cannot assess how the animals will be used and\ncared for and therefore cannot make an informed decision in approving the protocols. The facility was cited during the last\ninspection for protocols missing the same information. Some of the protocols were amended but, much of the information\nis still missing. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure protocols are complete and contain all of the required\ninformation before approval.
