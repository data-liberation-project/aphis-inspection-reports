The veterinarian did not want to expose this\ncamel to additional stress that might exacerbate its condition. Mr. Evola did take the camel to the festival despite\nthe attending veterinarian\u2019s recommendation. In a conversation with APHIS inspectors on September 8, 2016, Mr.\nEvola stated that he only used Romeo for giving rides to small children. Mr. Evola did not follow the advice of his\nattending veterinarian. The lack of authority of the attending veterinarian for the facility puts all the animals at this\nfacility at risk. Mr. Evola must follow the guidance and recommendations\u2019 of his attending veterinarian. This is\nespecially a concern in the case of Romeo, a camel in an extremely poor condition. Using this camel for rides\ndespite the recommendation of the veterinarian put the health of the camel at risk and could adversely affect the\ncamel\u2019s recovery."
