According to medical records and conversations\nwith staff and the Attending Veterinarian and clinical veterinarian, the rooster died as a result of drowning in the pool. Prior\nto its death, the animal had been housed for approximately 3 weeks with another chicken in an enclosure adjacent to the\n\u201cDuckling Pen\u201d. On the day of its death, the rooster (who was not flight restricted) flew over an approximately 3-foot tall\nbaby gate into an adjacent enclosure (the \u201cduckling pen\u201d) which contained a pool of water used for ducklings. The pool of\nwater was square, approximately 4 feet wide by 4 foot long, and the sides of the pool were steep and smooth. The depth\nof the pool in the center was approximately 3 feet deep. Facility staff believe that the rooster fell into the pool and couldn't\nget out. The facility has since covered the pool so it is no longer accessible to birds in the enclosure.\n***Disposition records show that two North American ruddy ducks \u201cdisappeared\u201d, and facility staff and the Attending\nVeterinarian stated that the animals were lost to predation, most likely racoons. The facility searched for the birds\nthoroughly for multiple days, and officially documented the disappearances on October 31st and October 23rd, 2023 in\nfacility records. The birds had been living in the \u201cTeton Marsh Exhibit\u201d, which contains a pond and natural marshy areas,\nand also houses a variety of waterfowl. The back walls of the enclosure are six-foot-tall chain link, and the front of the\nenclosure is an elevated public walkway bordered by an approximately 4-foot tall wire and wooden fence. The birds were\nflight restricted (pinioned). The facility has a predator control program in place and has undertaken measures to prevent\nadditional predation near this exhibit.\nBirds that are not protected from hazards or predation may suffer from stress, injury, or death.\nCorrect by ensuring that bird enclosures are maintained in good repair, protect the birds from injury, contain the birds, and\nrestrict other animals from entering who may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within.
