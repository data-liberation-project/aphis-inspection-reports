      "narrative": "One 12-year-old male Miniature Poodle (#23, known as 'Bobo') was observed shaking its head, and dark drown\nstains were visualized on the hair beneath his mouth. Upon closer review, the dog's left ear contained dark brown,\ndry debris, and its teeth were observed to have thick buildup of brown material that encased multiple teeth and that\nobstructed the view of the normal shapes of the teeth. A greyish-colored discharge was observed alongside the\ngum line. The gum line had a dark pink appearance in some areas. Upon inquiring with the attending veterinarian,\nthe attending veterinarian conveyed that the licensee had not called for guidance to treat the animal, and the\nattending veterinarian also conveyed not ever having seen the animal although it was procured several months ago.\nLicensees are required to use appropriate methods, within the attending veterinarian's authority, to control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases. Thick buildup of material on teeth and of discharge at the gum line can cause pain,\ncan decrease appetite, and can cause a deterioration of systemic health. Head shaking can be indicative of ear\npain, and the buildup of ear debris can damage ear health.\nThe licensee must have Dog #23 'Bobo' evaluated by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan.\nCorrect by March 25, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
