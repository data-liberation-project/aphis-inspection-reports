These rabbits are exhibited outdoors during the warm months of the year. Euthanasia is defined by the Animal\nWelfare Act as \u201cthe humane destruction of an animal accomplished by a method that produces rapid unconsciousness\nand subsequent death without the evidence of pain or distress, or a method that utilizes anesthesia produced by an agent\nthat causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death\u201d.\nThe Program of Veterinary Care states euthanasia can be carried out by the veterinarian or the licensee by gunshot or\nlethal injection but does not provide any further guidance. When speaking to the Attending Veterinarian, gunshot should\nonly be done by the park rangers and only to the bison or coyote in an emergency or any other animal that escapes and\nposes a risk to public safety. When reading through animal records, the inspector found a note under the bald eagle\u2019s\nrecord stating that \u201ctwo rabbits were shot and fed to the bald eagle because only 2 rabbits were wanted for the winter.\u201d\nWhen the inspector interviewed the facility representative that performed this euthanasia, the gunshot (.22 caliber rifle) to\nthe head did render the rabbits unconscious immediately. The attending veterinarian did not know that this euthanasia\ntook place, and it was not an approved method of euthanasia for rabbits. Euthanasia shall be overseen by the attending\nveterinarian to provide adequate guidance to personnel involved to reduce the pain and suffering of the animals cared for.\nWhen talking to a facility representative, he stated that the facility fed a live adult rabbit to the bald eagle sometime during\nthe summer months of 2021. This took place because the eagle was evaluated by a veterinarian and the facility was\ninstructed to provide more calories and calcium to the eagle. This event did not result in rapid unconsciousness and\nsubsequent death with evidence of pain or distress.\nThe facility must use euthanasia guidelines provided by the attending veterinarian and make sure that method complies\nwith the Animal Welfare Act.\nTo be corrected by: From this day forward."
