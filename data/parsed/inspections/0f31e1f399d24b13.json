      "narrative": "***An approximately 15 year-old female reindeer (named Striker), housed outdoors with 3 other reindeer, was noted\nto be lame on the front left leg at the time of inspection. The owner stated to the APHIS VMO that the animal has\nhad a history of lameness, was eating normally and appeared in healthy body condition. At the time of inspection,\nthe animal had not been evaluated by a veterinarian. The owner and the APHIS VMO both noted that the animal\nwas in need of hoof care, as the claws on the hooves were so long that they are crossing.\nThe owner stated to the APHIS VMO that the attending veterinarian (AV) would be at the facility on 8/13/14 to\nevaluate other non-regulated animals, and the owner would have the AV evaluate the lame reindeer as well. The\nowner also stated that the hooves on all animals are scheduled to be trimmed within the next 2 weeks.\nLameness can be an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes including both\ninfectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment\ncan result in delays of appropriate care and prolonged suffering of the animal. Each exhibitor shall establish and\nmaintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nThis animal must be seen and evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, with a written diagnosis/assessment, treatment,\nand follow-up plans, no later than 5:00pm on 8/15/14.\nInspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner."
