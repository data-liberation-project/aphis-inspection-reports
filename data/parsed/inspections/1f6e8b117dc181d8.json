      "narrative": "The following dogs are in need of veterinarian care.\n* One adult male Sheba (microchip number 448 793 780 ) has a swollen mass of tissue between the middle toes\non the right rear foot. The dog was unable to place any weight on this foot during the facility inspection. The\nswollen area had a puffy feel when touched. Swollen tissue can be painful and could potentially affect the mobility\nand daily activity of this dog.\n*******************************\n* One adult female Labrador Retriever (microchip number 079 275 569 ) has a swollen mass of tissue between\nthe middle toes on the right front and rear feet. Both feet had a puffy feel when touched. The skin had a reddish\nlooking color to it. Swollen tissue can be painful and could potentially affect the mobility and daily activity of this\ndog.\n* One adult female Elkhound (microchip number 048 306 812) has a swollen mass of tissue between the middle\ntoes on the right rear foot. The foot had a puffy feel when touched. The skin had a reddish looking color to it.\nSwollen tissue can be painful and could potentially affect the mobility and daily activity of this dog.\n****************************************************\n* One adult female Siberian Husky ( microchip number 070 805 383 ) was observed limping and placing little\nweight on the left front leg. The dog was observed holding the foot up an estimated 50 to 60 percent of a two to\nthree minute period. The licensee stated that this was the first time the limp had been noticed. At the time of\ninspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted. Foot problems can be painful when the dog has to\nplace weight on the foot affecting the mobility and daily activity of the dog.\n*******************************\n* One adult female German Shepard ( microchip number 033 264 621 ) has an open wound on the top of its left\near. The wound was moist, reddened and inflamed and covered approximately one third of the surface area of the\near. In addition, there was a yellowish, creamy looking discharge around the edge of the wound. The licensee has\npermission to treat wounds with antibiotics from the attending veterinarian and is doing so. There was a large,\ncrusty scab on the ear before the licensee restrained the dog for inspection. The licensee per their attending\nveterinarian recommendation is treating the wound with antibiotic ointment. The licensee stated that the wound first\nappeared on 9/1/14. The dog had not been examined by a licensed veterinarian at the time of inspection and the\nwound is still open, moist and inflamed. An open wound can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the\nspread of infection which affects the health and well-being of the dog.\nThe licensee must have all five dogs examined by a licensed veterinarian by 9/11/14 in order to ensure that an\naccurate diagnosis and treatment of the foot is provided. Any medical records must be made available to the\ninspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care to ensure the\nhealth and well-being of the dogs.\n***************************\n* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There was one 250 mg bottle of\nChloramphenicol pills with an expiration date of 12/1012. There was one 250 mg bottle of Amoxicillin pills with an\nexpiration date of 05/2014. These medications were intermingled with other products that are currently being used\nat the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not\nconsidered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The\neffectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be drastically\nchanged or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that all medications used have not gone past\nthe recorded expiration date."
