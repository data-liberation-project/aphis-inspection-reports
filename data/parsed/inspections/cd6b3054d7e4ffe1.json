The temperature was 92 degrees F behind the shelter and it was 102 degrees F in the other areas\nof the enclosure using the raytek minitemp gun. The rabbits were breathing heavily and they were all trying to get\nbehind the shelter from the direct sun which was not sufficient for all of the rabbits to stay cool. When sunlight is\nlikely to cause overheating and discomfort, sufficient shade shall be provided to allow all rabbits kept outdoors to\nprotect themselves from the direct rays of the sun. The atmospheric temperature must not exceed 90 degrees F.\nThere needs to be another means of artificial cooling in place to alleviate overheating and discomfort for the rabbits.\nThis was corrected by removing the rabbits before the exit briefing.\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the program manager."
