There was a car in the driveway, however no one would\ncome to the door. The house phone is disconnected and the cell phone would not take messages. I stayed in the\ndriveway for 30 minutes, honking the horn every 5 minutes with no response. The licensee has never made any\nattempts to call or contact this inspector in regards to the previous messages left on his phone, or to the personal\ncontact made with his son, or by the multiple attempted inspection reports he has been sent with my contact\ninformation. This licensee continues to purposefully avoid inspections by refusing to communicate with the inspector\nor for anyone to answer the door when they are home.\nPlease contact this inspector at 618-315-3649 ASAP in order to sort out optimal times for inspection."
