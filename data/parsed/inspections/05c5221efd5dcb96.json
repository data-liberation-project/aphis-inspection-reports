      "narrative": "During this inspection, it was observed that several animals are in need of immediate veterinary care.\n***A male Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that was irregular in shape, approximately 4\ninches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth was covered with flies.\nThe licensee was still unable to provide documentation of a physical exam, diagnosis, or treatment plan provided by\nthe attending veterinarian. The licensee periodically applies fly spray to the area.\n***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, has cloudy yellow liquid draining from her left year and it is drying up and\ncovering her inner ear. A facility representative stated that she has called and emailed (this email was shown to the\nVMO) her veterinarian about the ear discharge that she noticed 5 days ago. During the inspection, the facility\nrepresentative was able to make an appointment with her veterinarian for August 21, 2017. The fox still has hair\nloss over the knuckles of all four feet and has excessively long nails that need to be trimmed.\n***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS\ninspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing. The facility\nrepresentative provided documentation showing that the veterinarian had examined and treated the goat on March\n9, 2017. The licensee stated that the veterinarian had rechecked the goat on March 16, 2017, however did not have\nany documentation regarding that visit. The goat is still not weight-bearing during the inspection conducted today on\nAugust 8, 2017. The goat was rechecked on May 27, 2017 by the veterinarian and it was his recommendation that\n1) more diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2) if the facility\nrepresentatives do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the animal. The\nveterinarian stated in his report that the animal did not appear to be in pain and the NAIDS used previously provided\nno improvement.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals\nat the facility.\nThe animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plans for the problems cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the\ninspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests, and the\noutcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate\nveterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for\nproviding adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries. The licensee is required to follow the guidance of their attending veterinarian.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted on August 17, 2017. This report is limited to the direct non-compliant\nitems identified on the inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect non-compliant items and one\ncritical non-compliant item will follow.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives on August 17, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHammel Kurt, Veterinary Medical Officer"
