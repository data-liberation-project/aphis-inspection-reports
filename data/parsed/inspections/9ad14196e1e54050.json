Both tips felt thickened and the dog pulled away when a close up examination was\nattempted. One black and white female husky with USDA Tag # 39 had a 1 cm wound on the back of her left ear.\nThe wound was covered in dried blood and the area appeared thickened. The licensee had already conducted his\ndaily observations for the day and was not currently treating either dog for the condition.\nUntreated wounds can be a source of pain and discomfort for the dogs and a treatable condition left untreated can\nbecome infected and cause a serious health issue. The licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nThe licensee has an appointment with his AV for 7/10/2019."
