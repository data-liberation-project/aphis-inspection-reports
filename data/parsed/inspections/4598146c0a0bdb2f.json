The 2nd barrier fence is a 2 rail pipe fence and is 4 feet from the enlcosures. There is\nconcern that small children can pass under the rail of the pipe fence and come within 2 feet of the primary\nenclosures. The public has been observed allowing children to sit on the top board of the first barrier fence which is\nclose enough to allow contact with the animals. There must be sufficient distance and barriers between the animals\nand the viewing public to assure the safety of the animals and the public. The barrier fence must be corrected to\nprevent public contact with the animals.\nCORRECT BY : 1/1/16\nThe inspection was conducted with the Wildlife Exhibits Coordinator. The exit briefing was conducted with Wildlife\nExhibits Coordinator and the Program Manager."
