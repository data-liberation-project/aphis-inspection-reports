      "narrative": "* One orange and white adult female hamster had dried matter covering its face. In addition, this hamster was\nobserved limping and placing limited weight on its right front leg when trying to walk. Once the licensee had\nremoved the dried matter from the hamster\u2019s face, a cloudy left eye was revealed. Also revealed were skin lesions,\nthe largest being about \u00bc inch located under the left eye exposing moist pink tissue. After the hamster had been\ncleaned, the limping was not observed.\nThe licensee stated that they first noticed the limping and face condition at the time of inspection and the attending\nveterinarian had not been consulted prior to the time of inspection. The attending veterinarian sent treatment\ninstructions to the licensee for this animal after the inspector had left at the conclusion of the inspection.\nFailure to observe and communicate medical concerns to the attending veterinarian has resulted in this hamster not\nreceiving care for a condition that resulted in painful/altered mobility and skin lesions. Inadequate daily observation\nof medical concerns, whether they appears mild or serious, can lead to failure to seek professional veterinary care\nin a timely manner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the animal's condition.\nThe licensee must observe all animals daily to assess their health and well-being. Daily observation of the animals\nmay be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided that a mechanism of direct and\nfrequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and\nwell-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct by 1/4/20.\n* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 1/2/20 and the exit briefing done on 1/3/20 were\nconducted with the licensee."
