      "narrative": "On 3/8/19, a rabbit was placed in a restraint device on top of a counter prior to the induction of anesthesia. During\ninduction, the rabbit escaped from the restraint device onto the counter and ended up in the sink that was set into\nthe counter. Research staff re-restrained the rabbit and proceeded with induction of anesthesia. During anesthetic\nrecovery, the animal vocalized and attempted to right itself from recumbency. Veterinary staff was immediately\ncontacted to assess the animal. On examination, a spinal fracture was identified and the animal was humanely\neuthanized. Veterinary staff determined that the fracture occurred between pre-anesthetic assessment of the animal\nand its recovery from anesthesia. Inspection of the restraint device by facility personnel revealed a damaged latch\nthat prevented secure closure of the device. The damaged restraint device did not allow for safe handling of the\nanimal. Per this section of the regulations, handling shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not\ncause trauma or physical harm.\nThis item has been corrected, as the facility has inspected all restraint devices and replaced them as necessary.\nThis event was self-reported to the USDA.\nThis inspection was conducted from 4/8/19 - 4/9/19. This exit briefing was conducted on site with facility personnel\non 4/9/19.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGladue Paula, Veterinary Medical Officer"
