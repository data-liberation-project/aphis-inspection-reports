Blood was collected for laboratory tests. Over the\nnext 4 days conservative measures and prophylactic treatment was administered. The macaque\u2019s condition\nworsened and the facility made the decision to euthanize the animal on Dec 14, 2015. The necropsy report\nindicated that a piece of sterile gauze had been left in the abdomen during surgery causing adhesions and intestinal\nobstruction. Failure to remove all surgical gauze resulted in illness and euthanasia of the macaque.\nAppropriate corrective measures were instituted including the use of radio-opaque gauze and requiring a systematic\ncheck to account for surgical sponges. The noncompliant item has been corrected.\nExit interview conducted with the Chief Compliance Officer and facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMcfadden Gloria, Veterinary Medical Officer"
