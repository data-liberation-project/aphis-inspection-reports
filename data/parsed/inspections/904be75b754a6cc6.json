      "narrative": "Two pigs were observed to be lame and facility staff had not identified the lameness issues as of approximately\n14:00 hours the afternoon of the inspection. One of the pigs appeared to be moderately lame on the right front leg.\nThe second pig was severely lame and was not bearing weight on the left front leg. A number of what appeared to\nbe shallow bite wounds were present on the sides of the second pig. The animals were being housed in a group of\napproximately 40 pigs. While the pigs had sufficient room to make normal postural adjustments, the density of the\nanimals made the observation of individual animals difficult.\nDaily observations of all animals to assess their well-being and direct and frequent communication with the\nattending veterinarian regarding observed health issues are necessary to ensure that the animals at the facility\nreceive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensure that all animals are observed\ndaily and the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary.\nCorrect by February 25, 2015.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative."
