The baboon was observed shifting weight between the\nright and left feet and lifting the left foot. Upon review of study observation records, the laboratory staff observed bilateral\npressure ulcers on the feet on December 5th and applied Bacitracin.\nThe laboratory staff did not inform the RAR veterinary staff about the bilateral ischial pressure abrasion until the\nscheduled weekly rounds on Wednesday December 7th. After rounds with the laboratory members, a RAR veterinarian\nobserved the baboon and noted ulceration on both hind feet. The laboratory staff had started a treatment plan of\nBacitracin and pain medication on December 5th. The treatment plan was reviewed by the RAR veterinary staff on\nDecember 7th.\nDaily observations may be done by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided there is a mechanism for\ndirect and frequent communication on problems of animal health and behavior. The mechanism for reporting daily\nobservations must ensure direct and frequent communication with the Attending Veterinarian to allow for a timely and\naccurate diagnosis and treatment of health issues.\nCorrected during the time of inspection."
