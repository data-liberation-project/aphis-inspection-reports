When the enclosure was first\napproached, inspectors noticed this dog was quietly curled up in the corner while the other dogs housed with him\nbarked and ran around. The dog was reluctant to have his mouth handled and initially pulled his head away. There\nare open holes in the upper gums where the canine teeth used to be. In addition, the lower jaw bone felt \"soft\" and\ncould be moved side to side gently and slightly. Holes anywhere in the upper gums/mouth area have the potential to\nlead directly to the nasal canal which could allow food and water to be inhaled. A soft, mobile lower jaw can indicate\nbone loss from problems such as dental disease, metabolic diseases, or trauma and can be painful. Pain could be\nthe reason that this dog pulled his head away when initially examined. The animal listed above must be examined\nby a licensed veterinarian by close of business on 9 December 2017 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is\nobtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,\ntreatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\nThis correction date was given to the licensee verbally at the time of the inspection."
