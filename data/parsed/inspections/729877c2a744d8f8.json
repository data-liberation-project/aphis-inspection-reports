The facility representative explained\nthat the animal care staff had not been trained to transfer animals of this age to new caging in order to sanitize the\nprimary enclosure. Indoor primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and cleaned as often\nas necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, or disease hazard using one of the\nmethods prescribed in the Animal Welfare Act.\nThis was corrected within 24 hours of discovery from the IACUC facility semiannual inspection.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCooper Natalie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
