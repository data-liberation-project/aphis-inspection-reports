The facility refused to allow APHIS inspectors to conduct the Animal Welfare Inspection.\nWhen the inspectors arrived at 12:10 PM, the entrance to the facility was closed by a locked gate and no entry was\nmade onto the property. A telephone call was made and the licensee returned our call at 12:20 PM, and spoke to\nMegan Adams, ACI. The licensee stated to Inspector Adams that she could do the animal welfare inspection, but\nDr. Brandes was not allowed on the property. She also informed Inspector Adams that she would call the police\nand have trespass charged filed against Dr. Brandes.\nYou may not refuse any APHIS officials to enter your place of business and inspect the facilities, property and\nanimals as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the regulations and standards of the Animal Welfare\nact. Refusal to allow inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act.\nAdditional Inspectors\nAdams Megan, Animal Care Inspector"
