There are at least 2 support poles for\nchain link fences for 3 enclosures that have rusted and have broken in half. These support poles are located\nbetween enclosures housing a total of 3 adult dogs. One of the rusted and broken support poles is at the bottom of\nthe fence line separating 2 adult dogs, one male Golden Retriever and one female Golden Retriever. The chain link\nfence has also become detached from the support pole in this location leaving a large gap between the fence and\nsupport pole separating the two enclosures. This gap was large enough that the adult male dog was observed\npushing on the fence and sticking his head through this broken area of the fence and into the enclosure housing the\nfemale dog next to his enclosure. The licensee must ensure that the interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in\ncontact with the dogs is free of excessive rust that affects the structural strength of the surface or that prevents the\nrequired cleaning and sanitization of the surface. To be corrected by: April 10, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
