This is a\npotentially dangerous situation as a camel can inflict a very nasty bite if given the opportunity. A fence at least 3\nfeet in distance from the outside of the camel enclosure must be constructed to prevent physical contact between\nanimals inside the enclosure and people on the outside of the enclosure. This fence must be constructed so that it\nprotects the animals in the facility by preventing unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having\ncontact with the animals in the facility. To be corrected by: February 10, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives."
