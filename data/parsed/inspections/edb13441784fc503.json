The horizontal\ntension wire has broken due to rusting in several places such that it is no longer anchored to the fence posts. Some\nfence posts have large rust holes that weaken them. Some trees within the enclosures have grown to the tops of the\nkick-in fencing. The rust damage to the fencing has weakened the structural integrity of the enclosures. The tree\novergrowth provides a possible route for animal escape. These fencing must be repaired or replaced to restore\nstructural strength and prevent injury or escape of the animals. The trees must be trimmed and maintained so that\nthey do not grow near the fence.
