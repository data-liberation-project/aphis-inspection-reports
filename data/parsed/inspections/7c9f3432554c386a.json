      "narrative": "During a multi-day cross country transport trip from Seattle, Washington to Fredricksburg, Maryland one dog did not\nreceive veterinary care in a timely manner after being observed becoming ill. Two dogs were picked up from the same\nconsignor on the morning of August 29, 2022 in Seattle, Washington. Four other dogs from other consignors were also\npresent on this transport. The six year old male retriever picked up in Seattle did not eat on the evening of the first day or\nat any time on the second day. The driver stated that he did drink water on both days. On the morning of day three the\ndriver observed that the dog was stumbling and shaking when he walked. Instead of contacting a veterinarian, the driver\ncontacted the consignor via text and phone message asking the consignor if she wanted the driver to take him to a vet\nand telling her that they were about 8.5 hours from the consignee\u2019s address. The inspector was told that due to time zone\ndifferences no answer was obtained for a few hours. When the consignor and the driver did speak by phone several hours\nafter the observation of the dog\u2019s abnormal behavior, the consignor asked the driver to offer dog canned food and then a\nbit later a hamburger to see if the dog would eat. While purchasing the canned food, the driver asked the pet store\nemployee for a recommendation and purchased and used their recommendation of a \u2018gastrointestinal synbiotic\u2019 gel\nproduct. The dog did not eat the new foods and during the delivery of another dog in Maryland, the driver noticed that the\nretriever started panting and breathing heavily. The driver called the consignor back and stated that she was taking the\ndog to a vet and the consignor agreed. After a few attempts, a clinic in Maryland was found that agreed to see the dog.\nThe driver stated that the retriever was noted to have a seizure on the way to the vet clinic. The dog was seriously ill upon\narrival at the vet clinic and was treated for three weeks with intensive care before being released for additional at home\ntreatment for secondary complications which are ongoing. The second dog did eat and drink during the transport and did\nnot exhibit any abnormal behaviors or symptoms during the trip. The driver reports that the other dogs on the same\ntransport all did well and were fine.\nThe drivers performed regular frequent observations of the dogs and during these observations determined that the male\ndog was not eating and on the morning of the third day was starting to exhibit physical problems but veterinary care was\nnot obtained at that time at the closest veterinary facility. The transport continued and it was not until later in the day when\nmore severe symptoms were observed that veterinary care was obtained. If observation of dogs being transported shows\na dog to be obviously ill, injured or in physical distress, the dog must not be transported in commerce, except to receive\nveterinary care for the condition to ensure the health and well-being of the dog.\nCorrected for this dog. Correct in the future by ensuring that any dog obviously ill, injured or in physical distress is not\ntransported in commerce except to receive veterinary care.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nn"
