This animal had a firm movable mass on its neck/under the chin that was approximately 2 cm in\ndiameter. The treatment for masses is not addressed in the program of veterinary care and there is no record that\nthis facility had identified this animal as requiring care or started any treatment. This guinea pig was nursing a litter,\nhoused with 3 other adults, and was eating and drinking normally during this inspection.\nStandardized treatment protocols provided by the attending veterinarian in the program of veterinary care (PVC)\nmay be used by the facility to treat common conditions. When animals are identified as needing care the facility\nmust either initiate care as outlined in the PVC or obtain care by a veterinarian. The guinea pig with the mass above\nrequires examination and treatment by a veterinarian to prevent worsening of the condition and to prevent\nspreading the illness to other animals. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to evaluate this animal\nand determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment. Correct by February 19, 2020."
