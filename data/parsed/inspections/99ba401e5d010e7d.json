The hip bones were easily visible and there was an exaggerated abdominal tuck.\nThe facility representative stated he was old and arthritic. When asked what they were doing to provide for Cochise\u2019s\nmedical needs, the representative said they were providing chopped food and taking him for a walk every day. There\nwere no medical records to evaluate regarding a plan for care from a veterinarian or if his previously prescribed\nmedications are being administered as directed.\nA lion named \u201cSimba\u201d was in an enclosure with a hybrid cat named \u201cMani\u201d. \u201cSimba\u201d appeared thin and had areas of hair\ncoat loss near the hip area. The spinous processes of the vertebral bodies and hip bones were easily visible. He\nremained lying down throughout the time he was observed. When asked about any special care for Simba, the facility\nrepresentative stated that he was being given a weight gain supplement. The only diet supplement at the facility during\nthe inspection was \"Gleam and Gain\" which is a horse product. There were no medical records to evaluate regarding a\nplan for care from a veterinarian including the use of a horse supplement for a lion.\nWeight loss and hair coat changes, especially in geriatric animals, can be as a result of problems such as but not limited\nto numerous metabolic diseases and other illnesses, changing dietary requirements, and/or intestinal parasites. The\nfacility representative must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary approved nutrition and medical care at all\ntimes which includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries."

Approximately 5 grams of calcium carbonate are required to properly supplement\none pound of boneless meat for a big cat. There appears to be about 250 \u2013 500 mg of calcium in each 2 oz scoop of\nGleam & Gain so it would require at least 20 oz of this product per pound of meat fed to each cat per day to meet the\nminimum calcium requirements when used as a supplement for cats who are fed a boneless chicken meat diet. The\nfacility representatives have a history of feeding inadequate diets to big cats, and previous to this inspection, two big cats\nin their care were diagnosed with Metabolic Bone Disease, a preventable disease that is caused by a lack of calcium and\nother nutrients in the diet. One of the big cats is presently exhibiting lameness, which is often an early sign of this disease.\nThe chicken breasts are being stored in the food storage truck and were shown to be solidly frozen. In preparation for\nfeeding, the chicken breasts are removed from the truck and thawed on the ground, outside and next to the truck. Some\nof the cardboard boxes of chicken breasts were open are not protected in any way from contamination from dirt or pests.\nThe facility representative must ensure that food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of\nsufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.

An attending veterinarian  has not determined that these macaques are adequately acclimated to \noutdoor housing during this time of year. Based on observations they are not well acclimated.  The Kestrel thermometer at \nthe time of the inspection measured 41.8 degrees Fahrenheit.  Failure to have correctly acclimated nonhuman primates \nhoused in outdoor housing conditions can lead to hyperthermia or hypothermia. The facility representatives  must ensure \nthat nonhuman primates are acclimated, as determined by the attending veterinarian,  to the prevailing  temperature and \nhumidity at the outdoor housing facility during the time of the year they are at the facility.  They must also be able to \ntolerate the range of temperature and climatic conditions known to occur at the facility at that time of the year without \nstress or discomfort in order to be kept in outdoor enclosures.\n\nTo be corrected by: December 27, 2020 \n2.131(b)(1)  Direct\n   \nHandling of animals. \nTwo macaques were housed in adjacent outdoor enclosures, one with a metal crate and one with plastic barrel (open at \neach end) for shelter structures. The metal constructed enclosures and the metal shelter conduct cold in a manner that \ncould harm the animals especially the digits of the hands and feet in cold weather. The ears and tail are also at risk of \nfrost bite. Straw was used as a bedding. Supplemental heat was provided  by a forced air heater directed at a cinderblock \nwall between the two enclosures.  The plastic barrel was mounted on the enclosure wall above the level of the heater. \nThe set up did little more than to forcibly blow heated air into the open environment  adjacent to the enclosure. In fact, the \nloud and forceful nature of the heater may have discouraged the animals from use of cage space near the heater.  One \nmacaque was observed  sitting hunched up with its limbs pulled very close to its body, as one does when they are very \ncold and trying to conserve body heat. \nThe facility representative  must handle animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not \ncause excessive overcooling, trauma, stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. The housing design and strategy \nfor supplemental heat failed to protect the macaques and caused excessive overcooling  and distress. \nTo be corrected by: December 23, 2020 \n \nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nMARGARET SHAVER, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section",
