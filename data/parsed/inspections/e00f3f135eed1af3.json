The inspectors\nnoted that several of the animal enclosures did not have sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and\nthe public. A section of the wood barrier comprising half of the length of the enclosure was missing from in front of\nthe nilgai enclosure. The wood and rope barrier in front of the muntjac and deer enclosure was missing the rope in\nfront of half of the muntjac enclosure and all of the deer enclosure. The addax enclosure did not have a barrier\nalong one side of the enclosure. The addax was noted to be extremely active on this day-he was noted running\nrapidly around the enclosure and even bluff charging the enclosure fencing. The section of fencing between the\ndrive through portion and the walk through zoo portion of the park adjacent to the entrance to the drive through\nportion does not have a barrier. During the inspection it was noted that members of the public were viewing the\nzebra up close at this fence section. Lack of sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the public\ncan lead to safety issues for the animals and for the public. During public exhibition all animals must be handled so\nthere is minimal risk of harm to the animals and the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the\nanimals and the viewing public. Correct by 4/14/14."

Something has occurred that has damaged this section and pushed the wire fencing material to the ground\nfolding it partially in on itself. The barb wire strands are hanging loosened between the two posts. The animals may\nget caught in the loose wire fencing or some of the taller animals may bump their heads on/become entangled in the\nbarbed wire if they get close to this area leading to injury.\n*The front of the enclosure housing four fainting goats (two adults, two kids) is made of welded wire metal fencing\nof two different size openings. The two kids were noted placing their heads and necks through these openings to\nreach outside their enclosure as was the male goat with horns. The goats may injure themselves if they get caught\nor twist themselves in the openings.\nThe facility fencing materials must be constructed of such material and such strength as to be structurally sound for\nthe animals housed and shall be maintained in good repair."
