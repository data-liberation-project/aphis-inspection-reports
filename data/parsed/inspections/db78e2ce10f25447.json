Both dogs have prominently visible lumbar vertebrae, visible ribs with slight fat cover on\npalpation, and pelvic bones that are easy to appreciate when standing. An abdominal tuck is present on both dogs,\nthough less obvious on Georgette due to her being heavily bred. Both are routinely dewormed according to a schedule\ndeveloped by the AV and currently being fed an adult maintenance diet. Pregnant and nursing females have increased\nnutritional requirements due to the additional demands on the body during pregnancy and lactation, and a poor body\ncondition could negatively affect both the dam and the puppies. The licensee did not consult the attending veterinarian\nprior to inspection. The licensee must consult the attending veterinarian on developing an adequate feeding regimen for\npregnant and nursing females to maintain a healthy body condition in those animals.\nTo be corrected by: 12.9.25"
