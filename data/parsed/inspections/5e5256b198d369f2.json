In addition, the ridges of the spines\nwere more prominent than on the other pigs. Staff reported that the pig had been used in races up until a couple of\ndays ago when it didn't want to run when the starting gate was opened. A veterinarian has not yet been contacted\nabout the pig. A veterinarian needs to be consulted to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan for the pig.
