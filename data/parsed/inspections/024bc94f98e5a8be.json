When the flight arrived on the 23rd the dog was brought to the oversized baggage area by Alliance\nGround International. Photos were taken of the dogs carrier which did not contain any absorbent material. Per Customs\nand Border Control the airline was contacted multiple times over several hours to report the dog being unattended in the\noversized baggage area. Customs and Border Control reportedly provided some water to the dog as it was actively\nbarking and it eagerly consumed the water.\nThe lack of absorbent material in the carrier could force the dog to lie in it's own excreta which could cause skin irritation\nand lead to infection.\nAny person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) must not transport or deliver for transport\nin commerce a dog unless the primary enclosure has a solid, leak-proof bottom or a removable, leak-proof collection tray\nunder a slatted or mesh floor that prevents seepage of waste products, such as excreta and body fluids, outside of the\nenclosure. If a slatted or mesh floor is used in the enclosure, it must be designed and constructed so that the animal\ncannot put any part of its body between the slats or through the holes in the mesh. Unless the dogs are on raised slatted\nfloors or raised floors made of mesh, the primary enclosure must contain enough previously unused litter to absorb and\ncover excreta. The litter must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic to the dogs."
