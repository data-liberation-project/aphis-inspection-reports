      "narrative": "***One adult female Nubian ibex is observed to be non-weight bearing on her left front leg. The animal is reluctant to\nmove; when standing she touches her left forefoot on the ground or raises it outward in front of her. When walking, she\ncarries that leg out in front and the gait is affected as she heaves her left forequarter forward. Lameness can be caused\nby a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and\naffect the health and well-being of the animal.\nThe veterinarian evaluated the animal on Aug 27, 2021. She prescribed meloxicam daily for 2 weeks. She advised the\nlicensee to come to her clinic to discuss weights of the animal so that the correct dose could be prescribed. As of 12pm\non Aug 31, 2021, the licensee had not picked up the medication, therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian\u2019s\nrecommendation. The licensee needs to follow the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation.\n***One adult female fennec fox has multiple hair mats present on her back. There are six distinct hair mats among\ntangled fur which extends along the top of the back from the shoulder blade area to the base of the tail and along both\nsides of the animal. Matted hair can lead to medical problems, it can cause skin irritation, pain and progress to infected\nlesions.\nThe veterinarian evaluated the animal on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended removing the matts by shaving or brushing.\nThis has not been done, therefore the licensee has not followed the recommendation of the veterinarian. The licensee\nneeds to follow the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation.\n***Three adult female and two adult male white-tailed deer were observed to be thin to emaciated, with protruding hip\nbones, spine, and ribs. The bones of their spines, hips, and long bones were visible, and each rib was easily seen by both\nAPHIS inspectors upon inspection. They have rough, unthrifty hair coats and overgrown hooves that are affecting the\nangle of their feet.\nThe veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended increasing protein and fat in their diets,\ndeworming with ivermectin, and contacting a farrier to address the hoof problems. As of Aug 31, 2021, a farrier has not\nbeen contacted about the feet problems therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation.\nFailure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries.\n*** At least five adult Nubian Ibex have overgrown hooves affecting the angles of their feet due to a lack of hoof trimming\nand inappropriate substrate.\nThe veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended contacting a farrier to address the hoof\nproblems. A farrier has not been contacted about the feet problems therefore the licensee has not followed the\nveterinarian\u2019s recommendation. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be\npainful or cause injuries. The licensee needs to follow the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation.\n***According to the veterinarian, there is an addax/oryx that has a growth on its brisket area. The veterinarian\nrecommended this animal be started on meloxicam and antibiotics. She advised the licensee to come to her clinic to\ndiscuss weights of the animal so that the correct doses could be prescribed. As of 12pm on Aug 31, 2021, the licensee\nhad not picked up the medication, therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation. The\nlicensee needs to follow the veterinarian\u2019s recommendation.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan, then follow the\nplan."
