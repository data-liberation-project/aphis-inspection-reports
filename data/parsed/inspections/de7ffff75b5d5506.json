Both animals received injuries to the face and the female\nin Pen #3 had injuries to her right front foot that prevented her from being able to walk on it. The female in Pen #2 is\nknown to be very aggressive towards other females, and has had problems with fighting in the past, however she is\ncurrently housed in a run between 4 other dogs, and the fence had large enough holes(3x5inches) that they are\nable to cause damage to each other. The dogs appeared to have just gotten into a fight before the inspection and\nwas not observed until the owner arrived home.

The female in Pen#2 was still trying to get at the female in Pen #3 and causing stress for that animal.\nHousing an aggressive dog in an enclosure where they can have contact of any kind with other dogs can be a\nsource of stress and injuries for the neighboring animals. It is important that the aggressive dogs are housed\nseparately and in pens that prevent them from agitating and being able to have any physical contact with other\ndogs.\nThe licensee must move the aggressive dog to an enclosure where she can not agitate or attack and have\naggressive physical contact with any other dogs in the facility.\nTo be corrected: Immediately\nThe licensee moved this female by the end of the inspection"
