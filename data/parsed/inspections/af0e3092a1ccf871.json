      "narrative": "There is a 15 year old Barbados-cross black and white colored, female sheep which appeared to have a loss of\nvision indicated by the animal bumping into various objects during inspection. This sheep displayed abnormal\nbehaviors including head twitching as well an occasional circling type of gait. Upon closer inspection, the sheep\nalso showed an irregular type of eye movement. The facility representative stated he noticed the apparent\nblindness approximately three days ago and isolated the animal in a barn; however this animal has not received\nveterinary care at this time. The abnormal behaviors exhibited by this animal may be a sign of infection, injury, or\nother disease process. Additionally, these abnormal behaviors by the animal may cause the animal to experience\npain, stress and or discomfort.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian that can give an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for the problem cited above. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care. The program for\nproviding adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries.\nThis animal was evaluated and treated by a veterinarian during this inspection."

A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to\nensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain\nthe animals."
