A black and tan adult guinea pig in Row 3\nPen 10 and a red and brown adult guinea pig in Row 4 Pen 21 had areas over the back with gaps in the top layer of the\nskin with reddish areas and scabs. There was 1 guinea pig with a head tilt. An adult gray and white guinea pig in Row 3\nPen 15 had a head tilt to the left.
