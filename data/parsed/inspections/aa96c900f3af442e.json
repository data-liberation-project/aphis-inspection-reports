The facility should ensure that appropriate\nmeasures are utilized when it is necessary to euthanize animals covered under the animal welfare act regulations,\nincluding the use of pharmaceuticals that are in-date and properly handled. The same goes for all medications used\nfor covered animals, and records should be adequate to substantiate appropriate usage of drugs.\nTo be corrected from this time forward."

At the time of\ninspection the following problems were observed:\n- Around the back side of rhinos the fenceline is not complete, and so they are not encircled by an eight foot\nfence, as required, since they are classified as dangerous animals;\n- In some areas the fencing is comprised of a wire mesh with openings close to the ground that are up to six\ninches in height and width. Such openings could allow animals to pass through the fence;\n- A gate in the perimeter fence, which serves as the parking exit, is left open and unattended throughout the day.\nWhereas the entrance gate is visible to the nearby office area, and employees are available to monitor and close\nthe gate if needed, this exit gate is more remote, and not easily monitored.\n- When closed after hours, the entrance gate has a nine inch gap underneath the gate, which could allow animals\nto pass under the gate.\nThese are examples of where the perimeter fence falls short of meeting expectations. Failure to provide and\nadequate perimeter fence could put the well-being of the animals at risk, due to the possibility of harmful\nunauthorized contact with people or animals, including exposure to animals that could introduce diseases, and also\ndue to the risk of inadequate containment in the event of an escape. The facility should continue with its plan to\ncomplete the perimeter fence and bring all sections into compliance.\nTo be corrected by 3/22/18.\nThis inspection was completed on 9/21/17 and 9/22/17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the animal collection manager and other facility\nrepresentatives."
