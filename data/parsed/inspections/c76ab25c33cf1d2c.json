When the rabbit attempted\nto move about its enclosure, both legs were splayed out to the side in an abnormal position with the right leg being\nthe most splayed. The fur on the rear and tail of the rabbit was discolored and dark brown in color. The tail was\npositioned left of center in an abnormal manner as the rabbit attempted to move about its enclosure.\n***Another white female rabbit (ID number CS14) was unable to move and was laying in a stretched out position on\nits four feet with the rear legs extended slightly further back. Upon closer inspection, the fur of the rabbit's entire rear\nhad a wet and slimy appearance, was a deep dark brown in color and when the licensee repositioned the rabbit, a\nsection of this discolored fur pulled off. There was a presence of maggots on the rabbit where the discolored fur was\nnoted.\nThe licensee stated that these conditions were observed last week but no veterinary care has been provided and\nthe licensee has not had a conversation with the attending veterinarian regarding these serious health issues prior\nto the inspection. These animals are suffering and the health conditions are adversely affecting their health and\nwell-being. These animals must receive immediate veterinary care and be examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis\nand treatment. Documentation must be maintained on the veterinary care provided to these animals. Diagnosis is\ncritical to the health of all the rabbits should this involve a communicable disease. Correct by 8 PM CST on July 8,\n2014."
