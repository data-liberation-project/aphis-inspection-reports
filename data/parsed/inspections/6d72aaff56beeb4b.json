These animals were handled by employees of the facility as well as volunteers that assist in the care and\nhandling of program animals. Their enclosure was a plastic enclosure with a wire lid, which requires that the lid be\nplaced correctly in order to securely contain the animals. On August 12, 2019, it was noted by a staff member that\nthere were only 3 mice in the enclosure. It is not known how or when a mouse escaped from the enclosure. This\nanimal was not able to be recovered.\nEmployees and volunteers that are involved in the care of animals must be adequately trained in order to maintain\nprofessionally accepted husbandry standards. Acceptable husbandry standards include handling and enclosure\nmaintenance that results in the safe containment of the animals. In this instance, handling or enclosure\nmaintenance by inadequately trained personnel led to the escape of the deer mouse, and the facility was unable to\nsafely recover the animal.\nAfter the escape of the deer mouse from this enclosure, this species was removed from the education program, the\nremaining animals were moved to a separate location in a different type of secure enclosure, and handling of this\nspecies is now limited to trained and experienced employees of the facility.\nThis item has been corrected by the facility.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted on site with a facility representative."
