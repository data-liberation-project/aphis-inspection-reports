There were 2 guinea pigs with respiratory conditions the\nlicensee had not observed and was not treating. In Pen B, a tri-color adult guinea pig was observed with increased\nrespiratory effort and large chest movements when breathing. This animal was also heard with a raspy breathing noise\nand was lethargic. In Pen A, a brown and white adult was observed with increased respiratory effort and large chest\nmovements when breathing. This animal was also lethargic. There was one guinea pig with signs of lameness. In Pen\nD, a black and white adult guinea pig was observed to be reluctant to bear weight on the front legs. When examined\ncloser, both foot pads on the front feet were moderately swollen and red and had dirt and debris stuck on them. The\nlicensee had not observed the health problems in these animals, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, or applied\nany treatments. Respiratory conditions and swollen feet can be painful, can worsen and spread to other parts of the body\nand result in other health issues. Delays in providing appropriate veterinary care for these conditions can result in\nworsening of the condition and potentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature. The licensee must\ncommunicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis\nand treatment.\nCorrect by: October 15, 2020"
