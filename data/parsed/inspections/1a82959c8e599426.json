The following two facility issues were identified during this inspection.\n\" The ceiling between the two cage washers in the \"dirty\" wash room has peeling paint and what appears to be\ndamaged sheet rock. According to the licensee the steam from the large cage washer is not properly vented which\nis causing the ceiling problems. The licensee explained that money has been budgeted for a new cage washer but\none has not been ordered and a definite repair date is somewhere in the future.\n\" Animal room 137 has an area of water damage on its ceiling.\nAll premises associated with animal care and use must be kept clean and in good repair in order to facilitate\nrequired husbandry practices. An improperly vented cage washer is an improperly functioning cage washer which\nmay not be adequately cleaning cages. Chipping paint from the ceiling in the animal room could fall into an animal\ncage causing health issues. The integrity of both of these ceilings is damaged which could allow rodents and other\npests entry into the facility. The cage washer needs to be replaced or repaired and both ceilings need to be\nrepaired.\nTo be corrected by: Nov 1, 2015\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee."
