      "narrative": "In August of 2013 several of the large cat enclosures at this facility were evaluated for their height and the risk of\nescape from these enclosures. All of these enclosures are approximately 10 feet in height with a 3 foot kick in with\nopen tops. Many of them have 4 x 4 square welded wire as their siding which is easily climbed by young animals.\nAt that time all enclosures housed older animals, 16 to 20+ years old. Photos, fence height along with kick in\nlength, and the age of the cats housed in the enclosures were sent to the USDA big cat specialist. Her evaluation\nwas that the enclosures were \"suitable for the existing older tigers. Modification to add additional containment\nmeasures to the enclosures must be made before housing other big cats.\nSince Aug 2013 most of the older animals in these enclosures have died with much younger animals being moved\ninto the enclosures. These enclosure must now have additional containment measures added such as several\nstrands of hotwire at different levels of the fencing, a vertical extension of the fence to 12 feet with a 3 foot kick in, a\ntop across the entire enclosure, or some other measure to contribute to the containment of the younger cats.\nTo be corrected by: Dec 1, 2016"

The other 3 full time employees consist of one person who has\nhelped feed at the facility on weekends for a number of years, one person who started working at the facility in Dec\n2015 and one person who started working in Feb 2016. None of these 3 had exotic animal experience prior to this\nfacility. This facility also has an intern training program. A new group of seven interns arrived during the first part of\nJune 2016.\nThe current inventory of dangerous animals at this facility consists of 31 bears, 4 cougars, 1 jaguar, 3 lions, and 21\ntigers. This situation is extremely dangerous for the employees, the interns, the visiting public and the animals.\nFor example, the area game warden was visiting the facility on June 5, 2016. He observed several individuals\nentering various enclosures with unsecured bears. When I visited the facility on June 9th and observed where this\noccurred I observed a single gate into the enclosure, not a double safety gate. Two inexperienced individuals\nwalked through a single gate with food to feed 7 black bears. Nothing was between them and the bears. If they\nwould have needed to get out quickly, with only a single gate, there is a good possibility the bears would have come\nwith them. That event put the keepers, the visiting public, and the bears in an extremely dangerous situation.\nThis facility needs to hire a full time employee or a consultant with extensive knowledge of big cats and bears to\noversee daily operations and safety protocols.\nTo be corrected by: July 1, 2016\nInspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives."
