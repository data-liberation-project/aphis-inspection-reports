When the tartar was pulled up, it appeared there may have been a\ntooth that had been dislodged from the gums and hanging within the middle of the tartar. In addition there was\nheavy tartar buildup on both sides of the mouth. When asked the licensee stated he did not know the last time the\ndog had a dental done. Dental problems can be painful and can lead to systemic infection which could be\ndetrimental to the dog's health. The loose chunk of tartar on the right side of the mouth (whether or not a tooth is\nlodged in the middle of the tartar) and the heavy buildup of tartar in general indicates that the dog is in need of a\ndental.\nIn addition to the dental problems, this dog was matted up quite a bit around the eyes to the point that it made it\ndifficult to examine the dog's eyes. Matted up fur can be painful as it can start pulling on the skin. It can cause\nirritation and it makes it difficult for the licensee to properly observe the dog on a daily basis to ensure there are no\nhealth issues with the dog. The dog's fur should be clipped/trimmed around the eyes. This should be done on a\nregular basis from here on out to ensure the dog doesn't get matted up around the eyes in the future.\nThe Attending Veterinarian must be consulted with in regards to the dog. The dog must be treated per his/her\ninstructions."
