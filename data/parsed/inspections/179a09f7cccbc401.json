The daily treatment sheet shows that the\nmedications were not started until (cid:28)\"11/21 pm(cid:29).\" In addition, the treatment sheet shows that animal 101023 only\nreceived 75% of the oral medication given and animal 108020 did not receive any of the oral medication given on 21\nNov. On 22 Nov, all three animals were given medication only once (treatment record shows the only entry\nas(cid:28)(cid:25)\"11/22 p.m.\"(cid:29)). Failure to start treatment when prescribed by the attending veterinarian can lead to worsening of\na medical condition.\nAlso on 20 Nov 2014, the attending veterinarian directed the staff to administer fluids to the animal 20-30 ml of LRS\nsubcutaneously twice a day as the animals would allow.

There is a\nnote in the keeper log that animal 101001 had been receiving SQ fluids but this note was recorded after the animal\nhad passed away.
