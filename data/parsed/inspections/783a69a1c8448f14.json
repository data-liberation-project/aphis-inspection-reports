      "narrative": "* In multiple spots in the drive-thru park, farm animals approached very slow moving vehicles seeking bread which\nthe licensee provided customers to distribute from their cars. Llamas, elk, and buffalo were all observed sticking\ntheir heads into vehicles to eat the bread, oftentimes when no employee was in sight. In an attempt to become\ncompliant after the last inspection, the licensee ensured that all roving patrol vehicles were readily identifiable with\nbright, orange, blinking lights. The licensee also hired an extra employee specifically for the purpose of having\ntwice as many patrols occuring twice as often as compared to past years in order to monitor public feeding.\nHowever, because the park is so large, spanning multiple acres, the roving patrols still could not observe all contact\nbetween the farm animals and the public at all times. Close observation/supervision by employees helps prevent\npeople from feeding prohibited food items to the animals and it discourages the public from contacting the animals\nin a harmful way. Close observation/supervision also helps ensure a quick response if an incident does occur\nduring the public feeding.\n** The licensee must ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant is\npresent at all times during periods of public contact/feeding.\nThe inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. The inspector drove through\nthe park solo and unannounced prior to the escorted portion of the inspection in order to determine whether or not\nan employee was present at all times during public contact. In addition to the verbal exit interview on the day of\ninspection, a follow-up was conducted with the licensee via phone on 20 April 2015. Due to time constraints,\npaperwork (including Program of Vet Care and records of animal acquisitions/dispositions) was not checked during\nthis inspection."
