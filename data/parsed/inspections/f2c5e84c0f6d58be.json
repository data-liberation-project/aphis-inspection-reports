The animal pushed off the main\nenclosure gate without the zookeepers noticing it and got out. The primary enclosure is surrounded by a perimeter fence\nwhich serves as a secondary containment but the gate was left completely open and the animal was able to bypass both\nfences. Another staff member that was nearby saw the animal outside and alerted everyone. Escape protocols were\nenacted, all gates were closed quickly and visitors were moved indoors by staff members. The animal was always\ncontained inside facility premises but never gained access to public areas. The animal was darted and recovered on the\nsame day. The animal did not suffer any injuries but was weak when recaptured and received medical attention. The\nanimal was kept under observation in the medical ward for several days and was slowly reintroduced into her habitat. A\ntotal of 3 grey wolves are housed together in this enclosure but the other 2 were locked in the night quarters and never\nescaped. No member of the public or facility staff was harmed while the animal was out. Facility records show that\nzookeepers involved in this incident were re-trained. This handling mistake could have resulted in a potential injury to the\nanimal or any member of the public or the facility staff. Handling of all animals must be done in a manner that cannot lead\nto an animal escape and prevent trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrected at time of inspection\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
