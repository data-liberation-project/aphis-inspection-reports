With respect to activities involving animals, the\nIACUC, as an agent of the research facility, must review, at least once every six months, the research facility\u2019s program\nfor humane care and use of animals, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A \u2013 Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation.\nThe subsequent spring 2023 Semi-Annual program review was conducted at the required interval.\nCorrect by: July 31, 2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
