The raccoon was humanely euthanized in\norder to test it for rabies as a required precautionary measure for the injured person's health. Review of the exhibit\nduring inspection revealed that the primary enclosure of the raccoon could be touched from the public side of the\nexhibit by reaching over the public barrier. Sufficient distance and barriers are necessary to prevent public contact\nwith animals and to decrease the risk of harm to the public and exhibited animals. For the safety of the animals and\nthe public, ensure that adequate barriers and distances are in place between exhibited animals and the general\nviewing public.\nCorrection: Maintain correct from this date forward.\nNote: The raccoon enclosure was not being used for animal exhibit during inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
