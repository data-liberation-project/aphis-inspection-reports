For teaching protocols a\ncomplete description should include a description of the procedures to be performed by the students and address\nconcerns that may affect the well-being of the animals such as the number of procedures to be performed on each\nanimal.\nIn order to be compliant the protocols listed must be modified to contain a complete description and thereafter approved\nby the IACUC in order for animals to be used in protocol activities.
