The lack of\nparticipation of an unaffiliated IACUC member in IACUC meetings and semi-annuals means that there is a lack of\ngeneral community interest being represented on the committee regarding proper care and treatment of animals at\nthe facility. The IACUC, when conducting business required under the Animal Welfare Act, shall include at least one\nmember unaffiliated with the facility. Correct by April 2017."
