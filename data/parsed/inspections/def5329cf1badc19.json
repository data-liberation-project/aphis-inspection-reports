He\nwas bearing weight on the leg and running around as though the leg was only sensitive at times. Upon examination\na small white mass of tissue was discovered between the toes. The mass was approximately the size of a pencil\nlead. The dog when examined did not react as though it was sensitive to touch. The licensee stated that they had\njust sprayed and dipped for ticks and the dog had a tick between the toes. The licensee must have this animal\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis and treatment of the foot was\nprovided. Any medical records must be made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure\nthat all animals receive adequate veterinary care to ensure the health and well-being of the dog.

The metal base tubing has completely rusted through\nleaving only a portion of the tubing exposed..Excessive rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces which\naffects the structural strength of the metal. In addition, the ability to protect the animals from injury could be\nquestioned. The licensee must ensure that all metal surfaces are structurally sound, kept in good repair and must\nprotect the animals from injury.
