In addition, enclosure # 1 housing 15 adult guinea pigs and\nenclosure # 13 housing 16 adult guinea pigs have accumulations of excreta and dirty bedding. The cleaning\nprocess (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation of scale, debris, excreta, and\ndirty bedding inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to potential disease\nhazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and\nsanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of scale, debris, excreta, and dirty bedding. Additionally, ensure\nthat the primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by December 15, 2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner's wife."
