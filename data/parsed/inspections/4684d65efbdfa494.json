The exposed skin is reddened and contains numerous small bumps. Several of\nthese bumps have split open revealing raw tissue beneath. A section of dry, scab-like material is located on the surface\nof the skin. The licensee started treatment on October 1, 2021, the affected area has been treated with vetericyn spray\ndaily since that time, but within the past four months the condition continues to persist, and the facility has not reached out\nto a veterinarian to have the dog\u2019s ongoing condition evaluated.\nFemale English bulldog (\u201cMaybelle\u201d microchip number 93300320459871) has an abnormal condition of the right eye. A\nlarge red growth is located in the interior corner of the eye and is covering approximately a third of the surface of the eye.\nThe dog has not been evaluated by a veterinarian for the condition of the eye and no treatment has been provided or is\ncurrently scheduled.\nMale Maltese (\u201cBilly\u201d) has poor dental health. The dog has approximately three remaining teeth and a thick buildup of\nbrown colored tartar is coating the entire surface of the two lower left cheek teeth. A grey material is located between the\ntwo teeth and a dark red area is located along the gum line. The dog was evaluated by the attending veterinarian in July,\nbut the current condition of the dog\u2019s teeth has not been identified and no treatment has been provided or is planned.\nAbnormal conditions of the eyes and skin as well as and poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the animal\nand can lead to further health issues if not treated appropriately and in a timely manner.\nEach dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above\nmentioned dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan.\nThe licensee must provide adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: End of business 12-February-2022\nDuring the inspection several instances of animals receiving medical treatment which had not been approved by a\nveterinarian were identified.\n\u2022 An English bulldog has been treated by the facility for recurring \u201cstaph infections\u201d. The \u201cstaph infections\u201d were self-\ndiagnosed by the facility and a veterinarian was not consulted in regard to this dog\u2019s condition and the treatment plan.\n\u2022 While discussing the treatment plan for several bulldog puppies who have discharge from the nose, the licensee stated\nthat whenever a puppy is sick and requires treatment then they will administer the treatment to all the puppies in the\nkennel regardless of whether those puppies are showing symptoms of the illness or not. This plan has not been approved\nby the attending veterinarian.\nAbnormal conditions must be diagnosed by a veterinarian and treatment plans must also be approved by a veterinarian in\norder to provide adequate veterinary care. Failure to do so does not ensure the treatment plan is appropriate or effective\nwhich may allow the condition to worsen and place the health and well-being of the animal in jeopardy. Providing medical\ntreatments to healthy animals without approval from a veterinarian may have a negative impact on the health of those\nanimals.\nEach dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

The\nlicensee stated that this product was given to the dogs but was not \u201cAyr Saline Nasal Mist\u201d but is actually Gentomycin.\nThe bottle does not contain a label clarifying the product within is Gentomycin and an expiration date for the Gentomycin.\nA bottle of pills labeled \"Metronidazole 250 mg\" has no expiration date. The licensee does have a list of medication\ndosages approved by the attending veterinarian that does include metronidazole.\nImproperly labeled medical products and missing expiration date information does not ensure that the appropriate product\nis used and the health of the animal may suffer.\nEach dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee\nmust ensure the bottle of \u201cAyr Saline Nasal Mist\u201d is clearly labeled as Gentomycin and contains an expiration date.
