Lack of adequate\ncleaning may lead to odors, pests, and the spread of disease in addition to animal discomfort. All hard surfaces with which\nnon-human primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more\noften if needed to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, and excreta.
