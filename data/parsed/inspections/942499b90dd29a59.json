The licensee did not collect the care package (milk replacer, bottle, and\nhay) and feeding instruction sheet provided by the seller. The joey had been inspected by a veterinarian on 7/10/23 prior\nto travel to the sale. The licensee fed the joey non-specific milk replacer on the trip from Missouri to Utah and switched to\nkangaroo milk replacer once home. The joey was found dead the morning of 7/15/2023. The animal was not seen by a\nveterinarian after the sale prior to death nor necropsied thus the cause of death is unknown. The licensee did not\ndemonstrate that she understood the proper nutritional, feeding, and handling requirements of a joey of this age. Improper\nmilk replacer and feeding schedules can result in GI disturbances, dehydration, over/underfeeding, malnutrition, and\ndevelopmental problems. Lack of attention to sterilization of feeding utensils can lead to diarrhea. Dehydration can also\nbe caused by excessive or stressful handling. These deficiencies can lead to illness and death.\nAll licensees who maintain wild or exotic must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the species they\nmaintain. Lack of knowledge of this species was a contributing factor in the death of the wallaby joey.\nTo be corrected by: 5/1/2024"
