      "narrative": "At the time of inspection, the licensee mentioned there were four Leopard cat kittens (no microchip ID\u2019s) that became ill\n(stopped eating, among other clinical signs including, but not limited to, lethargy, upper respiratory signs, failure of weight\ngain) over the course of the past two months where she did not immediately seek veterinary care for any of the animals\nand, of which, two died from suspected preventable diseases. According to the licensee, all these animals were properly\nvaccinated. A necropsy report for the 3-month-old female kitten (DOB: 2/21/23) that was found dead on 5/18/2023 stated\nthe potential cause of death as pneumonia secondary to an underlying viral infection (such as calici or herpes virus \u2013\npreventable diseases). Per the licensee, the 3-month-old male kitten (DOB: 2/21/23) that was found dead on 6/1/2023,\nstopped eating and was being treated by the owner \u2013 by handfeeding an urgent care diet (Hills a/d) and Nutrical -\napproximately 1-2 days prior to its death. A gross necropsy only was performed on this animal where the heart was found\nto be abnormal. Per the licensee, the 3-month-old male kitten (DOB: 2/26/23) that was found dead on 6/8/2023 initially\nhad an upper respiratory tract infection for approximately 1-2 days prior to contacting her AV, but improved after receiving\na course of antibiotics, per the licensee\u2019s AVs\u2019 instructions. Approximately 1-2 weeks later, this animal got sick again\nwhere it stopped eating and was being treated (force-feeding urgent care diet and Nutrical) by the licensee for\napproximately 1-2 days, until it was seen by a veterinarian and treated for suspected parvovirus (preventable disease).\nLastly, per the licensee, the 3-month-old female kitten (DOB: 2/26/23) that was euthanized by a veterinarian on 6/9/2023,\nstopped eating approximately 1-2 days prior to her veterinary visit (on 6/7/23), and was being treated by the licensee via\nforce-feeding the urgent care diet and Nutrical. The veterinarian noted information from the licensee whereby this animal\nhad not gained weight in over 2 weeks even though she appeared to be eating, diagnosed this animal with pneumonia,\nand initiated treatment. The veterinarian also performed a gross necropsy only, where she also found an abnormal heart.\nUpon discovering their illnesses, the licensee did not immediately contact the veterinarian, nor does she have a\nveterinary-approved SOP to independently initiate treatment for any of the animals. Failure to use appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can foster an unhealthy environment, delay the onset of\ndiagnosing and treating ailments, and can consequently lead to unnecessary suffering and death. Each dealer shall\nestablish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nGervais Edmonds-Wiggins, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
