There is not a den box or quiet area off display available to him during the day. The facility has a\nhammock near the top portion of the enclosure, which is inadequate to offer him reprieve from public display.\nAnimals that are on continual display can be expected to exhibit signs of behavioral stress, including displaying\nstereotypical repetitive behaviors. This animal is given a dose of diazepam (sedative) each morning which,\naccording to facility representatives, is being given in order to reduce repetitive enclosure pacing. This animal is not\nbeing exhibited under conditions consistent with his good health and well-being, as evident by his repetitive pacing\nbehavior, and the need for sedation. The licensee must revise the enclosure set-up in such a way to provide this\nanimal with a quiet area where he is able to remove himself completely from public display, and re-evaluate his\nmedication and treatment plan with their Attending Veterinarian.\n*****\nTo be corrected by 30 April 2014\nThis routine inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives."
