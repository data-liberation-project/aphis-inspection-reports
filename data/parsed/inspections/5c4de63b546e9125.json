The licensee must\ntrim the toenails of these animals to ensure that the animals can move normally and prevent the potential for injury. As\npart of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must establish and follow a program of regular toenail\nmaintenance for all the animals to prevent the overgrowth of toenails. To be corrected by: March 23, 2022\nThere were at least 2 adult rabbits heard and/or observed to be repeatedly sneezing during the inspection. One of the\nrabbits was a female orange Netherland Dwarf (#5) observed with a small amount of white to light green mucous like\nmaterial, possibly nasal discharge, in the fur around the nose. Another rabbit was a female orange Netherland Dwarf (#6)\nobserved sneezing. Both rabbits also had long toenails as described above.
