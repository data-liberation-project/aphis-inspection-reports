      "narrative": "* Adult, female blue and white Italian Greyhound with number 933 has not been evaluated by a veterinarian\nsince the last inspection. The gum line over the upper right large premolar tooth is red and recessed away from the\ntooth surface. The gum line over the lower left premolar teeth is recessed and one lower premolar tooth is loose.\nThe front of the lower jaw is able to be moved when the two lower canine teeth are gently manipulated. The two\nlower canine teeth can be slightly moved toward each other. There is dark brown material coating the upper right\nlarge premolar tooth and the lower left premolar teeth. This dog is currently receiving \"Tylan\" powder in the drinking\nwater at the rate of 1 tsp/5 gallons. Documentation from the attending veterinarian directs the Tylan to be used at a\ndose of 1 tsp/1 gallon of drinking water. The license gives the water free choice every day. This dog is also\nreceiving (cid:28)Plaque Off(cid:29) in the food.\n* Adult, female Schnauzer with number 653 has not been evaluated by a veterinarian since the last inspection.\nThe gum line over the upper premolar teeth of both sides is recessed away from the surface of the teeth. The roots\nof the large upper premolar teeth are exposed on both sides. One of the small upper premolar teeth is loose on the\nright side. One of the small upper premolar teeth and the large upper premolar tooth is loose on the left side. The\nlicensee had a conversation with the attending veterinarian about the care of this dog via telephone. This dog is\nreceiving (cid:28)Plaque off(cid:29) in the food as discussed with the veterinarian.\n* Loose teeth, recessed and red gums are some of the signs of dental disease in dogs. Dental disease can\ncause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures (such as bone loss in the jaw), be painful, and\nimpact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal.\n* The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the\ndiagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon\nrequest.\n* Black and tan adult male Dachshund with number 1004 still has matted hair observed on the ears and back\nlegs that is tight against the skin. Salt and pepper colored adult male Schnauzer with number 64 still has matted hair\non his all four legs, rear end and abdomen. The matted hair was (cid:28)balled(cid:29) and ropey in appearance and was tight\nagainst the skin. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris, and moisture, and can foster skin\ninfections. The matted hair on these dogs must be removed and a program of coat maintenance must be\nestablished at the facility.\n* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 4/7/16 were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver\nVMO and Robert Bacon ACI.\nAdditional Inspectors\nShaver Margaret, Veterinary Medical Officer"
