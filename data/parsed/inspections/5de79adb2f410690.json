The edge of the wound was scabbed. The skin of the front portion of the ear, adjacent to\nthe wound edge, was reddened. The lab performed an unauthorized method for the approved tissue sampling procedure\nthat led to this complication. At the time of the inspection, the veterinary staff had already notified the lab to discontinue\nuse of that procedure.\nA significant change was made to the protocol without veterinary authorization. This failure does not give the IACUC and\nveterinary staff a complete understand of the animal\u2019s use as well as the opportunity to identify any potential for animal\npain or distress. It is essential that a complete description of all animal procedures used in the protocol be discussed and\napproved to ensure humane and judicious use of these animals.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd Section"
