A\nbicycle-rack type barrier was present on two sides but was within approximately 1.5 feet from the transport\nenclosure and could allow members of the public to reach into the enclosure and make contact with the tiger while\nthe facility representatives were directing the photo opportunities.\nFollowing the circus performance, the Tiger Trainer left the area where 4 tigers and 1 liger were housed between\nperformances and was unable to be reached by phone or by knocking on the door to his recreational vehicle for\nwhen APHIS personnel were present to conduct an inspection at 3 PM. No contact with the Trainer was made until\n3:30 PM. The public barrier gate that surrounded the 4 tigers and 1 liger in their transport cages was open at the\nentryway and no attendant or security personnel were present to prevent contact with members of the public\npassing by the cages. The public barrier was open approximately 3-3.5 feet at both ends of the line of transport\ncages and was only approximately 1.5-2 feet from the cages. This can allow for an animal or person to enter or exit\nthe area holding the big cats and for a person to reach into the mesh cages and contact the animals. This area was\naccessible to the general public and, during the time APHIS was waiting for a representative to conduct the\ninspection, approximately 6 people walked down the corridor adjacent to the barriers and stopped to take pictures,\nreaching their arms and hands close to the enclosures. The area where the transport cages are located is a busy\ncorridor and, during the inspection, vehicles were moving equipment past the cages which required the barrier gate\nto be moved within a foot or less of the enclosures.\nIf sufficient distance and/or barrier is not established between the animal and general viewing public this can\nincrease the risk of harm to the animal and the public.\nSufficient distance and/or a sufficient public barrier and/or a knowledgeable attendant must be in place in order to\nkeep unauthorized people or other animals from coming into direct contact with the animals.\nTo be corrected by: April 18, 2015"
