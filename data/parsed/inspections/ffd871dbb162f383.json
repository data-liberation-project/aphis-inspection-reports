The Attending Veterinarian (AV) had examined the dog and noted that it had Moderate to\nSevere Dental Tartar at that time but did not mention the receding gum-line and stated that no treatment was\nneeded at that time. It appears that the condition may have progressed at this time. Licensee must assure the use\nof appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, to include follow-up on\nanimals that may have progressive conditions. This follow-up assures that the animals do not suffer from worsening\nof conditions. Correct by having this animal reexamined by the AV and treated as appropriate. To be corrected by: 1\nJuly 2016\nAn exit interview was conducted with the facility owner."
