This resulted in\nthermal burns to two areas on the macaque's legs and evidence of behavioral stress during healing. The rhesus\nmacaque was observed during this inspection and has fully recovered from this incident.\nFailing to handle animals in a careful manner can cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Ensure\nthat all employees are trained and practice careful and acceptable handling procedures on animals during all\nactivities. The facility has already implemented corrective measures as a result of this incident, which include a\nrevised training program for laboratory members handling animals and the addition of a veterinary technician/animal\ntechnologist present for all animals undergoing anesthetic procedures.\nInspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd of report.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMercado Mario, Veterinary Medical Officer"
