      "narrative": "\u2022The animal records are incomplete. No written acquisition and disposition records were available for the majority\nof the animals at the facility regarding who they were obtained from or the date they were obtained. An inventory list\nof animals on hand was provided but it only listed the species and sex. The current animal care person stated that\nthat the majority of the records went missing with the previous animal caretaker. Approximately 170 animals were\ncurrently inspected. There were acquisition records showing arrival of 28 animals but some of those animals were\nnot present at the inspection and did not have corresponding disposition records (e.g. 3 kangaroos). Additionally,\nsome animal which were present at the previous inspection were not present at the current inspection and did not\nhave disposition records. This included: 2 cavys, 2 eastern grey and 3 red kangaroo and possibly 2 capybars\n(previously 3 present and only 1 claimed on the current inventory but not observed). Of those missing animals only\none kangroo had a disposition record.\n\u2022Based on the discrepancies in inventories, acquisition, and disposition records, it is not possible to track\nmovement of any particular animal into or out of this site. As a result, it cannot be ascertained if the licensee is\noperating as a Class A dealer of Class B dealer.\n\u2022Several of the acquisition and disposition records had the name of the current caretaker for this facility rather than\nthe actual licensee. The caretaker does not have a USDA license. The caretaker explained that the state wildlife\npermit for the facility is no longer held by the owner but is now held by her, and that her name and FWC permit\nnumber has to be on the transfer paperwork to meet state regulation. When the transition to her holding the wildlife\npermit happened she stated that there was some confusion about how to fill out the paperwork. The caretaker\nstated that she has changed how she fills out the paperwork to show the owners name and she puts her information\nin the margins.\n\u2022There was a giraffe on the property which during the inspection the licensee stated belonged to him. The owner\nhad stated that he could not go into the giraffe barn because the animal was aggressive. However, when records\nwere reviewed with the caretaker, she stated that she doesn\u2019t have the paperwork for the giraffe because it went\ndirectly to the son of the owner (who holds a separate USDA license for a separate business on the same property).\nShe stated that she did not have a wildlife permit to have the giraffe. The apparent confusion over who possesses\nthe giraffe raises serious concerns over who has responsibility for the care of the animal. It also raises concerns\nover the separation of the businesses that share the property.\n\u2022In addition to confusion about the giraffe, there were a couple of bactrian camels near that enclosure which were\nalso not accessible according to the licensee. An acquisition form indicated that four bactrian camels were\ntransferred from Maryland. However, these camels were not included on the inventory and similar to the giraffe it\nwas unclear who is responsible for these animals.\nAccurate, complete and current records must be created and maintained to comply with the applicable regulations\nand to protect the health and welfare of regulated animals under the Animal Welfare Act."
