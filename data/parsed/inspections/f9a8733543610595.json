This pinniped comes out of his enclosure pool for a meet &\ngreet with the public as well as for training interactions with the keepers. When Mac was observed today to be\ncoming out of the pool, he slipped/tripped and fell down hard onto the door threshold which is several inches above\nthe present water line. This pinniped has to lift himself & climb out of the pool, over the threshold, and onto a ramp\nlocated on the outside of the pool to leave the enclosure.\nA better method shall be implemented so that he does not injure himself or exacerbate his arthritis when leaving his\npool for the interactions & meet & greets. This may be accomplished by (but not limited to) possibly raising the\ncurrent water level, installing a ramp in the water, or moving this animal to a more suitable pool to ensure that he will\nnot be injured when leaving his enclosure.\nCorrect immediately.\nThe inspection was conducted with the attending veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted with the\nveterinarian, co-owner, & facility manager."
