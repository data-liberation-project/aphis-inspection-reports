Rust can affect structural strength and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of surfaces,\nwhich can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All rusted surfaces that come into contact with the dogs must be\nrepaired or replaced so they can be properly cleaned and sanitized and to ensure structural strength.\nTo be corrected by: January 12, 2015\nInspection and exit briefing conducted with the owner."
