It is damp and moist and there is\nstill some areas of wood above the entrance that are exhibiting signs of moisture. There is a slight smell of mildew\nand there are insects that favor moist and damp conditions present in the night house. There may still be some\nunderlying source of water leakage present in the night house that needs to be addressed to alleviate the moisture\nand dampness. The male Patas monkeys night house does have some patch work but there may be another issue\ncontributing to the moisture issue.
