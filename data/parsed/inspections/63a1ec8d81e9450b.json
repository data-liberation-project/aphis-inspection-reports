One of the pigs was facing a wood wall\nin an apparent head pressing manner and when he was moved by the inspector he walked around the stall for a few\nmoments then went back to the wall and again pressed his head against the wall. The other pig would stand with his head\ndown to the ground and his breathing appeared shallow. He would then slowly fall to his side and move his legs in a\nswimming motion on the ground. Both of these abnormal behaviors, and thin body condition of the pigs is concerning and\nmay indicate an underlying medical condition that needs to be diagnosed and treated.\nFor the health of these animals, the licensee must establish a relationship with an attending veterinarian who shall provide\nadequate veterinary care to his animals.\nCorrect by: Feb 4, 2022"
