While the footpads of the llamas\nwere positioned and oriented normally, the toenails were noticeably overgrown. The hindlimb hooves of the female\nzebu were also overgrown and longer than the forelimb hooves. The facility representative reported the llamas\u2019\nhooves are trimmed when they are sheared annually to avoid immobilizing and sedating them more than once.\nThey also stated the zebu\u2019s hoof trimming was postponed due to recent inclement weather.\nOvergrown hooves can lead to deformities in the bones of the feet as they can alter the conformation of the toes,\ncausing the toes to turn inappropriately. This can lead to pain and potential lameness. All animals needing feet\ntrimming should have their hooves trimmed in a timely manner, and as frequently as necessary for foot health."
