The licensee stated that this dog likes to lay on the wet concrete to cool\n\ndown.  The inspector observed wet, runny feces on the concrete in numerous covered outdoor enclosures.  A wet and \nfeces contaminated hair coat could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dog. \n \nThe primary enclosures must be designed to enable the dogs and cats to remain dry and clean.  The licensee must alter \nthe enclosure in a manner that will keep the dog clean and dry in order to support its health and well-being. \n \nTo be corrected by:  End of business 30-July-2021 \n3.10(a)  Direct Repeat\n   \nWatering \nNumerous dogs throughout the facility have no potable water.  Approximately 2 adult dogs housed in the sheltered \nhousing building and 8 dogs housed in the horse barn had no water in their water receptacles.  Approximately 22 dogs \nhoused in the outdoor enclosures had either a large amount of dirt in their water receptacle or the water receptacle had a \ncoating of green algae with small pieces of algae floating in the water.   The dogs were observed standing and sitting in \ntheir water receptacles along with digging the water out of the receptacles.   The dogs were also observed drinking the \ncontaminated water.  The temperatures taken throughout the facility ranged from 92 -97 degrees F with a heat index up to \n119 degrees F. \n \nFailure to provide potable water could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs. \n \nPotable water must be continuously available to the dogs.  The licensee must provide potable water to the dogs and \nensure they have access to potable water at all times. \n3.11(b)(2)  Direct Repeat\n\nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nTen adult dogs are housed in a building across from the horse barn and there is a thick, heavy buildup of hair, spilled \nfood, moldy food, used and unused wood shavings, organic waste and liquids along the front edge of each enclosure.  An \nexcessively large number of flies were located on this buildup of material. \n \nSeventeen adult dogs and 19 puppies are housed in horse stalls inside a barn.  The floors of the enclosures are consist of \na thick layer of dirt mixed with old dog feces, fresh dog feces, bits of straw, and what appears to be old horse manure.   \nThe dirt and feces mixture covers the entire floor space and the dogs have no ability to escape from this contaminated \nflooring material and must be in contact with it at all times.  None of the dogs have access to a clean, sanitized floor \nspace.   The dirt, straw and feces cannot be sanitized and sunlight is unable to hit the flooring in any of the horse stalls \nresulting in the dogs potential being in direct contact with disease causing agents at all times. \n \nThe upper half of the horse stalls consist of metal bars which have an excessively large amount of cobwebs attached to \nthem.  The cobwebs are brown and appear to have trapped a large amount of dust and dirt.  Failure to properly sanitize \nthe enclosures could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs. \n \nUsed primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 \nweeks.  The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that allows for sanitizing of this surface in order to decrease the \nrisk of disease towards the dogs.  The licensee must remove the buildup of waste materials and sanitize all surfaces as \nwell as ensure that all surfaces of primary enclosures are capable of being sanitized at all times. \n3.11(d)  Repeat\n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.\n\nThe licensee is housing 10 adult dogs in a building which has not been presented to APHIS officials at previous \ninspections.  An excessively large number of flies are located in this building.  The majority of the flies are located near \nthe front of each enclosure where there is a large amount of organic material, spilled food and moldy food, and spilled \nwater.  The flies were observed on the gates of the enclosures, on the walls, in the food receptacles and on the dogs.  \nThe inspector did not notice any fly control methods in place inside the building.  An excessive number of flies could \nincrease the risk of disease towards the dogs. \n \nAn effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that \nare pests, must be established and maintained.  The licensee must establish an effective form of fly control in order to \ndecrease the risk of disease and support the health and well-being of the dogs. \n3.13(b)(2)  Repeat\n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nFemale Pomsky (tag #135) has a broken leg which has been treated by a licensed veterinarian.  No medical record exists \nof the treatment this dog received. \n \nA small, red poodle puppy is under veterinary treatment, but there is no medical record that exists of the treatment plan \nfor this puppy. \n \nDocumenting veterinary care concerns assists APHIS officials in confirming that problems have been identified and \ntreatment has been sought in a timely manner, as well as establishes a documented medical history for the animal. \n \nDealers must keep copies of medical records which include the date and description of the problem (such as disease,\n\nillness, or injury), examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. \nThe licensee must create a medical record for the Pomsky and the poodle puppy which includes a description of the \nanimal\u2019s problem, the date the problem was identified and the plan to treat the problem. The licensee must ensure that all \nveterinary care concerns are documented and maintained in a medical record and available for APHIS inspection. \n3.19(e)(1)  Direct Repeat\n   \nTerminal facilities. \nA female poodle is contained in a transport crate sitting along the driveway in direct sunlight.  The dog is showing signs of \nheat stress and the ambient temperature is 97 degrees F with a heat index of 119 degrees F according to the inspectors \nKestrel.  A heat advisory has been issued for the area.  Failure to provide protection from the direct rays of the sun could \ncause the dog to become overheated which could have a detrimental impact on their health and well-being. \n \nShade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the dog from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that \nall dogs housed in transport enclosures have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun in order to \nsupport their health and well-being. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative. \n \nEnd Section",
