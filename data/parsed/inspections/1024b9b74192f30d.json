Only a tub of water measuring 6' L x 5' W x 2' deep is provided in each enclosure. Additionally, the dry\nresting area does not provide sufficient amount of space when they are confined to their primary enclosures. These\nanimals are only allowed access to compliant pools of water and dry resting area(s) for limited times during the\nday/night.\nThe attending veterinarian has not provided a written justification as to why these animals cannot be afforded a\ncompliant MHD, pool of water, and dry resting area.\nMarine mammals that are isolated or separated for nonmedical purposes must be held in facilities that meet\nminimum space requirements as outlined in Sec. 3.104. Holding facilities used only for medical treatment and\nmedical training need not meet the minimum space requirements as outlined in Sec. 3.104. Holding of a marine\nmammal in a medical treatment or medical training enclosure that does not meet minimum space requirements for\nperiods longer than 2 weeks must be noted in the animal's medical record and the attending veterinarian must\nprovide a justification in the animal's medical record. If holding in such enclosures for medical treatment and/or\nmedical training is to last longer than 2 weeks, such extension must be justified in writing by the attending\nveterinarian on a weekly basis.\nCorrect by January 1, 2016\nThe exit interview was performed with the president.\nThis inspection was performed by Robert Brandes, D.V.M. & Bart Sutherland, D.V.M.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSutherland Bart, Veterinary Medical Officer"
