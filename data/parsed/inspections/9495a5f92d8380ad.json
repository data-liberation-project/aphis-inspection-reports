      "narrative": "Two young cats, a caracal and a serval have been declawed -- all four paws on each animal. The caracal is named\nJericho, DOB ~2/2015, and was declawed on 6/22/2015. The serval is Mondo, DOB ~4/2015, and was also\ndeclawed on 6/22/2015. The serval's paws look relatively normal, but the caracal has the misshapen toes and the\nfloppy-footed gait common in declawed animals. Conversation with the attending veterinarian indicated that not only\nwere these two cats declawed, the licensee also had a Geoffroy's Cat, Aziza, DOB 5/7/2015, and a bobcat,\nMeernah, DOB 5/25/2015, declawed on 7/27/2015. The Geoffroy's Cat is no longer at the facility. The bobcat is\nhoused next to the serval and caracal on the back porch.\nDeclawing can cause ongoing pain, discomfort, and other pathological conditions such as arthritis in the animals. In\naddition, it does not prevent predatory behaviors such as biting. The declawing of any wild or exotic carnivore does\nnot constitute appropriate veterinary care. A copy of the Declaw-Defang fact sheet and a copy of Policy 3, Vet Care,\nwere provided to the licensee at the first prelicense inspection for her original license on November 5, 2007. Another\nhard copy of that document was provided at this inspection, and the updated Policy 3 is being provided with this\ninspection report.\nCorrection date: immediately - licensees must not declaw animals for handling purposes."
