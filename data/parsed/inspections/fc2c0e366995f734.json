In addition, there is an overgrowth of\nweeds around the Whelping Building, and weeds are starting to be overgrown around the sheltered and outdoor\nhousing facilities.\nOvergrown weeds create a breeding ground and living area for pests, rodents, and other vermin causing possible\ndisease hazards to the dogs.\nThese weeds and grasses must be continuously controlled to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for\nrodents, pests, and other vermin. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of\ninsects, external parasites, and bird and mammal pests, to promote the health and well-being of the animals and to\nreduce contamination by pests in all animal areas as part of the facility\u2019s regular plan.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLundy Kendall, Animal Care Inspector"
