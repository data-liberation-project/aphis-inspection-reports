The right\neye has a grey spot (approximate pencil eraser size) located toward the outside edge of the pupil. The hair above\nthe left eye is vertically pulled over the eye and matted down into this crusted material around the lower eyelid,\ncausing the hair both above and below the eye to pull at the skin when the dog blinks or opens its eye. This crusted\nmaterial and hair also interferes with her ability to see. (DIRECT)\n* \"(cid:28)Luther\",(cid:29) a male Wheaton Terrier (#48345B3821) has an excessively matted hair coat. The dense hair matting\ndid not allow for matt separation to allow for skin visualization. Excessively twisted, densely matted hair covered and\ndangled off most of his body. This condition could promote and foster skin infections because of the trapped\ndebris/moisture and the lack of air circulation. The licensee must remove the matted hair from this dogs. A program\nof coat maintenance must be established and maintained to ensure that excessive hair matting does not occur.\n\"Luther\" also has an accumulation of green/brown material completely coating and obscuring the (cid:28)cheek teeth\" and\nmolars. This material is also present in various amounts on all the other teeth in the mouth. Gums are red, swollen,\nand receded to expose obscured tooth roots. Dental issues can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth/ mouth\nstructures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally. (DIRECT)\n* \"Wheaton Terrier\" (# 442E5C4763) has an accumulation of off-white/brown/grey material completely coating and\nobscuring the \"cheek teeth\" and molars. This material is also present in various amounts on all the other teeth in the\nmouth. Gums are deep red, swollen, and extremely receded to expose obscured tooth roots. There is a creamy\nwhite discharge along the gum line. Dental issues can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth/mouth structures,\nbe painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally. (DIRECT)\n* (cid:28)\"Mandy\",(cid:29) (# 093093000), a female King Charles Cavalier has a thick, cloudy discharge that is starting to\naccumulate around her eyes. The inside of the left ear appears red, inflamed and slightly thickened. The ear has a\nmoist, cream to yellow in color, discharge oozing in and around the ear canal. A foul odor is present when the ear is\nlifted. (DIRECT)\n*\"(cid:29)Mandy\"(cid:29) still has an accumulation of brown material completely coating and obscuring the \"cheek teeth \", molars\nand the canine teeth. The gums have receded away from the canine teeth and some of the molars exposing and\nallowing significant tooth root surface area to become encased in this brown material. This was cited on a previous\nreport. (DIRECT)\n* (cid:28)\"Mandy(cid:25)s\" toenails were excessively long and curving down toward the pad of her foot. The length of the toenails\ndid not allow for her to stand in a normal postural manner and could become caught in the enclosure and cause\ninjury. Licensee must ensure a method of nail trimming occurs in a timely manner to minimize excessive toenail\nlength and injury and to allow for normal postural stance. (DIRECT)\n** The above four dogs are under direct non-compliance and need to be seen by the attending veterinarian by\nC.O.B., 3-November-2014.\n* \"Raven,\" a female King Charles Cavalier (# 0A01784917) has a hazy appearance to the surface of both eyes. This\ndog(cid:25)s eyes were reevaluated July 10, 2014 and the previous treatment of applying Rugby Artificial Tears Ointment\nwas to continue. However, the overall appearance of the eyes has remained the same since July 7, 2014. There is\na buildup of green mucoid matter (moist to dry in appearance) on the surface of the left eye. There is also a thick,\nclumped, crusted green dried material that has matted the hair down around the entire eyelid of both eyes. The\naccumulation of green moist to dried discharge in and around the eyes may be indicative of infection, hinder the\neffectiveness of the artificial tears, cause skin irritation and pain to the dog. Due to the ongoing condition of the\neyes, the licensee must have this dog reevaluated by the veterinarian for additional veterinary care and a detailed\nappropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n* Upon initial inspection, \"(cid:28)Michael\"(cid:29) a male, Yorkshire Terrier (# 44346A593E) appeared to be squinting in the\noutdoor portion of the enclosure. Both eyes are entirely bluish-white in color, no pupil is visible and do not appear\nnormal. Licensee did not have any medical treatment/ diagnosis available with regard to this condition. Michael also\nhas long toenails that do not allow him to stand in a normal manner. Licensee must ensure a method of nail\ntrimming occurs in a timely manner to minimize excessive toenail length and allow for proper postural stance.\n* (cid:28) \"My Marshmellow(cid:29)\" (# 4A3A1C033B), a female Bichon Frise had excessively long toenails that were starting to\ncurve around.
