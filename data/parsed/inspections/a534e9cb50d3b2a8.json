When the animal was first separated by the lab on Friday 6/21/24 and returned to\nhousing on the afternoon of Monday 6/24/24, a water bottle was present. Staff stated that it is unclear what happened to\nthe water bottle between Monday afternoon and Tuesday, when the animal was found dead. A necropsy was performed\nand results concluded that the animal was dehydrated and most likely died due to an absence of water. Appropriate\ncorrective actions, including more daily checks, an additional checklist to verify if there is a water bottle present, and\nincreasing the QA/QC program were established immediately by the facility. Potable water must be provided as often as\nnecessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
