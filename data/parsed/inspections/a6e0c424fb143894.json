Veterinary treatment was provided to Lauren by the Attending Veterinarian. Lauren was found dead the\nmorning of May 28, 2022 due to injuries and stress of the incident.\nAll enclosures must be constructed to contain the animals and to prevent injury or harm to the animals.\nCorrected prior to the time of inspection. Immediately after the incident, double padlocks were used on the gate and two\npersonnel were present when gate was used until the gate was permanently welded shut to prevent reoccurrence.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nn"
