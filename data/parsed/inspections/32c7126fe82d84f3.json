The AC inspectors then investigated the\ncircumstances surrounding this incident. The event involved a male pig which underwent an abdominal surgical\nprocedure, and during closure of the surgical site the pig's urethra was accidentally ligated by incorporation into the\nsuture line. The condition was detected and treated appropriately by the veterinary staff, and the pig was humanely\neuthanized in a timely fashion. Upon further investigation, the IACUC concluded that the surgeon performing the\nprocedure was unfamiliar with male pig anatomy, as only females had been used previously, and that improper\ntraining to conduct this procedure on a male pig was a contributing factor to this adverse event. The IACUC then\nrequired the PI to ensure that training was sufficient to eliminate the possibility of another such adverse event, and\nthe PI voluntarily indicated that the surgeons involved in these experiments would no longer use male pigs.\nBecause an animal was prematurely euthanized due to an error in surgical training that was rectified subsequently\nby the IACUC, this constitutes a serious animal welfare incident.\nPersonnel must be adequately trained on conducting the procedures, taking into consideration species, anatomy,\netc.; it is the job of the IACUC to ensure that this training is adequate to prevent adverse surgical errors and avoid\nserious animal welfare impacts.\nThis incident had been fully investigated and corrected by the IACUC at the time of inspection.\nThe routine inspection, records review, and exit briefing was conducted with various responsible University of\nMichigan staff.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCampitelli D.V.M Kathryn, Veterinary Medical Officer"
