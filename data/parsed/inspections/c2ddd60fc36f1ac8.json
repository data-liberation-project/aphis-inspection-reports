At the time of the inspection there were six enclosures housing groups of rabbits that did not meet the minimum\nspace requirements when rabbits are housed in groups. Each rabbit housed in the six enclosures weighed at most\n1.4 kgs. There were four enclosures measuring 2.5 ft x 2 ft (5 sq ft of floor space) that contained 4 rabbits each and\nthere were two enclosures measuring 5 ft x 2 ft (10 sq ft of floor space) that contained 9 rabbits each. Rabbits that\nweigh 2 kgs or less require a minimum of 1.5 square feet of floor space when they are housed individually or in\ngroups. Therefore enclosures that provide 5 sq feet of floor space can hold no more than 3 rabbits and enclosures\nthat provide 10 sq feet of floor space can hold no more than 6 rabbits.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount\nof floor space based on the weight of each individual animal. The provision of a minimum amount of floor space is\nimportant to an animal's health and well-being as it allows each rabbit sufficient space to make normal postural and\nsocial adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.\nThe facility needs to transfer some of these rabbits to other enclosures and ensure that any rabbit weighing up to 2\nkgs is housed in an enclosure that provides a minimum of 1.5 sq feet of floor space per rabbit whether it is housed\nindividually or in a group.\nCorrect by 6/6/14.\nNOTE - Exit interview held 5/29/14 on-site with facility representative.
