This raccoon was interacting and touching noses with at\nleast one of the licensee's raccoons through its cage wire. Because this facility does not currently have a perimeter fence,\nthis animal was allowed to directly contact and potentially spread disease to the covered animals. In addition to this\ndisease hazard, the lack of a perimeter fence does not allow for a secondary form of containment in the event of an\nescape of dangerous or exotic species. In addition, there are no physical barriers in place that would prevent unwanted\nanimals or people from walking directly up to an enclosure and making contact with the animals contained therein. The\nlicensee must ensure a perimeter fence is properly in place or apply and receive approval for a variance from the\nAdministrator for all species that require a perimeter fence."
