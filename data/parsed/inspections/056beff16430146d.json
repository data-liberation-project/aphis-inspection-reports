There were problems with three of these shipments:\nOne dog on waybill # 016-SFO-30890156 headed to Fort Lauderdale on UA Flight 1094: The consignor did not\nprovide any instructions for feeding and watering during transit.\nOne cat on waybill # 016-SFO-45632996 headed to Honolulu on UA Flight 300: Regarding instructions for feeding\nand watering during transit, the consignor filled in the time and date for feeding and watering with the \"null\" symbol.\nAdditionally, although the consignor\u2019s certification was signed by the consignor at \"9:30\" on \"11/1/17\", it stated that\nthe cat had last been offered food and water on \"31/10/17\" at \"12:00\" - suggesting either 9.5 or 21.5 hours prior to\nleaving the cat with the transporter.\nOne dog on baggage tag # 5-16-254498, that had originated from Spokane, and was headed to Frankfurt via UA\nFlights 58 and 1602: The consignor did not provide any instructions for feeding and watering during transit, nor did\nthey indicate the last time the animal was offered food and water.\nUpon accepting an animal for transport, the carrier must ensure that the consignor has provided the required\ninformation regarding feeding and watering, specifically there must be a certification from the consignor in writing\nthat the dog or cat was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the carrier, to include the time\nand date the animal was last fed and watered and the specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for\na 24-hour period. This certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a manner\nthat makes it easily noticed and read. Instructions for no food or water are not acceptable unless directed by the\nattending veterinarian, in which case this should be clearly visible on the certification.\nFailure to ensure that this information is collected and attached to the carrier could be detrimental to the health and\nwell-being of the animals while in transit.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives in the United Cargo Office."
