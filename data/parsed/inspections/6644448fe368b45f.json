The licensee was unable to provide the exact numbers of animals on hand at the facility. He stated that his\nrecord of animals on hand was what was provided to him on the animal inventory from the last APHIS inspection.\nInspection report inventories do not meet the regulatory requirements for record of animals on hand since they do not\ncontain where the animals were acquired from, the date of acquisition, etc. The facility is still not tracking offspring born at\nthe facility. The licensee previously stated that he does not record births until the animals are separated from their\nmothers for sale (and then only tracks through sales receipts). The licensee acknowledged that records of animals\nincluding deaths and euthanasia have not been recorded. The licensee stated that the white mink identified on the prior\ninspection was euthanized following examination by a veterinarian, however, there is no record of this euthanasia. The\nlicensee was able to produce several sales records of animals disposed of since the last inspection and two records of\nacquisition. One of the two records of acquisition did not contain the address or USDA License number of the person\nfrom whom the animals were acquired.\nFailure to maintain disposition record such as records of pre-weaning deaths prevents the licensee, attending\nveterinarian, and APHIS Officials from evaluating mortality to determine possible causes and/or compliance with the\nAWA. Failure to maintain complete and accurate records of acquisitions, dispositions, and record of animals on hand\nprevents APHIS officials from tracing animal movement and from completely assessing other aspects of compliance with\nthe AWA. Correct by ensuring that the facility maintains complete and accurate records of all animals on hand, all animal\nacquisitions (including the total offspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control) and animal\ndispositions (including those which die, are euthanized, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of). These records must\ninclude all information required by this section, must be maintained in an accurate and timely manner, and must be made\navailable for inspection by APHIS officials."
