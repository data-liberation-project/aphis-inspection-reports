Additionally, the perimeter fence must be at least three\nfeet from the enclosure fence to prevent contact through the fencing. At the time of this inspection the following\nproblem was observed:\n- A gate in the perimeter fence, which serves as the parking exit, is left open and unattended throughout the day.\nWhereas the entrance gate is visible to the nearby office area, and employees are available to monitor and close\nthe gate if needed, this exit gate is more remote, and not easily monitored. The gate is just behind the primary\nenclosures for cheetahs and striped hyenas.\nFailure to provide an adequate perimeter fence could put the well-being of the animals at risk, due to the possibility\nof harmful unauthorized contact with people or animals, including exposure to animals that could introduce\ndiseases, and also due to the risk of inadequate containment in the event of an escape. The facility should continue\nwith its plan to complete the perimeter fence and bring all sections into compliance.\nThis inspection was conducted 3/13 - 3/14/19, with an exit interview on 3/19/19. The inspection and exit interview\nwere conducted with facility representatives."
