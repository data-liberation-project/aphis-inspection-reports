The facility currently houses large felines\nand bears that require a perimeter fence of at least 8 feet in height. The bamboo growth on the outside of the fence has\nbeen damaged and is dying. The dying bamboo growth is leaning against the fence and the weight of the bamboo mass is\npushing the fence down toward the facility. The fence is at a slope with a height of only six feet in the affected area. One\nof the 2 inch metal posts has collapsed and broken under the weight. The facility has already shored up one section of the\naffected fence by adding large utility poles as posts to help hold the weight. However, an additional section of the fence is\nnow affected needing structural support and based on the appearance of the bamboo (brown, dying bamboo) other\nsections will need additional structural strength added in the near future. A structurally intact perimeter fence of at least\neight feet in height is necessary to keep out unwanted people and animals and to act as a secondary method of\ncontainment. The facility shall ensure that the housing facilities are enclosed by a structurally sound perimeter fence at\nleast eight feet high. Correct by Oct. 18, 2022.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
