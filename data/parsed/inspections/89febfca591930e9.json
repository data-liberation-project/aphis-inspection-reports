The\nattending veterinarian's medical notes indicate the body condition score had declined from the last time she had seen the\nanimal and now there was tissue necrosis around the open fracture site. She recommended euthanasia due to very\ndeclining body condition and ongoing infection in the leg. She stated to the USDA inspector that she believed the ranch\nmanger would euthanize the animal as she had instructed. On 7/13/2023 , she inquired about the wildebeest and the\nranch manager stated that he had not euthanized the wildebeest because the licensee did not want the animal\neuthanized. The attending veterinarian's medical records state that the licensee was contacted and the poor prognosis\nand concerns for animal welfare were discussed with the licensee . The licensee did not agree to euthanize the animal but\nrequested surgical amputation knowing it would be conducted under field conditions and would result in distress to the\nanimal. The licensee stated to the USDA inspector that the surgery was performed because the animal was very valuable\nand he was trying to save her for financial concerns. The recommended treatment of euthanasia by the attending\nveterinarian was not followed and as a result this animal had a major surgical procedure in a non-sterile area and died 30\nhours later. The attending veterinarian must have the appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary\ncare.\nCORRECT BY : 7/25/2023"

Despite treatment there was no improvement and the attending veterinarian and ranch employees\nmade the decision to euthanize the impala. Records indicate that 20 mg Sucostrin ( succinylcholine ) was used for\neuthanasia and administered by a ranch employee.

When asked by the USDA inspector , the attending veterinarian confirmed she did not\norder the animal to be destroyed with succinylcholine and did not approve this method.
