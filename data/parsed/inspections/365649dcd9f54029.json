The pig was in the catch shoot for a prolonged\namount of time, became stressed, and it escaped the outdoor enclosure before it could be medicated for sedation. After\nmultiple failed attempts to catch it, the decision was made to euthanize the pig by gunshot. The prolonged time in the\nsqueeze shoot caused the pig significant behavioral stress and led to its eventual untimely death. While the pig was\nintended for a non-recovery procedure, the early euthanasia reduced its value to the study. Handling of all animals must\nbe done as quickly and carefully as possible so as not to cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary\ndiscomfort. The registrant has already consulted with their attending veterinarian and made appropriate changes to their\nhousing and handling SOPs to prevent a future recurrence.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nEnd Section"
