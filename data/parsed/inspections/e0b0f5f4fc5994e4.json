Since the dogs arrive at the facility with an original tattoo from the vendor in one ear and\nthen are given the additional three digit identifier while at the facility, combining the tattoo numbers gives each\nanimal a separate ID number. This system is okay as long as both numbers are referred to in the animal records.\nSome of the animal records reviewed only refer to the three digit ID given at the facility, which may be on more than\none dog, creating confusion when connecting the animal records to the individual dogs. Both numbers will need to\nbe referred to on the animal records to prevent misidentification. Correct by August 31, 2015."
