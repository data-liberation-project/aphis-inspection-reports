      "narrative": "On inspection, the chain link fencing between the outdoor runs of the kennel was determined to be in disrepair with\nnumerous sharp wire ends protruding inside the enclosure. Seven of the chain link fences used in between the\noutdoor runs had multiple areas of numerous loose wires that had become unraveled and were protruding inside the\nrun. The ends of the wires were sharp to the touch and easily cut through an exam glove. The chain link fencing for\nthree fence-lines had such significant deterioration that the dogs inside the runs could and did cross in between\nindividual runs. Adult Siberian Huskies were observed crouching down and tunneling through the fence to the\nadjacent run. No cuts or injuries were observed on any of the animals. The licensee has been transiting the kennel\nfrom chain link fencing to a stronger metal fencing and has both the fencing and materials to replace the disrepair\nfences. Sharp points or jagged edges could cause injury and pain to an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to\nbreak off and be eaten. Additionally, compatible housing may not be able to be maintained if animals are crossing\nover into separate runs. All housing surfaces of the facility must be free of all sharp points, edges, and must contain\nthe animals in the separate runs. Monitor all wire fences to ensure loose wires are removed and could not harm\nany animals. Corrected at time of inspection."

It was overcast and cool with a moderate\nbreeze. Accumulation of feces and other waste prevents proper sanitation and odor control. Furthermore, the\naccumulation of waste encourages flies and other pest to live and grow near the animals.
