Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest\nupon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence.

Primary enclosures must be constructed in\na manner that will ensure containment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and behavioral\ncharacteristics of exotic cats, the height of the enclosure must be extended at least 4 feet in height or the top of the\nenclosure modified with an appropriate overhang to minimize the potential of an animal escape.\nNOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014."

Additional space and elevated structures for climbing and resting and an appropriate water\nfeature should be added to the enclosure to allow the animals to demonstrate species typical behavior and to\nimprove their psychological well-being.\nNOTE: Progress has been made on the construction of the new bear enclosure. Upon completion the bear\nenclosure will provide additional space and structures to encourage species typical behavior.\nTiger Enclosure:\n***The three (3) tigers are housed in a 30\u2019 x 40\u2019 x 10\u2019 closed top enclosure with a dirt and gravel and a single\nelevated structure. No water feature is available for swim-like activity. No changes have been to the enclosure\nsince the last inspection that would increase the size of the enclosure or that would allow the tigers to demonstrate\nmore species typical behavior. Tigers often engage in running, climbing, jumping, and water play. Tigers should be\nhoused in an enclosure with adequate space and structures that allows them to engage in natural behaviors. The\ncurrent enclosure must be modified or husbandry practices adjusted in a manner that will allow the tigers to jump,\nclimb, run and engage in water activities to improve their level of activity and to prevent abnormal behavior patterns.\nNOTE: Work on the construction of the new enclosure has not progressed since the last inspection due to other\nprojects and weather conditions."
