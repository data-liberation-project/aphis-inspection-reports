A portion of the\nwire fencing is lying on top of the ground and may entrap an animal's feet if they step on it. The sagging portion\nmakes the fence too low in height and isn't sound/strong. One young llama came to the fence and laid the upper\nhalf of his body over the fence while greeting us. The topline of this fence has some sharp points present where the\nsagging wire fencing came under strain. The sharp points need to be repaired or removed.\n2) The metal sheet forming the roof of a low shelter structure is damaged with a couple of corners bent downward\nand one corner appears loose. Sharp edges are present at animal height and present an injury hazard.\nThe outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Correct by 4/24/15."
