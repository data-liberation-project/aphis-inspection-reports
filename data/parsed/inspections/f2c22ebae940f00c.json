An adult brown and white guinea pig in pen 36 was observed with\nboth front feet that were moderately swollen. The left front foot had a swollen area approximately 1 inch in size and the\nright front foot had a swollen area approximately .75 inches in size in the foot pad area. The skin in the area appeared\npinkish red in color and there was a circular area approximately .25 inches in size on the underside of each pad that was\nbrownish in color where the skin appeared worn away. The guinea pig was observed to sit with most of its weight on the\nback feet and was reluctant to place weight on the front feet. The Program of Veterinary Care did not contain any\ninstructions on treatment of the condition.\nSwollen feet can be painful and if caused by an infection, can worsen and spread to other parts of the body and result in\nother health issues. Delays in providing appropriate veterinary care for health conditions can result in worsening of the\ncondition and potentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature.\nThe licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate this animal and determine an appropriate plan\nfor diagnosis and treatment.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
