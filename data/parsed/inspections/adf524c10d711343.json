The tigers range in size from 350+lbs for the\nfemale Lilly and 500+lbs for the male Tony.\nThe obesity of the two tigers due to the diet regimen they are currently on, has allowed these animals to become very\nobese which can cause serious health issues and increases the likelihood of long term health issues. The facility\ndescribed the tigers weight as being 'mighty' and did not agree that the tigers were that over weight by more than a few\npound, and that they would just lose it in the summer. This situation and their response highlight the lack of knowledge\nand experience in the raising and maintaining of tigers in a healthy weight range.\nThe risky behaviors include allowing the tigers to stand on their back feet putting their paws onto the volunteers' shoulders\nwhile they feed them a bottle. One photo shows a woman with a tiger standing in front of her with its paws on her\nshoulders as she stands against a wooden post, and the tiger is taller than her. This same volunteer is also shown\nfeeding a tiger a boiled egg out of her mouth, encouraging/allowing the tiger to take the egg from her using its mouth.\nThere is a male volunteer who allows himself to be sandwiched between both the male and female tigers at the same\ntime while he takes a photo. There are photos of this same man allowing a tiger to stand behind him and lick/mouth the\ntop of his head.\nWhile the owner chooses to routinely partake in these risky behaviors after continuous warning of the safety risks by the\nUSDA, he advised inspectors one year prior that he would not allow his volunteers to do what he does. The owner stated\nthat he now feels that he has adequate knowledge/experience to train the few volunteers he allows to do these activities\nbecause he raised the tigers from cubs and the older tiger is now 2 yrs old. The owner stated his training consists of him\nallowing the volunteers into the primary enclosure and watching his interactions with the tigers and talking to the\nvolunteers. He stated it is a 'do as I say, not as I do kind of thing'.\nThe owner of the tigers has not received any recognized training with tigers since their arrival as cubs. He has two years\nof raising them, as he stated 'learning as he goes'. The manager has cub experience only and minimal experience with\nadult tigers. Neither owner nor manager demonstrate adequate experience or knowledge to maintain adult tigers.\nThe response of the owner advising it is ok to allow and encourage some volunteers to partake in the same risky handling\nhe practices, shows the lack of experience and knowledge of this dangerous animal by all those involved.\nAll licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the species\nthey maintain."

      "narrative": "During the inspection a tour was being conducted by a facility volunteer with a group of three adults and three children.\nThe group was brought up to the cougar enclosure with a male cougar (Mercury), approximately 4 months old that was\nsitting on a shelf along the chicken wire fencing at the side of the enclosure. The young girl (approx.7-9yrs old) put her\nfingers through the chicken wire to pet the cougar, while the keeper stood approximately 4ft away watching her. The\ncougar was biting at the wire and mouthing anything put through the fence. When the keeper observed the inspectors\nwatching the child, he advised the group they were being 'spied on' and the one adult pushed the girls hand away from\nthe cage. The girl promptly put her fingers through the wire again to touch the animal before they moved on.\nAt this time, the situation was pointed out to the licensee who advised he did not think it was a problem since the keeper\nwas near by and the group was probably going in to pet the cougar later anyway. He felt there was no difference between\nthe little girl sticking her fingers into the enclosure to attempt to pet the cougar than if she was going inside the enclosure\nto pet the cougar. It was explained that a young carnivore might view fingers coming through the wire in its enclosure\nquite differently than when a trained, knowledgeable person had direct control of it. And, if there are no barriers to prevent\nthe public from coming into contact with the regulated animals, then the guides should not be allowing contact with\ndangerous animals that they have no direct control over. If the cougar decided to bite the fingers, there is nothing the\nguide could have done to stop it.\nThis is an example of the lack of experience and knowledge of the facility owner and volunteers when allowing the public\nto interact with dangerous animals. The requirement for the keepers to have direct control over the handling of dangerous\nanimals during public contact has been discussed multiple times with the licensee and volunteers by several inspectors.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals\nand the public. If there is direct contact with dangerous animals the keepers must have direct control and adequate\nknowledge and experience with those animals."

The level of the water was too low for them to utilize, since a domestic cat will not tend\nto drop down over 4 inches into a container, placing their feet into the water to be able to drink. The other bowls in the\nenclosure used for food were empty and there was no water available in any of those bowls. When the licensee was\nasked to put water in a bowl and put it in the enclosure, over 6 cats surrounded the water bowl, with three immediately\ndrinking from it while others waited their turn. One of the cats (the one still exhibiting upper respirator signs) drank for 5\nminutes while another drank for 4 minutes and a 3rd cat for almost another 4 minutes.\nDue to the reactions of multiple cats to the fresh water being brought in during the inspection, it is obvious that fresh,\npotable water is not being offered often enough, or in suitable containers for them to drink as often as necessary to\nensure their health and well-being.\nThe lack of potable and accessible water can be a source of stress and possible illness and kidney issues if not provided\nas often as needed to the regulated animals.\nIf potable water is not continuously available to the cats, it must be offered to the cats as often as necessary to ensure\ntheir health and well-being.\nWater was given at the inspectors request during the inspection and needs to be provided often enough from this day\nforward."

Not having adequate \nshelter could further compromise the health of sick animals. \n \nThe lack of enough shelter for the cats could be a source of stress from environmental elements that could cause or \npromote illness in the animal population. \n \nOutdoor facilities for cats must include enough shelter structures that are accessible to each animal that are large enough \nto allow each animal in the shelter structure at the same time to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about \nfreely. \n \nThe licensee provided additional shelter boxes to house the remaining cats by the time of the exit interview on 3-16-21. \n3.10(b)  Direct\n   \nWatering \nThe main water bucket that was being used for the cats had sides that were too high (approx. 12 inches high with a water \nlevel of approx. 4 inches inside).  The level of the water was too low for them to utilize, since a domestic cat will not tend \nto drop down over 4 inches into a container, placing their feet into the water to be able to drink. The other bowls in the \nenclosure used for food were empty and there was no water available in any of those bowls. When the licensee was \nasked to put water in a bowl and put it in the enclosure, over 6 cats surrounded the water bowl, with three immediately \ndrinking from it while others waited their turn. One of the cats (the one still exhibiting upper respirator signs) drank for 5 \nminutes while another drank for 4 minutes and a 3rd cat for almost another 4 minutes. \n \nDue to the reactions of multiple cats to the fresh water being brought in during the inspection, it is obvious that fresh,\n\npotable water is not being offered often enough, or in suitable containers for them to drink as often as necessary to \nensure their health and well-being. \n \nThe lack of potable and accessible water can be a source of stress and possible illness and kidney issues if not provided \nas often as needed to the regulated animals. \n \nIf potable water is not continuously available to the cats, it must be offered to the cats as often as necessary to ensure \ntheir health and well-being. \n \nWater was given at the inspectors request during the inspection and needs to be provided often enough from this day \nforward. \n3.75(c)(1)  Repeat\n   \nHousing facilities, general. \nThere are surfaces in multiple non-human primate primary enclosures that are made of unsealed wood materials. There is \na buildup of old food, oils or dirt and debris that is soaked into the well used areas of some of the wood surfaces. It is \nimpossible to clean/sanitize unsealed wood surfaces. The walls and nest boxes in the squirrel monkey and marmoset \nenclosure, the wall in the ruffed lemur and the shelves and perches in the Japanese snow macaque area have not been \nsealed and are made of raw wood. The painted/sealed wooden shelves in the enclosure of two ring-tailed lemurs has \nbeen chewed exposing raw wood areas that cannot be sanitized. The ropes that have been attached inside some of the \nenclosures are dark black and brown with grime and need to be cleaned or replaced. The licensee advised the ropes had \nbeen sitting in the dirt in the yard for a month and he put them in the enclosures as they were. The ropes have not been \ncleaned to remove the dirt and grime since they were put up.\n\nUnsealed wood or surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be cleaned and sanitized properly. If they cannot \nbe cleaned and sanitized appropriately, they must be replaced. Soiled surfaces can be a source of bacteria and cause \npossible health related issues if not cleaned or replaced regularly. \n \nThe surfaces of housing facilities - including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type \nfixtures or objects within the facility - must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily \ncleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. \n \nTo be corrected by: April 15, 2021 \n \nThe licensee washed the dirty ropes for the squirrel monkey and marmoset and painted the wood surfaces in the \nmarmoset enclosure by the time of the exit interview on 3-16-21. \n3.78(e)  Repeat\n   \nOutdoor housing facilities. \nThe Japanese macaque (snow monkey) (Dexter) was used for public handling over the summer/fall months of 2020 \nwhere the public was allowed full contact with the animal while not in direct control of a trained keeper. The macaque was \nallowed to move around the room, climbing onto peoples' laps, sitting on top of children's shoulders and get close to \nyoung children and adults in a face to face manner while a leash hung to the floor. There is no direct control of the \nmonkey by a trained keeper during this exhibition. \n \nThe lack of direct control over a non-human primate during public exhibitions can be a potential for injury to the animal or\n\npublic if the animal panics or gets overly excited while climbing onto peoples' laps, shoulders and within face to face \ncontact of members of the public. There is no way to get control of the animal in a timely manner if the leash is hanging \ndown onto the floor being pulled along by the animal without a trained keeper holding onto it. \n \nWhen a nonhuman primate is allowed contact with the general public, it must be under the direct control and supervision \nof an experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is present. Trained nonhuman primates may be allowed \nphysical contact with the public, but only if they are under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or \ntrainer at all times during the contact. \n \nThe licensee advised they are no longer conducting public handling interactions with the macaque. \n3.81  Repeat\n   \nEnvironment enhancement to promote psychological well-being. \nThe environmental enrichment and enhancement plans for the primates have been written up by the facility, however they \nhave not yet been directed by the attending veterinarian. This is especially important for the primates that are being \nhoused separately with no physical contact with other primates (marmoset and squirrel monkey) to assure that the \nanimals are being housed in a manner that is physically adequate and meets behavioral needs of the animals. \n \nA veterinarian directed, documented and adhered to enrichment/enhancement plan for the non-human primates is \nessential for their health and well being. \n \nThe licensee must provide a plan that is directed by the attending veterinarian that addresses all sections of this \nregulation, and it must be followed by the facility.\n\n3.127(b) \n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nThere is a Geoffroy's cat and prehensile tailed porcupine that are housed in primary enclosures that do not provide any \nsort of hide or shelter box/log for the animal to seek shelter in. The porcupine's primary enclosure is a corn crib, and the \nprimary enclosure for the Geoffroy's cat  is open on two sides, so there is no protection from the wind, rain, snow or other \nclimatic elements that could stress the animals. \n \nThere is a fenced area holding 5 goats (2 currently at a neighbors with their kids) and 1 pig with four babies and 2 rheas. \nThere is only one wooden shelter box approximately 4'x8' by 2' in height to provide shelter to all of the animals in \ninclement weather or to provide shade. While the fenced enclosure has trees around the area, in the winter when the \nleaves are gone there is not another area of shade available under a shelter for all of the animals to fit comfortably. \n \nThere are two full grown tigers over 350-500 lbs according to the licensee, that have one shelter box that is too small for \nthem to fit into comfortably without having to crawl or contort in order to get inside. This concern was mentioned one year \nago as the tigers were showing signs of getting too big for that shelter box. The shelter box is shorter than they are tall \nand too small to allow for normal postural movements and does not allow for them to sit, stand and laydown comfortably. \nWhile their enclosure does have shade cloth on both ends on the top of the enclosure and metal sheeting on \napproximately 3-4ft wide on the south side(rd side) of the enclosure and a 12'x12' square on part of the roof area on the \nend of the second part of the enclosure, the current shelter box  located in the middle of the first enclosure area is not \nlarge enough to appropriately protect the tigers from inclement weather conditions. \n \nThe lack of proper shelter to provide a windbreak, protection from the elements (including temperatures) can be a source\n\nof possible health or behavioral issues. The shelters must be large enough for the number of animals to all be able to fit \ninto comfortably and be protected from the elements. \n \nNatural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all \nanimals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals. \n \nTo be corrected by: March 30, 2021 for the tiger shelter box \n \nThe licensee provided shelter for the Geoffroy's, prehensile tailed porcupine and an additional shelter box in goat/pig yard  \nthe following day on 3-11-21 and started working on making the tiger shelter larger. \n3.127(d)  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nThe eight foot perimeter fence surrounding the facility is still under construction. The South and East sides of the facility \nare still completely open with no fence structure to prevent animals from escaping the property. The North and NW part of \nthe property has a six foot perimeter fence, with the SW part of the property having an eight foot wooden fence behind the \ntiger, vervet and porcupine enclosures. \n \nAn eight foot perimeter fence is required for the two cougar and two tigers that are in outdoor primary enclosures on the \nfacility property due to being considered dangerous animals. \n \nThere is no six foot perimeter fence completely surrounding the non-dangerous animals as required. This requirement is \nfor animals such as the three badgers (bottom of the perimeter fence is not secured and open for animals to get under),\n\nthe two coati, Geoffroy's cat, bobcat and non-human primates. While a six foot perimeter fence and partial eight foot \nperimeter fence surround over half the facility, the remaining South and East sides are open which can allow any of these \nanimals to escape if they get out of their primary enclosures, and allow other animals or people to gain entry into the \nfacility and make direct contact with the enclosures. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nREBECCA NANNEY, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER \nSUSAN KINGSTON n",
