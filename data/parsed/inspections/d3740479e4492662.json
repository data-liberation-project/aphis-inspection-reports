A guinea pig wrapped for an IACUC approved activity on 8 February 2024 was found dead on 9\nFebruary 2024. Pathology indicated the cause of death was compromised breathing likely due to wrapping the guinea pig\ntoo tight.\n- On 22 February 2024 an incident was self-reported to the IACUC committee regarding a rabbit on an IACUC approved\nactivity. On 22 February 2024 a rabbit jumped from its primary enclosure located in the top row during provision of feed,\nwater and enrichment by animal care staff. Upon veterinary examination the rabbit had suffered a small laceration its\nupper left lip and a mild contusion. Adequate veterinary care was provided until the rabbit healed from 22 February to 1\nMarch 2024.\n- On 6 December 2023 an incident was self-reported to the IACUC committee regarding a guinea pig on an IACUC\napproved activity. On 6 December 2023 a guinea pig was found deceased by animal care staff after being wrapped\nfollowing the approved protocol. On 4 December 2023 and 5 December 2023, the animal was observed normal.\nPathology performed on the guinea pig indicated hemothorax, suspected due to the wrap being too tight.\n- On 6 October 2023 an incident was self-reported to the IACUC committee regarding 3 rabbits on an IACUC approved\nactivity. On 6 October 2023 a technician performing sedation for a euthanasia procedure in accordance with the IACUC\napproved protocol indicated she administered Euthasol subcutaneously instead of the ketamine/acepromazine sedation\nthat should have been administered. The technician contacted the veterinarian who administered the\nketamine/acepromazine sedation and subsequently euthanized the animals with Euthasol administered intravenously.\nThe facility was unable to ensure that all personnel involved in the care, treatment and use of the above documented\nanimals were qualified to fulfill their responsibilities and be familiar with the procedures for these IACUC approved\nactivities, resulting in negative impact on the health and wellbeing of these animals. Develop and maintain a program of\ntraining and instruction to all scientists and all personnel involved with research activities that ensures that all personnel\nand members of research teams are trained and qualified to perform their duties and to follow procedures in IACUC\napproved activities so that research animals receive proper care.\nAll incidents documented above were investigated by the IACUC. Corrective measures had been implemented prior to\ninspection, to remain corrected from 16 September 2024 forward."

The rabbit was observed bleeding from the\nmouth. The rabbit was observed by the veterinarian and found be very anxious and to have a contusion between the two\nfront incisors. The rabbit was provided pain medication and received adequate veterinary care through recovery on 31\nMay 2024. The rabbit was provided a primary enclosure on the bottom bank and noted to animal care staff to be an\nanxious rabbit.\n- On 8 March 2024 an incident was self-reported to the IACUC committee regarding a guinea pig on an IACUC approved\nactivity. On 26 February 2024 a guinea pig was observed struggling during an IACUC approved procedure. Afterwards\nthe guinea pig was observed bleeding from the left nostril and crackling sounds when breathing. After examination from\nthe veterinarian, the guinea pig was euthanized due to poor prognosis. Cause of clinical signs was determined to be due\nto the head and chest being compressed too tightly during restraint.\n- On 4 March 2024 an incident was self-reported to the IACUC committee regarding a guinea pig on an IACUC approved\nactivity. A guinea pig was dropped while being handled by a technician. The guinea pig hit the side of the primary\nenclosure and a garbage bin before landing on the ground where bleeding from the mouth was observed. The guinea pig\nwas examined by the veterinarian and noted an injury to the nasal philtrum. The guinea pig was provided adequate\nveterinary care.\n- On 18 December 2023 an incident was self-reported to the IACUC committee regarding a rabbit on an IACUC approved\nactivity. On 18 December 2023 a rabbit was discovered bleeding from the nose and having respiratory distress after being\nremoved from the primary enclosure to be shaved for a procedure outlined in a IACUC approved protocol.
