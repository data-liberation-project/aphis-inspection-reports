The bleed schedules reviewed had two rabbits on every\nother week bleeds for 6 bleeds. The protocol says approximately 4 bleeds, and sometimes the course of the project\nis extended past that but there is no mention of monitoring the animal for additional bleeds.\nThere must be sufficient detail in the protocol for the IACUC to understand the use of the animals and evaluate the\nimpact of the research projects on the animal in order to approve the protocol.\nCorrection by 30 May, 2017\nExit briefing conducted with facility representative."
