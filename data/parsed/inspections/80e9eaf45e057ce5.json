The lack of full illumination of the primary\nenclosures can result in improper cleaning and sanitization due to the dirty surfaces not being seen in the dim and\npartial lighting of lanterns or headlamps. Maintenance issues can also be missed with limited lighting in the facility.\nThe licensee must provide enough illumination in all of the enclosures , in both barns that will allow for complete\nthoroughness in cleaning, sanitization and maintenance of the enclosures, as well as provide the ability to visually\nobserve all animals completely for any health issues.\nTo be corrected by: January 30, 2015"
