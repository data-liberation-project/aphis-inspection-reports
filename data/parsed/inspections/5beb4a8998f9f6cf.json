Heavy accumulations of bird excrement were also visible on the floor of the alley\nand on the sill plate between the wall studs on the north wall of the barn.

Accumulation of bird excrement may pose a disease risk to animals housed in the facility. An effective\npest control program must be developed to prevent continued infestation and contamination of the barn\nenvironment by birds. The accumulated bird excrement also needs to be removed or effectively mitigated to\nprevent continued contamination of the livestock housing environment. Relocation of livestock away from affected\nareas is recommended if cleanup of bird waste or control of bird infestation is deemed not possible by the\ninstitution.\nCorrect by 06-02-2018.\nUSDA facility inspections were conducted with the IACUC Coordinator and the Attending Veterinarian.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the IACUC Coordinator, the Attending Veterinarian and the IACUC\nChairperson"
