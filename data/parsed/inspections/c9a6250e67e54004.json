Once the animals had shifted, staff\nmembers locked the door between the rooms and conducted a visual check of the empty room and saw no animals.\nThen, one staff member entered the apparently empty room to begin cleaning. Unbeknownst to the staff member, one\nfemale chimpanzee was still lying in a hammock overhead, unseen. Once the staff member had entered the room to\nbegin cleaning, this chimpanzee climbed out of her hammock and exited the bedroom, entering an adjacent interior\nhallway which is not an animal living space. All staff members were able to exit the area and close all of the necessary\ndoors to prevent further movement of the animal. The facility\u2019s animal escape protocol was activated and the animal was\nsafety sedated and returned to a primary enclosure. The staff members and the animal were both unharmed by the\nincident, and staff members were subsequently re-trained on animal shifting and relevant safety protocols.\nAnimals who escape from their primary enclosures may be stressed, injured, lost, or may cause injury to nearby humans.\nCorrect by January 5th, 2022 by ensuring that animals are handled as carefully as possible, and in a manner that\nprevents escape and does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. The facility\ncorrected this issue prior to the inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, the Head of the Behavior Department, and the Head of the\nHusbandry Department. The exit briefing was conducted with the aforementioned personnel and the Clinical Veterinarian\nand the CEO.\nn"
