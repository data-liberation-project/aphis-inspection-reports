The sick vole was humanely euthanized.\nUpon being notified and in response to this information, the IACUC and AV immediately looked into the incident.\nIt was determined that husbandry staff had changed water bottles on all of the enclosures in the vole housing room\n2 days earlier but had failed to put a replacement bottle on 4 enclosures containing the 8 animals; in addition\nhusbandry staff failed to detect the lack of a water bottle on the 4 enclosures during the daily observations. As a\nresult the animals did not have access to water for 2 days.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including husbandry staff, should be\ndone as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm, behavioral stress, or unnecessary\ndiscomfort.\nThe research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to\nOLAW, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future. Corrective\nactions included but were not limited to implementing changes to SOPs related to animal care and husbandry\npractices and providing additional retraining of husbandry staff. No additional incidents have occurred.\nThis item has been appropriately addressed and corrected by the research facility."
