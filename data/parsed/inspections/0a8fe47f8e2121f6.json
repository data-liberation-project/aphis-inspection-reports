Rabbit (D-193) had an opaque white appearance with a disturbed surface covering its right\neye. The rabbit didn't exhibit any signs of distress or pain but there was some drainage from the eye. The second\nrabbit (H-721) had yellow crust and some drainage from his left eye which was completely sealed shut. Rabbit\n(D-374) had excessive drainage from the right eye and the skin beneath the hair appeared reddened with a crusty\nbrown substance around the edges. These conditions were noted at the previous inspection. The veterinarian has\nbeen contacted but the animals have not received any veterinary care as of yet. A mechanism for direct & frequent\ncaretaker communication is required so that timely information about the animals health may be conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian and the animals can receive treatment as expeditiously as possible.\nThis was a focused inspection of the veterinary care of the animals.\nThe inspection and exit interview was conducted with the animal caretaker."
