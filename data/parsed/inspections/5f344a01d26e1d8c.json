The primary enclosure is still intact, and the caretaker is taking additional measures to ensure the\nsafety of the animal. Two people live on the property and can see the enclosure from the house, and the property is\nsurrounded by a 5-6 foot property fence. The branch has been removed, the fence damage has already been\nassessed by a specialist, replacement parts are on order and the repair has been scheduled for January 8th.\nPerimeter fences must be greater than 8 ft high to act as secondary containment system for potentially dangerous\nanimals in the facility. The fence must be constructed and maintained so that it protects the animals in the facility by\nrestricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it.\nCorrection date 15 January, 2016\nExit Interview conducted with facility representative."
