      "narrative": "***In the petting zoo, one Boer goat and one pig had excessive hoof growth on their hind feet. The Boer goat had a\nslow gait and the pig would not stand on the hind feet.\n***A mature Aoudad ram that was housed with the Rhinoceros had extremely long hooves on both of his front feet\nand at least one of the hind feet (right). When exiting the barn, the ram had to kick his front feet in a high manner\nwhich caused a gait that was not normal. Once he crossed the mud area just outside of the barn, he knelt on his\nknees for a short period of time prior to regaining his balance to continue attempting to walk. Another Auodad in\nthis enclosure was observed with a gait that was not normal in both of the hind legs. This Auodad had high\nstepping, wide, spastic, swinging gait as it attempted to walk. A third Auodad in this enclosure was thin. Hip bones\nand a portion of the spinal bones were protruding. This Auodad also had a rough hair coat across the shoulders,\ndown the sides and to the top of the hips. The licensee stated that all of the hooves had been trimmed. The\nattending veterinarian was made aware in the past of the Auodad ram that presents with long hooves, yet this\ncontinues to be an issue for this animal. The licensee was unaware of the thin Auodad and the Auodad with the\nspastic gait.\n***Although the attending veterinarian was made aware of the Male Pere David's Deer that had a front left hoof that\nappeared to be twisted approximately 90 degrees outward from the other three hooves and had a long hoof on the\nlast report, there is no proof of direction for treatment for this issue. This male maneuvers with a limp on the affect\nleg.\n***A female goat in the nursery area had a large severely bilaterally deformed udder. The licensee stated she had\nmastitis last year when she kidded and he treated her. The inspector asked the licensee if the veterinarian had\nexamined this animal for the mastitis. The licensee stated the veterinarian had not examined this animal. Mastitis is\na painful and uncomfortable condition and this animal has a malformed udder likely secondary to an inappropriately\ntreated mastitis.\nThe attending veterinarian must be made aware of changes in animals health in order to adequately diagnose and\ntreat them. The licensee must have the above listed animals assessed by the attending veterinarian for appropriate\ndiagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must follow the treatment plan and assure that all of the animals are\nprovided with adequate veterinary care as required."
