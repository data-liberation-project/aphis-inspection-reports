      "narrative": "Two young sugar gliders were housed in one enclosure. Each had a \"leash\" around its neck. One of the sugar\ngliders was lying on the floor of the enclosure in one corner with its back to the wall and its abdomen exposed. In\naddition one of the front legs was extended in an abnormal posture not typical of a resting sugar glider. The facility\nrepresentative removed the sugar glider from the cage. It was obviously not used to being on a leash and was very\njumpy. It was able to walk normally on the table but when held would jump around. The facility representative\nexplained that she just started leash training these sugar gliders today and that by the end of the day they would act\ncalmly on a leash. Thirty minutes later one of the employees handed one of these sugar gliders on a leash to\nmember of the public on the other side of a long table from the employee. The sugar glider was agitated and\njumping around on the person. At one point, it jumped off the person and was dangling by the leash around its neck\nuntil the member of the public could figure out how to recapture it which was accomplished by reeling it in by its\nleash. This type of handling of an untrained animal by an untrained member of the public may lead to serious injury\nof the animal in addition to the distress caused to the animal. All handling of all animals shall be done as\nexpeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or\nunnecessary discomfort. Correct immediately."
