A Yorki that had\nrecently been groomed had feces stuck to the anal region that needed to be removed. Another Yorki had matted fur\naround the eyes that needs to be removed. Several dogs with short fur had long nails that need to be trimmed. One\nfemale Maltese was very thin and housed with a fat female Pug. It is highly possible the Pug is not allowing the\nMaltese to have access to the food. (the Maltese was moved to another enclosure at this time and given food)\nBased on the inspectors observations it seems evident that although the licensee's are walking through the kennel\nthey are missing some of these husbandry concerns. The method of daily observation needs to be addressed so\nthe animals with these types of issues are being identified and then the issues addressed in a timely manner.
