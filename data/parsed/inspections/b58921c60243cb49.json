      "narrative": "A white, adult, female Labrador identified by tattoo #71, has a problem with its left ear. There are several lacerations\non the top surface of the ear and around the dog's ear canal which appear to be layered in the flesh. A moist\nyellowish-green discharge is present and the area is warm to the touch. There is a dark brown crusty material\nmatted in the fur around the lesion and on the underside of the dog\u2019s left ear. The facility representative stated that\nhe was unaware of the dog\u2019s condition and that it has not received veterinary care.\nThere are two dogs (#36 female Shiba Inu and #12 female Labradoodle) with open wounds on their lower\nabdomens. The wounds run along the midline of the abdomen and are approximately two centimeters in length. The\nwounds are deep and create a hole through several layers of tissue. The tissue surrounding the wounds is bright\npink and there is a creamy yellow/red tinged discharge coming from the wounds. The abdomen surrounding the\nwound on #12 is very firm for several inches around the open wound. The facility representatives state that they had\nnot previously noticed the wounds.\nOne male Shih Tzu (#2 \u201cCole\u201d) has a cloudy left eye. There is a severely cloudy circular lesion on the surface of the\neye that is about 0.5 cm in size and is located in the middle of the eye. The remainder of the eye surrounding that\narea is moderately cloudy. The white of the eye is mildly reddened. There is a small amount of clear discharge\ncoming from the left eye. The facility representatives state that they had not previously noticed the cloudy eye.\nOne male English Bulldog (#14) has a small, approximately 1-1.5 cm long wound on the top of his right foot. The\nwound is located on top of one of his outer toes. The wound is deep through several layers of tissue. The tissues\nsurrounding the wound are bright pink/red and there is a creamy white/yellow discharge coming from the wound.\nThis dog also has a large mass on his chest. The mass is approximately 4 by 5 inches in size and protrudes off the\nsurface of the chest. The surface of the mass is uneven and is made up of multiple large and small firm lumps that\nare bright pink/red in color. There are brown to black crusts present on the surface of the mass and some areas are\nmoist with red-tinged fluid. In one area a moderate amount of creamy red discharge dripped from the mass.\nFemale Shiba Inu puppy (#116) was observed vomiting a yellow liquid. After vomiting, the puppy wrinkled up the\nsides of her snout and kept her eyes mostly closed. The puppy maintained this appearance throughout the time it\nwas evaluated. The puppy acted lethargic and when removed from the enclosure she hung limply when held.\nCloser observation revealed the puppy\u2019s gums were a pale purple to nearly white color. When placed back in the\nenclosure, the puppy stood still with her head lowered, eyes partially closed and appeared depressed.\nFemale Shiba Inu (#65) is non-weight bearing on her left front foot. She was observed holding her foot off the floor\nand licking the bottom of the foot. Closer evaluation of the animal\u2019s foot revealed a small, approximately 0.5 cm in\nsize, round abnormal growth on the bottom of the foot and it is located between the toes. The growth was red and a\ndischarge coming from it has stained the hair around the area a reddish color.\nFemale Shiba Inu (#81) has an abnormal growth between the toes of the right front foot. The growth was slightly\nwarm to the touch and was moderately red and swollen. The surface of the growth is moist with a slightly creamy\ndischarge present. The toenails of this dog have also become excessively long and were observed to lay sideways\nwhen the dog stood on the enclosure flooring.\nFemale Shiba Inu (#85) has an abnormal growth between the toes of her right front foot. The growth is hair-less,\nslightly purple to red in color, and approximately 0.5 by 1 cm in size."

The animals listed above\nmust be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an\nappropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and\nresolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee\nmust ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.\nFemale Labrador (#83), female Shiba Inu (#14) and female Wheaton terrier (#59) have excessively long toenails.\nOn all three of these dogs, the toenails have become so long that the toes and nails of the front feet were observed\nto lay sideways across the flooring.\nLong nails can be painful for the animal and can lead to further health complications. The licensee must ensure that\nall toenails are trimmed in order to prevent, control and treat injuries associated with long toenails.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, Heather Cole, VMO, Kelly Maxwell,\nACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and an APHIS Physical Security Manager.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist\nMaxwell Kelly, Animal Care Inspector"
