      "narrative": "Currently there is a 100lb sow in North side pen 13 that was recorded as having a completely swollen, fluid filled ear\non December 17, 2014 that was to be treated. Six days later the sow still has not received any treatment and the\near continues to be fluid filled and stretched to the limits of weight and size for that ear flap. Upon further inspection\nthere were two other medical issues that had not been observed by the facility Manager and had not been recorded\nor received treatment. There is an 80lb sow that is in the finishing barn South side pen 13 with a full right ear\nhematoma, or fluid filled ear. The sow had not been noticed with the issue until during the inspection. There is\nanother sow approximately 100lb in the North side pen 9 that has a bloody tail stump where the tail has been bitten\noff. During the inspection 3 other sows continued to bite and chew at her stump which continues to be bloody and\nraw. Two of the issues had not been observed until during the inspection, while the one recorded issues still has not\nbeen treated from 6 days prior. At this time the veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to these two health\nissues, and no treatments have been given.\nAny health issue that is left untreated can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animals. The\nlack of response can cause a treatable condition to become chronic or fatal if left undiagnosed and treated for long\nperiods of time depending on the original condition.\nThe veterinarian must be contacted to properly diagnose and treat any condition that is required. The licensee must\nmake sure all conditions are treated according to the veterinarians directions and procedures at all facilities.\nTo be corrected by: December 24, 2014"
