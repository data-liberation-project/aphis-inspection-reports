A hole approximately 2.5 x 2.5 inches wide is in \nthe bottom of the wire enclosure with sharp points extending into the hole. The rabbit could injure himself if his body, \nhead, or leg became caught in the opening. The primary enclosures for rabbits must be maintained in good repair to \nprotect the rabbits from injury, contain the animals, and restrict the entrance of other animals. \nCorrect by 05/10/2024. \n3.54(b) \n   \nFeeding. \nThe food receptacles for the rabbits are being cleaned weekly with soap and water, per a facility representative, but are \nnot being sanitized after cleaning. Without adequate sanitization there is a higher risk of large numbers of harmful germs \nremaining on the surfaces which creates a health hazard for the rabbits. Sanitization can be achieved by washing with hot \nwater (180 \u00b0F) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent \nsolution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame. Food and \nwater receptacles must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. \nCorrect by 06/01/2024. \n3.55 \n   \nWatering. \nMost of the light-colored water bottles for rabbits, attached to their outdoor primary enclosures, have a buildup of green \nmaterial coating the inside of the water bottle lixits and are in need of cleaning. Unclean and unsanitary drinking water can\n\ncause illness, discomfort, or may cause animals to drink less water leading to dehydration. Sufficient potable water shall \nbe provided daily, and all watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty and at least once every two weeks. \nSanitization can be achieved by washing with hot water (180 \u00b0F) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, \nor by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all \nsoiled surfaces with live steam or flame.  \nCorrect by 05/10/2024. \n3.56(a)(1) \n   \nSanitation. \nFour primary outdoor enclosures, each housing 4 rabbits, composed of wire mesh flooring and an attached wooden box \nshelter with a solid floor, are in need of cleaning. Per facility representatives, the enclosures are scraped weekly. A \nmoderate amount of feces and rabbit fur could be seen attached to the wire floor in two of the enclosures, collecting and \npiling up next to the food receptacle, unable to pass through the wire. In two other enclosures, the wooden floors of the \nshelters have more feces than bedding present. The accumulation of feces and dirty bedding can result in illness and \ndiscomfort thus having the potential to negatively impact the well-being of the rabbits. Primary enclosures housing rabbits \nmust be kept reasonably free of excreta and other debris by appropriate periodic cleaning.  \nCorrect by 06/01/2024. \n3.56(b)(1) \n   \nSanitation. \nThe primary outdoor enclosures for the rabbits, composed of wire mesh and an attached wooden or plastic shelter, \nelevated above the ground, are not being sanitized per facility representatives. They are currently scraped clean weekly \nwithout any detergent or sanitization products used. When enclosures are not sanitized adequately, there is a higher risk \nof large numbers of harmful germs remaining on the surfaces which creates a health hazard for the rabbits. Adequate \nsanitization of the rabbits' primary enclosures is necessary to prevent spread of disease and odors. The primary \nenclosures must be sanitized at least once every 30 days to reduce these risks and provide for the overall well-being of \nthe animals. \nCorrect by 06/01/2024. \n3.58(a) \n   \nClassification and separation. \nWhen exhibited during off site exhibitions, per a facility representative, rabbits are placed within an enclosure with other \nspecies of animals. When photos from the facility's social media page were shown to the facility representative depicting \nrabbits within a penned enclosure with goats and sheep in one photo, and in another photo, with ducks, chickens and \npigs, they confirmed that is how they have been exhibiting the rabbits. Rabbits housed in the same primary enclosure with \nother species of animals may cause harm or injury. Rabbits shall not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any \nother species in order to protect their health and well-being.  \nCorrect by 05/10/2024. \n3.84(b)(2) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.\n\nThe indoor primary enclosure for one male capuchin is not being sanitized per a facility representative. Instead, it is \ncleaned with detergent and a pressure washer once a month without any appropriate disinfectants used. The enclosure \nmust be adequately cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often, if necessary to prevent an \nexcessive accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, and excreta as well as to reduce disease hazards. Sanitization must \nbe done using one of the following methods: live steam under pressure, washing with soap and water of 180 degrees \nFahrenheit or with regular water plus a detergent and disinfectant. The indoor hon-human primate enclosure must be \nsanitized at least once every two weeks using one of the required methods.  \nCorrect by 06/01/2024. \n3.125(a) \n   \nFacilities, general. \nThe following outdoor enclosures either contain sharp points of wire protruding into the animals\u2019 primary enclosure or are \nin need of repair: \n\u2022 One enclosure of 9 pigs has chicken wire partially attached to the metal gate at the front of the enclosure that has \nbecome tangled, causing it to unravel. The wire is bent in many areas causing some sharp points of wire (varying in \nlength from approximately 1 inch to 6 inches long at varying heights from about 2 inches to 12 inches off the ground) to \npoint in towards the enclosure. \n\u2022 Within one enclosure of goats (mothers with offspring) that has wire mesh fencing to contain them, a sharp point of wire \nis observed in the front right corner of the enclosure, approximately 2-3 inches long, pointing inward about 2 to 3 inches \nfrom the ground.  \n\u2022 A holding stall containing one sheep has wire attached to the metal gate, but the wire has become loose and \nunattached, causing a sharp point of wire (approximately 6 inches in length and about 4 inches off the ground) to be \npointing into the enclosure. Within this same enclosure, wood privacy fencing is covering the interior sides, but most of the \nright side of the stall\u2019s wall has been worn down/broken, causing missing pieces or holes which are splintered and/or \nloosely attached. \n\u2022 Two separate enclosures of pigs each have a tarp attached in one corner covering the top providing some shade. Both \ntarps are sagging with varying amounts of holes in them, and one is fraying at the ends at the level of the pigs.  \nThe areas mentioned above could cause harm to the animals by allowing injury from the exposed sharp points, \nentrapment of a body part between broken wooden fencing or, the sagging tarp may be ingested and/or cause \nentanglement, due to the condition of disrepair. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be \nmaintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or harm and to contain the animals. \nCorrect by 06/01/2024. \n3.152(b) \n   \nFacilities, outdoor \nThe following outdoor primary enclosures have inadequate shelter provided for the birds contained within:  \n\u2022 Two separate enclosures, each housing a pair of chickens, only have tall trees providing partial shade with no shelter \nfrom wind or rain.  \n\u2022 In the large mixed species bird enclosure housing chickens, ducks and geese, there is a sheltered roofed area \napproximately 12 feet long by 3 feet wide that does not allow all the birds housed within to all be under it at the same time. \nTall trees provide some shade over this enclosure, but no wind breaks are provided.  \n\u2022 In the enclosure housing a peacock and a golden pheasant, there is a roofed area (approximately 2 feet wide x 4 feet\n\nlong) without any sides that does not provide a wind break.  \nInadequate shelter from inclement weather may result in illness, discomfort, or distress to the birds, and may have a \nnegative impact on their physical condition and well-being. All outdoor housing facilities for birds must provide enough \nshelter that is large enough to comfortably contain all the birds at one time and prevent their discomfort from direct \nsunlight, precipitation, or wind. \nCorrect by 06/15/2024. \n3.153(a)(1)(i) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nThe largest primary outdoor wire enclosure containing chickens, ducks, and geese has chicken wire that has not been \nsecured down at the bottom of the enclosure, such that sharp points along the length of this unsecured wire are pointing \ninward towards the enclosed birds. The sharp points are approximately \u00bd to 1 inch long, about 2-4 inches off the ground, \nalong the lower right side of the enclosure for approximately 12 feet in length. Sharp points may cause injury and may \nlead to pain or discomfort to the animals. Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so \nthat they are structurally sound. The primary enclosures must be kept in good repair and have no sharp points or edges \nthat could injure the birds. \nCorrect by 06/01/2024. \n3.153(a)(1)(viii) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nNot all the birds in the outdoor mixed species avian primary enclosure containing chickens, ducks, and geese had \nconvenient and easy access to water considering the size of the smaller species of chickens. The only available water is \nprovided in a water stock tank/trough measuring approximately 50 inches long x 30 inches wide x 12 inches high. The \nwater is kept at a lower level within the tub at approximately 7-8 inches high which requires the smaller poultry species \n(approximately 10 to 12 inches in height) to jump or fly up onto the ledge of the water trough, lean over at least 4-5 \ninches, while balancing on the approximately 1-inch-wide curved edge, to reach the level of the drinking water. Not having \neasy access to water can cause the birds to drink less, potentially become dehydrated, and impact their health and well-\nbeing. The licensee must provide all the birds with easy and convenient access to clean and potable water. \nCorrect by 05/10/2024. \n3.153(c) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nThe waterfowl in the large primary outdoor enclosure do not have a pool or other aquatic area provided that allows them \nto conduct normal waterfowl behaviors, such as swimming, submarining, and foraging. Failure to provide a pool or other \naquatic area of sufficient surface area and depth, for all aquatic birds in the enclosure to be able to express natural \nbehaviors, can lead to increased stress and a decline in physical condition. Primary enclosures housing wading and \naquatic birds must contain a pool or other aquatic area and a dry area that allows easy ingress or egress of the pool or \nother aquatic area. Pools and other aquatic areas must be of sufficient surface area and depth to allow each bird to make \nnormal postural and social adjustments, such as immersion, bathing, swimming and foraging. \nCorrect by 06/01/2024.\n\n3.154 \n   \nEnvironment enhancement to promote psychological well-being. \nAt the time of inspection, an environmental enhancement plan for birds that documents the appropriate provisions to \nprovide enrichment and special considerations that is approved by the attending veterinarian has not been developed by \nthe facility. This plan is necessary to ensure the psychological well-being and health of the animals. The facility must \nensure that a documented plan for environmental enhancement that addresses the required elements including social \ngrouping, environmental enrichment, special considerations, and exemptions is approved by the attending veterinarian as \nwell as maintained and available for inspection. \nCorrect by 06/01/2024. \n3.156 \n   \nWatering \nFour separate primary outdoor enclosures, three of which each contain a pair of chickens, and the other contains five \nturkeys, only have one source of water provided in water receptacles that are dirty within each enclosure. A layer of dark \ngrime is present in the bottom of each of these water receptacles as well as leaves and/or pine needles that have settled \nto the bottom. Failure to keep the water receptacles clean and sanitized can lead to contamination that can result in \nillness and/or discomfort. Potable water must be provided in sufficient quantity to all birds housed at the facility. Water \nreceptacles must be kept clean and sanitized in accordance with section 3.158, as often as necessary to prevent \ncontamination. The licensee must provide potable water to all birds, keep water receptacles clean and sanitary to protect \nthe health of the birds.  \nCorrect by 05/10/2024. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative. \n \n n",
