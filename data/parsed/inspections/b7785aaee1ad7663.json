Regardless of the observation the staff decided to\nwash the cultures with antibiotic media and proceeded to administer it to the animals.\nThe PI acknowledge that this is not an acceptable or standard working practice.\nThe PI provided a corrective action plan to the IACUC containing an sop for injection of gerbils and another sop for\nretraining the staff involved in handling of materials used for injection in the study. Also samples suspected of been\ncontaminated will be reported to the PI and not injected to the animals.The PI will monitor laboratory staff to ensure\nthe corrective actions are properly followed.\nThe Plan was reviewed by the IACUC and approved and later implemented by the PI. The IACUC considered the\nmatter resolved in the September monthly meeting.\nThe incident was managed and corrected by September 23, 2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
