      "narrative": "During this inspection six New Zealand white rabbits were observed on protocol M1800146 which involves\nintravitreal drug injections into the eyes of rabbits. These six rabbits had received an injection of the test drug the\nday before they were inspected. On the morning of the inspection day all six rabbits had abnormalities associated\nwith one or both eyes ranging from mild focal swelling around the eye and mild redness to more serious changes.\nThree of the rabbits (#113329, 113330 and 113331) had more serious issues including more severe swelling,\nredness, tear production and holding one or both eyes completely closed. Two of these three rabbits sat facing the\nback of their cage even while people were looking at them although they did move about when their cage door was\nopened. In addition, small mounds of pelleted rabbit feed were noted being dumped out for disposal as fresh pellets\nwere being placed in the hoppers by the husbandry caretaker. The lab staff member also present in the room stated\nthat this was done to monitor the rabbit\u2019s feed intake. Based on the amounts of pellets being discarded versus the\nnew daily ration, it appears that many of these rabbits had eaten much less than half of the daily ration for the past\n24 hours. The lab staff member stated that the eye issues and decreased appetite were normal/to be expected and\nwould clear up on their own in 1-2 days as she had observed after previous injections. The approved protocol stated\n\u2018significant periocular swelling that was symptomatic or adversely affected rabbit behavior was very rare\u2019 and that\n\u2018redness of the eye, subconjunctival hemorrhage and squinting\u2026are self-limiting and go away in 1-2 days\u2019. The\nprotocol did not include any specific monitoring parameters or treatments for the eye issues observed during the\ninspection. Review of procedural records of the previous drug injections administered to these rabbits also showed\nseveral similar eye issues being noted/monitored by both lab staff and veterinary staff post-injection but no\ntreatments were documented. A few hours after the inspection of these six rabbits, the three most severely affected\nrabbits were examined by the lab staff and a clinical veterinarian. All were diagnosed with periocular\nswelling/irritation. Tear production was noted. Treatment consisted of lubricant drops for all three and two were\ngiven ketoprofen. Follow up exams and treatments were provided. The eye issues of two of the rabbits cleared up\nwithin 48 hours. The third rabbit (#113330) is improving but is still being treated five days later.\nAs part of the inspection, a review of all of the procedural records for these six rabbits was conducted. It was\nobserved that at the start of the study the rabbits were given an intravitreal injection of disease causing cells. The\nprotocol was unclear about whether or not pre and post procedural analgesics were to be administered for this part\nof the study. In one section it stated that the analgesic ketoprofen would be administered every 12 to 24 hours. In\nanother section it simply stated that analgesics may be administered. The records reviewed documented that\nketoprofen was not administered to any of the rabbits before, during or after the procedure. According to the\npost-procedural records, all six rabbits developed eye redness. Three of the rabbits (#113329, 113327 and 113325)\nshowed weight loss (5-7%) and had decreased fecal +/- decreased urine output. These animals were examined by\na veterinarian and the poor appetite was addressed via diet changes.\nAdequate pre- and post-procedural care is necessary to ensure that procedures involving rabbits will avoid or\nminimize discomfort, distress and pain to the animals. Rabbits, as a prey species, are more difficult than other\nspecies to evaluate regarding discomfort, distress and pain so subtle changes in appetite, fecal and urine\nproduction and behavior such as facing away from a potential predator (people) or holding eyes closed/squinting\nneed to be closely observed and identified post procedures. If such changes are noted, post-procedural treatment\nshould be provided unless treatment would adversely affect the results or interpretation of the research and such\nhas been approved in the protocol by the IACUC (not the case in the current protocol). The research facility shall\nestablish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes adequate pre- and post-procedural care\nin accordance with current veterinary medical and nursing procedures. Corrected during this inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted over three days-Feb. 19, 20 and 24 with the Associate Director of Clinical Medicine\nDAC, an OAWA representative and other facility representatives. The exit interview was conducted on Feb. 25 with\nthe undersigned Attending Veterinarian, the IACUC Chair and other facility representatives."
