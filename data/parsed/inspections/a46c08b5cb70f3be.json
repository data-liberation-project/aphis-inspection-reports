      "narrative": "During the inspection, the following animals were found with veterinary care issues.\n- A male beagle (ID 74349) was non-weight bearing on his left hind limb. The facility representative stated this dog\nhad a \"tussle\" with another dog on 2-27-2020 and was immediately lame on that leg. The facility separated the\nanimals at that time. However, the dog did not receive any medical treatment at the time of the inspection and was\nonly being monitored.\n- A female cat named \"Sophie\" (ID 5819) had lost approximately 75% of her hair and had scabbed lesions on both\nflanks. The facility representative stated a small amount of hair loss was noted on February 27, 2020. However, no\nmedical treatment was given, and upon inspection the lesions had not resolved and actually were more involved\nwith increased hair loss and skin lesions. The facility did call the veterinarian for these two animals on March 4,\n2020 and had an appointment scheduled for Friday March 6, 2020. However, the facility waited a week after\nnoticing these conditions to seek veterinary care.\n- A male beagle named Glenn ( ID 3871) had 2 red, inflamed areas of hair loss on his mid-dorsum. These lesions\nwere approximately 1.5 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. The facility had not noticed these areas prior to inspection.\nMedical conditions must be appropriately treated, which includes timely veterinarian notification and appropriate\nfollow up evaluations to assess progress and make changes to the treatment plan when necessary. Sophie (ID\n5819), Glenn (ID 3871) and Dog (ID 74349) must be assessed by the attending veterinarian within 36 hours and\ntreated appropriately. Records of treatment must be made available to inspectors."
