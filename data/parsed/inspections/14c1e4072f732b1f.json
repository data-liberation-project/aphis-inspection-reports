It was too young as evidenced by its small size and\nappearance and its haircoat, which appears to have just grown in. A joey this young should still be in a pouch. Thus, this\nanimal was at risk of hypothermia and stress from over-handling.\nOn December 9th, 2022, a reporter from 13ABC news visited the facility for an interview. During the interview, a capybara\nwas recorded to be non-weight bearing on its right forelimb. Despite the obvious lameness, the licensee handles the\ncapybara to re-position it for the video. During the video, the licensee can be seen struggling with the capybara so much\nso that the reporter turns the camera after from the licensee handling the animal. However, the background noise\ncontinues to demonstrate the licensees struggle with the capybara. The licensee can be heard saying, \u201cSorry I was trying\nto hold him but he wasn\u2019t up for it today.\u201d The licensee recognized the animal did not want to be handled at this point but\ncontinued to struggle, handling the capybara for an additional 10-15 seconds as documented in the video. The capybara\ncan be seen breathing heavily and the licensee can be heard breathing hard, indicative of the struggle undergone during\nthe handling process. At the end of the video, the licensee stated \u201cLet\u2019s not film him because he has a little bit of a bloody\nnose. He hit his nose on the ground when I was trying to pick him up.
