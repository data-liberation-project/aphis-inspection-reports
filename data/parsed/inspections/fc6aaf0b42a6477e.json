Upon\narrival to the exhibit at 2:10pm, the inspector observed there were no employees present at all. During this time, the\nVMO witnessed several instances where members of the public (at least five personally owned vehicles) were able\nto drive up to the feeding exhibit without an attendant or employee available. One vehicle was seen where a child\nwas leaning its body out of the rear window for a closer view of the animals. When asked how the park staff\noversees the giraffe feeding exhibit, the facility representative confirmed there are no staff members assigned to this\nfeeding exhibit.\nThe absence of a readily identifiable employee or attendant endangers the safety, health, and well-being of both the\nanimals and general public when public contact is not overseen at all times.\nThe licensee must have a responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable attendant present in this area at all\ntimes.\nTo be corrected by close of business today, August 13, 2020.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
