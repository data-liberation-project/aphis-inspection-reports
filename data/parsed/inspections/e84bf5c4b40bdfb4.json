      "narrative": "***In the sheltered facility, there was an adult female English Bulldog identified as Lilly #482CO1OB5A that was\nhoused with another English Bulldog. Lilly had a large open wound at the base of her right ear. The wound\nextended from the top of the head to the bottom of the ear close to the jaw. The depth was full skin thickness,\nexposing the tissue below the skin. When this animal's head was turned slightly to the left, the wound width was\napproximately 1\" at the bottom and 2\" at the top. The edges of the skin were jagged and dried with some darkened\nareas as scabbing was beginning to form. The skin on the neck area was reddened and had hair loss near the\nedges of the injury. The facility representative stated that this injury had not been noticed prior to this time. The dog\nwas removed from the enclosure and taken to the attending veterinarian during the inspection. Injuries left\nunattended can lead to infection and unnecessary discomfort, pain or suffering of the animal.\n***In the whelping building, there were small areas of loose stool in the washdown area underneath the enclosure of\na female seal/white Boston Terrier with four puppies. The puppies were identified as #1502 F, #1503 M, #1504 M,\n#1505 M. Two of these puppies (the female and one of the males) were seen defecating this loose stool during the\ninspection. The facility representative stated that the puppies had been dewormed recently and had received\nvaccination shots. Loose stool can lead to diarrhea, dehydration and can be an indication of a serious medical\ncondition.\n***In the whelping building, there was an adult female brindle French Bulldog, identified as # 482E061918 that\npresented with a vomiting episode during the inspection. The vomit consisted of some liquid and undigested dog\nfood. This adult female had given birth to four puppies approximately two weeks ago. The facility representative\nstated that this dog had not had any problems. Vomiting can lead to dehydration and be an indication of a serious\nmedical condition.\nThe licensee did correct the injured dog during the inspection. The licensee must consult with a licensed\nveterinarian concerning the Boston Terrier puppies and the adult female French Bulldog and assure that adequate\nveterinary care is provided to all of the animals as required. The licensee understands that consultaion is to be\ncorrected by January 12, 2015."
