The animal was safely captured and returned to its enclosure within approximately one\nhour of its escape. There were no injuries to the animal or animal caretakers.

In addition, the licensee must also ensure that the housing facilities are structurally sound,\nkept in good repair, they must protect the animals from injury, and restrict other animals from entering at all times as\nrequired in this section.

During that transport back to the\nlicensee\u2019s facility, an approximately 11-month-old kangaroo escaped its carrier (described as a cloth sack/pouch by the\nlicensee) and jumped out of an open window from the back seat of the truck during a brief stop. The kangaroo was later\ncaptured and found with some injuries, including to its left eye and scratches on its left side/leg. The licensee contacted\nhis veterinarian regarding the animal\u2019s condition and followed directions for treatment. The licensee stated that another\nkangaroo, which had been exhibited during the event, had also been in the same transport vehicle and in a similar cloth\npouch as the one that escaped the transport vehicle. The kangaroos had been in their pouches and hung from the head\nrests in the truck\u2019s back seat, although only one of the kangaroos had escaped its pouch and the truck. The use of the\ncloth sack/pouch did not sufficiently contain a kangaroo during transport, and it resulted in injury to the animal. The\nlicensee must ensure that primary enclosures used to transport animals meet the requirements of this section (3.137)\nwhich includes, but is not limited to, that the structural strength of the enclosure is sufficient to contain the animals and\ncan withstand the normal rigors of transportation at all times. To be corrected: July 6, 2023.\nThis inspection and an initial exit interview were conducted with the licensee on July 5, 2023. A final exit interview was\ncompleted with the licensee on July 6, 2023.\nn"
