      "narrative": "There were two dogs at the facility with dental conditions.\n*An approximately 8 year old male long haired black and tan Dachshund, \"Snake Eyes\" (#041*036*545) had some\nteeth that appeared to be missing and a heavy buildup of tan to brown to greyish material on the majority of the\nteeth that were present. The gums over both upper canine teeth were red and inflamed and had receded. The\nbuildup of material on the teeth had a rough and cobblestone appearance.\n*An approximately 7 year old male red and white wire haired Dachshund, \"Mr. Whiskers\" (OBOF092262) had his\ntongue hanging out of the right side of his mouth. On closer observation, the dog had some teeth that appeared\nworn down and some teeth with a heavy buildup of tan to brown to dark grey material. The gums over both upper\ncanine teeth were red and inflamed with some recession present.\nAccording to written documentation from the licensee, the last dental procedure performed on these dogs had been\nby a veterinarian on July 22, 2014. The current abnormal build-up of material on these dogs' teeth can cause\ndamage to the gum tissues and tooth structures. These conditions could negatively impact these dogs' ability to eat\nnormally and their overall well-being. The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in\norder to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed.\nThe licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee\nmust develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the\nanimals at the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times. To\nbe corrected by: February 3, 2016."
