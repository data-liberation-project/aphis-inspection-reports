No current itinerary has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal\nCare.\nIn the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two\ndays prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information concerning the\nwhereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. The\nsubmission of itineraries allows USDA to conduct inspections in order to assess the welfare of the animals both at\nhome and while traveling.
