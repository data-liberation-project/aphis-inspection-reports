These areas had distinct margins between normal and\nabnormal areas. The skin in these areas was flaky in appearance with white/grey flakes visible adhered to the skin.\n*One adult large white sheep and one adult brown goat had visible areas of swelling. The white ram had a large\nbaseball size swelling under the left side of its jaw/neck. The brown goat had an egg size swelling in front of left\nshoulder/lower neck area.\nThe facility representatives with the inspectors during the inspection were not aware of any sheep/goat issues when\nasked. Multiple versions of caretaker records were reviewed. None noted the skin lesions. Regarding the swellings,\none version of the 8/8/16 record (Vet Care) show no mention of any goat or sheep issues. A second version of the\n8/8/16 records (Daily Care) mentions that \u201cnoted female goat with abscess on shoulder will have vet check on Wed\nand recheck lamb with growth on neck\u201d. No previous notations of evaluations, diagnosis or treatment of a lamb with\na growth on neck could be found in the records. A veterinarian had been out to the facility on 8/8/16. He was\ncontacted and stated that he saw two other animals on the afternoon of 8/8/16 but was not asked to look at any\nsheep or goats. He did state that he was coming out on Wednesday afternoon 8/10/16 to look at some animals\nincluding a goat.\nAll daily observations of problems in animal health need to be communicated to the veterinarian to ensure that an\nappropriate diagnosis is made and a treatment plan can be instituted to ensure the health of the animals and the\nsafety of the public that has contact with the animals. A veterinarian needs to examine the goats and sheep to\ndetermine a diagnosis and set up a treatment plan for the skin lesions and swellings. Documentation should be kept\nof all communications with the veterinarian, the diagnosis and all treatments.\n*** A female spider monkey was euthanized on July 20, 2016 according to facility records. During the exit interview\nthe licensee stated that the animal had been going downhill for quite some time. There are no records on hand for\nthis animal prior to the day of euthanasia (7/20/16). After veterinary exam on 7/20 revealed difficulty breathing in\nthe animal, euthanasia was elected."
