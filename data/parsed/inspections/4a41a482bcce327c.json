      "narrative": "A focused inspection was conducted on March 8, 2017 by APHIS inspectors and an IES investigator. The three pigs\nwith the excessively long hooves noted on the previous inspection had received hoof trimming and had been moved\ninto a different enclosure.\nThe coatimundi, Shyla, was not on the premises at the time of inspection. Licensee stated that she had taken the\ncoati to the veterinary clinic at approximately 8:30 am this morning. The licensee called the clinic at approximately\n10:30 am and spoke with the assistant. At the time of the inspection, the licensee did not know what the\nveterinarian\u2019s plan regarding the diagnosis and treatment of the coatimundi.\nThe APHIS inspector contacted the veterinarian regarding the coatimundi at 2:37pm on March 8, 2017. The\nveterinarian stated that she had not given any pain medication to the coati and that no medical treatment had been\nprovided that day. The veterinarian stated that she had given the coatimundi antibiotics last night but sent the\nanimal home as she did not have adequate facilities to house a coatimundi. The veterinarian stated to the inspector\nvia phone that the animal was \u201cvery aggressive\u201d and that the \u201ceye is pretty bad\u201d. No other diagnostics, treatments,\nmedications or pain control have been given at the time of this inspection. The veterinarian stated to the inspector\nvia phone that she was planning to anesthetize the coati and try to clean the eye out and that she would \u201ctry to do it\ntoday,\u201d however she was unable to confirm when the coatimundi would be examined and treated.\nThe young gray and white female goat which was unable to straighten her front legs at the knees during the\nprevious inspection was still in her enclosure in the barn. Her condition had not changed from yesterday and she\nwas still unable to stand or walk normally. Licensee stated that the goat had not received any veterinary treatment.\nIn addition, the intact adult male tricolor goat that was non-weight bearing on his right front limb during the previous\ninspection had been moved into the same enclosure as the gray and white female goat that was cited. The buck\u2019s\ncondition was unchanged from the previous inspection and he was still non-weight bearing on the right forelimb and\nlame at a walk. A veterinarian visually examined the goat yesterday and made a presumptive diagnosis. The\ninspector spoke with this veterinarian regarding these 2 goats previously identified by the inspectors as needing\nveterinary care on the night of March 7. He stated that he had recommended to the licensee that the goats in\nquestion should receive diagnostic testing in order to give a diagnosis and recommended a non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory agent for pain control, however animal manager at the facility declined diagnosis and treatment.\nThe female fallow deer that had a fresh wound over the left point of the shoulder during the previous inspection had\nnot been seen by a veterinarian and licensee had not provided any treatment.\nInjuries, diseases, and medical conditions that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be\npainful and can lead to prolonged suffering. The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of\nveterinary medical problems are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate\ndiagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of\nveterinary medical problems are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate\ndiagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency,\nweekend, and holiday care for all of the animals at the facility.\nThe facility representative was notified verbally that he must have both goats (the male and female listed above)\nexamined and receive medical treatment by a veterinarian by no later than 10:00am on March 9, 2017 to obtain\naccurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans for the leg problems cited above. In addition, the results of the\nexamination and treatment of the coatimundi should be made available to the inspection. The outcome of this\nconsultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the\nveterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian,\nany medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal\nhealth record that list when the medication is administered to the animal.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal identified on inspection, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary\ntreatment, and the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nAdditionally, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as\ndescribed by the attending veterinarian in the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate\nveterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and\ninjuries.\nA focused inspection was conducted on March 8, 2017. This report is limited to the direct noncompliant items\nidentified on that inspection. The inspection was conducted with the animal manager and IES investigator and the\nexit interview was conducted with the animal manager, an authorized facility representative, on March 8, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBolinger Jean, Compliance Specialist\nFrank Katharine, Veterinary Medical Officer\nGarland Kathleen, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
