This may also be a concern for the structural strength of the ceiling if liquid is collecting between\nthe exhibit pool above and the enclosure ceiling below. The source of this liquid should be identified and the\ndripping stopped or prevented from occurring in an animal enclosure.\nHousing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for\nthe species of nonhuman primates housed in them.
