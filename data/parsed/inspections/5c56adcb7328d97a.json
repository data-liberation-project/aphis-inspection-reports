      "narrative": "An APHIS official was refused access and inspection by a facility representative. At approximately 11:48 am on April 18,\n2024, an APHIS official arrived at the front gate of Rosaire Zoppe Chimpanzees with the intent of performing an\nunannounced routine inspection. The inspector called the number listed. There was no answer, so the APHIS official left a\nmessage explaining the purpose of the call. As the APHIS official was waiting to see if his phone call would be returned,\nhe noticed a camera by the front gate and drove up beside it. There was no buzzer or way to communicate via the\ncamera, but the hope was that if someone was there, they might notice the activity and come to the gate. A few minutes\nlater, a facility representative did approach the gate and asked if he could help. The APHIS official presented his badge\nand identified himself as a Veterinary Medical Officer with AC/USDA. He informed the representative that he was there to\nconduct an unannounced routine inspection. The facility representative said that the owner wasn\u2019t there, and he could not\nallow access without their presence. The APHIS official explained that any responsible adult could show him around the\nfacility. The representative again denied access. The APHIS official explained that if he was not allowed to conduct an\ninspection, he would be forced to cite them for refusal. The facility representative again stated that he could not allow\nanyone in without the presence of the owner. The APHIS official asked directly, \u201cAre you refusing to allow the inspection?\u201d\nThe facility representative said yes, and the APHIS official stated that he would wait the remaining 20 minutes to see if the\nlicensee (owner) would return his earlier call and if not, he would leave and cite for refusal. The call was not returned.\nRegular, unannounced inspections ensure that each dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler or carrier are compliant with\napplicable rules and regulations and provides inspectors with the ability to assess the overall well-being of the animals.\nEach dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to enter its\nplace of business, examine and copy records required to be kept by the Act and the regulations in this part, inspect and\nphotograph the facilities, property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the\nAct. The licensee shall allow the inspectors to document, by the taking of photographs and other means, conditions and\nareas of noncompliance. In addition, a responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the\ninspection process. To be corrected from this day forward, April 18, 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
