The ferret was found\nunresponsive and trapped between the platform and the cage wall. Shortly after being removed from the enclosure for\nmedical intervention, the ferret died. Based on the facility\u2019s internal investigation, it was determined that the ferret was\nable to push the non-stationary platform up from below and tried to crawl through the gap created between the wall of the\ncage and the platform. The investigation concluded that the ferret became entrapped in that space, such that its chest\nwas compressed, and it was unable to breathe. This enclosure was not constructed of such material and of such strength\nas appropriate for the ferret. Housing facilities must be structurally sound to contain and protect the animals from injury. At\nthe time of inspection, corrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nEnd Section"
