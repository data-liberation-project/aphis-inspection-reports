Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 ft square of space, so a maximum of 3 rabbits over 4.4\nlbs can be housed in an enclosure providing 10 ft square, or 6 rabbits all less than 4.4 lbs.\nFacility has been working to meet the space requirement, and all enclosures in Barn 8 and Barn 3 for research\nrabbits now meet the space requirements.\nAdequate floor space in primary enclosures is essential in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the\nrabbits. Overcrowding can result in stress, disease, and injury. Primary enclosures should be measured and the\nrabbits weighed so that rabbits can be redistributed into housing where they have adequate floor space and suitable\ncompanions.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative."
