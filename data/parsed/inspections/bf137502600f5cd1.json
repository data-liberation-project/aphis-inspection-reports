      "narrative": "The licensee is failing to provide adequate veterinary care for her 6-month-old neutered male Serval cat\n(\u201cTigger\u201d/\u201dSimba\u201d).\nIn December and January 2024, the cat had a broken bone in the forelimb which was surgically pinned by the Attending\nVeterinarian. The licensee failed to return for follow up appointments, and when the cat was finally seen by the AV on\nFebruary 2, 2024 it was overdue for pin removal one of the pins could not be removed because the bone had grown over\nit.\nAt the time of the pin removal, the cat also received an enema because it was extremely constipated due to a narrowed\npelvis caused by pelvic fractures. The AV recommended referral to a surgical center for evaluation and treatment of the\npelvis. The AV also recommended feeding wet food, nutritional supplements, and stool softeners to try to medically\nmanage the condition in the short term, although he indicated to the licensee that this would likely need surgery. The AV\nstated that he did not receive adequate follow up communication from the licensee confirming that she wanted a referral\nand that she did not schedule any follow up appointments.\nOn February 27, 2024, unbeknownst to the AV, the licensee took the cat to a veterinary referral center for evaluation. The\nrecords show the cat has multiple fractures, weight loss, labored breathing after exercise, and constipation occurring over\nthe past few weeks. Discharge instructions from the referral center state that the animal is has a fractured pubis (pelvic\nbone), diaphragmatic hernia, multiple rib fractures, and bone deformities in the forelimb. According to the discharge\ninstructions, the licensee declined diagnostics and treatment. The licensee indicated that diagnostics and treatment had\nbeen declined due to financial constraints.\nAfter visiting the surgical center, the licensee did not return to the AV or any other veterinarian for follow up care. After\nspeaking with USDA personnel on March 1, 2024, the licensee contacted a veterinarian (not the cat\u2019s AV) and got pain\nmedication, ordered stool softener, and scheduled an appointment for evaluation the next week.\nAt the time of inspection (March 5, 2024 at approximately 2:00PM), the cat has not been seen by any veterinarian since it\nwas discharged from the referral center. Upon inspection, the cat is bright and alert. While at rest, the cat is breathing\nquickly and shallowly and shows mildly abnormal movement of the chest and abdomen with each breath. There are a few\nsmall firm stools in the animal\u2019s enclosure. The licensee stated that the cat is passing stool like this daily, and that the\ncat\u2019s appetite is not robust (often leaves some food uneaten). The AV was contacted and said that he is concerned that\nthe cat may be constipated again due to the small stools.\nAnimals with broken bones and prolonged constipation may experience severe pain and discomfort. Diaphragmatic\nhernias can result in abdominal organs entering the chest cavity, causing animals to struggle to breath and to get enough\noxygen.\nThe Attending Veterinarian and the referral center have made recommendations for diagnostics and treatment which have\nnot been followed, which may have resulted in prolonged pain, discomfort, and stress for this animal. This animal must be\ntaken to a veterinarian by 10:00 AM tomorrow (March 6, 2024) and testing and treatment prescribed by the veterinarian\nmust be followed. Correct by: March 6, 2024 at 10:00 AM Central Time.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licnesee.\nn"
