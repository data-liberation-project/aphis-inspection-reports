Animal #49363M had a deep wound in the skin measuring 2 inches by \u00bd an inch\nover the shoulders, where two previous injection sites had nearly coalesced. The lesion was dry and dark in color. Animal\n49397M also had a lesion measuring about two inches by \u00bd inch over the shoulders, where two injections sites had\ncompletely coalesced, and this lesion was more pink and moist. The clinical veterinarian stated that these two animals\nshould be on a \u201cVeterinary Service Request\u201d (VSR), as she had not been aware of their condition. The VSRs are initiated\nby the technicians during their AM and PM daily observation animal checks. The animals in this room (176) had been\nobserved at 7:28 AM on this day, but no VSR was requested for these animals. The Principal Investigator stated that\nthese two guinea pigs had just had bandages removed, that might have concealed the lesions, between 9 and 10 AM on\nthis day, however the technicians that removed the bandages did not initiate a VSR either.\nDaily observation of all animals at the facility must be done carefully so as to identify any conditions requiring veterinary\nassessment and treatment. Failure to provide adequate observation of the animals and report problems to the veterinary\nstaff could be detrimental to their well-being.\nThe VSR was initiated at the time of the inspection for these two animals, and appropriate treatment was initiated. To be\ncorrected from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nBenjamin DuttonEnd Section"
