Several of the kits were highly active climbing and hanging on the top of the\ncrate and biting the bars of the door. Lack of space at a developmental age can contribute to abnormal behavior patterns\nsuch as repetitive head movements and excessive biting of bars that can wear and break teeth.

In addition, the licensee\nstates that any additional stress (like an additional person in the area) can cause the raccoons to kill their offspring. Killing\nof offspring is also a strong indicator of space issues when the animal does not feel safe or have ability to avoid stress in\nthis environment.\n*** A red fox was engaging in repetitive pacing behavior against the far wire mesh of his enclosure. This is also a wire\nmesh enclosure up off the ground with a dome shape wire cover and a wood nest box. This is a wire mesh enclosure that\ndoes not have any complexity to allow for the fox to have normal postural adjustments and social adjustments such as\ndigging or climbing and does not provide adequate freedom of movement for the species.\n*** The arctic foxes are housed in wire mesh enclosures up off the ground with 2-3 animals in an enclosure.
