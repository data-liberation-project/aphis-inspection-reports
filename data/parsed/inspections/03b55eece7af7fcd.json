The medical pool is connected by two\ngates to the Dolphin Stadium Pool Complex consisting of several pools housing multiple adult marine mammals including\ndolphins and pilot whales. On January 26, 2025, facility personnel observed a newborn bottlenose dolphin calf swimming\nwith two adult dolphins in a pool immediately adjacent to the medical pool. Facility veterinarians and staff immediately\nconfirmed the calf belonged to the adult female dolphin in the medical pool and reunited the mother and calf. Facility staff\nindicated they suspected the dolphin calf slipped between a gap in the metal rails on a pool ledge next to the gate\nseparating the two pools. Although the calf remained in a facility pool, it was not contained in the intended medical pool\nwith its mother. The pool enclosure, as constructed, failed to contain the animals as intended allowing the newborn calf to\nenter an adjacent pool creating a potential for distress, injury, or death to the animal. The facility has implemented\npreventive measures to ensure this does not happen again.\nIndoor and outdoor housing facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good\nrepair to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals within the facility, and to restrict the entrance of unwanted\nanimals.\nCorrected prior to the inspection on February 13, 2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nALEXANDRA ANDRICOS, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER\nGeoffrey Olsen, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
