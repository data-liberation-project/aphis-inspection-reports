The public is allowed to use kitchen tongs to feed raw meat to the tigers while having\ntheir photo taken by an attendant. The barrier that the public stands behind was about 3 feet high and was 32\ninches away from the tiger enclosure. This height and distance was not enough to prevent people from leaning over\nthe barrier far enough to potentially be able to stick their fingers or hands into the 2 inch by 4 inch openings of the\nenclosure. Insufficient distance or barriers between the animals and the public can compromise the safety of both.\nThe licensee must ensure that there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the general viewing public and\nthe animals so as to assure the safety of the animals and the public.\nInspection took place at the Central States Fair in Rapid City, SD.\nInspection and exit briefing were conducted on-site with facility representatives and 2 APHIS VMO's.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHeezen Dee, Veterinary Medical Officer"
