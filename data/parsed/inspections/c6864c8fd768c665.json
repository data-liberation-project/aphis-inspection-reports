The facility had contacted the\nattending veterinarian on 7/8/2023 and recorded doing haircuts with baths (with soap), increased cleaning/sanitizing\nthrough 7/15 and first gave a flea product (Capstar) to control fleas to most dogs on 7/26/2023 and the rest on 7/27 after\nthe attending veterinarian did physical exams and found fleas on dogs on 7/26/2023. The facility noted that a topical spray\nhas also been applied to dogs when fleas are observed but it is unclear to which dogs. I contacted the attending\nveterinarian (AV) who said instructions need to be followed more closely. The AV also said that Capstar was discussed\nbut would need to be given daily for protection and other products with better flea protection were recommended. A note\nfrom the clinic sent after the 7/26/2023 visit to the facility says that the product Zoguard should be started and 'the sooner\nthe better.' The caretaker said that a box of Zoguard arrived a couple of weeks ago but only one dog has received a dose.\nFleas can cause discomfort to dogs and can spread sickness. Flea populations inside a kennel can reproduce for months\nif not controlled and very strict cleaning and sanitizing routines with acceptable treatments for dogs must be followed as\nrecommended by the attending veterinarian.
