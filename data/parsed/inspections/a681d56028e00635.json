The animals were able to enter areas that were not intended for\nanimal housing. APHIS officials reviewed a video that depicts the three llamas (Sky, Gandalf, and Dante) running\nalongside a stopped train carrying park guests.

Failure to ensure that animals are handled with minimal risk to the animal and to the\npublic, with sufficient distance and/or barriers can result in animal/human injury, and disease exposure. The facility must\nensure that during public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the\npublic, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the\nsafety of animals and the public.
