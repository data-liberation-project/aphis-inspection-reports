      "narrative": "A male Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier (0A01242932) had an approximately 4 inch diameter raw skin area on the\nrear, just left of the rectum. The dog was observed repeatedly licking this area and occasionally favoring the left\nrear leg. The skin in this area was moist, reddened with spots of bright red and black throughout the raw area, and\nyellow and black in the middle of the round raw area. There was also a a reddish-yellow discharge from the area.\nThe last veterinary visit on June 6 the veterinarian stated the area was a tumor and the licensee wished to breed\nhim to 2 more females before bringing him back to address the problem. The licensee stated, since the last\nveterinary visit about 4 months ago, while waiting to have this dog breed 2 females, they have treated the dog with\nCorona cream and/or Vetericyn spray when area looked worse or the dog acted like the area was bothering him, but\nhe would just lick it off. Although there is no documentation of this treatment. Treatment for this dog started March\n13, 2016, at that time medical records stated the area was a open knot half the size of a golf ball. The last\ndocumentation for medical treatment was on June 6, 2016. The treating veterinarian was presented a current\npicture of this dog and did say this area has increased in size and needs attention. The condition of this dog could\nindicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable. The licensee must\nhave this dog seen by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an\nappropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it\navailable to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care\nat all times.\nThe exit interview was done on 10/3/2016 and the licensee was verbally told this was a direct NCI and this dog\nneeded to be seen by a veterinarian by close of business on 10/4/2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Chad Proctor ACI, and MDA inspector."
