The facility has an APHIS approved perimeter fence variance. The\nperimeter fence variance identifies that a perimeter fence is not necessary for the racoons at the facility provided that,\namong other requirements, there is a camera surveillance system and facility personnel reside on site. However, on\n2/4/2024 two hunting dogs pulled the heavy wire mesh enclosure material away from the lumber support structure in\nseveral locations. The dogs also tore an approximately 1-foot diameter hole in the wire mesh about 5 feet off the ground.\nUltimately, the dogs got into the enclosure by climbing onto the enclosure roof, pulling back approximately 2-foot X 2-foot\narea of the wire mesh from the roof support structure, and jumping into the enclosure. After killing the racoons, the dogs\nwere unable to exit the enclosure. The gross necropsy report for these two racoons confirmed death due to trauma. When\nsecurity measures are not effectively implemented to keep unwanted animals off the premises, injury to the animals can\noccur.\nThe facility must ensure appropriate security measure are being employed to keep unwanted animals and unauthorized\npersons from having contact with the animals at the facility.\nTo be corrected from this day (9/6/2024) forward.\n2) Non-critical item: Bobcat OGI (3954) is not adequately protected by a perimeter fence. There is a 6-foot-high wood\nprivacy fence that encircles about \u00bc of the bobcat enclosure. Perimeter fencing is important to protecting the animals at\nthe facility from injury and disease. Perimeter fences can keep unwanted animals and unauthorized people from having\nunwanted contact with the animals at the facility. Perimeter fences can also serve as a secondary containment system for\nthe animals.\nOutdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height (6 feet) to keep animals and\nunauthorized persons out. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting\nanimals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and\nso that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance\nfrom the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals\nor persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure, and less\nthan 6 feet high, must be approved in writing by the Administrator.\nTo be corrected by December 30, 2024."
