She is thin and her ribs, and lumbar vertebrae are\neasily palatable, and her pelvic bones were easily visible, with no palpable fat. The licensee states this has always been a\nthin dog and they supplement her with additional food and she remains thin. This could indicate another underlying health\nproblem. This dog should be assessed by the attending veterinarian prior to being bred again to determine if there are\nunderlying health problems that prevent her from maintaining a healthy body weight and condition during pregnancy.\n*** At the time multiple dogs in the kennel had long nails that needed to be trimmed. The facility states they trim every 6\nweeks, but the length of the nails indicates a shorter frequency is needed to prevent the nails from getting too long. This\nneeds to be addressed for the health of the dogs.\n*** A poodle, \u201cPepsi\u201d had matted fur on her back and a patch of hair loss on the back towards her rear right leg.\n*** A poodle, \u201cTriscut\u201d had long nails and her left ear had an excessive amount of wax and debris built up that was\nblocking the ear canal. Regular ear checks and cleaning are needed to prevent this amount of debris build up in the ear\nand prevent ear infections and irritations.\n*** A cavalier, \u201cDagwood\u201d had heavily matted ears that were filled with shavings stuck in the mats.\n*** A Pomeranian, \u201cGummy Bear\u201d had matted fur around her ears.\n*** A Cocker spaniel, \u201cCarson\u201d also had matted fur around the ears.\n*** A Cocker spaniel, \u201cTeddy\u201d had matted fur around his neck and ears and his ears were also dirty and in need of\ncleaning.\nMatted fur on these dogs, pulls and separates from the skin which can be painful and can hide skin irritations underneath\nthe matted fur. These dogs need to be groomed on a more frequent basis to prevent this matting from occurring for the\nwelfare of the dogs.\nCorrect by: Oct 12, 2022"
