      "narrative": "***Significant changes regarding the use of animals in protocol #AS2836-11-20, involving guinea pigs, were not\napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nAPHIS inspector discovered that the PI deviated from the IACUC approved protocol regarding the duration of\nguinea pig exposure to cigarette smoke and initial exposure to nebulization. The protocol states that 8 guinea pigs\nwould be exposed to cigarette smoke in a smoking machine for \u201c2 hours/day for 5 days for the first week, 3\nhours/day for 5 days for the second week, and 5 hours for the third week.\u201d A flow chart in the protocol also depicts\nthis timeline. Facility records indicate that four guinea pigs from group 1 were exposed to cigarette smoke for 5\nhours/day for a total of 6 days. The PI had planned to continue to smoke exposure for 4 more days, however this\ngroup\u2019s final smoke exposure occurred on 03/19/18 due to the adverse reaction of a guinea pig. As the guinea pigs\nwere removed from the smoking machine, one female guinea pig, microchip # 052-550-022, was observed to have\n\u201cbloody discharge from nose,\u201d and displayed \u201cvocalization\u201d and \u201copen mouth breathing.\u201d The guinea pig received\nmedical treatment, however she was euthanized that same day due to continued respiratory distress. Guinea pig\n#051-774-537, also from group 1, was noted to have \u201cserosanguinous discharge on both nares\u201d when removed\nfrom the smoking machine on 03/19/18.\nThe IACUC approved protocol states that medications \u201cwill be administered via nebulization to guinea pigs during\nexposure to cigarette smoke.\u201d The protocol does not state during which week of smoke exposure the nebulization\nwill actually begin. The PI informed the APHIS inspector that due to difficulty in obtaining the medication, she did not\nbegin nebulization until 04/16/18, by which time the smoke exposure had ended for both groups. The cigarette\nsmoke exposure ended for group 1 guinea pigs on 03/19/18 and ended for group 2 guinea pigs on 04/13/18. The PI\ndid not submit an amendment informing the IACUC of the change in procedure.\nUnapproved significant changes to a protocol can result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal\u2019s\nwelfare at risk. All activities involving animals must adhere to those in the IACUC-approved protocols and\namendments. This conformance to protocol is necessary to ensure that the IACUC has the authority to assure the\nproper care and use of animals in research projects. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be\nreviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementing the changes.\nTo be corrected from this date forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
