Accumulations of debris were also observed particularly alongside the\ninterior enclosure walls throughout the facility. Some of the debris accumulations along the walls and floor appeared\nto be moist and sticky, and much of the debris accumulation along the walls appeared to be adhered to the\nenclosure surfaces.\nAccumulations of debris and excreta can create health hazards for guinea pigs. Although the facility representative\nindicated that enclosures are cleaned on a regular basis, the presence of the debris and excreta accumulations\nillustrated that the enclosures must be cleaned more thoroughly and/or more frequently to prevent excreta and\ndebris accumulations.\nThe licensee must thoroughly clean and sanitize the enclosures at least once every two weeks or more often as\nnecessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris. Correct by November 20, 2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
