      "narrative": "- At the time of the inspection there was an 11 year old black female pug aka \"Mattie\" microchip number\n0A02173973 that had bilateral ocular discharge and an abnormal gait. The facility representative stated she had not\nnoticed her eyes or the abnormal gait. Mattie knuckled over on her left front foot when she walked. She also had\nbilateral ocular discharge. Her left eye appeared enlarged and the hair below the eye was caked with crusty\nmaterial. The discharge from both eyes was yellow to green in color and thick in appearance. Gait abnormalities can\nbe painful, may be due to underlying medical conditions and affect the health and well-being of this animal. Eye\ndischarge can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful.\nTo be corrected by November 1, 2014.\n-At the time of the inspection a female Japanese chin aka \"Yoshi\" microchip number 087817520 had a 2 week old\npuppy nursing and had an excessive buildup of a dark brown material on the teeth extending up into the gum line.\nMost of the teeth could not be visualized. The gums were swollen and reddened. There was a yellow creamy\nmaterial along the gum line near one of the large cheek teeth on the right side (the large molar tooth). The buildup\nof abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat\nnormally, and harm the health of the animal.\nTo be corrected by November 27, 2014.\n-At the time of the inspection an 11 year old female Yorkshire terrier aka \"Susie\" microchip number 064027313 had\nmost of her teeth removed prior to the inspection and her tongue protrudes out of her mouth. However, there was\nan excessive buildup of a dark brown material on the remaining teeth extending up to the gum line on the left rear\nlower molar. The gums in this area were reddened and swollen. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a\ndischarge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the\nanimal.\nTo be corrected by November 10, 2014.\n-- The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plans. The outcome of these consultations must be documented and provided to the\ninspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
