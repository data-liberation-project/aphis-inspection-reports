The hair on top of the feet were\nwet and brown staining could be seen on the white hairs over the toes. The skin along all of the digits, at the nail beds and\non the webbing between the toes was red and inflamed. Brown/red staining could also be seen on the 3 exterior nails of\nboth the left and the right foot, extending approximately 0.5 inch from the nail bed onto the nail. Champ also had an\napproximately 1 inch in diameter circular red hairless and raised lesion on the back of his right rear foot.\nBlake (Microchip # 837380847), a white dog with black spots, had all four feet affected. Brown staining could be seen on\nthe white hair covering all four feet. The skin along all of the digits, at the nail beds, on the webbing between the toes and\ncovering the foot pads, was red and inflamed. On both of the front feet, near the dewclaw, there was an approximately 0.5\ninch in diameter circular red moderately hairless and slightly raised lesion. On Blake\u2019s left hind foot, at the juncture\nbetween the foot and the leg, there was an approximately 1.5 inch in diameter circular red hairless raised lesion.\nThe facility had not identified the condition affecting these two dogs, therefore had not contacted the veterinarian for\nguidance on care. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress in animals\nwith such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to properly\nassess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for\ntimely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. These two dogs need to be seen by a veterinarian for an appropriate\ndiagnosis and treatment plan.\nCorrect by August 4th, 2021"

The primary enclosures they were housed in only provided 6 square feet of floor space. The other 6 dogs were of the\nsame size or larger than the 2 measured yet still housed in the same type of enclosure. Therefore, the minimum floor\nspace was insufficient for all dogs.\nFor approximately 5 dogs, the interior height of the primary enclosure was not 6 inches higher than the head of the dog\nwhen in a normal standing position.\nThe inadequate amount of floor and head space may not provide enough room for the dogs to comfortably make natural\npostural movements. Enclosures that are too small can have a negative impact on their health and well-being. Each dog\nhoused in a primary enclosure must be provided a minimum amount of floor and head space as required by the Animal\nWelfare Act.\nThe facility representative informed us that the dogs will be returning to their adequately sized primary enclosures the next\nday since repairs are now done.\nCorrect by: August 6, 2021"
