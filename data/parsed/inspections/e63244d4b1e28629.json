During the time the animal was\nout, she injured another female rhesus macaque on the tongue and right hand. The injured animal was treated with an\nanti-inflammatory/pain medication, antibiotics, and supportive care.\nOn October 4th, 2022 a male rhesus macaque escaped from his primary enclosure. During the time the animal was out,\nhe was injured on his right pinky finger, left ear tip, and right upper lip. The animal underwent surgical repair of the finger\nand ear tip and was given medications and supportive care.\nOn October 17th, 2022 a female rhesus macaque briefly escaped from her primary enclosure during routine removal of\nuneaten food by an employee. During the time the animal was out, she got a small cut on her left lower jaw that was\nclosed with tissue glue and treated with anti-inflammatory/pain medication and antibiotics.\nThe facility determined that all 3 incidents were caused by a lack of employee training: The incidents on 09/29/22 and\n10/03/22 occurred due to failure of employees to properly secure secondary locks on animal enclosures after cage\nchanges; as a corrective action employees were re-trained on this task. The incident on 10/17/22 was due to failure of an\nemployee to appropriately handle the animal during a cage change; as a corrective action the employee was re-trained on\nthis task.\nAnimals that are handled by inadequately trained employees may suffer from injuries or stress. Correct by March 7th,\n2023 by ensuring that all personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified and trained to effectively\nperform their duties. Corrected prior to the inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and the Clinical Veterinarian. The exit interview was\nconducted with the AV, the Clinical Veterinarian, and the Director of Office of Animal Welfare.\nEnd Section"
