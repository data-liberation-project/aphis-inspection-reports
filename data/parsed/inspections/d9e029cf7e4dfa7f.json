Kevin and one of the other pigs were\nboth shivering and huddled together towards the back of the shelter. The outside temperature during the inspection\nat 2:15pm was 38 degrees Fahrenheit. During inspection, the veterinary medical officer noticed that one of the pigs\nin the enclosure was not breathing and notified the facility representative, who pulled the pig out from underneath\nthe shelter. The animal was dead, cold to touch and there was stiffening of the limbs. The facility representative said\nthat he last saw the pig running around yesterday evening. This morning he fed the pigs, but was in a rush and did\nnot observe the pigs. A brief inspection of the dead pig by the VMO did not indicate any outward evidence of\ntrauma. There was a heat lamp inside the shelter, however the facility representative stated that it had not been\nturned on yet this year.\nThe pigs are showing signs of discomfort from the cold temperatures. Inadequate protection from cold temperatures\ncan lead to hypothermia and potentially death. The shelter provided to regulated animals must afford them\nprotection, prevent discomfort, and be appropriate to the local climactic conditions.\nThe facility must make any necessary changes to the shelter to ensure that the pigs are provided adequate\nprotection from the cold temperatures by November 30, 2016.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative and VMO Dominique Engel."
