This can become a possible health hazard for the dogs if not cleaned\nfrequently enough to prevent the buildup under the pens, or within the runs that allows for the dogs to walk and lay\ndown in the debris. The buildup of feces under the wooden kennel is a source of possible disease due to increased\nflies and vermin that can inhabit that area in close proximity to the dogs.

The outdoor kennel\nwith the beagles needs to have the catchment area cleaned out more often that once every 3 months.
