The gumline is reddened and swollen over the\ncanines and incisors and receding above the upper canines on both sides.\nLeo (MC# 0A02036566, DOB 6/4/12) a male Poodle Had heavy tartar buildup on his upper canines on both sides, and the\nleft upper premolars are encased in tartar.

The cyst between digits 4 and 5 on the left hind foot was swollen with a small\namount of serous discharge and the cyst between digits 3 and 4 on the right hind foot was swollen with no obvious\ndischarge.

The gumline is swollen and reddened and beginning to recede along the\nmolars on the right side.\nDental and gum disease can be painful, affect the dog\u2019s ability to eat, and lead to tooth loss. Chronic dental and gum\ndisease can also result in damage to other vital organs such as the kidneys and the heart.\nMatted hair can result in skin lesions and may become very painful, even to the point of affecting a dog\u2019s ability to walk\neasily. Matted hair can also compromise the hair\u2019s ability to provide protection from heat and cold.\nAn effective program for dental maintenance must be put in place and maintained to ensure the health of the dogs.
