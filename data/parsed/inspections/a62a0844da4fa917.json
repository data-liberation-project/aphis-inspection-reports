All structures in enclosures should be\nmaintained in good repair to prevent injury to animals.\nIn the badger enclosure, there are three spots along bottom perimeter of the enclosure that has exposed chain link\nmesh due to the badger digging. The exposed chain link should be covered to prevent injury to the animals.\n***Corrected By: September 7, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBaltrush Jan, Animal Care Inspector"
