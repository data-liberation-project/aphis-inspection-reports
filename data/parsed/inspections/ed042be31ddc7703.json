In one enclosure with three adult dogs, the dogs pulled the metal away from the main enclosure to\nsqueeze between it and their enclosure, creating a sharp edge. In another enclosure housing one adult dog the metal tin\nhad started to roll down creating sharp edges where if the dog jumped up it could injure his feet. The last enclosure\nhousing the one adult dog and four puppies had metal ties connecting the tin to the enclosure with the sharp points facing\ninward posing a risk of injury if the adult dog jumped on the enclosure. Failure to maintain housing facilities in good repair\ncan lead to injury of the animals contained in them. The licensee must maintain housing facilities so that they are free of\nsharp points that might cause injury to the animal.\nTo be corrected by September 10, 2025"
