The\nthird cavy, also housed in the same enclosure, was moved into a warmer area inside of the facility. A single electric\nheater was present and working in the garage where the animals were housed, however; the heater was unable to\nsufficiently heat the garage. Cold temperatures and inadequate heating can cause discomfort, distress, and even\ndeath.\nAssure that all indoor facilities are adequately heated to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.\nTo be corrected: The third Patagonian cavy was moved into a warmer part of the facility. All indoor facilities\ncontaining animals shall be adequately heated from this day forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.\nNO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED FROM THIS FACILITY SITE UNTIL ALL NON-COMPLIANT\nITEMS ARE CORRECTED."
