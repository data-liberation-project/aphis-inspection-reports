A\nside-to side opening transfer door connects the two runs. During the night, the transfer door was somehow opened\nand the male adults killed one of the puppies. The other puppies were unharmed. The facility examined all of the\ntransfer doors to determine if the latching mechanisms were working and adequate. The examination revealed that\nwhile the transfer doors appeared to be working correctly, the latching of the doors required careful attention. All of\nthe transfer door latches were replaced with retractable spring plungers with pull rings that must be physically\nengaged by personnel standing within the run when either opening or closing the transfer door. When the ring is\nreleased, the plunger snaps down and secures the door in the desired position. To avoid incidents such as this from\nhappening again, the facility must ensure that housing facilities for dogs are designed and constructed so that they\nprotect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering at all times.\nThis noncompliance was corrected prior to inspection."

The pen was put back together and reinforced. After this event, it was\nnoticed that the surviving boar appeared more aggressive and the decision was made to euthanize it.
