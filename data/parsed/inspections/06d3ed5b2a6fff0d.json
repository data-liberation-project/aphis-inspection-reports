The gums over all of the teeth are red and have\nreceded up away from the teeth and there is a creamy discharge at the gum line of some of the premolar and\ncanine teeth. There is one loose upper incisor tooth. These symptoms are consistent with dental disease in dogs.\nDental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the\nability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animal listed above must be\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate\ntreatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the\ncondition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. Correct by close of business 26\nMarch 2016.\nAdult, female, black and white French Bulldog with chip number 093 577 310 was seen by the attending\nveterinarian (AV) on 21 January 2016 and was diagnosed with Keratitis Sicca. Treatment directions from the AV for\nthis dog were \"Mild keratitis sicca can be managed by supportive care by cleaning with a moist cloth and application\nof ophthalmic ointment with steroids as necessary.\" During the inspection today, the dog'(cid:25)s left eye has thick green\ncolored discharge on the cornea and a hazy appearance to the surface of cornea. In addition, the \"(cid:28)white of the\neye\"(cid:29) was red compared to the right eye. These symptoms are consistent with the need for cleaning and treatment.\nThe licensee stated that they are not using ointment in this dog(cid:25)'s eye at this time. Failure to treat a medical problem\naccording to the directions of the AV result in problems that continue to get worse and can cause pain for the dog.\nThe licensee must use appropriate methods to treat disease and injuries which includes treatment of diagnosed\nmedical problems as directed by the AV. Correct by close of business today.\nThis routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO and Kendall\nLundy, ACI.\nAdditional Inspectors\nShaver Margaret, Veterinary Medical Officer"
