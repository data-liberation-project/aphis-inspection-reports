It was observed that both dogs were in crates where there was only\none food / water receptacle. Transporters should ensure that there is a food AND a water receptacle in each\nenclosure at the time of consignment, so that the animal can be properly cared for during transit.\nUpon taking possession of a dog or cat in transit, the intermediate handler is assuming the responsibility of ensuring\nthat all animal welfare act regulation requirements are met. The Intermediate Handler should take steps to ensure\nthat the carriers for which they handle animal cargo abide by these requirements.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a cargo office representative."
