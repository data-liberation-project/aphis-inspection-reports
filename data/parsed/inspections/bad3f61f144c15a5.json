      "narrative": "A male Yorkshire terrier (ID #168) was observed to have difficulty trying to sit on a piece of carpet in his enclosure.\nPhysical inspection of the dog revealed that he has a very thin body condition. The dog's shoulder blades, ribs, hip\nbones, and spinal column were easily felt with little body fat covering them. The dog's front teeth and the canine\nteeth have a brown/tan colored material covering the majority of their surface. There is a grey, creamy substance\nalong the gum line of all the teeth. The front teeth and the canine teeth on both sides of the mouth are loose. A\nfront tooth on the right side of the mouth was easily moved when touched by the inspector. The licensee stated\nthat he had been giving the dog medicine, but it has not been evaluated by a veterinarian recently.\nA female Yorkshire terrier (ID #069) was observed scratching the right side of her body. Physical inspection of the\ndog revealed red abrasions/wounds along her side behind her right shoulder. The area containing the abrasions is\nmostly hairless and there is some dried blood stuck in the remaining hair. Some of the abrasions appear moist and\nreddened and those closer to the shoulder have a dark crust across them. The skin in the area is slightly reddened.\nThe licensee said that he had not noticed this dog's condition. The dog's cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth\nare almost completely covered in a thick dark grey/brown material. There is a grey creamy substance along the\ngum line.\nDifficulty sitting and poor body condition can be an indication of an underlying health issue and also a sign of pain or\ndiscomfort in the animal. Scratching, hair loss and abrasions can also be an indication of pain and discomfort as\nwell as an underlying health problem. Poor dental health can also cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to\nfurther health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and\navailable to the inspectors upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care\nat all times."

One upper enclosure, containing one dog, has gate\nthat is slightly open and lacks any way to latch it shut. The licensee managed to wedge the gate closed but there is\na large gap in the wire that the dog could stick its snout or leg through. Inside the building there is one enclosure,\ncontaining two young adult dogs, which has an opening cut into the wire gate and contains a feeder. The feeder is\nmuch smaller than the opening resulting in a large gap that the dogs were seen sticking their snouts and faces\nthrough. Gaps in the wire could cause a dog to become entrapped and can result in injury to the dog. Gates that\nare not securely latched may allow the dog to escape or fall from the enclosure.\nAnother upper enclosure, containing one dog, has no gate at all. Lack of a gate does not allow for the enclosure to\nsecurely and safely contain the animal. The dog could escape or fall from the enclosure.\nInside the building there is a partition between two enclosures that has become loose at one end and is leaning into\none of the enclosures. The partition could collapse resulting in injury to the dogs. There are two dogs housed in the\naffected enclosures.\nFailure to maintain structurally sound enclosures can lead to animal injury or escape. Housing facilities for dogs\nmust be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. The licensee must repair or alter the affected\nenclosures in a manner that keeps them safe for the dogs and structurally sound.
