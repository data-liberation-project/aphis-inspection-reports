When the appropriate individuals were notified on July 20th, initial corrective measures\nwere taken, but their efficacy was not evaluated or monitored. The temperature continued to rise between\nobservations, and recorded temperatures in the hamster facility on July 21st ranged from 88 \u2013 93 degrees. The\ninitial corrective action was insufficient to maintain the appropriate temperature for hamsters, leading to an ambient\ntemperature of >85 degrees for more than 12 hours. Indoor housing for hamsters shall provide for the health and\ncomfort of the animals, and the ambient temperature shall not be allowed to exceed 85 degrees.\nTo remain corrected after July 24th, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted on site with a facility representative."
