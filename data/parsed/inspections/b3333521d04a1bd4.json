The entire eye is cloudy with a blue-grey color. The eye also does not have a visible pupil.\nThe licensee stated that the problem with the eye was noticed this morning. The licensee also stated the dog has\nnot been seen by a veterinarian. During the inspection, the licensee removed the dog from the enclosure and\napplied medicated eye drops to the affected eye.

This bottle of medication has an expiration date of November 2008.\nThe abnormal appearance of the eye could be an indication of injury, infection, or other medical issues. The\nlicensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan. Documentation should be available for all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended\ntreatment must be part of the documentation.\nThe usage of expired medication on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and\ndoes not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when\nexpired drugs are administrated to dogs could be drastically changed or not work as anticipated. The licensee must\nensure that all medications being used are not expired and used properly in accordance with standard veterinary\npractices.
