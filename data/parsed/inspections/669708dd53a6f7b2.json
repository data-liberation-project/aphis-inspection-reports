This\nseparation caused unnecessary behavioral stress in the female and juvenile when the female began vocalizing for her\noffspring for extended periods of time and the baby would call for its mother. In unnecessarily separating a juvenile from\nits mother the facility caused unnecessary discomfort and distress.

      "narrative": "The staff at the facility are not trained nor under the supervision of an individual who has the knowledge, background and\nexperience in proper husbandry and care of non-human primates, specifically the three Ring tail lemurs at the facility. The\nsupervisor who had experience left the facility almost 11 months ago. The current staff does not know how to adequately\ntrain, crate, separate or manage a family group of lemurs. When last inspected September 16, 2022, the family group\nconsisted of a male, female and infant male offspring born Sept 4, 2023. At the time of the inspection, intense discussion\ninvolved the family group dynamics, need to \u201cbaby proof\u201d the enclosure in the next few weeks and strong\nrecommendations to keep this as a family group for their psychological wellbeing and historical issue with the adult male\nbeing aggressive due to having been raised as an isolated animal.\nDuring this inspection, only the male and female lemur were in the enclosure. When asked, the inspector was informed\nthat the baby had been pulled at three months of age and was in another room. A staff member stated the adult male had\nbeen acting aggressive and they felt the need to pull the baby. Upon clarification, the facility confirmed that the male had\nbeen acting aggressive towards staff and the female, but not the baby. The facility pulled the baby unnecessarily, as\nopposed to separating the male they said was aggressive. The baby was then taken from the facility to a staff member\u2019s\nhome nightly so he could not hear the mother vocalize and she could not hear him vocalizing. He is returned to the facility\nduring the day and has been brought into the large mammal room to visually see the parents. The facility has expressed a\ndesire to neuter him and attempt to reintroduce him to his family group.\nAs a highly social family species, male offspring will often live with the parents for up to a year and a half. For the\npsychological wellbeing of the animal, the baby should have stayed with the parents, removed at the appropriate time for\nneutering and quickly reintroduced. Because he was pulled at such a young age, a reintroduction back to the group has\nlimited chance of success, requiring him to remain a solitary primate. Staff with adequate background in non-human\nprimate behavior and husbandry should recognize that a male ring-tale lemur acting aggressive to the staff was in fact\nprotecting his family group. If the male was aggressive to the female or offspring, then the adult male should have been\nseparated per 3.81 (a)(1), keeping the female and offspring together. Additionally, the staff never addressed the enclosure\nwire spacing or adequately \u201cbaby proofed\u201d the enclosure. According to staff, the baby escaped the enclosure, getting\ncaught in some netting around the wires, causing the mother to be distressed. Instead of designing the primary enclosure\nto contain the baby securely, they chose to remove him from the family group and house him in a smaller enclosure.\nThe staff has no observational records regarding the aggression of the adult male, distress vocalizations from the female,\npulling of the infant or his behavior when taken to a staff member home. Due to the lack of records, timely and accurate\ninformation cannot be conveyed to the AV and staff cannot maintain the level of husbandry practices and care required for\nnon-human primates. The facility must ensure that staff has a knowledge base of species they are caring for to provide\ngood welfare for the animals.\nCorrect by: June 10, 2023"
