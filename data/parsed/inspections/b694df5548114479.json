There were several areas of loosely matted hair, there was feces caked to the matted areas around the\nhind legs. There was discharge from the left side of the nose. The discharge was also found in the skin fold around\nthe nose. This animal had severe buildup of grey/tan material on the surface of the canine teeth and also had\nseveral missing cheek teeth.

Some of the mats are tightly adhered to the skin. The skin does not appear red or\nirritated. There is a thick, grey/tan material encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth and approximately half\nof the surface of each canine. A milky grey/tan substance is present along the gum line of all of the cheek teeth.\nThere is a string-like material mixed in with the milky substance located between the gums and the upper, right\ncheek teeth. Some of the upper cheek teeth on the right side of the mouth are loose and easily move when touched.\nThe gums are moderately red and swollen and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth.\nA female Shih Tzu ((cid:28)Betty of Arbor Hill(cid:29), Microchip # 102 305 036, DOB 04/12/06) has a mildly cloudy right eye. The\ncloudiness is located throughout the surface of the eye. There is a thick brown discharge/crusting present on both\neyelids and down the right side of the face.
