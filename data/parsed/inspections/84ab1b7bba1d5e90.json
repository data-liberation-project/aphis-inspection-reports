If left untreated, the abnormal build-up can cause\nfurther damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. Dental conditions can become painful and may decrease the dog\u2019s\nability to eat normally thus negatively impacting the overall health of the animal.

Left untreated, this skin condition may worsen causing pain and\ndistress to the dog.\nA ten year old white, black and brown hound known as \u201cBaxter\u201d (ear number T14) was seen with a hairless area\napproximately 0.5 inches in diameter, on the left front limb, near the paw. The skin appeared moist and had a pinpoint red\nspot. The skin surrounding the hairless region was brown in color. The registrant had not noticed and was not treating the\nskin condition. Left untreated, this skin condition may worsen causing pain and distress to the dog. There was also hard\nbrown to grey build-up with receding gums.
