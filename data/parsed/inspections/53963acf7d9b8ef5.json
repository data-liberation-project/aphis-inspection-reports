The clinical veterinarian immediately addressed\nthe injuries and provided surgical treatment. Both primates made full recoveries and no other NHPs in the room\nwere injured. The facility's investigation concluded that this incident was caused by a lock not being secured on the\nexterior side panel of the enclosure during a cage change performed earlier the same day.\nThe facility promptly acted to address this incident by conducting investigations, reporting the incident to OLAW &\nUSDA, and implementing a multi-step corrective action plan to prevent similar incidents in the future. No further\nescapes have occurred. Primary enclosures must contain the nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental\nopening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal. This incident has been appropriately addressed and is\nconsidered corrected.\nThis inspection (July 15 - 16, 2017) and exit interview (July 16, 2017) were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGladue Paula, Veterinary Medical Officer"
