The protocol did not include any drug preparation procedures or\njustification for use of this non-pharmaceutical grade drug in regulated animals. The use of non-pharmaceutical\ngrade drugs is not considered adequate routine veterinary care.

The ceiling material was visibly wet and bulging with an irregular surface in\nan area of approximately 2ft x 2ft. The evident damage extended under a light fixture and around a metal vented\nstructure. The cats had access to the pooling liquid and the area underneath the light fixture. The facility manager\nreported previous submission of two separate work orders to address this issue: one on Oct. 24, 2017 and a second\non Dec. 7th, 2017. No assessment or repairs have been performed to date. The cats may be injured by access to\nunknown substances or collapse or other failure of damaged ceiling structure. Primary enclosures must be\nstructurally sound and kept in good repair.\nTo be corrected by: 01/29/2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with OLAC Director/Attending Veterinarian and additional facility\nstaff.\nAdditional Inspectors\nKarr Eilis, Veterinary Medical Officer"
