The four enclosures had tape applied to the exterior that sealed all ventilation openings on the\nenclosures. Removal of the externally applied tape on one enclosure revealed the openings had also been sealed\nwith a layer of tape applied to the inside of the enclosure.\nCarriers and intermediate handlers must only accept for transportation any live animal in a primary enclosure which\nconforms to the requirements of 3.137: when there are ventilation openings located on all four walls of the primary\nenclosure the ventilation openings on each wall shall be at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each wall.\nBy sealing the openings on all four sides of the enclosures the animals were essentially provided with no openings\nfor ventilation. Insufficient ventilation during transportation will compromise animal well being by restricting oxygen\nand could result in death of the animal. Animals must not be accepted for transportation when housed in primary\nenclosures that do not meet requirements for adequate ventilation under the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect by: Immediate.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with United representatives at IAH."
