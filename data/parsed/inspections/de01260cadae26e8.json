The facility representative stated that Mouse was bitten by\nanother dog about four days ago. On closer observation there were puncture wounds high on the inside of the left\nleg. The facility representative stated that veterinarian had not been contacted, yet they had separated this dog and\nwere treating the puncture wounds. Limited weight bearing or non-weight bearing limbs are an indication of\ndiscomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the risks of further deterioration if not properly treated or left if left\nunattended.\nThere was also a female Boston Terrier identified as Dawnde 2 #0A01652831 that was consistently and repeatedly\nblinking her eyes. The eyes were tearing. The facility representative stated that it was probably allergies, no\ntreatment was being given and a veterinarian had not been contacted. Eye tearing and repeated blinking can occur\ndue to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee must\ncontact a licensed veterinarian concerning both of these dogs for proper treatment and assure that all of the animals\nare provided with adequate veterinary care as required.\nTo be corrected by July 29, 2016\n***On the (cid:28)hands on vet check(cid:29) there was a male Boston Terrier identified as Shadow #0A01540410 that was\nmarked not sound for breeding. Shadow was still intact and being housed with an intact female dog. Dogs that are\nused for breeding that have been identified as not being sound for breeding by a veterinarian, can increase the risk\nof harmful conditions to either adult or the puppies. The licensee separated Shadow into a single housing enclosure\nduring the inspection. The licensee must follow recommendations of a veterinarian and assure that all of the dogs\nreceive adequate veterinary care as required.\nCorrected during inspection.\nThe inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Bill Heine, ACI and Bev Hicks,\nACI.\nEnd of report.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHeine William, Animal Care Inspector"
