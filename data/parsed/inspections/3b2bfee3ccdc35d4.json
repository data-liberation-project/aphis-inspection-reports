The\nfacility representative stated that the attending veterinarian had been contacted about the acquisition of the animal\nand the need of a environment enhancement plan. The animal has been on site for approximately three months\nand no approved plan was in place at the time of the inspection.\nThe lack of appropriate environment enrichment, including special considerations for infants and young juveniles,\nand individual housing, can impact the growth and psychological well-being of a nonhuman primate. All dealers and\nexhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to\npromote psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently\naccepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed\nby the attending or species specific veterinarian. This plan must be made available to APHIS upon request.\nTo be corrected by: June 7, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
