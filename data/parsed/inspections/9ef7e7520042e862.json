The rabbits weighed approximately 10lbs, requiring 6sqft of space if they have a litter. The facility was aware that\nthe rabbits had litters because date of birth was marked on the cage cards and all 3 enclosures contained a nestbox. The\nlitters were confirmed to be in the nestboxes and were 4-5 days old. When not provided enough space, rabbits can\nbecome stressed and engage in abnormal behaviors, including killing their litters. Rabbits must be provided a minimum\namount of floor space based on weight and reproductive status in order to allow for normal postural adjustment and\nadequate freedom of movement. Corrected at the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
