Additional details are as\nfollows:\n***A goat housed in an outdoor enclosure was walking on his front knees (carpal joints). The goat was either unwilling or\nunable to rise to walk on his front toes. The licensee was not aware of the condition until the time of inspection and had\nnot sought treatment for this condition. Failure to identify conditions causing lameness or an abnormal gait and to seek\ntreatment for such conditions can lead to unnecessary suffering and further injury.\n***A second goat, housed in the same outdoor enclosure as the goat described above, was in very thin body condition.\nEven though the goat had a moderately long hair coat (about 1 inch in length), the top of the spine, the shoulder blades,\nand the pelvic bone were readily apparent. The goat also had a rough (or unkempt) looking hair coat. The licensee had\nnot identified the thin condition of this goat or sought treatment for this condition. Poor body condition can indicate a lack\nof sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. Failure to properly observe\nand/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can lead to worsening of the condition,\nprolonged unnecessary suffering, and possibly starvation and death.\n***Three goats died between 7/15/24 and 7/19/24. The goats were 3-5 years of age. The licensee did not seek veterinary\ncare for these goats prior to their death and did not consult with the veterinarian about the cause of their death to\ndetermine if other goats at the facility might be at risk of becoming ill or dying. As noted with these goats, failure to identify\ndisease conditions and seek veterinary care for those conditions has resulted in needless pain and/or suffering for the\nanimals or death.\nThe licensee must have the two live goats described above examined and treated by a licensed veterinarian. In addition,\na program of adequate veterinary care must be maintained that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries for all animals.\nTo be corrected by the close of business on 9/19/2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
