      "narrative": "When inspecting sheep enrolled in several IACUC approved protocols studying the effects of maternal obesity on\noffspring, the inspector observed juvenile ewes being checked for puberty. The puberty checking is performed by\nhousing the ewes with vasectomized rams that wear a dye marker on their chest. The dye marker puts a visible\nmark on the ewes' backs when the vasectomized rams mount the ewes in an effort to breed. This procedure is not\ndescribed in any IACUC approved animal use protocols. Upon request by the inspector, the Director of Research\nIntegrity and Compliance corresponded by email with a representative of the laboratory group of the principal\ninvestigator responsible for this activity. The representative confirmed that the puberty checking was being\nperformed on these animals for regulated, research purposes. The representative also confirmed that they had not\nrequested approval by the IACUC for this activity. If activities involving the care and use of animals at the facility are\nnot reviewed and approved by the IACUC, then the IACUC is unable to ensure that those activities comply with the\nregulations and do not jeopardize the welfare of the animals. The IACUC shall review and approve, require\nmodifications in (to secure approval), or withhold approval of those components of proposed activities related to the\ncare and use of animals. The principal investigators must obtain IACUC approval before conducting any regulated\nanimal care and use activity.\nCORRECT BY: Immediately\nThis inspection was conducted on 18 December 2018 with facility representatives, and this exit interview was\nconducted on 19 December 2018 with Director of Research Integrity and Compliance."
