A second\nenclosure, housing two raccoon, had welded wire on one side that had become broken and loose from the side\nsupport shared with the adjacent enclosure. The side support was scratched up indicating that the animals had\nbeen working on this area and might loosen or break the wire to the point that it could injure or trap the animals.\nCorrect by assuring the housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury and to contain the animals.
