      "narrative": "Eight Primates (50Y,GM2,47A,96C,72X,51S,40T,78U) were noted to have significant hair loss at the time of\ninspection. The underlying skin in these areas is pigmented, typical for the species but several also had redness of\nthe skin. There is no crusting of the skin or obvious signs of scratching and the animals were not observed hair\nplucking during inspection. The manager speculated about the causes of this hair loss including: that it was due to\nover-grooming for one and likely hormonal for another. She indicated, that in the case of 78U, that the near\ncomplete hair loss had been present for years. Below is a summary of the records reviewed:\n78U -The manager stated that the primate had a long history of diarrhea but was not currently receiving any\ntreatment for the hair loss. Veterinary records indicated that the animal had been evaluated for diarrhea multiple\ntimes but the hairloss was not assessed other than as a Hair Coat Score (HCS) which was Moderate General\nalopecia (3) on 6/2/15 and Bald (5) on 10/6/15. There was no documentation at the facility regarding the hair loss\nand no record of the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding this animals hair loss.\n40T - The record showed no workup for hairloss. In the past year, the animal had a wound on the left thigh\n(4/28/15), gave birth (5/29/15), and had a Physical Examination (PE) (10/20/15). On the PE, the animal was noted\nto be Overweight (4) with Severe Generalized alopecia (4) but no treatment plan was noted for either observation.\n51S - The record showed no workup for hairloss. The most recent PE (9/22/15) showed a Body Condition Score\n(BCS) of 3.5/5 (despite the facility using a four point scale instead of five as indicated). The HCS was noted as Mild\nPatchy alopecia (2) No treatment plan was noted.\n72X - The record showed no workup for hairloss. In the past year, the animal had a wound (4/16/15), gave birth\n(6/15/15), had a wound treated on the ventral back (7/15/15), and had a PE (10/20/15). On the PE, the animal was\nnoted to be hypoalbuminemic with Severe Generalized alopecia (4) and diarrhea but no treatment plan was noted\nfor the decreased albumin or the hairloss. The animal was on observation for diarrhea\n50Y, GM2, 47A, 96C Were all noted on their last PE to have a HCS of Mild Patchy alopecia (2) or better despite\nhaving significant hairloss at this inspection.\nAs indicated by the manager's comments, hair loss in primates can result from multiple causes. Evaluation by a\nveterinarian is necessary to determine the most likely cause and develop an appropriate diagnostic and treatment\nplan. Failure to address abnormal conditions can result in worsening of the condition and unnecessary suffering.\nAll licensees must ensure that observations of abnormal conditions are reported to the attending veterinarian in a\ntimely manner and that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease when\nidentified. Correct by having all animals with hair loss examined by a licensed veterinarian who will develop\nrecommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Additionally the licensee shall maintain record of this examination,\nthe veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations, and any treatments for future evaluation by APHIS Officials upon request.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility manager."
