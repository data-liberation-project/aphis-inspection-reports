These findings are consistent with dental\ndisease. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of the jaw\nsupporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the overall\nhealth of the animal. The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that\nan accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.\nThe coat was generally matted on his whole body but the mats were especially thick on the limbs and face. Soiled,\nmatted hair can cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted coats do not provide complete\nprotection against the elements. The licensee must clean this animal's hair coat and remove the matted hair. As\npart of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat\nmaintenance to ensure that animals are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is\nremoved on a regular basis."
