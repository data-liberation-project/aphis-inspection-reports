In three of these cages, excessive feces had built up to the point where the\nadult dogs and puppies had no other option but to step in their feces if they wanted to step into the portion of the\ncage that extends into the garage. In these cages, the feces was caked onto the grate. Feces build-up like that can\ncause the spread of disease including but not limited to fecal parasites. Excreta must be removed from primary\nenclosures daily and cages must be sanitized every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent the\naccumulation of excreta. Correct immediately.\nNote: The German Shepherd (Animal # GS230) that was cited under 2.40 (b)(2) from the last inspection was\nevaluated. The licensee was able to provide documentation showing that treatment had been completed since the\nlast inspection. The compatibility issues cited under 3.7 (b) from the last inspection appear to be resolved.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative.\nEnd of report."
