      "narrative": "The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 12:30p.m. on 12/19/2016.\nUpon arrival, we knocked on the door and received no answer. We then called Ms. Leo and made contact, she\nagreed to come outside of the house and meet with us. Immediately after stepping outside Ms. Leo indicated that\nshould would not allow for an inspection because of the police officers that were accompanying the inspection team.\nWe explained to Ms. Leo that the officers were present for all parties involved and not just our safety. She indicated\nthat they were there for only us. She then refused inspection again when asked. At that time she turned away from\nus, walked into the house and shut the door.\nRepeated refusal to allow APHIS officials to enter a facility in order to inspect regulated species and other\npotentially regulated animals is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Access must be granted to any\nfacilities as deemed necessary by APHIS officials in order to enforce the provisions of the AWA regulations and\nstandards, including but not limited to animal housing areas, procedure areas, transportation conveyances, holding\nareas, or other auxiliary areas related to the care or use of regulated species. In addition records may be examined\nand copied as needed and photographs taken of the facilities and animals as APHIS officials consider necessary.\nVeterinary Medical Officer, Michael Neafsey and Investigator from Investigative Enforcement Services, Kevin\nIsenhart were present at the time of this refused inspection."
