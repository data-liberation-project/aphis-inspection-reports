Both protocols describe surgery that involves a craniotomy and the use of meloxicam for pain during/after the\nprocedure. Both protocols also involve the use of foot shocks in behavior testing. The consideration of alternatives for\nboth protocols did not address the craniotomy procedure and one protocol, 201900151, also did not address alternatives\nto the foot shock procedure.\nThe searches were therefore not adequate to determine that alternatives were not available. In order to approve proposed\nactivities, the IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may\ncause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals and has provided a written narrative description of\nthe methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available.
