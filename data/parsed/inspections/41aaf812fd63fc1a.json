In addition, one black and white female Shih\nTzu ( micro chip number 076 051 281) has matted hair on the lower back, rear end and on all four legs, covering\napproximately 40 percent of the body. The matted hair on both dogs was matted to the skin. Matted hair can\ncause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture and affect the skin. It can foster skin infections, affect the\nanimal's mobility or be able to defecate normally. Matted hair does not maintain the same insulating qualities of\nnormally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for coat\nmaintenance for the health and well- being of the dog. The matted hair on both dogs were removed during the\ninspection, correcting this NCI."
