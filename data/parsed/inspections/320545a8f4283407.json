      "narrative": "At the start of the inspection, Merle, the smaller adult male castrated Camel was laying down in a kushed position\nwith his head and neck extended and was foaming at the mouth. He would not rise when approached. The facility\nrepresentative was asked to contact the AV. About one hour later, Merle stood up. He exhibited hyperextension of\nhis limbs when walking and repetitive head bobbing and lip twitching. He did eat grain when offered, chewing\nslowly. Veterinarian did not find any physical or behavior abnormalities upon exam and felt animal was in\nacceptable body condition.\nThe juvenile Southdown sheep housed in a pen on the east side of the shed building was limping on its left rear leg.\nThe sheep had urine and fecal staining around the hind end and down the back of rear legs. It was reluctant to\nmove around and was pushed out of the feeder by the bigger sheep and goats. Veterinarian examined animal and\ncould not identify cause of lameness and felt the animal was in acceptable body condition. He administered a\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory injection with follow up hoof trimming recommended.\nFailure to recognize and provide appropriate diagnostic and treatment of illness or injury can cause the animals to\nsuffer pain and suffering or death. The veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and visited the facility and\nevaluated the camel and the Southdown sheep within 2 hours.\nTwo fallow deer were observed with extremely long hooves on all four legs. Overgrown hooves can lead to pain,\ndiscomfort, lameness, gait abnormalities and joint/conformation problems."
