Three days after the training was conducted, two more rabbits\nescaped. No additional corrective action was taken at that time. From August to September 2018, six additional\nrabbits escaped from their enclosures. These incidents were all reported to the IACUC by facility personnel. No\nfurther action has been taken.\nThe enclosures at this facility are elevated off the floor on a rack system, and there is a substantial risk of injury to\nthe rabbits upon escape from these enclosures. These incidents are recurrent despite the additional training\nprovided by the facility in April. Further investigation of the underlying cause of the escapes is warranted to protect\nthe animals from potential injury.

      "narrative": "On August 24, 2018, an animal was anesthetized for a study procedure. Two research associates were present to\nadminister and monitor anesthesia. One was a senior employee who was training a junior employee in anesthetic\nprocedures. The junior employee was responsible for pressure checking the anesthesia machine prior to the\nprocedure.\nThe animal was intubated and its vitals were recorded. Eight minutes later, the animal's heart rate was noted to\ndecline rapidly. The machine was checked and it was discovered that the pop-off valve had remained closed after\nthe initial pressure check, leading to breathing complications. The veterinarian was immediately notified and\nresuscitation was attempted but was unsuccessful.\nThe anesthetic complications and subsequent death of the animal were the result of failure of personnel to correctly\nconfigure the anesthetic machine after the initial pressure check. It is the responsibility of the research facility to\nensure that personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.\nIn response to this incident, the facility immediately conducted additional training on anesthetic machine use and\nthere have been no additional related incidents. Corrected prior to inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted from 10/15 - 10/16/18. An initial exit interview was conducted on site on 10/16/18. A\nsupplemental exit interview was conducted on site on 10/23/18.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGladue Paula, Veterinary Medical Officer"
