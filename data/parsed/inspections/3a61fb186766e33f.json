      "narrative": "On Sunday, 9/14/2014, two adult female Labrador Retrievers that were housed together, with microchip #146 32\n129 0A and #029 109 374, were fighting and the owner immediately separated the animals into different primary\nenclosures. Both animals sustained injuries.\n***Upon our inspection, the yellow Labrador (#146 32 129 0A) had a swelling on her neck extending over the\nshoulder blades. Over the left shoulder, there was a circular area of black and crusty exudate on her fur. On the\ndog(cid:25)'s nose, there is an abrasion extending from the tip to opening of the nares.\n***The other dog, a chocolate Labrador Retriever (#029 109 374) had a reddened and swollen right eye. Also there\nwas a whitish-yellow, thick discharge coming out the corner of the right eye by the nose. At the time of inspection,\ntreatment was not provided for the animals.\nDog bites can cause significant injury to the skin, soft tissues and organs, which can lead to localized abscesses\nor generalized tissue infection (cellulitis) or any other disease condition that affects these animals(cid:25) overall health\nand well-being.\n***There was another adult female, yellow Labrador Retriever (#0A02086003) had an area of hair loss on the top of\nher head, about the size of a quarter. Within that area was a scab, about the size of dime. The licensee stated that\nshe was bit by flies about a week ago.\nInsect bites can cause significant irritation to the skin and discomfort to the dog which can lead to severe pruritus\n(itching) or any other disease condition that can affect this animal(cid:25)s overall health and well-being.\nThe licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian concerning these two animals and ensure that adequate\nveterinary care is provided to all animals as required by federal regulations.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: September 19, 2014.\n***On inspection of medication being used for the animals. Out of all the medications inspected, one bottle of\npyrantel pamoate, used as dewormer, had an expiration date of 05/14. The licensee recently used the expired\ndewormer for a litter of puppies in August 2014. According the licensee, there were no sicknesses noted due to the\nexposure. However, the use of expired medication is not considered acceptable veterinary practice and therefore\ninconsistent with adequate veterinary care according to the Animal Welfare Act.
