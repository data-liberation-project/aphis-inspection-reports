In several areas where the hair is missing, the exposed skin is thickened and has a dark\npigmentation. Animal caretaker stated that the younger female pronghorn was excessively mounting the older\nfemale which could potentially be stressful for this animal. These two female pronghorns need to be evaluated by\nthe attending veterinarian in order to determine if there is a medical and/or behavioral problem with the excess\nmounting and hair loss.
