Involved animals received\nveterinary treatment. These incidents were reported to the overseeing ACUC and OLAW and the facility has\nimplemented changes to decrease incidents of NHP's exiting their primary enclosures.\n-In relation to an ACUC-approved handling procedure a marmoset sustained a femur fracture that required\namputation. The injury was successfully treated resulting in the marmoset being able to ambulate well (observed in\ninspection). Bone fractures cause pain and the loss of a limb is considered a serious adverse effect to an animal.\nThis incident was reported to USDA, the overseeing ACUC, and OLAW. Corrective actions were implemented to\nprevent further recurrences.\n-On 10/25/18 the facility found a peromyscus mouse was found to have got its head caught between the\npolypropylene enclosure and the lid. Necropsy findings had signs of rapid hypoxia. It wasn\u2019t clear how the mouse\ngot its head caught, possible warping in enclosure might have contributed to the incident. Increased attention to\nenclosure warping and the manner in which enclosure lids are closed were corrective actions reported by the lab.\nThis is the first incident of this type that the lab is aware of and reports no further occurrences of entrapment have\nhappened since. This incident was reported to overseeing ACUC.\nCorrection: Ensure corrective actions are followed to prevent further occurrences of incidents.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nThis was a routine inspection of the animals, animal housing areas, records and protocols maintained under the\nLSVC IACUC conducted from 7/9 - 7/11/2019 and the exit interview was conducted on 7/12/19.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBarksdale Dawn, Veterinary Medical Officer"
