It was determined that this attack was from a bobcat\nand a trapper was hired. The IACUC agreed that no further action was required. During the inspection, the attending\nveterinarian explained that there has been a total of 8 sheep killed or euthanized due to predation between October 19,\n2020 and November 23, 2020, which includes 4 more sheep since the IACUC meeting where the predation was first\nreported. Per the attending veterinarian, these were all thought to be separate, individual attacks and were most likely\nfrom both a bobcat and a mountain lion. The initial effort to trap the bobcat was not successful.\nThe attending veterinarian reports that the perimeter fence surrounding the facility is 10 feet high in all areas except for\nthe gate where it is 6 feet high. The fence is constructed from \u201cno climb\u201d wire which consists of approximately 4x4 squares\nwith 3 inverted triangles in each square. The fence extends vertically from the ground with no kick out, barbed wire, or\nelectrified sections. No other deterrents are used on the fence.\nThe perimeter fence has not restricted animals from entering the facility multiple times and killing sheep. An effective\nperimeter fence protects the animals within from any outside animals that could cause injury or death. Perimeter fences\nare not required for domesticated farm-type animals, such as sheep, as long as the facility has effective security\nmeasures in place. These multiple predation incidents indicate that security measures are not effective to protect the\nanimals from harm.\nThe perimeter fence must be of sufficient height and constructed in a way that protects the animals within by restricting\npredators from entering the facility. Security measures used must be effective in protecting the animals. A corrective plan\nwith a reasonable timeline for completion must be developed.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY 18 JANUARY 2021.\nThis inspection was conducted from 12/14/20 to 12/16/20 and the exit interview was conducted on 12/16/20 with facility\nrepresentatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nMichael Schnell, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
