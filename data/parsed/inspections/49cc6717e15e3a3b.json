In this enclosure there was a catwalk that was warped where the ends of\nthe wood curled upward. One board had a nail that had come out of it exposing the head. There was also mesh that\nwas lining the walls of the enclosure that was coming down in which a cat could become entangled.\n** In the fifth enclosure containing 2 servals there was mesh lining the fencing that was falling down or coming away\nfrom the fencing allowing potential for a cat to become entangled.\n** In the first kinkajou enclosure containing one kinkajou there were two areas of the caging that the wiring had\ncome undone and its pointy ends were exposed. These areas need to be repaired and secured to ensure the safety\nand containment of the animals.\n** In the fennec foxes enclosure on the right there were small pieces of cut out chicken wire that were scattered on\nthe ground. Also on the outside there was a beam of wood for the structure and a perch made of wood that had\ndegraded and needs to be replaced.\n** In the fennec foxes outdoor enclosure on the left there is a wood beam that is falling on the mesh covering of the\nenclosure that needs to be removed and repaired. This beam could possibly fall in and injure an animal or possibly\ncreate a means to escape.\n**In the kinkajous enclosure on the left there is a den box made of wood that has been chewed and soiled. The box\nis in disrepair and needs to be repaired or replaced.\nThe facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
