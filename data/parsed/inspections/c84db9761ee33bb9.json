The environment enhance plan currently\nstates that all primates are housed in a least pairs. Three non-human primates including a male black-handed\nspider monkey, a female brown capuchin, and a female white throated capuchin are currently single housed for a\nvariety of reasons. The environment enhancement plan must be updated to address the social changes for these\nthree non-human primates. The plan should include the reasons for these non-human primates for being single\nhoused, attempts to introduce them to other non-human primates, additional enrichment, and that they are housed\nadjacent to other non-human primates. Correct by July 28, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner's wife."
