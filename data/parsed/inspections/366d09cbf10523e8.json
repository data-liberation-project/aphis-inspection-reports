The licensee had\nconsulted with the attending veterinarian on the care of the dog after the incident. The veterinarian told the licensee\nto give the dog 5-6cc\u2019s of penicillin every other day for an 8 day period and to treat the wounds with Vetericyn spray.\nThe dog received the first penicillin treatment on October 10th and the last treatment on October 18th. At the time\nof the inspection the left front leg has a significant amount of swelling midway down the leg in an area that received\nnumerous lacerations. Physical examination by the inspector revealed that this area of swelling was much hotter to\nthe touch than other areas of the dog\u2019s leg and body. The licensee has not had the condition of this dog\u2019s leg\nre-evaluated by the veterinarian.\nA female Great Dane (\u201cBlue Velvet\u201d, 0A02025018) has discharge coming from both eyes. The lower eyelid on both\neyes is drooping and the hair surrounding both eyes is wet and is becoming thickly coated with the discharge. The\ndischarge from the right eye has a yellowish color. The licensee stated that this dog had surgery on her upper eye\nlids at some point during this year. The dog is not currently receiving any treatment approved by a licensed\nveterinarian for her eyes.\nA female Mastiff (\u201cSansa Stark\u201d, 0A02036007) has discharge coming from both eyes. The discharge is yellow in\ncolor and is located beneath both eyes. The left eye has a significant amount of discharge that is attached to the\nhair beneath the eye and the hair directly under this eye is wet. The hair beneath the right eye is also wet and has a\nlarge amount of yellow discharge attached to the hair and in the corner of the eye. A strand of the discharge is\nacross the eye and attached to the upper eyelid. The licensee had not noticed the condition of this dog\u2019s eyes.\nPoor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Areas of swelling on the body could also cause pain\nand discomfort to the dog and could indicate an underlying health issue. The above mentioned dogs must be\nevaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and\ntreatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must\nprovide all dogs with adequate veterinary care at all times.\nCorrection date: End of business October 26, 2016"
