The appearance of the ears is consistent with a chronic condition that has been occurring for an extended period of\ntime. There is also evidence the animal has been scratching the area. The back side of both ears are also being affected\nby mild hair matting. The licensee was not aware of the condition of the ears and was not treating it.\nA female Golden Doodle dog named \u201cTootsie\u201d (Microchip #1412) has dark discharge in both ears. The ears are reddened\nand contain dark discharge with scabs in the ear canal. The ears also show evidence that the animal has been scratching\nthe area. The licensee was not aware of the condition of the ears and was not treating it.\nInflamed ears with discharge can be a sign of infection and can cause pain and discomfort for the animal. Failure to\nidentify problems of animal health can lead to delays in providing proper care to animals resulting in worsening of their\ncondition. Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use\nof appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency,\nweekend and holiday care.
