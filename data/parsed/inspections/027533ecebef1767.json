There was also a brown film on the door leading to the outside\npart of the kennel and along the walls. The washdown pans which collect all the fecal material and urine under the\nkennel showed a build up of both older and new excreta as well as increased insect activity. Upon speaking with the\nlicensee he had not had the opportunity to spot clean the kennel since Thursday and had sanitized the kennel\napproximately three weeks ago.\nThe licensee must remove any food waste and excreta from the primary enclosures on a daily basis to prevent an\naccumulation. Cleaning the enclosures on a daily basis reduces the chance of disease, pests and odors. The pans\nunder the primary enclosure must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent a build up. A build up on the\nwashdown pans increases the chance of pests, disease and odors.\nCorrect by cleaning the enclosures and the washdown pans by 8/9/2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee's wife."
