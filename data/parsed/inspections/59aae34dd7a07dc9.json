Subsequent to a study\nprocedure in August, monitoring of blood cell counts and body weight was conducted according to an approved\nprotocol. Over the course of one week, there was a >80% decrease in the animal's white blood cell count to levels\nsubstantially lower than the normal reference range. These low levels persisted and continued to drop in two\nsubsequent tests conducted over the course of the following week. Bi-weekly body weight measurements on this\nanimal were documented and show steady and progressive weight loss over the same time period. Both of these\nparameters changing concurrently represent strong evidence that this animal was experiencing a health problem.\nHowever, the research team did not contact the facility veterinarian to provide timely and accurate information\nregarding the health and well-being of this animal, and the animal passed away without veterinary assessment or\ntreatment.\nResearch facilities shall maintain programs of veterinary care that include a mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the\nveterinarian.\nThis incident was voluntarily self-reported to the USDA by this facility, and corrective measures had been\nimplemented prior to inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted from December 16th to December 18th, with a preliminary exit interview conducted\non site with facility representatives on December 18th. A final exit interview was conducted with facility\nrepresentatives by phone on December 19th."
