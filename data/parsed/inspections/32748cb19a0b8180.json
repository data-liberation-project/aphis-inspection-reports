According to the exhibitor, the python appears more rotund than\nusual and it is presumed that the python consumed the 3 rabbits. The animals are indoor housed in separate enclosures\nthat share a common solid wall. The entrance to the rabbit enclosure is a half wall that is approximately 5 feet tall with a\nwide air gap to the ceiling. It is undetermined how the python escaped their padlocked enclosure at this time. Primary\nenclosures housing rabbits that can be breached by wild or captive predators can result in their injury or death. Primary\nenclosures for rabbits shall be constructed and maintained to keep predators out.\nCorrect from this date forward of 10 July 2023.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
