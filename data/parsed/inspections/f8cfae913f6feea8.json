The\naffected area included under its tail, genitals, and pelvic area and extending over the inner aspect of both hind legs nearly\nto the foot and extending nearly to the rabbit\u2019s belly. The underlying skin was red and appeared inflamed. The corrective\naction was to have the animal examined by a veterinarian and treated according to that veterinarian\u2019s instructions. The\ndisposition record (APHIS Form 7020) presented to the inspectors by the facility representative showed that this animal\nwas purchased by an individual in Michigan The facility representative stated that this animal was not seen by a\nveterinarian and was sold on August 15, 2024.\nOn Wednesday 8/14/2024 and Thursday 8/15/2024, the inspectors observed a 4- to 5-month-old spotted hyena that was\nmoving abnormally at the time of inspection, showing signs that were consistent with lameness resulting from pain, poor\nmuscle development, or hind limb instability. The corrective action was to have the animal examined by a veterinarian and\ntreated according to that veterinarian\u2019s instructions. The hyena was not examined by a veterinarian prior to sale on August\n15, 2024. The disposition record (APHIS Form 7020) presented to the inspectors by the facility representative showed\nthat this animal was purchased by an individual in Missouri, at least a ten-hour drive from this facility.\nThe President of the pet shop stated to the inspectors that these two animals had not been evaluated by a veterinarian\nprior to the sales. The inspectors contacted the veterinarian who was represented as the attending veterinarian on the\nprevious inspection (8/14 to 8/15/24) and the veterinarian who was represented as the attending veterinarian on the this\ninspection (8/19/24). Neither veterinarian had evaluated these animals at any time.\nAll dealers must ensure that all animals are provided with adequate veterinary care to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care can result in unnecessary suffering resulting from\nthe spread of disease between animals and delays in treatment of impacted animals. Transporting animals over long\ndistances when they may have painful conditions can result in significant unnecessary suffering. Correct by ensuring that\nanimals are provided with adequate veterinary care including examination by a veterinarian to prevent, control, diagnose,\nand treat diseases and injuries."

The information was not furnished by the licensee to date.\nOn 08/14/24, when the inspector asked who the Attending Veterinarian was, the facility representative referred the\ninspector to a name and phone number on the wall. The inspector contacted that veterinarian, who stated that she was\nnot the Attending Veterinarian for the facility. The facility was cited for not having an Attending Veterinarian, as required\nby the Animal Welfare Act regulations.\nOn a follow-up inspection on 8/19/24, the report for the inspection on 8/14 to 8/15/24 had the name and number of a\nsecond veterinarian written on it. When asked by the lead inspector, the facility representative stated that is what he got\nfrom the owners.\nAs the information regarding the status of an Attending Veterinarian could not be answered by the facility representative\nduring the inspection on 8/19/24, on 8/20/24 the inspectors called the company both the President of the pet store at\napproximately 1:30 p.m. and then Vice-President of the pet store at 1:41 p.m. The calls were not answered and voicemail\nmessages were not left. Instead, the lead inspector sent an email to the President and Vice-President of the pet shop on\n8/20/24 at 3:16 PM to the email addresses that they provided for contact. The email specifically asked if the veterinarian\nwritten on the inspection report was their new Attending Veterinarian. Additionally, that email contained questions\nregarding the status of the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) and if the veterinarian provided information about diets. The\nPresident replied on 8/21/24 with an email that did not identify an Attending Veterinarian or the definitive status of the\nPVC but rather stated, \u201cThe new attending veterinarian will have this all completed ASAP, I will inquire about an updated\ntimeline.\u201d The email also did not state whether the new Attending Veterinarian provided any guidance related to diet.\nAs that email response from one of the owners did not furnish the information requested by the lead inspector, she sent a\nfollow-up email to the President and Vice-President on 8/22/24 at 12:20 PM with more detailed questions about those\nissues. She gave a deadline for response as the end of the business day on 8/22/24. No response has been yet received\nto that email.\nBecause there was no response to that email, the lead inspector called the President and Vice-President on 8/23/24 at\n11:323 AM and 11:33 AM and left voicemail messages asking for them to return her call. No return call or other response\nwas received.\nThe inspectors have repeatedly requested information about key information about their business, specifically related to\nveterinary care, and provision of that information by the licensee is required by the Animal Welfare Act regulations. To\ndate, those inquiries have not been answered. The failure of the facility to promptly furnish this requested information has\ndiminished the ability of the inspectors to complete a thorough inspection. The conclusion of the inspection and the\ndelivery of the inspection report has been significantly delayed because of the inaction of the licensee to provide\nrequested information in a reasonable amount of time, presently 7 calendar days including the day of the inspection. The\ninaction in providing the required information has also diminished the ability of the inspectors to thoroughly evaluate the\nveterinary care, husbandry practices and welfare of the animals. The inspectors cannot determine whether there is any\nveterinary care being provided by the licensee.\nThe licensee shall promptly furnish the requested information and, in the future, furnish within a reasonable amount of\ntime all information which the APHIS official may request in connection with the enforcement of the provisions of the Act,\nthe regulations and the standards in this subchapter.\nCorrect by: 8/27/24"
