The use of\noutdated or expired medications may not be safe or efficacious, and is not considered to be an acceptable practice.\nMedications that are past their expiration date can deteriorate with time and may not result in the intended\ntherapeutic effects in the animals.\nAlthough the expired medications were immediately discarded at the time of the inspection, the research facility\nneeds to ensure that all personnel involved in animal care, including research staff, are familiar with the guidelines\nfor administering in-date medications. In addition, the research facility needs to review its procedures for monitoring\ndrugs to ensure that all medications being used on research animals are in current dating.\nCorrect from this date 11/1/17 forward.\nNOTE - Exit briefing held 11/1/17 on-site with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLopinto John, Veterinary Medical Officer"
