      "narrative": "There needs to be an appropriate diet approved by the attending or treating veterinarian for the 12 year old thin\nmale camel Gabrielle. According to the handler during the inspection this camel was initially thin due to the winter\nmonths and noticed he lost weight in the last several months after he shed his winter coat. It was stated that\nGabrielle was not getting enough food due to the rest of the camels during feeding and he was being very choosey\nwith the varieties of food. It was stated Gabrielle at times would not eat from on to 3 days having to change different\nproducts of feed with no evidence of approval from the attending veterinarian. After there was no improvement a\nveterinarian on site did recommended a diet on two occasions but there was no evidence that the complete diet is\nbeing followed. To ensure this camel is being fed an adequate diet there needs to be a diet approved and followed\nby the attending or treating veterinarian. I did observed the camel during two days of inspections and he was eating\nand active. This camel will be transported to the attending veterinarian as an appointment has been scheduled next\nweek.\nFood shall be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be\nprepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. Animals shall be fed at\nleast once a day except as dictated by veterinary treatment, normal fasts, or other professionally accepted\npractices.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: APRIL 8, 2016.\nThis inspection was conducted with the handler and exit interview with the handler in Naples, Florida and licensee\nvia phone."
