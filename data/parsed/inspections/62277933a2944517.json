The owner did not\nrealize that the animals were without heat for several hours with temperatures reported to be 40 below.\nThe capybara(cid:25)s exposure to lower temperatures led to frost bitten areas on the feet and ears. There was initial\ncommunication with the attending veterinarian via electronic communications (text messaging) but the animals\nwere not examined by the veterinarian to properly diagnose the extent of injuries. When the animals were finally\nexamined several weeks later, the veterinarian determined euthanasia as best option to prevent further suffering of\nthe animals.\nVet care including appropriate methods to diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries needs to be addressed at this\nfacility for the health of the remaining animals there.\nCorrect Immediately"
