      "narrative": "***An approximately 13 year old, reindeer steer, named \u201cDumas,\u201d was lame on the left hind limb. While standing in\nthe enclosure, the reindeer alternated between standing with both hind limbs tucked underneath his body and being\nnon-weight bearing on the left hind limb. At the walk and trot, when the reindeer placed his left hind limb on the\nground, he would shift his body weight onto his other three limbs, creating a \u201chopping\u201d movement to his gait. The\nlicensee stated that he had first noticed the lameness yesterday evening. The reindeer had not been given any\nmedication by the licensee to address the lameness and he had not notified his veterinarian about the issue. The\nlicensee stated that his veterinarian was located several hours away near his home site location, and he did not\nhave a veterinarian in the area.\n***An approximately 10 year old, female, reindeer, named \u201cComet,\u201d appeared to be standing uncomfortably in the\nenclosure. She was constantly shifting her weight between different limbs while standing. Additionally, she would\nraise different limbs off of the ground for periods of time while at rest.\nLameness and non-weight bearing is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes\nincluding both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis\nand treatment of this lameness can result in delays of appropriate care. Injuries, diseases, and medical conditions\nthat are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be worsened and can lead to prolonged suffering.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by\na veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the licensee must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the\nanimals at the facility. The licensee was notified verbally that he must have both reindeer examined by a\nveterinarian by no later than 5:00pm on December 4, 2017 to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment\nplans to address the soundness issues cited above.\nThe outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation\nshould include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by\nthe veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions and entries on a log and/or calendar\nand/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animal. There should also be an\nentry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each animal at that point, to indicate\na time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the need for follow-up and any\nfurther veterinary care prescribed.\nAdditionally, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as\ndescribed by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate\nveterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and\ninjuries.\nTo be corrected by: December 4, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
