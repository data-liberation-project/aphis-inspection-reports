      "narrative": "Thirty seven rabbits underwent blood collection immediately prior to euthanasia in amounts that exceed what is\nallowed by the IACUC approved protocol and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures). A staff member stated that\nsome rabbits are bled from the ear vein until no more blood can be obtained and that the rabbits are then\neuthanized in the carbon dioxide chamber. When bleed records for euthanized rabbits were checked from March\n15, 2014 through the day of the inspection (35 days), 37 rabbits had blood collected in excess of what was allowed\nby the protocol prior to euthanasia. In most cases, the amount of the final blood collection was approximately double\nwhat was allowed by the protocol.\nTwenty eight goats underwent terminal blood collection immediately prior to euthanasia between January 1, 2013\nand April 30, 2013. The amounts of blood collected in these terminal procedures exceeded what was allowed by the\nIACUC approved protocol and SOP. A staff member stated that the terminal bleeds were approved by\nsubcommittee on May 30, 2013. However, the IACUC community member position was vacant during May, thus the\nfacility had no functional IACUC at that time and no outside member had the opportunity to participate in the May\nprotocol evaluation. The community member position was filled in July and the member was first present at a\nmeeting in August 2013. Between May and the August meeting an additional 84 goats underwent terminal blood\ncollection, again exceeding the amounts allowed by the protocol. Additionally, according to the August 2013 IACUC\nminutes, the protocol was not reviewed during this meeting. An additional 168 goats were euthanized with terminal\ncollections between the August 2013 meeting and the next February IACUC meeting, the next protocol review.\nSignificant changes in the care and use of animals in ongoing activities may adversely affect animal well-being. The\nIACUC should review proposed significant changes to activities involving animals prior to the implementation of\nthose activities.\nPrevious correction date: Correct immediately."
