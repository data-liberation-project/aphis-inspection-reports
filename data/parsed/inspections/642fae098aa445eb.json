It was thought to have gotten its foot caught in a corner\nhole, which was slightly larger than the other holes in the flooring. The animal failed to respond to treatment and\nwas euthanized. Bedding-free flooring must allow waste to drop through, but protect feet and legs from injury. This\nwas corrected quickly after the incident, prior to the time of inspection. The study was concluded shortly after this\nincident without further cases. The cage floors have since been replaced with solid-bottom flooring with bedding.\nAnother incident was reported in the October 2017 IACUC minutes. A guinea pig was injured when its leg got\ntrapped in a damaged igloo. The animal was euthanized when it did not respond to treatment. Husbandry staff had\nnot removed the damaged item as per policy. Items in the enclosure must be replaced when damaged to protect\nfrom injury. This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by retraining the staff on evaluating enrichment items\nfor safety."
