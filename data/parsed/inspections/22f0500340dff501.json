The medication was obtained from an outside source by the time\nit was needed. There was no delay in the procedure, nor ill effect on the animal from the oversight.\nMedication errors such as these could result in lack of effectiveness of a treatment regimen, or harm to the animal if\nprocedures were prolonged while medications are procured.
