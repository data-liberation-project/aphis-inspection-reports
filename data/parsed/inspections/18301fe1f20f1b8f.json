From the medical records pulled and reviewed, at least 4 dogs failed to receive follow up care as directed by\nthe Attending Veterinarian (AV), and 1 dog did not receive medication as prescribed.\n***One dog, \"Bow\" (female yellow lab, 11 year old, 900215003196985) was noted to be severely overweight and having\nmuch difficulty rising from the concrete floor. She has excess fat deposits over her entire body including the ribs,\nbackbone and limbs. Her ribs could not be palpated. It took her eleven seconds and many attempts to get her front legs\nup off the ground and her weight on them to get up off the floor. Her front limbs kept sliding out from under her. No rubber\nmats were present in his enclosure. Previous examination results show her being placed on thyroid medication but no\nevaluation for her weight or difficulty rising.\n***Medical records show \"Shadow\" (10-year-old female black lab, microchip 900215003196997) was seen for heart\nissues on 5/2/23, and the AV requested a recheck in 2-6 weeks. At the time of the inspection, no recheck had been\nperformed.\n***Medical records show 3 dogs were diagnosed with low thyroid blood test levels over the last approximately four months\nand started on supplemental thyroid medication. The medical records for all three dogs state that the dogs were to have\nfollow-up thyroid testing after being on the medication for several weeks but the records do not show that these tests have\nbeen done. \"Snow\" (10-year-old female yellow Labrador, microchip 900215003196989) was diagnosed and started on\ntreatment on 3/27/23 with a recheck to be done in 45-55 days. \"Chance\" (5-year-old male yellow Labrador, microchip\n900215003196995) was diagnosed and started on treatment on 3/24/23 with a recheck test to be done in 45-55 days.\n\"Ritz\"(1.5-year-old female black Labrador, microchip 900215003196821) was diagnosed and started on treatment on\n4/17/23 with a recheck test to be done in 50-70 days. None of these dogs had received follow up testing by the time of the\ninspection.\n***One dog, \"Snowflake\", (twelve year old yellow lab 956000012520418) did not receive a daily medication as prescribed\non 6/9/23 to 6/11/23. The kennel manager stated that the AV did not give permission for this medication to be stopped.\nFollow up testing requested by the veterinarian is important to ensure that the correct dosage of medications is\nadministered. Follow up examinations are essential for monitoring disease progression and response to treatments.\nFollowing the AV's instructions regarding daily prescription medications is vital for animal health.\nCorrect by 1) having the veterinarian re-evaluate Bow to develop a treatment and husbandry plan going forward to\naddress her health issues and by 2) using appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and\ninjuries in consultation with the AV, including the timely provision of follow-up care as prescribed by the AV."
