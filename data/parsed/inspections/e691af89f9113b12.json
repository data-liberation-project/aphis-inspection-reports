In the back Degu enclosure, the\nmetal sides and bottom corners have rust that easily comes off on your hand. Sharp edges can pose a danger to the\nanimals inside and lead to oral or extremity lacerations and wounds. Rusting of metal causes pitting in the metal surface\nand prevents adequate cleaning of the enclosure to minimize biological hazards to the animals. Correct by 3 May 2022 by\nensuring that all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals."
