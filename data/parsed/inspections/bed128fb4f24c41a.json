Veterinary evaluation on 9/23/15 indicated that this animal be monitored for a\nmonth to determine if she continued to lose weight or if she regained her pre-pregnancy body condition. This\nfemale hedgehog was transferred to a second site for this licensee and had not been monitored nor reweighed to\ndetermine if she had recovered. All four female hedgehogs on site were evaluated and weighed during the\ninspection of site 002 on 11/6/15. One female with pinto markings similar to the one seen at site 001 from Bin#43\non 9/21/15 and 9/23/15 weighed 390 grams on 11/6/15 which would be an improvement if this is the same animal\nbut there was no mechanism nor records by which this could be determined.\n**A juvenile male hedgehog was evaluated by a veterinarian on 9/21/2015 where a diagnosis of mild upper\nrespiratory infection was made. The veterinarian initiated treatment for the diagnosed condition and there is a plan\nto repeat antibiotic treatment in two weeks if animal has not improved. This hedgehog had been sold according to\nthe licensee and no records were made to show that this animal responded to the treatment prior to release for sale.\nEach dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of\nemergency, weekend, and holiday care.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM."
