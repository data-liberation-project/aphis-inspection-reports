The caretaker observation log for those days does not indicate any abnormal\nfindings, including the finding of the deceased animals, and the facility representative did not know when the guinea pig\nenclosure was last cleaned. The facility representative stated that all three of the guinea pig carcasses are frozen,\nawaiting necropsy from the veterinarian. Failure to adequately sanitize primary enclosures as frequently as needed can\nresult in noxious fumes as well as accumulation of feces and other debris that can foster microbial growth, attract pests\nand vermin, and cause discomfort, distress, illness and death.
