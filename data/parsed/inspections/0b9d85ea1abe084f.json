The licensees confirmed\nin some of the pictures from the event that different adults and children were allowed to hold their sloth. In a few of the\npictures their sloth was stretching and reaching her neck back. In some of the photos the licensee recalled that they would\nactually call from behind the camera and she would look back at the camera more as a learned behavior. While some of\nthe pictures might be a learned behavior or the sloth looking for her bonded caretaker, a sloth stretching its neck back and\naway from someone holding it might also be stressed. Allowing young children and multiple adults hold a sloth with no\ndirect control of it by the license-holder can also be stressful for the sloth and increase the risk of injury to public\nmembers. Ensure that if the sloth is in public events that she is handled in a manner that prevents any behavioral stress\nor discomfort. (The licensee discussed their corrective plans and do not plan to allow the public to hold their sloth in future\nevents.)\n***To be corrected from 2/16/2024 forward."
