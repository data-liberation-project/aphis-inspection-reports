Animals could become tangled in the tether causing injury or\nbecome stressed because of the inability to get away from the public. They could break a tether and leave the area.\nSmall children could get caught in the tethers and be injured or be knocked over by the animals. The pigs need to\nhave an enclosure that does not easily allow children and adults to enter the enclosure and allows the pigs to\nescape from the public if they desire. The animals must be maintained in facilities that contain the animals, allow\nthem to escape from public contact if they desire, and protect them from injury.\nTo be corrected by: Aug 1, 2015"
