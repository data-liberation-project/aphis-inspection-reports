There were six open windows in the facility, but no screens present\nto prevent the entry of flies. The presence of these pests creates conditions which promote undue stress for the\nanimals and creates conditions which promote the spread of disease within the facility. Guinea pigs exposed to\nnumerous flies can increase health hazards such as parasitic disease, bacterial disease, and viruses. Additional\nmeasures must be taken to control the fly problem such as increased sanitation, exclusion, other fly control\nproducts, and/or consulting with a pest control company. Licensee must establish and maintain an effective\nprogram for the control of pests to protect the health and well-being of the guinea pig colony.
