An adult, male cat (\u201cTyson\u201d\n#BH0550FM) was placed in a temporary holding/transport device (consisting of 4x4 stacked enclosures) while the\nopen room he shared with multiple other cats was undergoing routine cleaning/sanitation. The cat, which was dark\ngray, went unnoticed by the staff when the cats were placed back in the open room. The large, dark gray\nholding/transport device was then sent to the enclosure wash. Upon completion of the cleaning cycle, the cat was\nfound deceased in the enclosure. The respective supervisor stated employees were instructed to inspect all\nenclosures for pets before the enclosures are sanitized, however, there was no documentation identifying that this\nspecific training for cleaning enclosures was provided. The facility has well-documented protocols to ensure\nemployees and contractors are qualified and properly trained to perform their duties. The facility acted promptly and\nappropriately to address this accident. They conducted an immediate investigation and implemented immediate\nchanges to their animal enclosure and room cleaning procedures, including adding the appropriate training\ndocumentation. Additionally, the IACUC discussed the incident and as a result, certain Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOP\u2019s) were modified to ensure the accident could not be repeated. All employees involved with\ncleaning/sanitizing pet rooms or enclosures have since received re-training on the new SOP\u2019s and that training is\nwell-documented. This non-compliant item was already corrected by the facility.\nThe inspection was conducted 8-9 August 2017 and a thorough exit interview was conducted with facility personnel."
