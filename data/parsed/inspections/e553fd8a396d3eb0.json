It was discovered that a water hose became disconnected from a Lixit.

One pig, #131, began to display neurologic signs of salt toxicity and seizures that ultimately\nfailed to respond to therapy, necessitating euthanasia. The cause of the disconnected hose was not determined and could\nnot be reproduced. Corrective actions were implemented, to include retraining of the caretaker and care staff for checking\nhose connections, normal pig behavior and disease states, and adding a second health check later in the evening, which\nis performed by a different caretaker on alternating days.\nFailure to ensure access to drinking water impacted the well-being of three pigs and resulted in the development of salt\ntoxicity and subsequent euthanasia of one pig. The facility must ensure that potable water is accessible to the animals at\nall times or at least provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals; frequency of watering shall\nconsider age, species, condition, size and type of animal.\nCORRECTED PRIOR TO INSPECTION\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
