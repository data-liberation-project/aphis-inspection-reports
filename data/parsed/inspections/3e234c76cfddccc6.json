The\nentry door to the room is a hollow core metal door. The surface of the lower part of the door close to the floor was\nrusty and part of the rusted area had corroded through forming a rectangular shaped opening approximately 1 inch\nhigh by 12-14 inches long that exposed the inside of the hollow door. In addition, the painted cinder block wall of\ntwo of the kennels had small areas of peeling paint that were near the floor level of the walls.\nRusted surfaces cannot be effectively sanitized and the opening into the hollow core door allows dirt or other debris\nto get inside the door itself and cannot be adequately cleaned. The presence of peeling paint in primary enclosures\ncan pose a risk should pieces of the paint flake off and be ingested by the dogs and can also interfere with effective\ncleaning and sanitization of the walls.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, buildings where housing facilities for dogs are located must be kept in good\nrepair to protect the dogs from injury and to facilitate required husbandry practices.\nThe Registrant needs to address the condition of the kennel room door and the walls of the two kennels to maintain\nthe premises in good repair and to ensure effective cleaning and sanitization.\nCorrect by 8/15/16.\nNOTE - Exit interview held on-site 3/8/16 with facility representative.
