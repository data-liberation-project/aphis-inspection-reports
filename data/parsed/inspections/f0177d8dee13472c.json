Several others were lethargic due to the cold temperatures, however\nthe licensee was able to warm them and no vet care was required at the time.\nDue to the extreme ambient temperature change caused by the open window and cold temperatures, several\nhedgehogs died and others experienced undue stress and discomfort. From this date forward, the licensee must\nensure that temperature in indoor housing facilities shall be sufficiently regulated by heating or cooling to protect the\nanimals from the extremes of temperature, to provide for their health and to prevent their discomfort.
