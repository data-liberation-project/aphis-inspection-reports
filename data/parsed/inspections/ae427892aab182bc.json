Lameness can be caused by a\nvariety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and\naffect the health and well-being of the animal. This animal also had overgrown hooves, the toes on her right front\nleg were longer compared to the others. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities\nwhich could be painful or cause injuries.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The\nprogram for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
