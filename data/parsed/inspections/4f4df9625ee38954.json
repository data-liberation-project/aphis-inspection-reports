The\nPVC prescribes for adult dogs to receive vaccinations for distemper and parvovirus yearly.\nThe facility reports that female dogs are given a \u201c5 way\u201d or \u201c7 way\u201d vaccine (which contain distemper and parvovirus) at\nthe time of their pre-breeding exam, which occurs before a dog enters its estrus cycle (also known as \u201cgoing into heat\u201d).\nFemale dogs cycle approximately every 6 months. Which means, a dog may be getting vaccinated twice a year, not\nyearly as the PVC prescribes. It is also possible a dog goes longer than a year for their vaccination, depending on when\nthe dog was acquired into the kennel, the timing of previous vaccination, or with the timing of pregnancy and weaning.\nAdditionally, six adult male dogs are not up to date on their distemper and parvovirus vaccinations:\n- \u201cTinker\u201d #5368 last had the distemper/parvovirus vaccination (\u201c5 way\u201d) on 7/20/23. It was due again on 7/20/24.\n- \u201cWiley\u201d #9139 last had the distemper/parvovirus vaccination (\u201c5 way\u201d) on 7/20/23.

It was due again on 7/20/24.\n- \u201cDallas\u201d #5051 has no recorded history of the distemper/parvovirus vaccinations.\nFailure to follow the PVC for vaccination scheduling leaves the dogs susceptible to diseases, which, if contracted, would\ncause pain, distress, and suffering. Correct by administering all of the vaccines required by the Animal Welfare Act\n(distemper, parvovirus, and rabies) in accordance with a schedule approved by the Attending Veterinarian and vaccine\nmanufacturer recommendations.
