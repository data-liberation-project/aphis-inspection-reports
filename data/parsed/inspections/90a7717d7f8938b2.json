Discussion with the attending veterinarian and veterinary records\nreview indicate that the deer sustained a severe injury to its right hind limb due to being caught in a fence on\n03/05/2014. The attending veterinarian stated he is currently aware of the overgrown hoof however he does not\nrecommend hoof trimming at this time due to the stress of sedating this animal in the high, summer temperatures.\nAccording to records, the deer has not received any pain relieving medications or treatments for its chronic\nlameness condition.\nLameness along with severely, overgrown hooves often indicates pain and discomfort to the animals. Although this\nanimal has been examined by a veterinarian, there is currently no treatment plan in place to address any associated\npain or discomfort resulting from its condition.\nThe licensee must obtain an evaluation of this animal's current condition by a veterinarian which includes an\nappropriate treatment plan for the issue cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided to the\ninspector upon request, as well as a documented plan which addresses hoof care and ensures the relief of any\npain/discomfort. Additionally, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log\nand/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals should be\nincluded along with any follow-up instructions.\nCorrect by 08/03/2016"
