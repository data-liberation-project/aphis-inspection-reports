This section of wall must be addressed to protect water quality and keep the\npool in good repair. There is also evidence of rust coming down the back walls of holding A and C pools where another\nseal and sea lion are housed.\n***The main sea lion stadium pool and back holding pools are still in disrepair throughout the area. The shade structure\nover the public seating area is deteriorating. The staff reports that pieces of the structure fall and, \u201cget wind-blown\u201d into\nthe sea lion and seal main show pool where animals have access during the day. There is still evidence of rust coming\nthrough the wall and running down into the water of the main stadium pool which can impact water quality.\n*** Sections of the wall at the water level in the outdoor holding pool for sea lions adjacent to the stadium pool still has\npaint that is actively chipping. This chipped paint can enter the water an impact the water quality or become an ingestion\nhazard to the seals and sea lions who are placed in this pool.\n*** The stadium stage area which is the haul out space for the seals and sea lions is deteriorating with multiple sections of\nconcrete actively breaking off and peeling when touched by the inspector. When the seals haul out and drag themselves\nover the area, there is a high likelihood that their weight and water is continually deteriorating the concrete. These haul\nout areas must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals.\n*** The ramp that leads into holding pool A for sea lions is also breaking down with the top layer of the ramp missing and\nexposed wood underneath. The continued weight of the sea lion coming in and out of the pool will further degrade the\nramp and it should be addressed to keep the ramp in good repair for the safety of the sea lions.\n*** The haul out space in the port area housing two sea lions is beginning to show wear and some of the plastic coating is\ncoming off the wood platform. These areas should be addressed to keep the haul out space adjacent to the pool in good\nrepair.\n***The back wall along the stage for seal and sea lion stadium is still in disrepair with sections of wood broken and paint\nactively chipping.\n*** The perimeter around the dolphin stadium pool is in the early stages of disrepair with paint flaking off right at the edge\nof the pool. These areas need to be addressed to prevent chipped paint from entering the water and impacting water\nquality or becoming an ingestion hazard to the dolphins.\n*** The cracked and broken concrete all around the perimeter of the far west dolphin pool has not been addressed and is\nstill breaking down. These areas of concrete are breaking off and when touched by the inspector, the powder under\nbroken areas is coming up and loose. This can be a hazard as the concrete powder can be wind blown into the pool\nimpacting water quality for the animals. There was evidence of concrete dust on enrichment devices (basketballs) when\nthrown from the pool by the dolphins.\nFacilities where animals are housed must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury."
