Dirt\nfloor was damp and may be the source of excess humidity. (Outdoor humidity was measured at 73%). Chinchillas\nrequire cool temperatures and low humidity for their health and comfort. High heat/humidity levels may lead to\nheatstroke and/or death. Need to maintain adequate temperature and humidity levels.\nExit briefing conducted with licensee."
