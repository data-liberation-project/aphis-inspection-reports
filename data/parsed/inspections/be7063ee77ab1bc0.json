      "narrative": "These animals are in need of veterinary care:\n**** A six year old male Yorkshire Terrier (chip# 0A10635067) located in the Hog House building had an\naccumulation of yellowish-grey material covering the entire surface of the few teeth that he had left. The shape of\nthe teeth were no longer visible. This heavy coating of yellowish-grey matter was on the cheek teeth on both sides\nof his mouth extending up into the gum line. The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the\ngum tissue and tooth structures, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the\nanimal.\n**** An adult female Maltese (chip# 0A106E155B) located in the Hog House building had a heavy coating of brown\nmaterial on the both sides of the cheek teeth, canine teeth, and incisors extending up into the gum line. The gums\nhave receded up and away from the teeth. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease, can be\npainful, lead to the development of other health problems, and can inhibit the ability of the animal to eat normally.\n**** An adult, red female Pomeranian with no official identification located in the Hog House building had a heavy\ncoating of brownish-grey material on the both sides of the cheek teeth, canine teeth, and incisor teeth extending up\ninto the gum line. The material completely covers the upper cheek teeth. The gums are inflamed and there is a\nwhite colored discharge at the gum line of the canine and cheek teeth. The gums have receded at the incisors and\ncheek teeth as well. The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth\nstructures, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal.\n**These dogs all have symptoms that can be caused by dental problems. Dental disease can be painful and\neventually lead to a decrease in appetite. It can also lead to infection in the mouth as well as potential spread of\ninfection to other organs in the body. The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by a veterinarian to obtain an\naccurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must document the follow up care as directed by\nthe attending veterinarian and ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n**** An adult, female black and white Shih Tzu (chip# 0A106E1B3C) located in the Hog House building had a red,\nblood-like liquid covering the entire sclera/white area of her left eye. This could be caused by infection, allergies,\ninjury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted\nnor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that this was the first time the\neye had been noticed. Eye problems can be painful causing discomfort which affects the health and well- being of\nthe dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 1-19-2015."
