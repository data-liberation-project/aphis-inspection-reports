These carriers were not affixed together or secured to the transport container. The top row of\npet carriers was measured to be approximately 73inches off the floor. Cats kept in stacked carriers at substantial\nheights in an unsecure, unstable manner may potentially result in trauma or physical harm to them if the carriers\nwere to fall or unintentionally be knocked over.\n-There were two goats kept in one transport container (23in. height X 21in. width X 28in. length) for approximately\n10-15 minutes prior to transporting them to a travel trailer. The goats are kept from jumping out of this container\nand are restricted in movement by a chain which is connected from the inside of the container to the goat(cid:25)'s neck\ncollar. Goats kept or handled in such a manner may experience stress or unnecessary discomfort by not having the\nability to turn about freely or make normal postural adjustments.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect for all future inspections.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative.\nInspection conducted at Planet Hollywood Casino, Las Vegas, NV."
