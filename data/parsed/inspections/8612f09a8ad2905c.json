The cause of death was determined to be dehydration. Two other\nanimals in the enclosure found clinically dehydrated were treated and recovered.\nThe three affected animals were confined to an upper level of the enclosure without a functional water source. A\nsubsequent investigation indicated that the animals had closed a cage divider; essentially trapping themselves.\nThey were unable to re-open the divider because of their size/age. Although a water device was installed in the\nupper and lower levels of the enclosure, the water source in the upper level had become disconnected from the\nwater supply.\nPrimary enclosures for non-human primates must be constructed and maintained so that they safely contain the\nanimals and protect them from injury. The ability of these animals to close the cage divider and their inability to\nre-open it contributed to a death and clinical illness in three animals.\nThe facility has taken corrective measures to prevent future compromise of animal safety in these enclosures by\nlatching the enclosure dividers in the open position when applicable.\nCorrect by: All future housing for non-human primates must safely contain the animals and prevent injury."
