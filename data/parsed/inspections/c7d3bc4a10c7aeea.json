      "narrative": "One of the ferrets has a large submandibular swelling. The swelling encompasses the entire width of the neck. The facility\nrepresentative states that they noticed the swelling had started a day ago and they have not yet contacted a veterinarian\nregarding this problem. There is no mention of this ferret in the daily medical logs.\nDuring this visit one of the white racoons appeared lethargic with an overall unthrifty appearance. Although racoons are\nnocturnal animals, this animal did not appear as bright and alert as the other racoons in the enclosure. He also seemed\nto be isolating himself from the other animals which is not normal for racoons. There were no records indicating that he\nhas been seen by a veterinarian or that the facility representative noticed there was a problem.\nAn old red fox previously diagnosed with chronic medical conditions continues to receive no veterinary care for these\nconditions. This animal was examined by a veterinarian on Feb 20, 2021. During that visit the veterinarian tentatively\ndiagnosed prostate cancer and arthritis in the front legs. Instructions to the facility representatives were to \u201cmonitor\nmobility on daily observation report, if improved on Metacam notify veterinarian and may continue to use long term.\nMonitor for trouble urinating and defecating daily.\u201d None of this has been documented in the daily observations. The\ndaily record for this animal states \u201cwill allow him to pass away peacefully when it\u2019s his time\u201d.\nThe bush baby has an area of hair loss on his right side that has exposed reddened skin. The facility representative has\ndocumented this problem along with a decrease in the animal\u2019s energy in the daily medical log and has been applying\nVaseline and coconut oil to the area of hair loss. According to the facilities' former veterinarian, she was never notified\nabout the bush baby having hair loss or acting lethargic.\nThe bobcat named Paulina has areas of hair loss on both sides of her neck about 1 by 2 inches in size. These areas of\nhair loss were also present during the May 17-18, 2021 visit to the property. There is now also a small area of hair loss\nby the ear with exposed reddened skin. The facility representative states that the hair loss is from breeding (she is housed\nwith a male). The daily medical log states that they have been using \u201cwound coat spray\u201d on her skin. There were no\nrecords indicating a veterinarian had been consulted about this animal.\nThe male bobcat named Paul appeared thin and lethargic. He has noticeably lost weight since he was observed on May\n18, 2021. There were no records indicating that he has been seen by a veterinarian or that the facility representative\nnoticed there was a problem.\nFailure to provide adequate medical care can result in health issues that cause ongoing pain and suffering. The facility\nrepresentative must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary approved nutritional and medical care at all times\nas directed by a veterinarian which includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and\ninjuries."
