The licensee has been treating all of the affected dogs with eye\nissues and has gone through the kennel and identified and worked on any dogs with buildup on their teeth. \nThe dogs treated with the eye medicine look much better, and the dogs that had dentals appear to be healthy and\nhealing well. The licensee addressed all concerns in a timely manner and has continued to document and provide\ntreatment.\nInspection and Exit interview conducted with facility representative.",
