If a puppy falls ill, they check more\noften than that. The facility representative stated they do not remember how often they checked this puppy, what it's\nsymptoms were and what was given to this puppy during the transport, but they stated they likely followed the same\nprotocol they always do when a puppy starts to get ill during a transport. Per the facility representative: if a puppy\nbecomes sick or distressed, the drivers should bring the puppy to the front of the van and administer electrolytes and/or\nstress drops per a protocol from a broker's attending veterinarian. Once stabilized, the puppies are given a mousse starter\n(canned food) and monitored more closely. The transporter has no documentation of the medical care provided to the\nanimal and this puppy was not seen by a veterinarian during the transport. The facility representative does not remember\nwhen the puppy passed away, but it passed away while in transit. The inspector asked what happens if a puppy does not\nrespond to supportive care provided by the driver, the facility representative stated they will \u201cforce feed\u201d the animal or\nsometimes have a veterinarian at a pet store examine the puppy if it is ill at a store drop off on the route. No other\nveterinary care is sought out for puppies becoming ill during transport. Failure to obtain veterinary care at the closest\navailable veterinary facility can lead to physical distress and may have led to this puppy\u2019s death.\nThe regulated person must ensure that the operator or person accompanying the operator determines whether any of the\ndogs or cats are in obvious physical distress and obtains any veterinary care needed for the dogs or cats at the closest\navailable veterinary facility.\nTo be corrected: 22-January-2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
