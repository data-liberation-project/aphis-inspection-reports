A second enclosure housing one kitten (orange and white domestic\nshorthair) whose litter box had loose stool present in it coated with cat litter had a handwritten sign on it that stated\nthat the kitten was being treated with Metronidazole and Albon. All kittens appeared alert and active. The facility\nrepresentative stated that the attending veterinarian had been called this weekend and that medication was waiting\nto be picked up at the vet's clinic. Acquisition records stated that the kittens have been at the store for the last 2-4\nweeks. There was no documentation available to show when the vet had been contacted, what the vet's\nrecommendations were or when/with what the kittens had been treated. The attending veterinarian was not able to\nbe reached by phone (on vacation). The inspectors asked to see the medication that was being administered and\nwere shown the following: a large stock bottle of Albon (no directions specific to kitten) and a bottle of aquarium\nmetronidazole tablets that states on the label for use in aquariums only and expired on 5/2014. No bottle of Amoxi\nwas present at the facility. The facility representative stated that they ran out of Clavamox this weekend and had\nthrown out the empty bottle. From the lack of treatment records available for review, lack of labeling of medication\nused with kitten instructions (Metronidazole, Albon), use of exired medication (Metronidazole) and lack of\nmedication (Amoxi/Clavamox) available for use it was impossible to determine if appropriate methods are being\nused to diagnose and treat these kittens. The attending veterinarian must be contacted and involved in the dianosis\nand treatment of all diseases to ensure the health and well-being off the animals. For commonly treated conditions,\ntreatment plans can be approved in advance by the attending veterinarian and individual animal treatments\ndocumented by facility staff. Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat all diseases\nand injuries. Correct by 6/20/14."
