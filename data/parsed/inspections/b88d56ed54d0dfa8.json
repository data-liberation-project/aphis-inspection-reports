It was determined that a climbing structure had been built\nagainst the inside of the fence. The height of the platform was such that a goat could extend its head over the fence\nand possibly escape from the enclosure. There is also a potential for injury from the barb wire. A primary enclosure\nshould be constructed in a manner that prevents escape and injury. Modifications must be made to the fence or\nclimbing structure to prevent an animal from extending its head over the perimeter / primary enclosure fence to\ncontain the animals and prevent injury. Correct by May 31, 2014.\nThis is a focused inspection to evaluate veterinary care.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the owner.\nThis is an electronic copy of the Microsoft Word inspection report dated 29 May 2014."
