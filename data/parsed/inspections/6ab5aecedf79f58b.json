This\nincludes performing treatments without AV approval, failing to follow treatment plans provided by a veterinarian, and\nfailing to communicate changes in patient condition with their AV.\n\u2022Latte, a 5 month old female capybara, presented to the emergency veterinary clinic (EVC) on December 4, 2024, with\nsevere weakness rapid breathing, low body temperature, and low blood sugar. After treatment she was released. Latte\n\u201cwas sent home with husbandry recommendations, including feeding her separately from the three other capybaras she\nshares housing with and keeping her inside during winter nights. The owners brought Latte inside at night for the first\nthree nights out of hospital but then returned her to her outdoor enclosure as the temperature at night had increased.\u201d On\nDecember 10, 2024, Latte was brought back to the EVC lateral and minimally responsive. She was humanely euthanized.\n\u2022Beans, a 4 month old male capybara, was bitten multiple times by a capybara around April 10th. The facility flushed the\nwound and left it to heal without communication with a veterinarian. Beans was taken to the attending veterinarian on April\n19, 2025, with an abscessed bite wound on the right flank. The AV treated the wound and discharged this animal. Beans\nthen presented at the EVC on April 24, 2025 for lethargy, difficulty walking and an open wound on his left side. During his\nexam there was a \u201dLarge open wound on right flank with necrotic margins and steel suture secured into the lateral\nmargins of the wound; additional ~8-10cm superficial laceration along left flank.\u201d The facility did not communicate this\nworsening of his condition to the AV. Following hospitalization, Beans was discharged on April 30, 2025. Beans died at\nthe facility on May 3, 2025.\n\u2022Reese, a 9 month old male capybara, presented to the EVC on May 27, 2025, for lameness in the left front leg. Reese\nwas sent home with pain medication. The facility called the EVC on June 7, 2025, stating that Reese\u2019s condition was\nworse, and the emergency veterinarian altered the treatment plan. During the call the facility was given instructions to\ncontact the EVC or their AV \u201cif Reese\u2019s condition worsened or other concerns arose.\u201d Reese returned to the EVC on July\n2, 2025, \u201ccovered in urine, dehydrated, hypothermic, and cachectic, with marked decrease in body and muscle condition\nsince his last assessment on 5/27/2025; since that time, he had lost 7 kg (20.6% of body weight). Additionally, Reese was\nfound to have numerous wounds throughout his body, including full-thickness puncture wounds (suspected to be due to\nhis history of conspecific bite trauma), superficial abrasion with and without hemorrhagic crusts (scabs; suspected to be\nrelated to this trauma), and ulcers in various pressure points throughout his body.\u201d The facility told the EVC that Reese\nhad been attacked by a capybara resulting in multiple bite wound and they had cleaned with chlorhexidine and applied\ntopical purple wound spray. This was not part of the treatment plan given by the EVC. Between June 7 and July 2, there\nwas no communication with the EVC or AV regarding Reese\u2019s decline. Diagnostics done by the EVC showed chronic\nchanges. Reese was humanely euthanized due to his condition.\nThe AV confirmed that he had no record nor was he informed of Latte or Reese. Additionally, the AV was not informed\nabout the additional wounds and treatment to Beans.\nPerforming treatments without AV approval, failing to follow treatment plans provided by a veterinarian, and failing to\ncommunicate with their AV does not provide appropriate authority and prevents them from ensuring that the animals are\ncared for appropriately. This lack of authority given to the AV can lead to injury, pain, prolonged suffered, and death.\nThe licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate\nveterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.\nCorrect from this date forward, July 21, 2025"
