Ingestion of contaminated feed can cause illness in the animals. Storing\ntoxic substances in food storage areas can cause illness and harm to animals. Supplies of food and bedding must be\nstored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be\nstored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Food requiring\nrefrigeration must be stored accordingly, and all food must be stored a manner that prevents contamination and\ndeterioration of its nutritive value. Substances that are toxic to the nonhuman primates but that are required for normal\nhusbandry practices must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the\nanimal areas."
