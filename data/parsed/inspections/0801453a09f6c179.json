His molars were incased with tarter. His incisors had tartar build up covering\nalmost three quarters of the teeth and his gums were red and swollen. Philippe, a 12-year-old male Toy Poodle, (m/c#\n0A01670943) had excessive tarter on the canines and molars. On the right side the molars were completely encased in\ntarter with what looked like a line of white film buildup along the gumline. The gums were red and swollen. FeFe, a 5-year-\nold Toy Poodle, (m/c# 933000320275138) had excessive tarter mainly on her canines and molars on both sides but was\neven more excessive on her right side. The gum line is starting to recede away from the second tooth behind the canine\ntooth and the rest of the gums are red and swollen. Mary, a 2-year-old Yorkie, (m/c# 7E10243938) had excessive tarter\nmainly on her molars. However, on her left side the tooth behind the canine the gum line is starting to recede and there is\na white cr\u00e8me or film like material building up in between the tooth and the receding gum line. The rest of her gums are\nred and swollen. Teeth and/or gum problems can be painful, can affect the ability to eat, and can result in tooth loss. The\nlicensee must establish an effective program of dental maintenance. The licensee must contact a veterinarian to have\nthese dental problems diagnosed and treated and must maintain medical records for the inspector to review.\nThe same four dogs had excessively matted hair all over their bodies. Maily found on their backs, their hind feet/hocks\nand around their heads. Matted hair can result in skin problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair\u2019s ability to\nprovide protection from the heat or cold. The licensee must remove the matted from these animals and must establish an\neffective program of haircoat maintenance.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 5, 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.\nn"
