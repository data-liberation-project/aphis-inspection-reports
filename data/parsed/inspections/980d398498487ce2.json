      "narrative": "There are two female boxers (#11. #12) approximately 6 months of age that appear to have a skin issue, resulting in\ndry, flaky spots throughout the hair coat, with redness under the chin/neck area and between their toes and on their\nfeet, with dry redness and irritation in both ears. The eyes have a buildup of green/yellow material surrounding both\neyes. Both dogs appear to be underweight, with the ribs and hips being more prominent. While the veterinarian had\nbeen contacted on 12-18-17 and suggested a treatment of shampoo, the treatment was only given twice in 2 days,\ninstead of once per week as the directions advised. The dogs have not improved in their skin condition or much in\ntheir weight, and the veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to the lack of improvement from the first visit\nover 6 weeks ago. There is a Boston male (#10) black/white approximately 8yrs old that has explosive diarrhea and\nhas not responded to the treatment provided 2 weeks ago. The veterinarian has not been contacted for further\nevaluation or treatment for the unresolved issue.\nAll medical issues must be treated and provided with continued care until the issue is resolved, or contact with the\nveterinarian made if the treatment is not working after given, as soon as it is clear the health of the animal is not\nimproving. The lack of followup by the veterinarian, or not following the directions of the treatment prescribed can\ncause further discomfort to the animal, and could cause a treatable condition to be chronic if left too long.\nThe attending veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the Boxers and Boston Terrier.\nThe licensee must provide veterinary care in a timely manner, and continue to communicate with the veterinarian if\nthe medical issues are not resolving with the medications provided. All medications must be administered as\nprescribed according to the attending veterinarians directions.\nThe licensee did contact the veterinarian during the inspection for a consultation.\nTo be corrected by: February 5, 2018\nInspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative."
