The facility stated that the\nonly means of capture for the llama was by darting to sedate the animal involved in the situation. The facility stated\nthat the one adult male llama, and two prairie dogs could not be captured and evaluated in a safe manner.\nA wound on an adult male llama was not discovered in a timely manner. The shearing had not taken place for the\nyear, but was scheduled to be done. The wound of unknown size was located on the sternum and was observed to\nbe draining. During treatments the wound became necrotic. After 17 days of treatment at the onsite treatment\ncenter, the animal was euthanized due to the severity of the wound.\nThere is a prairie dog enclosure that housed two prairie dogs. The enclosure design prevents routine evaluation of\nanimal\u2019s health and well-being. The two prairie dogs retreated into their burrows for the winter without evaluation of\ntheir health status and have not been observed since.\nThe lack of appropriate equipment to handle and control the animals for maintaining their health and perform normal\nhusbandry practices does not allow for proper care of the animals. The facility personnel has started integration of\nnew training, capture, and handling of new animals to the facility. The exhibitor shall establish and maintain\nprograms of veterinary care that include the availability of appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services\nto comply with the provisions of this section.\nCorrect by date: March 25, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
