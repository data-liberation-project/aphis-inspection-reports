The facility must observe all animals daily and then ensure an effective mechanism of direct\nand frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health,\nbehavior, and well-being are conveyed and so that the medical conditions of the animals can be evaluated and\ndocumented by the veterinarian.
