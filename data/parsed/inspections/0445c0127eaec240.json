      "narrative": "This was a focused inspection checking on the condition of the reindeer Clarice (F) that was on the inspection report\nfrom December 18, 2017.\nThe reindeer Clarice, has not significantly changed in body condition since the previous inspection on December 18,\n2017, and she is still suffering from the original issue. The attending veterinarian did not examine Clarice until\nJanuary 31, 2018, even though a correction date of December 29, 2017 had been given in the previous report. It is\nextremely important that correction dates be met for the health, welfare and comfort of the regulated animal. This\nanimal has a significant medical issue that could have been resolved sooner, resulting in less suffering of the animal\ndue to the lack of veterinary input in a timely manner, as was required in the first inspection report.\nDuring this focused inspection, there was another reindeer ' Christmas' (M) that was being housed separately due\nto his severe weight loss. Christmas is very underweight with his hips, spine and ribs protruding through his winter\ncoat. It was also observed that there are 3 other reindeer in the pasture that are at varying degrees of underweight\ncondition. While there, the veterinarian observed a reindeer with a swollen left lower jaw in addition to the low\nweight condition.\nAll medical conditions must be evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent\ncontinued suffering/discomfort of the regulated animals.\nDirect and frequent communication must be held between the licensee and attending veterinarian. Timely\ncommunication is required so that accurate information on health problems is conveyed to the veterinarian, in order\nfor proper treatments to be applied. Veterinary treatment plans must be followed to care for these animals."

      "narrative": "The diet for the reindeer had been changed late fall 2017 without any discussion with the attending veterinarian.The\nattending veterinarian (AV) asked the licensee to show him what type and how much food was being fed to the\nreindeer. When the licensee showed the AV, the AV read the label directions and told the licensee that he had been\n(for months) and still was, severely underfeeding the animals. The labeled directions required that corn and hay be\nfed to the animals in addition to the pelleted feed, but only a very small amount of hay was being given and no corn.\nThe AV told the licensee that he must follow the directions on the feed label (in quantity and type) in order to provide\na wholesome diet with enough nutritive value to sustain the animals. The additional corn and hay rations were not\nbeing provided in the quantities necessary to keep all of the animals in the herd at a healthy weight.\nThere were 5 reindeer of the 8 observed that were underweight with hips, spine and ribs showing through their\nwinter coats.\nThe lack of wholesome food fed at a sufficient quantity and nutritive value to keep the animals in good bodily\ncondition, can result in weight loss and illness due to improper diet. This can cause animals to suffer and possibly\ndie due to malnutrition or other health issues.\nThe licensee must follow the recommendations for proper diet by their attending veterinarian, and read all\nrequirements on the feed they provide to make sure they are feeding a complete diet and ration for the regulated\nanimals they have.\nTo be corrected by: From this day forward\nThe inspection was conducted with the licensee. The exit interview was conducted by phone until the licensee hung\nup in the middle of the exit interview, as he refused to continue with the discussion."
