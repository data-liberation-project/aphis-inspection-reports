A piece of wood has been placed over the section of fence, However, it is not secured to the fence and\ntherefore will not effectively prevent potential injury. Unsecured fencing that curls into an enclosure could cause\ninjury to a hoof or leg of an animal walking the fence line. The curled fencing must be repaired or secured in a\nmanner that will prevent injury to the animals.\n***The portion of fence along the right side of the goat enclosure housing two adult goats, is bowed curling upward,\ninto the enclosure.This has a been a point of escape. The damaged fence may also cause an injury. The curled\nfencing must be repaired or secured in a manner that will prevent injury to the animals and escapes.\n***The bottom fence line along the right side of the enclosure housing 6 six deer, has a gap of about 3 inches as a\nresult of ground erosion. The gap is large enough to allow the entry of unwanted animals or objects. It also could be\na point of escape or cause injury. Enclosures should be constructed in a manner that protects and contains the\nanimals. Modifications along the fence line must be made to eliminate the gap and prevent further ground erosion\nfor the safety of the animals and the public.\n***Goat enclosure: The bottom of one section of fencing near the gate, is bent upward into the enclosure and bowed\noutward. This has created a gap that would allow an animal to enter or exit the enclosure. The owner indicated one\ngoat was seen pushing the section of fence up and going under it to escape from the enclosure. The section of\nfence no longer prevents the escape of animals or the entry of unwanted animals. The fence must be reconstructed\nin a manner that will ensure the fence is structurally sound and made of such material and strength to contain the\ngoats within and to prevent further damage to the fence.\n***Goat enclosure: The gate for the goat enclosure is a wire panel loosely secured with carabiners and a chain. The\npanel gate fence is attached so the pointed edge extends into the enclosure. The goats in the enclosure could be\ninjured by the points along the edge of the gate fencing. The gate must be better secured, such as a hinge or metal\nfence clamps, to ensure the gate is kept closed to prevent escape and the unwanted entry of patrons. Additionally,\nthe gate must be constructed in a manner that will allow the gate to be properly closed and the points eliminated to\nprevent injury to the animals.\n***Highland Cow / Zebu: The gate is not squarely placed. The gate leans forward as there is no latch and just a\nsingle chain attached to the mid- section of the pole. A single chain does not securely fasten a gate to an enclosure\nhousing cattle. Poorly secured gates do not prevent animals from being able to dislodge the gate and escape. The\ngate must be secure in a fashion that would prevent an animal or person from dislodging the gate to ensure the\ncontainment of the animals.\n***Highland cow / Zebu: A set of 4 rungs of board fencing are attached to a wood support post and extends beyond\nthe post but does not extend all the way to the metal support pole that secures the gate. The unattached boards\nleave a gap between the fence and the gate, approximately 2-4 inches wide. The current design does not serve to\nsecure the enclosure and could be easily broken by an animal or human. The fencing must be constructed in a\nmanner that will provide adequate strength to contain domestic cattle.\nNOTE: The black squirrel was securely contained in another enclosure at the time of this inspection. The wild grey\nsquirrel was released."
