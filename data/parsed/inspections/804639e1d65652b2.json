A perimeter fence prevents unwanted animals\nand unauthorized persons from passing through, over, or under it to gain access to animals in enclosures. The\nperimeter fence can also serves as secondary containment should an animal escape from its enclosure. An\nappropriately constructed perimeter fence, at least 8 feet in height must be constructed around the lynx enclosure.\nAdditionally, an appropriately constructed perimeter fence, at least 6 feet in height, must be constructed around the\nAsian clawed otters. The perimeter fences must also extend a sufficient distance from the outside of the primary\nenclosure, at least 3 feet, to restrict direct contact of the public and unwanted animals with the animals within the\nenclosures. Alternatively, an 8 foot fence can be constructed around the property that will encompass the Asian\nclawed otter and lynx enclosures. Correct by March 30, 2018\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the animal keeper and co-owner."
