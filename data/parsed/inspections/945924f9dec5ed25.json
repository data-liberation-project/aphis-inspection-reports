The VMO\nobserved the camel while lying down and asked the animal manager if anything was wrong with it. The animal\nmanager responded \"that is the camel that had the broken back about 7 years ago. She just needs to be put down\".\nThe VMO asked the animal manager why he thought the animal needs to be \"put down\". The animal manager\nresponded \"she is old, she lays down most of the time, has problems getting up and down and she just needs to\ngo\".\nThe VMO asked the animal manager to get the camel up. When attempting to do so, the camel was reluctant to rise\nand on the first attempt, stumbled and fell to the ground from a kneeling position. The animal manager attempted\nagain to get the camel up, and once in a standing position, the camel appeared weak in the hind limbs. She\nappeared to shift her weight to her front limbs and move her hind limbs in a \"tucked\" position beneath her stomach.\nLameness is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes including both infectious\nand non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment can result in\ndelays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.\n***There is 1 female sheep, which had access to the field, that was squinting her right eye. There was no discharge\nfrom the right eye. Squinting can be a sign of eye disease. Depending on the cause, this condition can be both\nprogressive and painful.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 13, 2015 to obtain\naccurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation\nmust be provided to the inspector upon request.
