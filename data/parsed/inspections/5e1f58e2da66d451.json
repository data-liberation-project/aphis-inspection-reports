The majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive\nbuild-up of tartar. There is hair and/or debris and a yellow/tan/milky substance running along the top of all of the\nupper left cheek teeth near the gumline. Some of the cheek teeth on the left side of the mouth are severely loose\nand one tooth fell out when the licensee moved it. The gums are severely red and swollen and in some areas they\nare pulled back from the teeth. Dental conditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health\ncomplications. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the\ndiagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon\nrequest.\nOne adult, white, female Anatolian/Great Pyrenees mix (Microchip # 0A01786177) has excessively long toe-nails on\nall of her toes and excessively long (double) dewclaws. On most of the toes the nails were so long that they were\ncurling out and altering the position of the toes as she was standing/walking. One of the dewclaws on the back right\nfoot was curling back into the pad and the pad was moderately red and swollen. Long nails can be painful for the\nanimal. The licensee must ensure that all toenails are trimmed in order to prevent, control and treat injuries\nassociated with long toenails.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times."
