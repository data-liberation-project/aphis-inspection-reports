This rabbit is located inside cage 26 with 6 other rabbits that did not have water. The facility representative\nput water inside of the enclosure by the request of the inspector. The other 6 rabbits went to the watering receptacle\nto drink and the Rex juvenile white female rabbit sat by herself not attempting to go to the water receptacle. The\nlicensee put a small bowl of water in the enclosure for the juvenile white female rabbit and she drank only a small\nportion before moving to the corner of the enclosure. The female rabbit sat in the corner with her head propped up\nin tense position and stayed in this position for an hour in the corner. The rabbit appeared to be very sluggish and\nunresponsive compared to the other rabbits. The facility representative stated that the rabbit was given to them the\nday prior and were aware that the rabbit did not look right but did not contact the attending veterinarian. The\nlicensee must have this animal seen by a veterinarian for evaluation, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment.
