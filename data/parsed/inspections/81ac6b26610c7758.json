The IACUC identified the following:\n- Ferrets did not receive dexamethasone as described for surgical procedures in the approved protocol.\n- Ferrets were administered ketamine and xylazine for anesthesia instead of sodium pentobarbital.\n- Blood samples were not taken at P30 two hours after test article administration as described in the approved protocol.\n- During terminal procedures, ferrets received isoflurane overdose followed by perfusion. According to the protocol,\npentobarbital should be administered prior to perfusion.\n- Three ferrets assigned to Protocol FE-006 were used under FE-008. The Principal Investigator did not transfer the three\nferrets over to protocol FE-008. The procedures for the three ferrets were conducted on 01/20/23, 01/24/23, and 01/18/23\nunder protocol FE-008.\nProposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be\nsubject to further appropriate review and approval by officials of the research facility.

According to medical records, the female baboon was sedated and reviewed by veterinary staff. A finger\non the right hand was amputated. The baboon was placed on antibiotics and analgesics and monitored until recovery.\nOn July 28, 2022, male baboon presented to the clinical veterinarian with a bleeding finger. It was determined that the\nmale baboon was able to move his cage because it was not secured to the wall per husbandry requirements. The male\nbaboon was able to pull a female baboon\u2019s enclosure towards him and his hand was injured. The male baboon was\nsedated, and the left index finger was amputated.
