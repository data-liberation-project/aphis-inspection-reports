During a keeper talk/demonstration with multiple lions, the animals entered\nthrough a hydraulic door onto an indoor stage. \"Zawadi\"(cid:29) was the last lion to enter the stage, and as he stopped\ninside the door his tail was not fully through when it closed severing the tail approximately 4 inches from the end.\nThis was a guillotine-style door, and the keeper operating the switch was unable to see the bottom of the door as\nher view was blocked by a large wooden table. As soon as the injury was noted, the door was opened, and an\nadditional keeper behind the scenes recalled \"Zawadi\"(cid:29) back to his holding area and contacted the veterinary staff.\nThe animal was examined by a veterinarian within 15 minutes of the incident and treatment was initiated.\nHandling of animals must be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm. At the\ntime of the inspection, the zoo had instituted procedures to minimize the risk of injury in the future as animals enter\nthe indoor stage. The wooden table was removed and additional training on shifting animals has been provided to\nstaff.\nCorrection: Ensure corrective actions instituted by the facility are properly followed.\nAn exit interview was conducted with the facility representative."
