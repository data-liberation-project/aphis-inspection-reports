      "narrative": "One young adult (DOB 18 Jan 2015) female golden retriever (microchip number 900032002163027)is nursing a\nlitter of five puppies that are approximately 4 weeks old. The licensee reports that 11 puppies were born in this litter\nbut the others died shortly after birth. This female dog is very thin. Her ribs are easily palpable with no palpable fat\ncovering them. Her vertebrae, hip bones, and obvious abdominal tuck were visible through her coat and were very\nprominent when palpated. The licensee has not consulted a veterinarian about the body condition or nutritional\nneeds of this dog. While lactation is a known metabolic demand on a female dog, the body condition of this dog is\nexcessively thin. A very thin body condition shows that the nutritional needs of this dog are not being met or that a\npossible medical condition exists. The licensee must have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of\nbusiness on 13 January 2016 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate\ntreatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it\navailable to the inspector upon request."
