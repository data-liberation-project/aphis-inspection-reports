The investigator performed a lensectomy to clearly visualize the back of the eye. However, the IACUC\napproved protocol did not include the surgical procedure of lensectomy, and the investigator did not contact veterinary\nstaff prior to performing the procedure.\n(2) A total of eight NHPs on two separate IACUC approved protocols did not receive the post procedure analgesics as\ndescribed in the protocols. Each of the protocols required that analgesics were to be administered to the NHPs for three\ndays post procedure. Six NHPs on Protocol 24-09 underwent a procedure on 2/22/25 and did not receive their dose of\nanalgesic on post procedure day one. Two NHPs on Protocol #15-03 underwent a procedure on 12/7/24 and did not\nreceive their dose of analgesic on post procedure day three. The research facility determined in each instance that the\nanalgesic was not administered to the NHPs due to technician error.\nPer this Section, with respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications to\nsecure approval, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing\nactivities prior to implementation by the investigator. Principal investigators are to follow the IACUC approved proposals\nand any proposed changes shall be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementation. In (1) above,\nperforming a surgical procedure that is not described in an IACUC approved protocol is a significant change in an ongoing\nactivity that was implemented without prior review and approval by the IACUC. In (2) above, altering the IACUC approved\npost procedure schedule of analgesic administration to the NHPs is a significant change in an ongoing activity that was\nimplemented without prior review and approval of the IACUC.\nThese two incidents were identified by the research facility and corrective measures were implemented prior to this\ninspection, which included IACUC approval of a modification to add lensectomy to Protocol 25-03, implementation of a\ntreatment verification system to ensure all treatments are administered as described in the IACUC approved protocol, and\nrefresher training of staff on following IACUC approved protocols.

Staff lifted the cage door, and the animal was able to free its hand. Staff\nnoted swelling of the animal\u2019s hand and immediately contacted veterinary staff. The animal was assessed and treated by\nveterinary staff. The research facility determined that facility staff had left the cage door latch in the open position that\nallowed the NHP to raise the door enough to create a gap that the animal placed its hand into, and the hand became\ntrapped in the gap when the NHP released the cage door.\n(2) On 10/12/24 two NHPs were not fed their ration of biscuits; they did receive produce on that day. The animals were\nbeing transitioned to a new diet over several days and had fully transitioned to the new diet by 10/6/24. The research\nfacility determined that the room technician had mistakenly thought that veterinary staff would be responsible for feeding\nthe two animals that day.\nPer this Section, the handling of animals by all personnel should be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause physical harm, behavioral stress, or unnecessary discomfort. The NHPs were not handled as carefully as\npossible by facility staff resulting in a hand injury to one NHP and two other NHPs not being fed one day\u2019s ration. These\ntwo incidents were identified by the research facility and corrective measures were implemented prior to this inspection,\nwhich included the retraining of staff on methods for securing the types of NHP caging and retraining on feeding\ninstructions.
