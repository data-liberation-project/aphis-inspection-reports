It further stated that in a previous\n(cid:24)similar model group sizes of 8 were needed to allow for variability in biological response and unanticipated health\nevents(cid:25). No references or statistics were provided as rationale. No rationale was given for the extra 2 animals per\ngroup requested in protocol 2383 that were apparently included in the 8 animals of the (cid:24)similar model group(cid:25). A\nprotocol must include a rationale for the number of animals to be used in order for the IACUC to be able to\nadequately review activities related to the care and use of animals including ensuring limiting the use of animals to\nminimize discomfort, distress and pain and unnecessary duplication.

      "narrative": "The facility reported a suspension of protocol 1626 to USDA Animal Care in November 2015. The IACUC was\nmonitoring this protocol closely due to previous non-compliance events. In early Nov. 2015 OLAC staff noticed that\ntwo hamsters had open surgical incisions and another three were showing signs of pain and distress the day after\nsurgery. In addition some were showing neurological signs and one of them was salivating heavily. Research staff\nrecords noted that the research staff had observed the animals that same morning and considered them (cid:24)bright,\nalert and responsive(cid:25). An IACUC investigation into the incident determined that the research staff were not provided\nproper training for conducting protocol procedures including surgery or for conducting post-surgical animal\nassessments. During the six month suspension, extensive training was provided to all research laboratory\npersonnel via multiple modalities and by multiple people. Procedures have resumed with frequent IACUC member\noversight and no additional problems have been reported. Lack of adequate training of personnel involved in animal\ncare and use can lead to severe consequences including unnecessary pain and distress to the animals. It shall be\nthe responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians and\nother personnel involved in animal care, treatment and use are qualified to perform their duties which shall be\nfulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel. Corrected for protocol 1626 at\nthis time; correct from this day forward for all protocols.\nExit conducted with undersigned Attending Veterinarian and additional facility representatives."
