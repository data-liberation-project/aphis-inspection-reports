The guidance included in the written program of\nveterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods\nto prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written\nPVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended\ntreatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of\nadministration. Regarding frequency of administration, the written PVC says (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) for the majority of the\nspecies. There is no guidance elsewhere clarifying what (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) means. Additional guidance for the use of\nthese drugs must be provided in the written PVC for all species for which these drugs are intended to be used.\nFailure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure welfare of the animals\nmaintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for prevention, control, and\ntreatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that complete guidance\nregarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species that are not\nspecifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. At a minimum\nguidance must include species-specific directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and the\nprevention, control, and treatment of internal and external parasites.

      "narrative": "The program of veterinary (PVC) authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29)\n(without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority of species\nincluding: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai, Fallow Deer,\nEland, and Elk. During this inspection, the Farm Manager again stated that no changes have been made to the\nwritten guidance in regards to the use of this drug.\nSuccinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this\ndrug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered\ndistressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug\ncan also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated\nthey can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,\nor training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis\nof respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available\nwhich are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.\nBecause of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or\nneuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of\ngeneral anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.\nThe licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care\nas required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and\nis likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your\nattending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides\nadequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of\nadministration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all\nchanges or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must\nmaintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request."

This includes camel, sheep, kangaroo, muntjac deer, goats, porcupines, cows, and mini-zebu cattle.\nThese animals are housed in multiple areas including the walk through area of the zoo, the production barn, the\ndairy barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to the public. There are no barriers or signs present to\ndiscourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate. There are no\nattendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals.\nPrimary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch\nthe animals. Unattended public contact continues to be a problem at this facility and has been documented on many\nprevious inspections. Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these\nanimals.
