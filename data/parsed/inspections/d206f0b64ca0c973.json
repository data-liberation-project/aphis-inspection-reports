The neglected care by one research staff employee included: a hot pack wasn't provided for a lame pig, an\nincision was cleaned with water rather than betadine, and a weight was not taken as directed to determine the\nproper pain medication dose for a pig. Another research employee disregarded the Attending Veterinarian's\nmedical directive to examine a lame pig while under anesthesia. Medical orders should be followed as directed in\norder to ensure the animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times. The registrant must ensure that the\nAttending Veterinarian has the appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care.
