      "narrative": "This was a focused inspection regarding the status of a lion cub named \"Lucie\".\nA female lion cub named \"Lucie\", approximately 8 1/2 months old, was previously found to be severely lame,\nuncomfortable, and unwilling to stand at the time of the previous inspection on 6/7/17.\nAt the time of the inspection prior to that, on 4/27/17, the cub was exhibiting some lameness in its hindquarters, and\nhad a history of intermittent lameness in the front as well. The exhibitor was asked to have a diagnostic work up\ncompleted by a veterinarian who is experienced with this species, by 5/1/17. Radiographs and blood work were\ncompleted by that date, but the results were inconclusive. Subsequently two radiologists who specialize in zoo\nanimals reviewed the radiographs at the request of the USDA / APHIS / Big Cat Specialist. Both radiologists stated\nthat the radiographs showed thinned bone cortices, which is typically seen in metabolic bone disease, which can be\ncaused by a dietary deficiency. Currently the animal is able to stand only momentarily, with great reluctance, and\nshe is not able to walk, but does crawl. Although the lion cub seems more comfortable than she did at the time of\nthe 6/7/17 inspection, her condition has not significantly improved. Additionally the lion cub has a history of difficulty\nswallowing. Although the lion cub's body condition appears healthy, the licensee states that all the lion's meals are\nbeing fed to her by hand out of necessity. The last time the attending veterinarian observed the animal, according to\nrecords on hand, was 6/12/17, which was two weeks ago.\nAt the time of the last inspection on 6/7/17, the exhibitor was asked to have a consultant veterinarian with a higher\nlevel of expertise with big cat nutrition and medicine review every aspect of this case and to determine an\nappropriate treatment plan including specific guidance about medical care, treatment, diagnostics, diet and\nnutritional supplements for this animal. The licensee has not complied with this request, as of the time of the 6/26/17\ninspection.\nFailure to provide appropriate diagnostics and treatment can result in a poor outcome for animals. The exhibitor\nmust ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care, to include the use of appropriate methods to\ndiagnose and treat diseases. Veterinarians should have sufficient experience with the species on hand, so as to\nensure appropriate care.\nThe licensee must have a consultant veterinarian with a higher level of expertise with big cat nutrition and medicine\nreview every aspect of this case and to determine an appropriate treatment plan including specific guidance about\nmedical care, treatment, diagnostics, diet and nutritional supplements for this animal. The licensee must\nimmediately follow the exact recommendations of this expert veterinarian. The outcome of this consultation must be\nprovided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, any\ndiagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed, any medications or supplements prescribed\nalong with the dosing instructions, the treatment plan, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health\nrecord that list when the medication or supplement is administered to the animal, showing the amounts, and who\nadministered it.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by\nthe attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care\nshall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nThis inspection was conducted on 6/26/17 with the licensee, and the inspector was accompanied by Dr. Gage\nduring the inspection.\nThe exit interview was conducted on 6/27/17 with the licensee, and the inspector was accompanied by the\nSupervisory Animal Care Specialist, Dr. Kathleen Garland.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGage Laurie, Big Cat Specialist"
