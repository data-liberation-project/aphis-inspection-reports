      "narrative": "On Sunday March 19th, 2017, a small child (aged 3-4 years old) entered a portion of the outdoor giraffe exhibit\nthrough a gap in the enclosure fence.\nThe gap was located at one end of the enclosure fence near a keeper gate. The keeper gate was locked, but there\nwas an approximately eight inch space between the fence post and another fence (giraffe crossing fence). Beyond\nthe fence is a plateau area roughly 20 x 20 feet that is approximately 10 feet above the giraffe\u2019s exhibit. The child\nwalked out on to this plateau and another zoo patron climbed over the barrier fence to retrieve the child. The\ngiraffes were on exhibit at the time of the incident, however, no injuries to the child or the animals were reported. No\nparties involved notified the zoo staff at the time of the incident.\nWhen the inspector arrived on Wednesday March 22nd for this focused inspection, that gap had been corrected, but\nan even larger space was identified in the same area between the keeper gate door and the giraffe crossing fence.\nWhen the giraffe crossing gate is closed to allow the giraffes to move from the indoor enclosure to the outdoor\nexhibit, a larger gap is created between the crossing gate and the keeper gate. That gap (approximately 15 inches)\nis large enough for an adult to squeeze between the gate post and the crossing gate. The giraffes were not on\nexhibit at the time of inspection, but there are 9 giraffes that typically have access to this exhibit.\nThis area where the gap is located is adjacent to a public walkway which allows the direct entry of unwanted\npersons into the exhibit. This could lead to animal or human injury.\nThe enclosure and/or any fences must be constructed in a manner to ensure the public does not gain access to an\narea that will allow direct contact with the animals. During public exhibition, any animal must be kept with sufficient\ndistance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals\nand the public. The barrier fence shall be maintained to prevent public contact with the animals to assure the safety\nof both the animals and the public.\nThis item was corrected on the day of the inspection.\nThis is a focused inspection to address the incident with the giraffe enclosure.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the General Curator."
