Surfaces in cat enclosures should be constructed and maintained so that they can be readily\ncleaned and sanitized. A peeling floor surface could allow animal and food waste to accumulate, and does not allow\nproper cleaning and sanitation, and this puts the health of the animals at risk.\nAll den boxes, and all surfaces in the animal enclosures, should be maintained and or replaced when worn, so that\nproper cleaning and sanitation can occur.\nTo be corrected by November 9, 2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
