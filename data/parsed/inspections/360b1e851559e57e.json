      "narrative": "On Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at approximately 11:30am a keeper entered the Bearline service hallway and saw\none of the two polar bears present in the keeper area. She was about midway down the hallway when she saw the\nfemale bear, about 30 feet away. It is unknown where the male bear was at this time. She then quietly backed\naway\nand retreated up the hallway. She exited out of the hallway to the outside through one secondary\ncontainment/access door. Once outside, the keeper initiated the facility emergency response plan by calling\n\"Code Houdini-Polar bear\"(cid:29) to security. The shooting team and veterinary staff were notified by security. Guests\nwere\nushered indoors without incident.\nIn the Bearline service hallway where the polar bears were discovered, are stored many items related to the care of\nthe bears and maintenance of the exhibit including, but not limited to: Feed, bedding, enrichment items, cleaners,\ntrash, hoses, fans, electrical switches & wires, fire extinguisher, etc. Once the dangerous animal response team\nwas\nassembled, the bears were darted while they were in the Bearline service hallway by the veterinary staff. Upon\nbeing\ndarted, the bears exited back out of the hallway into the exhibit. The female bear required a second dart, as the first\none did not fully discharge and detached. Once safely anesthetized, the bears were denned and examined. No\nabnormalities with the bears were noted on examination. They recovered uneventfully.\nIt was determined that two doors were left open by keeper error which allowed the bears to have access to the\nhallway. The first is a door between the outdoor exhibit and one of the dens. This door is opened and\nclosed with a weighted manual guillotine system. Once closed, an orange metal slide is placed then padlocked.\nThen a switch in the hallway is flipped which also prevents this door from being raised. The second door is between\nthe den and the hallway. To close and lock this door, it is pulled closed and two padlocks are applied and latched.\nThough keepers are not allowed to work alone in the Bearline, they are not always within visual contact. One may\nbe\nworking in the black bear or spectacled bear area and one may be working in the polar bear area. The length of the\nhallway is estimated to be 50 yards long or more, so some distance may separate the keepers as they work. The\nstandard operating procedures for the Bearline states that all locks and doors are to be double checked before any\nbear is let out, which did not occur on the day of the incident. There does not appear to be a routine or formalized\nmethod for keepers to double check locks and doors.\nAnimals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Surprising\nthe bears in the keeper area could have resulted in human injury or death. Though the bears remained within\nsecondary containment, had the bears gained outside access, the public would have been at great risk for injury,\nharm or death. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound, and maintained to protect and contain the animals.\nCorrect by: Immediate\nThis was a focused inspection to investigate events related to polar bear containment only\nAn exit interview was conducted with the Director of Animal Collections and other facility personnel."
