      "narrative": "A male red poodle DOB 10-4-2009 (MC# 047363069) was observed to have a mild yellow to clear discharge in the\nleft eye. There was no swelling or redness associated with this discharge. This dog had a thin body condition with\na visible spine and hips and palpable ribs. The left upper incisor was fractured leaving only \u00be of tooth remaining in\nthe mouth. The gum line was pushed up away from the tooth exposing the root. The space between the fractured\ntooth and upper canine tooth had a thickened red distended mass of gum tissue. The gum tissue in the entire mouth\nwas reddened and appeared swollen. A thick deposit of brown to grey tartar covered the top half of the left upper\ncanine tooth.\nA female apricot poodle DOB 1-8-2010 (MC# 051836816) has a small round, pink mass between the toes of the\nright front foot. The center of this mass is dark red in color. The animal also has two small round, pink masses\nbetween the toes of her front left foot. One of the masses on the left foot has a dark red appearance in the center\nand appears to have ruptured and small amount of discharge was observed on the hair surrounding this area. The\nother mass on the left front foot appears as a dark color with darkest area located at the center of the mass.\nA female white/yellow Chihuahua DOB 05-22-2010 (MC #042876886) has extremely long, overgrown toenails that\nare starting to curve under with sharp points on all four feet. The left front foot had a small firm round pink mass in\nthe space between the toes.\nA female poodle DOB 4-12-2009 (MC# 031115010) was observed to be lame non weight bearing on the left rear\nleg. There is a round, red, wet draining ruptured mass approximately 0.5cm in diameter located in the space\nbetween the toes of the left rear foot. The left front foot also has a round, pale pink firm mass of similar size in the\nspace between the toes. A third mass was identified in the right front foot that appeared smaller, darker, firmer and\nnot irritated. A small round wet draining pink mass was noted in the space between the toes of the left rear foot.\nTwo of the cheek teeth on the lower right jaw were loose when the inspector touched them. As well there are two\nareas of bleeding of the gum line where the licensee had recently removed the teeth while performing dental care\nwithin the last 4 days. There are some small areas of tartar on both the left and right cheek teeth remaining after\nrecent dental care had been performed.\nA female cream colored poodle DOB 4-13-15 (MC# 0A02276512) has a laceration on the right side of the neck.\nThe laceration was 1.5 inches in length exposing the tissue under the surface of the skin. There is a mild amount of\ngreen, wet discharge along the left edge of the wound. The entire surface of the wound is coated with a creamy\nwhite to tan discharge. The edges of the wound are also mildly reddened. The wound had been identified and\ntreated by the licensee with a topical dermal product however had not yet consulted with the veterinarian.\nPoor dental health, lacerations, and foot masses could cause pain and discomfort to the dogs as well as lead to\nfurther health complications. Poor body condition could be an indication of underlying health issues.\nThe above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and to develop an\neffective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the\ninspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nA female Chihuahua DOB 1-23-15 (MC# 020629075) has extremely long, overgrown toenails. The toenails have\nbecome so long that they have begun to curl under.\nA female chocolate/tan Chihuahua DOB 12-12-14 (0A02552969) has extremely long, overgrown toenails. The\ntoenails have become so long that they have begun to curl under.\nOvergrown toenails can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as affect the dog's natural gait.\nThe licensee must develop an effective plan for toenail maintenance. The licensee must have the toenails of the\nabove listed Chihuahuas trimmed to an acceptable length and ensure that all of the dogs receive adequate toenail\nmaintenance at all times.\nFemale Chihuahua DOB 05-22-2010 (MC #042876886) must also receive toenail maintenance."
