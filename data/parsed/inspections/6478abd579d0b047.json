The procedure involved placing study devices inside the\nchamber. The placement of the sterile field for instruments and supplies was in a location where it could be easily\ncontaminated, unobserved by the person doing the procedure. During the observation, the sterile field was on an\ninstrument table in a corner of the very small room outfitted as an acoustic chamber. As the person manipulated the\nelectrode and fiber optic cables, the sterile field was at times behind him, allowing his lab coat to breach sterility of\nthe field.\nAseptic technique requires that sterile fields be maintained the entire time a body cavity is open. Failure to do so\nmay result in infection, harming the animal and interfering with the research.\nFrom this point forward, ensure that all sterile fields remain sterile for the duration of any procedure involving an\nopen body cavity."
