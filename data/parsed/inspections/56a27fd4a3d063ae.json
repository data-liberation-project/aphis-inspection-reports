Multiple members of the medical staff, director, and care techs all stated that \u201cJB\u201d is known to be an overly\naggressive, unfit alpha male. During this 9-month period, \u201cRebel\u201d sustained injuries to his hands, feet, anus, torso, and\nface. Behavioral logs also noted \u201cRebel\u201d eating less and spending an increased amount of time outside on the island.\n\"Nigida\u201d sustained multiple injuries to his testicles, anus, and face. Behavioral logs indicated \u201cNigida\u201d frequently sat alone\nunder an indoor enclosure bench. Despite the facility\u2019s efforts to stabilize the group, \u201cRebel\u201d and \u201cNigida\u201d continued to\nsustain injuries by \u201cJB\u201d. Social incompatibility may lead to distress, anxiety, injuries and possibly death.\nNonhuman primates may not be housed with animals unless they are compatible, do not prevent access to food, water, or\nshelter by individual animals, and are not known to be hazardous to the health and wellbeing of each other.\nCorrected prior to the time of inspection."
