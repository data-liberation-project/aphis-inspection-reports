      "narrative": "Whereas the perimeter fence is in the process of improvement, and new fencing has been, or is in the process of\nbeing installed, in several places inspected the perimeter fence still does not meet the requirements specified in\n3.127 (d). The fence should be at least eight feet in height, due to the presence of animals defined as dangerous\nanimals, and it should prevent animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing secondary\ncontainment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The following shortfalls were noted:\n1.) There are portions of the fence that fall short of the eight feet minimum height requirement. For example near\nthe camels, where the original fencing comprises part of the perimeter fence, sections measured were 71\"(cid:29), 74\"(cid:29),\n80\"(cid:29), and 90\"(cid:29) in height in January, 2016, and no changes have been made in this area as of yet.\n2.) Near the camels there are some gaps under existing gates that could allow animals to pass under the gates.\nThe gate referred to as the (cid:28)\"Bison Gate\"(cid:29) still has a six plus inch gap underneath, and the gates around the camels\nstill have six and seven inch gaps.\nThere are still contractors present working on the new fence, and it was not inspected in its entirety at the time of\ninspection.\nThese observations are examples of where the perimeter fence does not meet the standards specified. The fence\nshould consistently meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. This facility should have a\nperimeter fence which adequately prevents people and animals from passing through or under the fence, and which\ncan also act as a secondary containment system for the animals on exhibit. This facility houses animals such as big\ncats, bears, hyenas, and elephants, and therefore the perimeter fence should be at least eight feet in height, and it\nshould either fully enclose the whole premises, or the areas where these animals are housed, with a perimeter\nfence measuring at least six feet in height for the other animals. There should be a separation of at least three feet\nbetween the animals on exhibit and the perimeter fence, and it should preclude contact with people or animals. The\nfence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here. Failure to\nmeet these standards could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.\nThis is a repeat citation; it was previously cited in 2013, 2015, and January 2016.\nThis was a focused inspection on issues cited on the last inspection, and now past their correction dates.\nAn exit interview was conducted by phone with the Curator on 4/7/16."
