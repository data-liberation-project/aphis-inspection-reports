According to\nthe licensee, the cougar was found inside the den with bite marks on the neck along with wood splinters around the\nmouth. Although the licensee stated he did not see the fight / death occur, he believes that during the night a mouse\nor chipmunk was inside a wall of the den box and one cougar was trying to get the small animal out of the wall when\na fight between the two cougars occurred. The licensee found a hole and parts of the wood paneling inside of the\nden along with the dead cougar the following morning. The licensee stated that the AV had seen the body of the\ndead cougar and determined it was due to the other cougar. The AV later informed inspectors that the he had not\nseen the cougar(cid:25)s body and only heard about the incident the day of inspection (29 January). According to the\nlicensee the body of this cougar was buried on the premises. Additionally, the licensee stated he was already\nseparating the two cougars during feeding times due to food aggression; however, the only way to separate these\nanimals was to lock one in the unlighted den box area while the other remained in the rest of the primary enclosure.\nThe licensee failed to properly recognize that this aggression maybe expressed during other times particularly since\nboth animals were found to be significantly underweight at the time of the previous inspection. When food\nresources are scare, aggression resulting from competition for food is significantly increased.
