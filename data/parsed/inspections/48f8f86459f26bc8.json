Calls were\nmade at 3:51 pm to the cell phone and a message was left, and at 3:53 pm to the house phone that had no answer.\nAPHIS inspector then waited until 4:20 pm when the house phone was called again, without an answer. The cell\nphone on file was called again at 4:21 pm and a second message left. The inspector then waited until 4:30 pm\nbefore leaving the facility. This facility has a gate across the driveway entrance that does not allow access to the\nhouse.\nFailure to allow APHIS officials to complete an unannounced inspection does not satisfy the requirements of the\nAnimal Welfare Act and makes it impossible to determine if the facility is in compliance with the Act and its\nregulations.\nCorrect this by ensuring adequate availability is provided to allow for unannounced inspections in the future.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED"
