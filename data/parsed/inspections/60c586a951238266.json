Four\nanimals were affected. In order to prevent further escapes and mis-pairing of animals, the research facility must\nensure that personnel always handle animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible.\nNote: The facility previously identified these incidents and has implemented corrective actions to prevent and\nminimize further incidents.\nCorrection: Ensure corrective actions are properly followed.\nThis was a routine inspection of CALS and the Veterinary School and a focused inspection at the Primate Center\nconducted on 1/21/2015 through 1/23/2015.\nExit interview conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBarksdale Dawn, Veterinary Medical Officer"
