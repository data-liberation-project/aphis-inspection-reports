      "narrative": "The one rabbit remaining on protocol 1506 amendment 2 was observed to be wearing an e collar. There were pasty\nfeces noted on the cage floor. Facility employees stated that the e collar may result in the rabbit not eating its full\namount of the regular diet and was being supplemented with vegetables resulting in the abnormal fecal pellets. The\nprotocol states that the animal will wear an e collar for 7 days post op. This rabbit has worn an e collar for greater\nthan 7 days. There is concern that the e collar is restricting access to a full amount of the normal diet and also\nrestricts the rabbits ability to consume night feces which is a necessary part of the digestive process for rabbits. The\nextended use of the e collar - longer than stated in the protocol is a significant change in the care and use of\nanimals and requires IACUC review and approval prior to the change. The IACUC must review and approve ,require\nmodifications to or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in\nongoing activities.\nCORRECT BY : 11-23-15\nThe inspection was conducted with facility employees and company VP.\nThe exit briefing was conducted with the company president."
