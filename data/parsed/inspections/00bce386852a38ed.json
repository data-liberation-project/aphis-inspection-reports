The facility questioned the investigator, who then reported that one of the rabbits had\njumped out of it's 2nd level enclosure two days prior. The rabbit looked fine to him so he did not report the event to\nthe animal care staff at the facility. The rabbit could have become injured, therefore the animal care staff must be\nnotified of the incident so they can make the determination of the health of the animal, as well as, to allow the facility\nto determine how to prevent a recurrence of the incident. Animals must be handled carefully and in a manner that\ndoes not cause trauma and in response to this incident, the facility has implemented several measures to prevent\nrecurrence.\nThis item has been addressed by the facility.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
