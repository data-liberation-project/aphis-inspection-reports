Hair loss with reddened skin scabbing over could indicate the dog either injured\nitself or may have a skin condition that may be contagious to other dogs or even people. Not observing these conditions in\na timely manner and reporting them to the Attending Veterinarian doesn't allow for the Attending Veterinarian to be able to\nproperly diagnose and treat the dog accordingly.
