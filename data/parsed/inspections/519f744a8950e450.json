Portions of the barbed\nwire fencing were loose, creating gaps in the fencing. There were sharp points on several of the metal wires holding\nthe fencing to the posts, which pointed into the enclosure.\nThere was a large gap between the metal gate and the fence post. An additional gate had been placed into this\ngap, however the gate was not tethered to anything and was unstable.\nA portion of the metal fencing had old farming equipment, including metal feeders and gates, pushed up against it.\nThis equipment had created gaps and sharp points in the wire fencing. The animals within the enclosure were able\nto make contact with this equipment due to the holes in the fence.\n***A portion of the wire fencing surrounding the primary enclosure of three horses and eight cows was in disrepair.\nThe fencing was leaning in an outward direction from the enclosure. There were several sharp points created by the\nwiring that attached the fencing to the metal posts.\nAll enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to\nprotect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.\nTo be corrected by: October 22, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Animal Resource Manager."
