During the transport one of the non-human primates, a female capuchin, had died. According to\nthe licensee, the animal was found dead in its enclosure after arrival at the final destination. A necropsy report,\nsigned by a veterinarian, for the deceased monkey stated that (cid:28)\"Necropsy diagnosis or gross findings was possible\nover heating and stress or possible injury\".(cid:29) When the licensee was questioned about the means of transport, he\nstated that he had transported all of the animals in a livestock trailer (which measured approximately 15 feet in\nlength). He had sealed up the openings of the trailer to protect the animals from the wind and also to contain them\nif there was an escape from their(cid:25) primary transport enclosures. He said that he used \u00bc inch plastic boards to cover\nthe openings. When the licensee was questioned about any openings for ventilation he said that there were a few\ncracks in the floor and also a few cracks around where he had sealed the openings with the plastic boards. When\nthe licensee was questioned as to how the primates were contained inside of the trailer he said that each one had\ntheir own crate and they were placed in a single level. The primary cargo space for the deceased primate was not\ndesigned and constructed to protect the health, and ensure the safety and comfort of the primate. The licensee\nmust ensure that all animal cargo space of primary conveyances used in transporting live animals shall be designed\nand constructed to protect the health, and ensure the safety and comfort of the live animals contained therein at all\ntimes.\nTo be corrected from this day forward"
