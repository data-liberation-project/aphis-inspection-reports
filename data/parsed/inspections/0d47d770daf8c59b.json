The eye is protruding and extremely swollen, approximately the size of a golf ball. It\nis an extremely reddened mass of tissue and has a dark crusty scab on approximately one third of the surface area.\nFluid appeared to be leaking out of the eye onto her face. There were flies observed in the open wound around and\non the eye. APHIS staff observed the animal clacking its teeth loudly and pacing up in the top corner of the\nenclosure. The overall condition of the animal has changed since the last inspection. The animal now has a dull\nhair coat and appears to have lost weight. The animal was shaking her head and pawing at the injured eye\nfrequently during the inspection. She appeared to be suffering, as she exhibited signs of extreme stress and\ndiscomfort for the species.\nThe last time the attending veterinarian examined the animal was on November 18, 2016. On January 27, 2017 the\nlicensee noted in her log that she spoke to the attending veterinarian and discussed the eye problem, but that the\nAV was out of town and would come by to see the animal when she gets back. There was no notation of any\nattempt to contact an emergency or alternate veterinarian at any time during the months of November through\nMarch the animal\u2019s deteriorating condition.\nAs of today, March 7, 2017 the coati has still not been seen by any veterinarian despite the condition of the eye\ncontinuing to worsen as noted and observed by the facility staff. They have also completely stopped providing any\ntreatment and have discontinued recommended treatment by the AV. Failure to properly communicate animal\nhealth issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the\nanimal and potentially worsen a current medical condition.\n***An intact adult male tricolor goat was non-weight bearing on his right front limb. The goat was lame at the walk.\nThe animal manager had not noticed that the goat was lame until the time of the USDA inspection. Lameness and\nnon-weight bearing is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes including both\ninfectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment\ncan result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.\n***A juvenile female goat had abnormal skin covering the tips of her ears. The skin was crusty and dry, with large\nareas of hair loss. Her overall hair coat appeared dull and she was seen to be scratching her shoulder along the\nchain link fencing. The animal manager stated that he had not noticed this skin condition prior to the USDA\ninspection. Skin disease can be caused by a variety of problems, including infection, allergies, injuries, irritation, or\nother medical conditions and can be painful and distressing to the animal.\n***In an enclosure containing three fallow deer and a camel, a female fallow deer had a fresh wound over the left\npoint of the shoulder. The wound was approximately two inches in diameter. There was complete hair loss at the\nsite of the wound, with reddened tissue exposed. A clump of white hair was seen beside a metal feeder. The animal\nmanager stated that he had introduced the deer and the camel into the same enclosure two days ago.\nInjuries, diseases, and medical conditions that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be\npainful and can lead to prolonged suffering.\n***A young gray and white female goat, which was being housed alone in the barn, was unable to straighten her\nfront legs at the knees. This inability to straighten her front legs caused her to place all of her weight on her toes.\nShe was unable to stand or walk normally. The animal manager mentioned that he noticed the condition two weeks\nago but the condition has worsened since then. The animal manager stated that he thought the licensee had\ncontacted the veterinarian regarding this animal, however they \u201chave trouble getting the vet out here.\u201d The goat has\nnot been seen by a veterinarian nor received any medical treatment.

Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems, in a timely manner, can result in prolonged\npain and suffering and the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions.
