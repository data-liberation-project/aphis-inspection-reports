Two approximately one inch long reddened\nscratches were observed near the base of the tail, one on each side of the tail. The third lesion, located on the left\nhock, was approximately 1.5 inches long and one inch wide. The hair was missing over all three lesions and the\nskin was abraded and open over the tail and hock lesions on the left side of the body. Flies were seen settling on\nthe left tail lesion.\nDaily observation of all animals to assess their well-being as well as direct and frequent communication with the\nattending veterinarian regarding health issues are necessary to ensure that the animals at the facility receive timely\nand adequate veterinary care. Documentation of health problems, communications with the attending veterinarian,\nand treatment of those problems are necessary to ensure that the facility is providing appropriate monitoring and\ntreatment of sick and injured animals. A system should be in place to ensure that the facility keeps appropriate daily\nobservations of animal health problems and treatments.\nCorrect from this time forward."
