The owner stated he had just arrived home and did not have enough\ntime to provide adequate shade to the animals. The inspector noted that all the rest of the animals had proper\nprotection from the hot sun. Animals that are unable to find sufficient shade from the sun could overheat. Animals\nshall be provided sufficient shade by natural or artificial means to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect\nthemselves from direct sunlight.
