Review of their records shows that they are not currently on any medication or\ntreatment plan.\n*Several goats were noted favoring one leg/foot by holding the foot up while standing and attempting to put less weight on\nit when walking. Two goats in the upper barn front enclosure (341 and 447) each did not want to put weight on more than\none foot. Goat 341 (dark brown) was seen resting on and trying to walk on the front leg carpal joints and has a wet soiled\nhaircoat on its hind quarters. Two goats (538 and B100) were reluctant to get up and follow the other goats out into the\nouter portion of the upper barn back enclosure when we entered the enclosure. They both exhibited difficulty rising and\nwere very lame when first rising on all four feet. One tried to walk on just its two front limbs. The medical records for these\ngoats show that they have all had hoof trims done earlier in May 2023 but no other treatment was administered. The\nrecords show that this same issue occurred with the goats in May 2022 and they were seen by the vet and treated with\nDraxxin at that time. The written program of veterinary care does not contain veterinary instructions for lameness/foot\nissues.\n* Goat 455 (white and brown face, white with tan body) was noted to be thin with spine and hip bones very prominent and\nwas reluctant to put weight on its left rear leg (upper barn front enclosure).\n*One brown with white goat (381) in the upper barn back enclosure has a swelling about 2 inches rounded on the left side\nof its face at the back of the jaw area. The facility representative stated that this swelling wasn\u2019t present yesterday.\nThe facility has observed the foot issues and completed foot trimming but has not followed up with the veterinarian for\nevaluation, diagnosis and treatment recommendations when the goats continued to show foot issues. Chronic or recurrent\nfoot issues can be painful for the animals. A call with the veterinarian was held and he was aware of the trimming having\nbeen done but had not been consulted further this year.\nThe facility shall have the veterinarian evaluate the goats listed to ensure appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose and treat the goats\u2019 issues."
