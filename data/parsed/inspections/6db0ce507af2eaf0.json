      "narrative": "At the time of inspection, two California sea lions and one South American sea lion were left unattended in their travel\ntrailer for a period no less than 4.5 hours without a proper public barrier in place and without a single identifiable\nemployee.\nThe inspector arrived at the licensee\u2019s TRA site at approximately 4:20pm EST and identified a marine mammal exhibit set\nup complete with two pools, a stage, a travel trailer containing the sea lions, a residential trailer and a small fence\nbordering the exhibition area. The fence noticeably stopped at the edges of the travel trailer and did not form a barrier\nbarring entrance into the trailer containing the sea lions. The inspector observed a drink concessions trailer being dropped\noff adjacent to sea lion exhibit. Three individuals working on this task identified themselves as employees of the\nconcession stand and mentioned that they had nothing to do with the licensee\u2019s business. They were seen walking\nunsupervised around the TRA site in order to maneuver their trailer. After calling the licensee and leaving a voicemail\nrequesting to conduct an inspection, the inspector knocked on the licensee\u2019s residential trailer and loudly identified herself\nas an USDA inspector. There was no response from either the residential trailer or the travel trailer holding the sea lions.\nA quick inspection around the outside of the trailer and surrounding areas confirmed that none of the Sea Lion Splash\nLLC employees or the licensee were on site. The licensee was called again at approximately 5:47pm EST and a\nvoicemail was left requesting a return phone call.\nWhile waiting for an employee to return to the site, the inspector observed that the back of the trailer containing the sea\nlions, their food and necessary water quality chemicals had no public barrier and was left completely open so that the\npublic could easily walk approach the trailer containing the 3 sea lions. The trailer door to the freezer storing fish was left\nopen, and the freezer door was not seen to have a locking mechanism. Furthermore, the trailer door to the transport\nenclosure housing the three sea lions had been left completely open and any person could easily step into the trailer and\ninteract with the animals. The sea lions could be heard vocalizing/splashing around and observed from outside the trailer.\nThe door to their enclosure consisted of thin metal bars that could allow the smaller two sea lions to poke their heads\nthrough. The width of spaces between the metal bars could allow any member of the public to touch and/or pass food\nthrough to the animals. Furthermore, under the steps leading up to the sea lion enclosure, a large collection of cleaning\nand water quality chemicals were being stored. These were within easy access to any passing individual.\nUntil the licensee\u2019s employee finally arrived, the inspector observed various individuals entering the county fair property\nthrough an unguarded gate directly across from the TRA set up. There was not a security guard posted at the gate\nentrance, and the inspector did not observe any readily identifiable security officials patrolling throughout the county fair\nproperty. Additionally, various employees from different exhibitors/concession stands/fair rides were seen driving golf\ncarts or walking around the TRA set up.\nThe complete lack of employee supervision over the animals and the lack of a physical barrier barring entrance to the\nanimals for a period of almost 4.5 hours severely compromised the safety of the animals. Any member of the public could\nhave entered the trailer and harmed the animals or have been harmed by the sea lions. Additionally, the chemicals were\nopenly available to be tampered with or used to harm the animals. The current public barrier does nothing to impede\naccess to the sea lions or their food whenever the employees are not directly supervising the animals. Additionally, the\nlicensee\u2019s reliance on the fair ground\u2019s security to supervise the animals is inadequate to provide protection to the animals\nfrom abuse and harassment by the viewing public.\nAll marine mammals must be provided with protection from abuse and harassment by the viewing public by the use of a\nsufficient number of uniformed or readily identifiable employees or attendants to supervise the viewing public, or by\nphysical barriers, such as fences, walls, glass partitions, or distance, or any combination of these.\nCorrect by February 27th, 2021.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
