A female maltese(#4691) has an excessive amount of brown tarter on all of her teeth, with\nreceding gums. The left upper pre-molar has an open pocket between the top of the tarter and the bottom of the\ngumline that exposes the roots of the tooth. There are several areas between the gumline and tarter on the front\ninsizers and some of the pre-molars where there is a gray spongy type of material that appears to be pus like in\nconsistency. There is a strong odor coming from the mouth and alot of salivation when looking in the mouth. There\nis a brown poodle (#4695) that has an excessive buildup of brown tarter running along all of the pre-molars\npreventing individual identification of each tooth. The back molars had a large ball of white calculous type material\nbuildup completely covering the two back upper molars. This material came off during the inspection of the mouth,\nwhich showed a red, bleeding gumline underneath. There was an odor to the mouth and alot of saliva while\ninspecting the teeth. The teeth had not been observed and the veterinarian had not been contacted for any\ntreatment prior to this inspection.\nThe buildup of tarter and debris on the teeth can cause possible health issues if left untreated or managed on a\nregular basis.\nThe licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of any dogs with a large buildup of\ntarter or any gum or tooth issues. The licensee should be checking all regulated animals regularly for any health and\ndental issues.\nTo be corrected by: December 29, 2018\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee"
