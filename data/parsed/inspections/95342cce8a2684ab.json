The reasons stated for this were animal aggression and the safety of employees.

When staff cannot introduce a food receptacle into an enclosure, they try to feed the dogs through fences\nwithout the food contacting the ground for food items that are small enough, but larger food items are still tossed in and\neaten off of the ground. Food receptacles help food remain palatable and protect it from contamination, as well as limit the\namount of non-food and potentially harmful parasites or other pathogens an animal may inadvertently consume from\neating directly off of the ground. The facility must ensure that food receptacles are used and are readily accessible to all\ndogs, and located so as to minimize contamination by excreta and pests, and be protected from rain and snow. Feeding\npans must either be made of a durable material that can be easily cleaned and sanitized or be disposable. Non-\ndisposable food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized in accordance with Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.11(b),\nwhich is achieved by using one of the methods described in Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.11(b)(3).
