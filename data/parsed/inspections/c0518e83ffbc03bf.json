While\nnursing is a metabolic strain on a female and can result in weight loss, this degree of weight loss is concerning.\nAlso, it cannot be assumed that there are not concurrent problems occurring that contribute to the excessive weight\nloss.\n-There is a thin, geriatric bobcat as evidenced by a pronounced hollowing in the abdominal area behind the ribs and\na visible loss of muscle mass in the rear legs. This animal was seen by a veterinarian for a dental problem about 2\nmonths ago and was weighed at that time. The facility has not communicated with a veterinarian about this animal's\nbody condition nor have they weighed her since that time. Weight loss in any animal (but particularly in a geriatric\nanimal) can indicate that there are medical or nutritional problems occurring.\n-There are three chipmunks who have evidence of wounds. One has a thinning, rough hair coat, a large scab on the\nback of its neck, and is missing the tops of his ears. One has a large scar in the center of the top of his head and is\nmissing the top of the left ear, One has some damage to one of its ears and appears to be missing part of its tail.\nThe facility representative states that the animals were acquire in this condition but does not have documentation\nfrom the AV to show that they have been assessed. Evidence of wounds can indicate incompatibility or space\nissues, ongoing skin problems, or other medical problems.\n-There is a geriatric artic fox who walks with a stiff, slow gait. The facility is feeding this animal a dog food with a\njoint protective function as part of its regular diet. The facility representative states that they have had the animal\nassessed by the attending veterinarian recently and have a receipt showing the visit but no other documentation\nshowing the communication with the veterinarian or any outcome or treatment plan resulting from that visit.
