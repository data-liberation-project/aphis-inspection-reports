The framing supports the enclosure divider and the entry gates. The rust\ncorroded the metal supports of the dividers and the gates. The metal supports are completely gone in some areas\nrevealing signs of structural weakness. Also, inside the Unheated Kennel there is tin that runs along the bottom of\nthe back wall. This tin is excessively rusty and pitting. Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point\nthat the metal surfaces can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust affects the structural\nstrength of all metal surfaces. Any surfaces that come in contact with the dogs must be free of excessive rust that\nprevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. These rusted\nsurfaces must be repaired, treated or are in need of replacement."
