      "narrative": "An adult female Welsh Corgi named Ellie Mae (last 4 digits of her microchip #0563) had been attacked through the\nfence by another dog in an adjacent pen about a week ago. The kennel owner had made appropriate adjustments\nto the kennel layout to isolate the aggressive dog and had cleaned the wound. Ellie Mae's left ear was missing a\nlarge piece and it was red, crusted, and had pus oozing from the wound. The kennel owner was using a\nnon-prescription spray to clean the ear daily but had made no attempts to contact his attending vet in the preceding\nweek.\nA 4 month old red and white male Welsh Corgi pup (last 4 digits of his microchip #211B) had large patches of fur\nmissing from his face and feet. The skin was red and darkened and had small scabs all over. His eyes had a yellow\ncreamy discharge. The puppy was not as active as its littermate in the same pen. The puppy had received no\ntreatment for his condition.\nThe kennel owner called the veterinarian during the inspection and left to take both animals to the vet at the\nconclusion of the inspection. The vet confirmed that both dogs received treatment.\nAdequate veterinary care must be provided to sick and injured animals. Communication with the veterinarian must\nbe timely and accurate to ensure best possible outcomes and improve animal welfare.\nCorrect immediately.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner."
