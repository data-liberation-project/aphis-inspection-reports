This symptom\nhas not been noted or consulted with the veterinarian. Upon questioning this, the inspector was told that the animal\nmoved this way because he was very old; approximately 10 yrs, but records list date of birth as 2009.\nIt is essential that there is daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being, so that the\nveterinarian can be consulted. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and\naccurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian. Failure to recognize medical or other issues and to convey those to the attending veterinary staff in a\ntimely manner can jeopardize the health and well-being if the animals.\nTo be corrcted by 5/2/14."
