      "narrative": "During the visit at the premises with two Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission investigators the facility owner\nindicated that he has continued to sell wild, exotic and domestic animals since the last visit of the previous USDA\nAnimal care inspector in July of 2015. He stated he sold a macaque to someone in Texas. He also breeds exotics\nand sells them as well as buys and sells regulated animals at auctions not just in Florida but in other states as well.\nHe and another individual at the facility stated they breed and sell hairless cats, nonhuman primates, zebras, and\nother animals. The owner indicated that they intended to become USDA license down the road but were really not\nready for that now. There was extensive discussion including regulated activity without a USDA license, specific\nregulated activities and covered species, types of licenses, the licensing process, standards, exemptions, health\ncertificates, housing animals at other facilities, covered species, covered activities and other items related to the\nlicensing processes, inspections, and regulations. A copy of the AWA regulations (\u201cBlue Book\u201d) and an application\npacket was provided and the contents discussed and explained. It was clearly communicated that conducting\nregulated activity without a valid USDA License is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act and that no regulated activity\nmust occur without obtaining a valid USDA License."
