One of them, a Bengal female (microchip #: 985141005790573) that was identified on the last report (June\n9, 2023) with crusts and clear nasal discharge located in the white cage near the kitchen, received veterinary care (exam\nand treatment initiation) on the same day. However, per the licensee, this kitten has been getting worse and the\nveterinarian was not notified until the inspector observed and mentioned concerning clinical signs \u2013 including lethargy\n(new clinical sign), thick, yellowish-brown nasal crusts, as well as yellowish-brown nasal discharge in right nostril. On the\nevening of Friday, June 9, 2023, the licensee identified a separate Leopard cat kitten (no microchip), that was not taken in\nfor treatment that day with the others, as appearing ill with watery eyes. The licensee elected to initiate medical treatment\non this animal, using the same medication as the other kittens, without consulting a veterinarian. The licensee notified the\nveterinarian about the condition of this animal during the same call regarding the Bengal kitten. Failure to use appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can foster an unhealthy environment, delay the\nonset of diagnosing and treating ailments, and can consequently lead to unnecessary suffering and death. Each dealer\nshall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Both cats that were identified by the inspector need to be examined\nand treated by a veterinarian.\nOn the same date, a focused inspection was conducted, whereby the findings from the inspection will be forthcoming in\nan additional report. These findings did not rise to the level of direct or critical non-compliances.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nBRENTON COX, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOR\nMadeline Anna, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
