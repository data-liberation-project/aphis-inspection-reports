      "narrative": "During this inspection, the inspectors identified two animals that were in need of acute veterinary care:\n1) On 3-3-16 several people were noted congregated in front of a stall housing goats. Two of the people were\noverheard voicing concern and were upset over a couple of newborn goat kids in the enclosure that appeared weak\nand unable to rise on their own and thus could not nurse. One very small brown goat kid was noted making high\npitched crying noises. Every few minutes it would try to lift its head or one of its legs but could not do so for more\nthan a couple of seconds. It was unable to rise on its own. A second white with brown on face goat kid was also\nnoticed to be weak and lying in a position with its legs unnaturally splayed. Both kids appeared thin with a\npronounced bone structure especially compared to the other set of newborn goat kids in the same enclosure. An\nauction staff member was notified and tried to assist the kids with nursing by holding them up to the mother goat.\nThe staff member stated that the vet tech staff knew about the birth that morning but had not been informed about\ntheir current weakness. The attending veterinarian was consulted by the inspectors and had not been notified about\nthe goat kids. The goat kids were no longer present at the auction on 3-4-16.\n2) During a walk through the auction barn on 3-4-16 an addax (#7628) was noted missing its left horn. There was\nfreshly clotted blood on its head and running down the left side of its face from the wound where the horn had been.\nReview of the consignment form indicated \"broken horn\". A conversation with auction staff indicated they consigned\nthe addax with a horn that broke off during transport to the auction. The attending veterinarian was unaware of the\naddax.\n3) On the morning of 3-5-16 one capybara (#176) was noted with a fresh moist bright red lesion on the top of its\nnose about 1/2 in x 1 inch in size. No veterinary attention had been sought.\nLack of adequate veterinary care for acute conditions can lead to distress and suffering of the animals. The facility is\nresponsible for identifying veterinary issues, communicating with the veterinarian about the issues and ensuring\nadequate veterinary care to include diagnosis and treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the\nauction."

      "narrative": "On the morning of 3-3-16 the inspectors watched the auction staff moving goats and sheep from their enclosures to\nthe auction ring. One young adult man with reddish hair was noted kicking and using a whip on the animals that he\nconsidered moving along too slowly. When a second auction staff member noted us observing them, the young\nadult man was taken aside and the whip was exchanged for a plastic guide pole. Later that same day, several\nyoung boys helping out with the movement of the sheep and goats were noted physically pushing, shoving and\npulling goats and sheep rather than allowing them to move along at their preferred speed. During this entire time the\nboys were loudly yelling at the animals. Again when the older more experienced staff noted the presence of the\ninspectors, they told the younger boys to end the aggressive behavior.\nKicking, whipping and shoving of animals results in behavioral stress, discomfort and possible injury to the animals.\nAll animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort."

The weather on 3/3/16 started out grey, overcast and\nsnowy. After a couple of hours, the snow changed over to rain that continued through the afternoon. One young\nwatusi was noted to be wet and shivering and exhibited a tucked-up body, indicating discomfort. The calf was\nwatched for 10 minutes and was noted to be full-body shivering throughout the observation period. The temperature\nat that time was recorded at 40.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Cold weather coupled with snow and rain makes it difficult for\nanimals, especially young animals, to maintain their core body temperature. Inability to maintain appropriate body\ntemperatures can predispose animals, especially young animals, to increased risk of disease due to stress,\ndiscomfort and hypothermia. The calf was rechecked on 3-4-16 and appeared to be more comfortable and dry and\nwas no longer shivering. When climatic conditions present a threat to the animals health or well-being, appropriate\nmeasures must be taken to alleviate the impact of these conditions. Correct from this day forward."
