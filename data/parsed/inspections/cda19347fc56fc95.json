Sloths as a species are very\nsensitive to temperature and humidity, requiring temperature of 75-85 degrees F and 60-80 % humidity for their health\nand comfort. The facility Standard Operating Procedure is to record the temperature and humidity weekly to ensure it is\nkept in the appropriate range. The last time the facility recorded the temperature and humidity was 18 April 2023, and the\nparameters were not within the range. Ensuring that the temperature and humidity in a sloth enclosure is corrected if out\nof range, and brought back into range is important to the welfare of the sloths.\nCorrect by 15 May 2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager.\nn"
