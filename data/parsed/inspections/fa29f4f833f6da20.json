In Pen 6 there were 3 adult guinea pigs (2 black and\nwhite and 1 brown and white) with head tilts. The animals were eating and drinking normally and appeared to be in\ngood body condition. The facility had observed these animals had head tilts approximately one month prior to the\ninspection but had not contacted the attending veterinarian and had not applied the treatments described for\nanimals with head tilts in the Program of Veterinary Care. The attending veterinarian was contacted and agreed\nthese animals should be treated.\nHead tilts can be due to various causes and delays in providing appropriate veterinary care for these conditions can\nresult in worsening of the condition and potentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature.\nThe licensee must initiate treatment as described in the Program of Veterinary Care or consult with the attending\nveterinarian regarding the head tilts in these 3 guinea pigs.\nCorrect by: March 13, 2020"
