      "narrative": "***A female wolf was favoring the right front leg. Documentation at the facility indicated that the licensee had first\nnoticed that the animal was not \"weight bearing at all\" on the front leg on 1/2/16. According to the licensee, the\nanimal had not been physically examined by a veterinarian and was not receiving any medication for this condition.\nThe licensee had caught the animal and detected \"some heat in the shoulder\" on 1/3/16. According to\ndocumentation at the facility, the licensee had taken a phone video of the animal on 1/4/16 and showed her\nveterinarian. The facility document continues: \"she said leave her and observe to determine if it will resolve\". Only\none attempt to give Rimadyl to the female wolf was made according to the record; however, one of the two other\nwolves that share her enclosure \"grabbed it\". On 1/27/16 an entry on the record indicates that the animal started to\nput some weight on the leg but was still \"packing it\". On 2/15/16 another entry states that the licensee spoke with\nthe veterinarian about the lameness and proposed a new treatment plan as a possibility in the spring or summer.\nCurrently, this treatment had not been started. The next and last entry was documented on 3/31/16 stating that\nthere is still a \"slight right front limp\". According to the written documentation, the licensee \"can't medicate\", the wolf\n\"will limp 9m-1y then periodically\" and it is \"to much stress to cage rest\" the animal. There was no written\ndocumentation of a possible diagnosis. Furthermore, the licensee indicated that no diagnostic testing had been\nperformed. Lameness could indicate arthritis, an injury, infection, or other veterinary medical condition which can\nbe painful. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an\naccurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must\ndocument this information and make it available to the inspector upon request.\n***There was a female adult tiger named \"Honey\" who appeared to be excessively fat. The licensee stated that in\nJanuary 2016 she slowly began decreasing the cat's amount of food from 7 pounds of meat per day down to a\ncurrent amount of 5 1/2 pounds per day. The licensee stated the tiger has lost weight since January, but she made\nthat determination using visual estimation since she is unable to weigh the tigers. The facility's written nutrition plan\nfor the animals' non-commercial diets shows that \"Honey\" and the other tigers receive 7 pounds of meat per day.\nThere was no documentation showing that \"Honey's\" diet was decreased nor that the decrease was approved by\nthe Attending Veterinarian. The licensee stated that \"Honey\" is separated from the other tigers during feeding time\nto restrict her intake. However, at the time of inspection, there were meat scraps found in the enclosure containing\n\"Honey\" and the other tigers. Overweight animals have an increased risk of developing health problems. Felines in\nparticular have special nutritional needs which require veterinarian-approved non-commercial diets to help decrease\nthe risk of health problems. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this\ninformation and make it available to the inspector upon request. Due to the special nutritional needs of wild and\nexotic cats and to ensure the diet is appropriate, a diet plan must be documented and approved by the attending\nveterinarian when a facility is feeding a non-commercial diet.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by: May\n6, 2016."

There was a stack of bags of kitty litter covered in dust leaning up against the\nanimals' chain link enclosure as well as other miscellaneous items such as a plastic food rack.
