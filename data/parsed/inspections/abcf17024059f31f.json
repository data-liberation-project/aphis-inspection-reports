The pond enclosure located on the periphery of the zoo grounds adjacent to\nan empty parking lot is not fully enclosed (i.e. open-air top) but it includes areas of dense foliage on opposite sides of the\npond as well as two shelters (i.e. a large dog crate as well as an A-frame structure) for safety. A hawk was previously\nseen nesting near the zoo grounds and presumed by zoo staff to be the predator involved in this case.\n--On June 13, 2024 during morning round observations a zoo keeper discovered a rat snake in one of the sun parakeet\nnest boxes where two sun parakeets were missing (i.e. 13 year old male #AV0431 & 14 year old female #AV0429). Staff\nconfirmed predation by scanning and detecting the missing birds' microchips inside the rat snake. The enclosure consists\nof 1x1 inch metal fencing walls and roofing which are contiguous with each other and this is the first incident of a predator\nbreach to this enclosure. The enclosure was thoroughly inspected by zoo staff for point of entry for the snake and no area\nof compromised integrity was identified.\n--On July 10, 2024 during morning round observations a 15 year old male Chilean flamingo (#AV0496) was found\ndeceased in its enclosure with a foot caught in a split gap on one of two 5-foot vertical wood pillars/posts. The vertical\nposts have an approximate 6-inch flat cut diameter top surface and staff indicated the flamingos were never observed to\nuse these posts for perching. The wood pillars/posts are only intended to keep the giant tortoises from entering the\nflamingo area of the exhibit. Corrective action of trimming the posts as well as increased frequency of enclosure integrity\nchecks were implemented prior to the time of the inspection on October 24, 2024.\n--On August 3, 2024 the keeper opened the 6 inch diameter water drain of the black swan pool to empty it for routine\nmaintenance. When the keeper returned to complete the pool maintenance the 1.5 year old female black swan (#AV0831)\nwas found deceased with her head inside the drain. The cause of death was determined to be drowning due to necropsy\nfindings of water in the bird\u2019s lungs. Corrective action of covering the pool drain with a screen cover during pool\nmaintenance was implemented prior to the time of inspection on October 24, 2024.\nComplete corrections by January 28, 2025 by ensuring housing facilities are kept in good repair, protect the birds from\ninjury, and restrict other animals from entering that may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within."
