There is also a large piece of green colored metal lying on the ground in the enclosure.\nContact with the piece of metal could cause injury to the animals' feet and legs and the angle at which the electric\nfence posts are leaning could cause injury to the animals' face and eyes should they inadvertently run into them.\nThe housing facility must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.\nThe licensee must remove the large piece of metal from the enclosure and either remove or alter the electric fence\nposts in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the warthogs.\nTo be corrected by: October 19, 2020\nIn one enclosure containing at least two groundhogs, a blue tarp had been covering the top of the enclosure, but the\ntarp has now been shredded and spread throughout the enclosure. The potential consumption of the blue tarp could\nhave a negative impact on the groundhogs' health and well-being.\nAt least four enclosures, containing a total of two groundhogs, two bobcats, two badgers, and a porcupine, have a\nfloor constructed of welded metal rod fencing that will stop the animals from digging out of the enclosure. Substrate\nsuch as dirt has been laid across the top of the fencing, but the animals have completely excavated the substrate\nfrom areas of the flooring causing the metal rod fencing to be exposed. The dirt beneath the exposed fencing has\nalso been dug out and the animals' feet and legs can now pass through the openings in the floor fencing. Openings\nin the flooring that allow animals' feet and legs to pass through could result in injury to the animals.\nThe housing facility must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.\nThe licensee must remove the shredded tarp from the groundhog enclosure and alter the exposed flooring fence in\nall the affected enclosures in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the animals.\nTo be corrected by: October 19, 2020\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell and the facility representative."
