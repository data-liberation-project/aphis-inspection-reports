      "narrative": "A female cream and tan colored adult Shih Tzu identified with microchip (452E7B3062) and tattoo number (25) has\nan open sore on top of its right front paw. The dog was observed in the primary enclosure holding up the right front\nleg and not putting any weight on it while it walked. The open sore was bleeding and running down the paw. The\nsize of the area affected on the skin is approximately 1 inch in diameter with hair loss around the sore. The licensee\nremoved the dog from the enclosure and took it into another room in the building to clean the wound. A facility\nattendant stated that the sore was observed a few days ago. The licensee stated that she had not consulted a\nveterinarian regarding the current condition of the dog. Open wounds can be very painful causing discomfort when\nthe dog has to place weight on the affected foot. Wounds on the foot can affect the mobility and daily activity of the\ndog. If left untreated the open wound could lead to an infection forming which affects the health and well being of\nthe dog. The licensee must have the animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate plan administered. The\noutcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must\nensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n*The licensee contacted the attending veterinarian at the time of inspection and stated the veterinarian is going to\ncome to the facility to examine the dog and provide documentation today.\nExit interview conducted with licensee."
