The medication expired 5 months ago, the\nexpiration date on the bottle of medication was 09-2020. An employee stated that the facility owner told her that the\nattending veterinarian had given instructions to use this medication for the sloth daily to treat the injured claw.\nThe attending veterinarian was contacted and stated that on Feb 12th she was contacted by the facility about the sloth\u2019s\ninjury and instructed the facility to administer \"a dose\" of Metacam. The attending veterinarian did not know that this sloth\nwas continuing to be given this medication every day, and indicated that it was not her intention to prescribe the drug long\nterm. The attending veterinarian stated that she had not received any updates from the facility regarding this animal's\ninjury.\nMedications that have expired may be less effective, resulting in less or no impact on the medical problem they are meant\nto treat. Using medications for longer than prescribed may result in accidental overdose, or may damage vital organs such\nas the kidneys or liver. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as Metacam (Meloxicam) are known to pose a\npotential risk to kidney function in some animals if used longer than prescribed.\nCorrect by providing adequate veterinary care to treat injuries and support the health and well being of the sloth, including\nthe use of unexpired medications and timely communication with the Attending Veterinarian regarding this animal\u2019s injury,\nprogress, and medication regimen.\n***An approximately 1-year-old 2-toed sloth (\u201cKiara\u201d on necropsy records, \u201cKoda\u201d in the facility's Animal Inventory\ndatabase) died on January 29th, 2021. Employees stated that this animal had diarrhea for 3 weeks prior to its death, and\nwas housed at the owner\u2019s home in the days before it died. The previous attending veterinarian- who was the attending\nveterinarian at the time of this animal\u2019s death- was contacted and stated that while she was the attending veterinarian she\nhad not examined the sloth and did not provide medical treatment prior to its death beyond possibly conducting one fecal\nexam for parasites. The current attending veterinarian submitted the animal for necropsy on February 2nd, 2021, and the\nnecropsy report diagnosed diarrhea as the primary illness present.\nAnimals with severe diarrhea can become critically ill in a short period of time and may die due to dehydration,\nmalnourishment, or electrolyte imbalances. Daily observation of animals for signs of illness or changes in body condition\nor behavior is important for the prompt detection of illness or injury. Timely communication with the attending veterinarian\nis critical for ensuring medical problems are addressed and treated. The provision of adequate veterinary care is critical\nfor animal health, well-being, and survival.\nCorrect by providing adequate veterinary care to treat illnesses and support the health and well being of sloths, including\ndaily observation of every sloth and expedient communication with the attending veterinarian regarding the presence of\nnew or recurrent health problems.\n***An adult male dromedary camel had a large amount of liquid diarrhea on his hind legs and the underside of his tail. The\ndiarrhea was brown and covered the inside of the upper hind legs and was also located on the backs of hind legs lower\ndown (near the knees/hocks). Spots of similarly colored diarrhea were observed in the pasture. The animal was otherwise\nquiet and alert. An employee stated that the diarrhea had not been observed yesterday, and that this animal has had\ndiarrhea intermittently in the past, often when he is needing to be dewormed. The attending veterinarian\u2019s written program\nof veterinary care for this facility requires fecal exam of camelids (camels) once a month, and deworming is then\nperformed based on results of the fecal exam. According to an employee, the last deworming for this camel occurred over\na month ago (Panacur was last given from December 15th to December 22nd, 2020), and the last fecal exam likely\noccurred prior to that time.\nAnimals with diarrhea or intestinal parasites can become very ill in a short period of time and may suffer from dehydration,\nmalnourishment, or electrolyte imbalances. Failing to follow the written program of veterinary care may result in animals\nbecoming sick or unhealthy due to lack of adequate veterinary care.\nThe day of the inspection, a fecal sample from the camel was taken to the attending veterinarian for examination and\nbased on the fecal exam results the animal was given medications for intestinal parasites.\nCorrect by following the attending veterinarian\u2019s written program of veterinary care and by providing adequate veterinary\ncare to support the health and well being of the camel."
