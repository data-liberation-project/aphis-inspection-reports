This can then lead to recession of gum tissue, gum inflammation\nand tooth loss. It may also lead to pain and discomfort while chewing, decreased food consumption and weight\nloss.\nThe above described dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian by 26NOV2019 for dental assessment and a\ntreatment plan established for the treatment of the dental tartar buildup."
