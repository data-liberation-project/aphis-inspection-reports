There was a\nmild amount of clear watery-like discharge present on the inner corner of the right eye. \u201cLincoln\u201d was also observed\noccasionally squinting the right eye. The animal appeared otherwise healthy. The facility\u2019s animal care staff stated the\ncats in A-3 had been observed that morning, prior to the inspection; however, these clinical signs had not been identified\nduring the observation. Failure to provide adequate daily observation of all the animals and prompt notification to the\nattending veterinarian regarding problems on animal health, behavior, and well-being may delay care and cause undue\npain, discomfort, or stress. The facility must maintain a comprehensive method to perform daily observations of all\nanimals to assess their health and well-being, identify problems, and assure direct and timely communication with the\nattending veterinarian.
