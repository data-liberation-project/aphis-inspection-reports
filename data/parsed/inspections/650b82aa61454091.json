There is 1 enclosure housing 1 adult female and 1 adult male jaguars and an\nadjacent enclosure housing 1 adult male jaguar. There is a stone barrier in front of these enclosures that is\napproximately 3\u2019 high and 4\u2019 from the metal fencing, the area in-between contains thorny low growing plants. The\nmetal squares of the enclosure fencing have openings that are 2\u201d x 4\u201d. Members of the public are able to reach out\nand touch the bars of these enclosures. A facility representative stated that 2 members of the public have leaned\nover the barrier and were scratched by the 3.5 year old adult female jaguar \u2018Sara\u2019. One incident was in March 2019\nand another incident occurred in the summer of 2018.\nFailure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the viewing public may pose a risk of\nharm to the animal and to the public. A sufficient barrier system must be in place to assure the safety of all animals\nand the public.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals\nand the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
