Once standing,\nthe female would not bear weight or would intermittently toe touch. Additionally, it was noted by APHIS personnel\nthat her left hind limb would shake and twitch when toe-touching. Although this animal was seen by the veterinarian\non July 31 2016, the veterinarian confirmed this animal was weight bearing at that time. Non weight bearing on a\nlimb may be an indicator of pain.\n***One tricolor goat was intermittently non weight bearing on its front right limb and walked semi-lame. The animal\nmanager stated he had trimmed this animals hooves two days prior and had \"nicked the quick\". The manager stated\nafter trimming the hooves, he had to apply a \"kwik stop\" like substance to aid on stopping the bleeding. Lameness\nand non weight bearing is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes including both\ninfectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment\ncan result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on August 10, 2016, to obtain\naccurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation\nmust be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary\ndiagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any\nmedications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health\nrecord that list when the medication is administered to the animals.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and\nthe need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate\nveterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for\nproviding adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries.\n***There are three pigs, housed in the indoor barn, that are in need of hoof trims. The hooves on both front legs\nwere excessively long, extending out approximately three to fives inches. Failure to appropriately maintain\nhooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility(cid:25)s programs\nof preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a\ntimely manner."
