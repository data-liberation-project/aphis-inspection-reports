The licensee reported that it was\npurchased in March 2016 with a stump left front leg and hadn't had problems with it. In inspection today it was\nobserved to have crusted tissue and hair around the leg, its foot was missing and bone was protruding from the\ncenter of the lesion. This condition can be painful and the bone protruding from the stump leg is an open route for\ninfection to enter the chinchilla's leg and needs veterinary treatment. The facility must ensure that the attending\nveterinarian evaluates this animal's condition and ensure that the prescribed treatment is followed.\nCorrect by 11/3/2017."
