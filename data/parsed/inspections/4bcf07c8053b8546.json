Additionally, there were several nail heads protruding from the facility\u2019s\nmain building and two other storage structures within the facility yard. Structures in disrepair and sharp, protruding\npoints or edges in areas of contact with the animals may lead to injury.\n-Several sections of a wooden railing, material were loosely stacked against the side of a storage shed and on the\nground. Animals could potentially become injured or trapped in the railing openings if these items fall or are\nknocked over.\n-There was a heavily worn, sagging and loosely attached particle board covering a crawl space opening along the\nside of the facility\u2019s main building. The lack of structural stability of this board covering could lead to injury by an\nanimal falling through or becoming trapped within this opening.\n- At least four, exposed and unprotected, extension cords connected to a single power source were lying directly on\nthe ground in this yard. Electrical cords located within reach of the animals pose the risk of serious injury from\nelectrical hazards. Two goats and one pig were freely roaming within the facility yard at time of inspection.\nCoatimundi/Raccoon Enclosure: There was exposed underground wire meshing material in several sections of this\nenclosure. Exposed, wire meshing may cause potential injury or entrapment of the animals.\nAll enclosures must be structurally sound, kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other\nhazards in order to protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely\nidentification, facility repair and maintenance must be in place.\nCorrect by 03/20/2017.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative."
