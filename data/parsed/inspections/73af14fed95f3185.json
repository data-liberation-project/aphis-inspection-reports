She was also repeatedly using her hind feet to scratch at the area. The skin near the end\nof the incision (closer to the back end of the dog) was bright pink with darker pink around the edges. The inflamed area\nwas approximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size. The kennel manager stated she had observed that the area was \u201cbruised\u201d\nand that she had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) about the issue. The kennel manager stated that she was\nnot giving the dog any medications, since she had not received any instructions from the AV to do so; the dog's medical\nrecords showed no medications have been given since the surgery. The AV was contacted and stated that the dog had\nbeen discharged after surgery with instructions which included 1) the dog should wear an Elizabethan collar, and 2) the\ndog was supposed to be given anti-inflammatory pain medication (Carprofen) daily. The AV stated that these instructions\nwere given to the kennel employee who picked up the dog from the clinic after surgery. The written medical record\navailable for review did not contain these instructions, and the written Program of Veterinary Care did not include post-\nsurgical instructions. Dogs that are not properly cared for after surgery may suffer from discomfort, stress, pain, infection,\nor complications at the surgical site. It is critically important to follow the AV\u2019s instructions for post-surgical care; it is also\nimportant to ensure that instructions are relayed from the AV to the appropriate personnel so that all instructions can be\nfollowed completely and correctly. Correct by having this dog evaluated by the AV and following all instructions for her\ncare, and by ensuring that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in\ndogs."
