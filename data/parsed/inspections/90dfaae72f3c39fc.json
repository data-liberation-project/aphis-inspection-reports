Closer inspection revealed the\nskin deep inside the left ear canal is slightly reddened and the hair on the inside of both ear canals is coated in a wet\ndischarge. Additionally, both ear canals have clumps of a greasy-dark colored material inside them, and this material is\nalso trapped in the hair directly beneath the ears. The Veterinary Medical Officer examining the dog noticed a yeast-like\nsmell exuding from the ear. The dog had been treated for the condition of its ears between February 25th and February\n29th but is not currently receiving any treatment.\nAbnormal conditions of the ears could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to further health issues if left\nuntreated.\nFemale Bulldog (#363, microchip #725835) has an abnormal condition of the eyes. The whites of both eyes are severely\nreddened, and a large amount of yellow colored discharge is covering both eyes and coating the hair surrounding each\neye. The dog was hesitant to hold its eyes open while being examined by the inspector. The facility had treated the dog\u2019s\neyes between April 7th and April 12th and had planned to have the dog rechecked April 26th but the animal is not\ncurrently receiving any treatment for the condition.\nAbnormal conditions of the eyes could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to further health issues if left\nuntreated.\nFemale Bernese Mountain dog (#42, microchip #7E10334930) is observed by the inspectors to be sensitive on all four\nfeet while walking around the enclosure. Closer examination revealed the dog has areas of reddened, irritated, and\nslightly swollen skin on the bottom of each foot. The majority of the irritated areas are located along the foot pads on\neach foot. A few small areas of irritated skin are located around the toenails on the topside of the hindfeet.

One upper incisor is loose and moved easily\nwhen the inspector applied gentle pressure. The white of the dog\u2019s left eye is moderately reddened and a small amount\nof yellow colored discharge is attached to the hair near the corner of the eye. The condition of the dog\u2019s teeth and eye\nhave not been noticed and the animal is currently receiving no treatment.\nPoor dental health and abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to\nfurther health issues if left untreated.\nMale Pomeranian (#3, microchip #64578, \u201cManny\u201d) has poor dental health. The entire surface of the upper and lower\ncheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are encased in a dark brown colored material and nearly the entire surface of the\nupper and lower canine teeth are also covered in the brown material.

Closer\nexamination of the animal revealed a large clump of dried and wet feces attached to the hair coat beneath her tail.\nNumerous rope-like mats of hair are attached to the top of the dog\u2019s head and beneath the right eye. The condition of the\ndog\u2019s hair coat has not been noticed but the facility representative stated to the inspectors that the dog could be groomed\nthat day.\nFeces trapped in the hair coat could cause the animal discomfort as well as attract pests such as insects and allow for the\ngrowth of disease-causing agents. Matted hair coats could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to further\nhealth issues.\nFemale Bulldog (#355, microchip #1747566) has an abnormal condition of the eyes. The whites of both eyes are\nseverely reddened and both eyes appear cloudy.
