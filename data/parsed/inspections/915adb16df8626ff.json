Any individual animal falling below 85% of their free-feeding weight for two days in a row will be either returned\nto ad libitum food access or euthanized. On, 9 December 2025 it was determined by the attending veterinarian while\nreviewing weight logs that the following voles fell below 85% of their free-feeding weight for more than 2 days\nconsecutively without being returned to ad lib feeding:\nVole ID R4- Day 7 (83.56%), Day 8 (78.72%), Day 9 (83.83%), Day 10 (84.09%)\nVole ID B3- Day 6 (82.83%), Day 7 (81.81%), Day 8 (83.33%), Day 9 (79.01%), Day 10 (79.27%)\nVole ID S5- Day 8 (84.24%), Day 9 (84.06%), Day 10 (81.92%)\nAdditionally, weights were not recorded for voles ID R6, ID NP (cage 1551), ID S5, and ID NP (cage 1546) on Day 4 of\nthe study.\nThis activity constitutes a significant deviation from the approved activities in the protocol. Making significant changes to\nprotocols without IACUC review and approval deprives the IACUC of the opportunity to provide oversight of animal\nactivities and compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, failing to follow the fasting procedure as described in\nthe protocol could result in excessive weight loss, discomfort, and additional medical issues in the affected animals.\nPrincipal investigators are to follow the IACUC-approved protocols, and any proposed changes shall be reviewed and\napproved by the IACUC prior to implementation.

      "narrative": "The facility self-reported an incident that occurred on 5 August 2025 where adequate daily observations were not\nperformed resulting in a failure to identify significant overgrowth of the upper incisor teeth of one prairie vole. The\novergrown teeth subsequently led to entrapment of a prairie vole in its primary enclosure. On Tuesday, August 5, a\nlaboratory research assistant called the attending veterinarian because they observed a 5-month-old male wild-type vole\nentrapped with his severely overgrown upper incisor teeth hooked on the wire lid of the primary enclosure and the vole\nwas unable to free himself. The attending veterinarian immediately went to the vole room and quickly freed the vole from\nthe wire lid. The facility stated that the length of time the animal was entrapped by the overgrown incisors was potentially\nup to 7 hours. The vole had small lacerations on the upper and lower lips from his efforts to free himself from the wire lid.\nThe vole was anesthetized to do a more thorough evaluation. The voles upper incisors were long/overgrown,\napproximately 3-4 times the length of a normal vole. The vole was administered meloxicam and buprenorphine for pain\nand stress from the entrapment. Subcutaneous saline was also administered to the vole for potential dehydration due to\nthe length of time the vole could have been entrapped. The jagged edges of the overgrown upper incisors were trimmed,\nand the lacerations irrigated. The vole was placed in a recovery cage in the incubator per IACUC surgery guidelines. After\nthe vole awoke from anesthesia, it was noted that there was a large area of urine on the drape and the vole\u2019s fur was\nsoaked with urine. This is suggestive of a possible seizure during recovery, but the vole appeared to be behaving\nnormally and was returned to his normal primary enclosure. Twenty-four hours later, upon restraining the vole to\nadminister meloxicam, the vole went into a grand mal seizure/status epilepticus. After several minutes, the vole had not\nrecovered and was euthanized.\nMalocclusion can result in dental issues for rodents and should be monitored for routinely in facilities with prairie voles\nand other species of rodents. Failure to conduct adequate daily observations to assess the health and well-being of this\nanimal prevented the identification of the severely overgrown incisors which led to entrapment and subsequent serious\nanimal impacts. Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include\nadequate daily observation of all animals to properly assess their health and well-being.\nCorrect by today 11 December 2025 and going forward"

      "narrative": "The facility self-reported an incident that occurred on 19 May 2025 where the primary enclosure failed to contain prairie\nvoles resulting in the death of two vole pups and the euthanasia of a third vole pup. On 19 May 2025 in the vole housing\nroom, it was discovered by facility personnel that 3 prairie vole pups had escaped their enclosure and were found on the\nfloor. Two of the pups were found deceased and the remaining pup was observed to be in acceptable health but was\neuthanized as a precaution for biosecurity risk to the rest of the vole colony.\nThe laboratory personnel were able to determine the pups escaped from a breeding enclosure that had contained a\nbreeding pair and 6 pups that were born on 01 May 2025, and on 19 May 2025 only the breeding pair and 3 pups\nremained in the enclosure. The enclosure was discovered to be a two-grommet cage, and the voles remaining inside the\nenclosure were actively opening the grommet flap and trying to escape through it. These five voles did not escape and\nwere all determined to be in acceptable health.\nThe facility currently utilizes two types of primary enclosures for rodents which are a single grommet enclosure and a two-\ngrommet enclosure. The single grommet enclosure has only one grommet that connects the enclosure to the air valves on\nthe ventilated rack. The single grommet enclosure is the appropriate enclosure to be used for the voles. The two-grommet\nenclosure has two grommets, one that is the receptacle for the air valves, and the other which is superfluous comprised of\na spring-hinged metal flap covering an open and unused port/hole. These cages are not to be used in the vole colony but\ncan be used for rats when necessary. The facility has established this through training and photos posted in the facility.\nFacility management investigated the incident on 05/19 and 05/20 and determined that the animal care technician\ninadvertently used a two-grommet cage when changing the enclosure housing the 8 voles. The three vole pups were able\nto escape through the superfluous grommet flap, leading to the death of two pups and euthanasia of one pup.\nEnclosures that do not properly contain the animals can lead to stress, injury, and even death. The facility must be\nconstructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor\nhousing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and\nto contain the animals. Prior to inspection, the facility implemented the following corrective actions: On 21 May 2025, the\nfacility staff was re-trained on the requirement of only using the single-grommet cage style in the vole room. The facility\nand laboratory staff will double-check that there are no two-grommet cages in use each time they're in the vole room. The\nfacility will eliminate two-grommet cages to the extent possible based on cage inventory. If the facility must continue to\nuse two-grommet cages in the rat colony, staff will permanently label all two-grommet cages to be clear that they are only\nfor rat use. The facility will also work with the cage manufacturer to replace the flap-style grommet cover with a\nsolid/immobile cover if possible.\nCorrected prior to inspection on 10 December 2025\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.\nn"
