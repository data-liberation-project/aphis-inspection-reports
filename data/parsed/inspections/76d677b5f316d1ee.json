The shelving did not have any\ndoors or cabinets attached to allow enclosed storage.\nSubstances that are toxic to the nonhuman primates but that are required for normal husbandry practices must not\nbe stored in food storage and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nThomas Carla, Veterinary Medical Officer"
