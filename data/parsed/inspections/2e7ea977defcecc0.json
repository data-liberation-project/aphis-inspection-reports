The representative believes the\nbadger was able to escape his enclosure by squeezing through the gap at the junction of the ceiling and back wall of the\nwire enclosure due to a bolt that was not properly tightened.\nFailure to construct and maintain structurally sound facilities can lead to escape, injury, or even death of an animal.\nThe facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor\nand outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury and to contain the animals.\nPrior to inspection the facility checked and tightened all bolts on every enclosure used within the facility.
