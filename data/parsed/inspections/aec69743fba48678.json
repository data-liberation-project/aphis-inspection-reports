  "narrative": "A focused inspection was conducted to re-evaluate two animals identified as needing hoof trimming due to\nexcessively long hooves noted on the inspection on 12/17/2014.  A male llama and female zebu were observed to\nhave received hoof trims since the previous inspection.  The attending veterinarian had not yet met with the licensee\nto develop a plan for appropriate hoof trimming schedules to prevent chronic changes in the animals' feet and legs. \nThis plan should be developed within the next week and be made available to APHIS officials for review.\n  \nExit interview conducted with facility representative.",
