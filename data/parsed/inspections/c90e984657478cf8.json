The raised whelping enclosures with puppies\nwere checked closely and fleas were not found on the dams and puppies. Dog #54 and Dog #62 were observed to have\nfleas and flea dirt (dark grainy material in their fur). Dog #43 in the same enclosure was then confirmed also to have some\nfleas. After this, at least one dog per group in the floor enclosure was checked and all but one enclosure had fleas on the\nchecked dog. If one dog in the group enclosure has fleas, it is likely the other dogs in the enclosure also do. Light\noccasional scratching was observed by a few dogs during inspection. The caretaker had a note that a flea problem was\ndiscussed with the attending veterinarian on 6-3-2023, however other than a home remedy for one dog, treatment action\nby the facility wasn't taken for the dogs. I called the attending veterinarian who said the home remedy wasn't one of the\ntreatment advices given for flea control.\nFleas can cause dogs discomfort and if uncontrolled can cause dogs to get sick.\nIn order to protect the health and comfort of the dogs the facility must contact the attending veterinarian and follow the flea\ntreatment and prevention directions given.\nCorrect by 7/8/2023."
