      "narrative": "** The facility\u2019s geriatric Asiatic black bear, \u201cDillon\u201d, was observed to have severe dental issues that were seen as\nthe animal was eating. The bear is missing several teeth and has a broken left lower canine tooth that has black\ndiscoloration in the center of the remnant of the tooth. There is a moist yellow discoloration on the lower left jaw\nconsistent with the appearance of a draining tooth abscess. The right lower canine tooth appears to be sheared so\nthat the pulp cavity is exposed and is visible below the natural gum line. The gum line is recessed, and the tooth\nremnant has a black discoloration. There are no visible upper canine teeth. The severity and chronic nature of these\ndental issues are likely to have caused the bear a significant amount of pain over a long period of time and the\ncondition of the teeth has continued to deteriorate since first documented in 2017.\nDiscussions with the facility representative revealed that they are aware of the dental issues with the bear but the\nAttending Veterinarian (AV) has not been comfortable sedating the bear for further examination and potential\ntreatment.\nAdditionally, the bear is morbidly obese, with limited mobility and exhibits a repetitive behavior in which he sits on\nhis haunches and repeatedly rocks himself back and forth by using his forepaws to push against the wall in front of\nhim, and will rock back against a large stone behind him in his enclosure. The caretaker confirmed this is a\nbehavior that is observed frequently. Repetitive abnormal behavior of this nature, can often be an indicator of pain\nand or psychological distress. This repetitive behavior was first documented in 2017 and has been viewed on\nsubsequent inspections and no methods of assessing, addressing or minimizing the underlying causes for this\nbehavior have been put into action.\nThe facility\u2019s geriatric bobcat is similarly obese and the caretaker stated that the animal no longer utilizes climbing\nstructures within the enclosure. The AV hasn\u2019t evaluated the bobcat for weight gain, changes in behavior and\ndecline in mobility or activity.\nBoth the bear and the bobcat are declawed and housed in enclosures that consist of only concrete as the ground\nsurface with the exception of dens that have straw bedding and two rubber mats placed in the bobcat\u2019s enclosure.\nThe combination of old age, obesity, and being declawed, likely contribute to impacts on mobility due to arthritis or\njoint pain. There have been no plans to pursue any diagnostics or treatment to diagnose or alleviate any discomfort\nthe animals might be experiencing.\nFacilities are required to establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Failures to address the old age\nrelated problems, obesity, and lack of mobility of these animals, and the dental disease of the bear are having a\nnegative impact on the health and welfare of these animals."
