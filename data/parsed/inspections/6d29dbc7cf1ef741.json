The attending veterinarian has\ngiven written guidance to follow for these conditions. The facility failed to identify the above animals listed with eye\nconditions. The chinchilla that was noted as being \"beat-up\" by the male was not communicated to the attending\nveterinarian. The attending veterinarian was contacted by phone on 3/24/20 and stated that the licensee should\nfollow the written guidance from his visit on 2-14-20. Facility employees stated that daily observations are\ncompleted in the morning every day when feeding is done. They stated that treats are given to the animals in small\nfeed containers and the animals come to the front of the enclosures and are able to be observed. These daily\nchecks were completed before this inspection.\nThe health issues identified above are significantly impacting animal health and well-being. Daily observation of\nthese animals is not effective and health issues are not being identified within a timely manner. It is the licensee\u2019s\nresponsibility that daily observations are completed appropriately and effectively. Additionally, there must be a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure all health issues are\naddressed within a timely manner, to include the animals identified above."
