At the conclusion of the procedure, the dog was returned to its enclosure. The investigator\nstaff realized they had forgotten to remove the catheter following the procedure when they found the tape used to secure\nthe catheter inside the dog\u2019s enclosure and suspected the dog may have ingested the catheter, as they were still in the\nroom with the animal and very little time had passed since the procedure ended. Investigator staff immediately contacted\na veterinarian who immediately examined the dog, implemented a treatment plan, and frequent evaluations of the dog\nwere performed by veterinary staff. The dog passed the catheter and recovered uneventfully.\n(2) IACUC personnel identified during a routine records review that investigator staff had incorrectly calculated the dose of\nanesthetic agent for an IACUC approved procedure for protocol #023 that resulted in 1.5 times the correct dose being\nadministered to a total of 5 rabbits from August 2025 to September 2025. There were no adverse effects in the rabbits\nfrom the higher dose of medication.\nPer this Section, the handling of animals by all personnel shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not\ncause behavioral stress or unnecessary discomfort. The dog was not handled as carefully as possible when the IV\ncatheter was not removed by investigator staff following the IACUC approved procedure, and the dog subsequently\ningested the catheter. The 5 rabbits were not handled as carefully as possible when the dose of anesthetic agent\nadministered by investigator staff was 1.5 times the correct dose due to inaccurate calculation of the dose by investigator\nstaff.\nThese two incidents were identified by the research facility and corrective measures were implemented prior to this\ninspection. Corrective measures included but were not limited to review of post-procedural processes by dog investigator\nstaff and the inclusion of additional monitoring steps, refresher training of the rabbit investigator staff on drug\ncalculation/drug administration and recordkeeping, and increased monitoring by veterinary and IACUC staff. There have\nnot been any additional incidents in either laboratory after the implementation of these corrective actions.\nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives from 1/13/26 through 1/15/26. The exit briefing was held on\n1/16/26.\n*END OF REPORT*\nn"
