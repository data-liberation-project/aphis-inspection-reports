Both of these expired medications were stored with other medications\ncurrently in use and are therefore considered in use as well. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs,\nfluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not\nconstitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs\nare administrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The applicant must\nensure that all medications used are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary\npractices. To be corrected by 20 May 2106.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility's Attending Veterinarian and Margaret A Shaver,\nVMO in attendance."
