The analgesic medication Buprenex (buprenorphine) was given pre-op, post-op and\nthe morning after the procedure at a dosage of 0.02 mg/kg. The dosage in the approved protocol was 0.005 to 0.01\nmg/kg.\nThe IACUC, as an agent of the facility, shall review all components of activities related to the care and use of animals to\ndetermine that the activities are in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.
