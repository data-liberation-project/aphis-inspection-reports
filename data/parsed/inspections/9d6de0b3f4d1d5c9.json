      "narrative": "During an unsupervised tour visit on July 8, 2019 a group of 4 adults and 6 children approached the lynx primary\nenclosure in the area between a partial public barrier and primary enclosure. There was no guide or attendant at the\nlynx pen to prevent people from approaching the lynx fence or from gaining entry between the partial barrier and\nprimary enclosure. Lack of supervision and lack of an adequate barrier fence allowed the public to approach the\nlynxes' primary fence and a lynx was able to reach through the primary fence and grab the shirt of a 2.5 year old\nboy. The lynx pulled the boy towards the fence and scratched (likely clawed) the boy's head, forehead and forearm.\nOn July 13, 2019 a group was lead by a tour guide to the open-top prairie dog enclosure. While the guide started to\ntake the group of 10 to another area, two people stayed behind to take a photo. The guide said one of the people\nstuck their hand into the enclosure trying to get the prairie dog to jump up, which resulted in the person getting\nbitten on the finger/knuckle. There was no direct supervision by a guide at that time to prevent the actions of the\npublic, and the distance and barrier were not adequate to prevent the public from being able to put their hands into\nthe enclosure and contact a prairie dog.\nDue to the lack of physical barriers, the safety of the public depended solely on the supervision of the guides. Lack\nof adequate supervision and lack of physical barriers has lead to animals causing physical harm to public members.\nLack of adequate barriers and or distance from exhibited animals could lead to future injuries or harm to the public\nand/or animals.\nThe facility must ensure that during public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to\nthe animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing\npublic. Where responsible, knowledgeable attendants are not available at any time of public contact with animals,\nappropriate distance and/or barriers must be in place to prevent contact between the animals and public."

However, since the last\ninspection in 2018, enclosures for two Albifron lemurs, a Geoffrey cat and two badgers have been added to the\noutdoor area with no perimeter fence surrounding these new enclosures.\nA tiger enclosure has recently been added that uses two sides of the wooden planked 8ft perimeter fence for two of\nits primary enclosure sides, so there is not at least 3 feet between the enclosure and a secondary perimeter fence.\nThe enclosure does have a top on it, however using the perimeter fence also as the primary enclosure fence has\nnot been approved by a variance and doesn't meet perimeter fence requirements.\nWhen there is no perimeter fence, animals that escape their primary enclosures can easily escape from the entire\nfacility. Lack of a perimeter fence also allows for easier contact between unwanted animals/people and the animals\nhoused in their primary enclosures. This possible contact can cause increased stress, disease transmission, or\npossible injury to the regulated animals as well as injury to the unauthorized animal/public. A primary enclosure\nusing the perimeter fence on two sides without the 3ft distance between the perimeter fence and primary fence\nincreases risk of unauthorized access/contact with regulated animals.\nAll outdoor housing facilities must be surrounded by a perimeter fence of sufficient height (either six feet for the\nfox/primates/coatis/raccoons or eight feet-for the tiger) with sufficient distance between the primary enclosure and\nperimeter fence to prevent unauthorized contact or entry to the facility's animals.\nInspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nWelch Scott, Veterinary Medical Officer"
