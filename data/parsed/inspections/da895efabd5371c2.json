A facility representative did not notice\nan injury to the puppy earlier in the day before an inspection was conducted. Along the bridge of the puppy's nose\nthere is a triangle shaped portion approximately 1.5 inches long by 1 inch wide of skin missing and a cream-colored\ndischarge coming from the wound. The puppy's nose is split open from the top down to the mouth. There is a small\narea under the left eye that has dried red matter on the fur.
