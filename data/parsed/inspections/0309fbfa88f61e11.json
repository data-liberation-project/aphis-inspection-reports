The gap was loosely filled with rocks.\n- On the creek side, behind the black bear Baloo\u2019s enclosure, there is a large hole spanning approximately 1/3 of the\nlength of the bottom section of the fence, about 2 to 3 feet in height above the water.\nThe chain link fence designated by the facility during inspection as the perimeter fence surrounding the outdoor\nenclosures for all the other animals, including non-human primates and other non-dangerous mammals, had the following\ndeficiencies:\n- Two flood gates, encompassing approximately the bottom 1/3 of the fence, were wedged open by overgrown vegetation\nalong the fencing closest to the road.\n- Behind the primate enclosures, on the side nearest the river, there is an approximately 2-foot- long, 1-foot-deep gap in\nthe bottom of the fence.\n- On the side behind the fox enclosure was an area of damaged fence approximately 6 feet in length, where the top of the\nfence had rolled down to approximately 5 feet in height.\n- The bottom of the fencing near the bird aviary housing macaws had a hole that roughly expanded 1-foot-deep and 1-\nfoot-wide.\n- The fence that crosses over the creek had many areas of vegetation overgrowth leaning on top and across the fence.\n- A perimeter fence gate located along the south side of the facility measured 52 inches (slighly more than 4 feet) in\nheight.\nDuring the exit briefing, the facility mentioned they were considering using some of the fencing immediately surrounding\nsome primary enclosures as perimeter fences. The following deficiencies were seen with these fences:\n- The fence surrounding the bobcat enclosure had areas that were 1 to 3 inches short of 6 feet.\n- The fence for most of the non-human primates, designated as the public barrier during inspection, had areas that were\nless than 6 feet in height. In addition, an approximate \u00bd foot deep, 2-foot-long gap was also seen at the bottom of a\nsection of this fence located between the non-human primate enclosures and the dangerous animal perimeter fence.\n- The fence surrounding the back section of the gibbon and brown lemur enclosures was approximately 4.5 feet high.\nThe lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn\u2019t an\nadequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures, or a sufficient barrier\nto keep animals and unauthorized persons out. In fact, on August 13th 2023, the Grizzly bear Anna loo escaped the\ndangerous animal\u2019s perimeter fence after a fallen tree allowed her to leave her primary enclosure. The facility believes the\nbear was able to escape the perimeter fence through a gate loosely closed by a chain.\nThe facility must ensure they maintain 8-foot-high perimeter fencing for dangerous animals, and 6-foot-high fencing for\nboth non-dangerous animals and non-human primates. Such fences must be at least 3 feet in distance from the primary\nenclosure for outdoor housed animals."

Per the original binder and the label, the big cats should be given \u00bd scoop of Cosequin daily. The facility has\nbeen giving 1 scoop.
