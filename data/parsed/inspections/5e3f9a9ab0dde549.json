According to documentation maintained by\nthe facility, this dog had been examined by a veterinarian and a dental had been recommended on November 29, 2022.\nHowever, according to the applicant, no follow up contact with a veterinarian to schedule an appointment for the dog\u2019s\ndental had been made since the veterinarian\u2019s examination and treatment recommendation last November. The abnormal\nbuild-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition could be\npainful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and could negatively impact the overall health of the animal. The\napplicant must communicate with a veterinarian regarding the dog\u2019s current dental condition in order to obtain an accurate\ndiagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
