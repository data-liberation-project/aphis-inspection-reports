The protocol states that pigs will be monitored every 15 minutes for an hour, every 30 minutes for 2 hours, every\nhour for 4 hours, and then every 4 hours until the following day. Pig #23340 became sternal after surgery at 1:35pm, was\nmonitored continuously until put back into its cage at 4pm, when it was regularly observed until approximately 8pm. He\nwas left unmonitored overnight until 5:30 the next morning.\nThe same protocol states that injectable Tacrolimus will be given IM daily following surgery. Due to pig #23340's behavior,\nthe PI submitted an amendment request to give the drug in capsules by mouth on May 15th, 2024. The amendment had\nnot yet been approved by the IACUC but they began giving the drug by mouth on the same day.\nAlthough there were no recorded post-operative complications or medical issues noted for the pig, the protocol was not\nfollowed as written and approved by the IACUC. Failure to follow the approved protocol and making unapproved changes\ndoes not allow the IACUC to review these changes as required and ensure the animals involved do not experience\nnegative impacts to their health and well-being. The IACUC must ensure that all significant changes regarding the care\nand use of animals in ongoing activities are reviewed and approved prior to implementation.\nCorrect by May 24, 2024 by ensuring that proposed activities, including significant changes to ongoing activities involving\nanimals, contain a complete and accurate description of the proposed use of the animals and are approved by the IACUC\nprior to starting activities or implementing any changes.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
