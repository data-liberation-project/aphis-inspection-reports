      "narrative": "Dog #4243, an adult brown and white beagle housed in room 124 was observed exhibiting a continuous circling\nbehavior to the left. It was not possible to assess this dog in the enclosure without the dog being aware of the\nobservation. However, facility husbandry personnel familiar with the dog stated they were able to observe the dog\nfor approximately an hour each day and the circling behavior was continuous. This repetitive behavior can have\nbehavioral or physical origins.\nThe medical record of this dog documented circling behavior in April 2012 and enhanced exercise enrichment was\nprovided. It was documented in May 2012 that the dog stopped the circling behavior when group-housed. No\nadditional entries were noted in the record regarding the behavior of this animal.\nThe dog was individually housed during this inspection and facility personnel stated there was no reason the animal\ncould not be grouped housed at this time. No records were available to determine the dogs housing status between\nMay 2012 and the present. This dog was placed in group housing prior to the end of the inspection.\nDog #4964, an adult female brown and white hound mix, was observed to have thickened pink skin with concurrent\nhair loss and small crusted lesions in both flank areas at the front of the rear legs. Multiple small red, circular raised\nlesions were visible on the abdomen in an area where the hair is naturally sparse.\nMedical records indicated that this dog had been diagnosed and treated for allergic dermatitis in September and\nOctober of 2014 and resolved with treatment. Facility personnel familiar with the previous dermatitis episode stated\nthat the skin symptoms now are not as severe as when treatment was first initiated but are worse than when the\nprior treatment was concluded.\nThe current behavioral and physical status of the above dogs should be communicated to and addressed\naccordingly by the attending veterinarrian. Problems related to animal health and behavior as observed by facility\npersonnel must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian accurately and as frequently as necessary to ensure\nadequate communication related to animal problems is maintained with the veterinarian. Appropriate\ncommunication is required to ensure adequate veterinary oversight when needed.\nCorrect by: January 23, 2015.\nThe inspection was conducted with management and various facility personnel. The exit interview was conducted\nwith management."
