Facility staff suspect a mountain lion gained\naccess to the sheep enclosure by going over both the perimeter fence (eight feet high) and the enclosure fence.\nFailure to maintain perimeter fencing at a sufficient height may allow animals or persons to enter or exit the facility\nand harm the regulated animals. All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed\nby a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out and so that it can\nfunction as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.\nA corrective plan detailing how the perimeter fence will be modified with a timeline for completion of the\nmodifications, must be made available to APHIS personnel when requested, by September 25, 2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
