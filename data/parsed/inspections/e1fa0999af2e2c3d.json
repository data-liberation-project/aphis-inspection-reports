The top and base of\nthe fence was damaged, creating sharp points that pointed upward and outward into the enclosure where the camel\ncould come into contact with it.\n***In an enclosure housing eleven sheep, a portion of the metal fencing material, along the bottom, was bowing out\nof the base of the pen. This has created a gap large enough for the animal's limbs, horns, or head to become stuck\nand therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.\n***In an enclosure housing seven goats a portion of the wire fencing was in disrepair. The lower edges of the metal\nfence was bent upward with sharp points protruding toward the animals that could cause injuries.\n***The enclosure housing eleven goats in the barn had rust along the lower parts of the metal walls, which extended\nup the wall at least 10 inches in height in some areas. The rusted metal exposed many areas of jagged, splintered\npieces of wood underneath. In the areas where the metal was rusted through, sharp metal edges were created and\npointed into the enclosure.\nAll enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in\norder to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to\nensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape."
