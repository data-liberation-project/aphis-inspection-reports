Pieces of ceiling/insulation have fallen and were observed caught on the top of the Tamarin enclosure,\nwithin reach of the animals. Loose pieces of insulation within reach of or in contact with the animals can be\ndetrimental to their health and well-being. Foreign objects in enclosures could lead to toxicity exposure or various\ngastrointestinal illnesses and/or injuries if ingested. The facility must ensure that housing facilities for nonhuman\nprimates be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates\nhoused in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. This was\ncorrected at the time of the inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and Justine O'Malley, VMO."
