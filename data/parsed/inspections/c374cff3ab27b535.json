The\nrationale given for these numbers in the proposal states: \"Although few animals were used under this protocol in the\npast year, it remains important to be able to supply blood and plasma upon request for the various research\nprograms at Portola. The numbers of animals cited in this protocol reflect the expected use in 1 year's time based\non previous years records.\" The protocol lists previous animal use numbers: 2017-2018: 0 guinea pigs and 0\nrabbits; 2016-2017: 0 guinea pigs and 6 rabbits; and 2015-2016: 0 guinea pigs and 2 rabbits. There is no\nexplanation as to how it was determined that they would need 36 rabbits and 75 guinea pigs per year.\nThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) should not approve a proposal to conduct an activity\ninvolving animals unless that proposal contains a rationale for the numbers of animals to be used. It is the role of\nthe IACUC to be thoughtful about requests to use animals for studies. Failure to ensure that the protocol contains a\nclear explanation for the number of animals requested could result in unnecessary acquisition and usage of\nanimals.\nTo be corrected from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
