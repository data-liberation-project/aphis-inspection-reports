Per animal observation records,\nweight loss removal criteria in the ferret kits was calculated using their weight at the start of the study, not to \"mock\nanimals\" as indicated in the IACUC approved protocol. Using the mock animal weight, as described in the approved\nprotocol, weight loss in the kits exceeded 20%, which was a criterion of early removal from the study. Had mock animal\nweights been used, the early removal criteria would have been met earlier in the protocol timeline.\nEarly removal criteria are used as humane endpoints to ensure that animal stress or discomfort is not prolonged. With\nrespect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall function to review and\napprove, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals. Deviations in an\nalready-accepted IACUC protocol without submitting an amendment prohibit the IACUC's ability to review changes and\nhow those changes may impact animals.

      "narrative": "Adequate veterinary care was not provided to 16 infantile ferrets during an interinstitutional collaboration study between\nthis research facility (INSTITUTION A) and a second research facility (INSTITUTION B). The collaborative study occurred\nwithin the high containment facility at INSTITUTION A and was performed by study team members from INSTITUTION B,\nusing a protocol approved by INSTITUTION A\u2019s IACUC. There was an interinstitutional collaboration involving studies\nperformed by study team members from INSTITUTION B to utilize the high containment facility at INSTITUTION A. All\nanimal care and observations were performed by study team members from INSTITUTION B. The study team from\nINSTITUTION B failed to provide supportive care to 16 infantile ferrets (kits) for protocol 2024A00000045. The\nINSTITUTION A Clinical Veterinarian was informed by the INSTITUTION B Study Director that the jills (female ferret\nmothers) were having decreased milk production. The communication dated October 9, 2024, shows the INSTITUTION A\nClinical veterinarian recommended using a milk replacer product to supplement the kits, and to ensure the kits were\ngaining weight. It was reported by the INSTITUTION B Study Director to the INSTITUTION A Clinical veterinarian that the\njills were still allowing the kits to nurse, that they did not meet the Early Removal Criteria of 20% weight loss, and no\nadditional care was provided to the kits. The INSTITUTION A Clinical Veterinarian followed up 48 hours later and was told\nthat the study was ended early. Review of study observation records from October 2024 show 3 kits belonging to jill\n#T6545 were noted to have \"significant weight loss\" at 10:51am on October 10, 2024, and one kit was found deceased\nlater that evening at 5:53 PM. The next morning (October 11, 2024) one kit from jill #T6545 was found deceased, and the\nlast remaining kit was euthanized. It was noted that jill #T6545 was also losing weight. \"Significant weight loss\" noted by\nINSTITUTION B study team members on October 10, 2024, was not communicated to the INSTITUTION A Clinical\nveterinarian.\nThis interinstitutional collaboration had another study begin on February 24, 2025, involving 3 jills: #84, #85, and #86, with\n5, 3, and 6 kits, respectively. All animal care and observations were performed by study team members from INSITUTION\nB. On March 2, 2025, at 11 am study observation records show 3 kits belonging to jill #84 were \"weak\". On the same day,\nat 4:30pm, 6 kits belonging to jill #86 were also noted to be \"weak\". The study records indicated \"no treatment, just\nobserved\". At 8:30am on March 3, 2025, the three remaining kits to jill #84 were found deceased. At 10 am the six kits\nbelonging to jill #86 were euthanized due to weight loss. At 3:30pm kits belonging to jill #85 were noted to be continuing to\nlose weight. Jill #85 was not producing milk and there was concern for the kits overnight. No supportive care was provided\nto the kits. On March 4, 2025, one kit from jill #85 was found deceased. The remaining two kits were weak and not\nresponsive and were euthanized. There was no communication with the INSTITUTION A Clinical veterinarian in reference\nto the arrival in the facility or subsequent condition of the ferrets in this February 2025 study. Further, Early Removal\nCriteria for ferrets in the protocol states that \"animals unresponsive to supportive care will be removed and euthanized\".\nSupportive care was not administered to these kits. There was no communication by the INSTITUTION B study team or\nDirector to the INSTITUTION A Clinical veterinarian, who learned of the death and euthanasia of the kits in late March\nwhile performing a review of records for the facility.\nImplementing methods stated in the protocol to prevent and treat disorders, such as supportive care, is one way a facility\ncan ensure adequate veterinary care is provided. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care can result in prolonged\nstress, pain, or distress to the affected animals. The facility must ensure that appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases and injuries are used.
