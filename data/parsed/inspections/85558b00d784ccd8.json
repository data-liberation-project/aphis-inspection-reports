The attendant was on the other side of the enclosure, often\ntaking a picture of the interaction. The sloth was located in the corner or floor of the enclosure, back hunched, facing the\nwall, and folding in on himself with his head tucked in on his chest. This demeanor may indicate a lack of interest or\ndistress from the interaction. With this set up, the sloth was unable to escape the interaction if he so desired.\n\u2022 An interaction with tigers occurred where patrons were allowed in an area approximately 3-4 feet wide located between\nan electrified fence and a secondary 10-foot chain link fence with a 2-foot kick in. The electric fence, the only barrier\nbetween the patrons and the tigers, was approximately 2.5 feet tall made of 3 electrified wires about 1 foot apart. The\ntigers, being of similar height as the fence, could possibly jump over it or reach the patrons through the gaps between or\nbelow the wires. In addition, pictures of the interaction shows patrons with their backs to the tigers making it difficult for\nthe patrons to monitor the tiger\u2019s behavior. The proximity to the tigers paired with an inadequate barrier made this an\nunsafe interaction.\n\u2022 Two incidents of animals biting members of the public occurred when, on two separate occasions, a bison and a zebra\nwere being fed by patrons without an attendant present. The bites occurred on fingers of the patrons drawing blood.\nBecause of inadequate barriers between animals and the public, injuries occurred to members of the public. With the\ncurrent design of the tiger and sloth interactions, injuries could result as well as undue stress on the animals due to the\nproximity of the patrons and the lack of adequate barriers. Any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to\nthe animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to\nassure the safety of animals and the public during exhibition and/or encounters.

      "narrative": "During inspection, some primary enclosures were found in need of repair while others were found to contain items that\nmay be injurious to the animals within:\n\u2022 The primary enclosure housing 3 tigers was made up of 2 fences:\n- A first fence, approximately 2.5 feet tall, was made of 3 electrified wires about 10-12 inches apart, held together by\nabout 3 feet tall cylindrical wooden poles evenly dispersed throughout the enclosure.\n- A second fence was an approximately 10 feet tall black chain link fence with about a 2-feet kick-in made up of two\nelectrified wires.\nSome of the wooden poles of the first fence have scratch marks but, one in particular, near the start of the public\nwalkway, had the most damage. The bottom quarter of the pole was, per the facility representative, chewed and\nscratched by a previously housed tiger all around the circumference, thinning it to almost half the diameter of the rest of\nthe pole. The structural integrity and therefore function of such a pole may be compromised.\nDue to some erosion, small gaps are forming below the black chain link fence, mainly in the area nearest the start of the\npublic walkway. In addition, on the side of the enclosure nearest the facility entrance, there is a thicket of tall trees\nbetween the first and second fence. The trees are protruding over and across the black chain link fence. The holes and\ntrees may provide the tigers sufficient means to escape by climbing over or digging beneath the fence.\n\u2022 In the lemur enclosure, one of the elevated bamboo branches, spanning the width of the enclosure towards the front,\nwas cracked throughout with larger gaps towards the center of the branch with a moderately caved in/flattened area\ntowards the highest end of the branch. This branch is not structurally sound to support the weight of a lemur.\n\u2022 In the enclosure housing 2 sloths, there was an exposed live electrical wire connected to a humidifier. Electrical wires\nmay present a health risk to animals that may chew or pull on them.\n\u2022 In the enclosure housing 2 zebras, there was a downed metal roof propped against a wooden fence and a wooden pole\nwith an exposed nail, remnants of a collapsed shelter. In the same enclosure, near the hay bale, the bottom horizontal rail\nof the 3-rail wooden fence, was cut all the way through on one side, with the remaining post leaning against the ground,\nthus creating a wider gap in the fence.\n\u2022 Furthermore, the enclosure containing 2 camels was undergoing extensive construction. There were large piles, about 5\nfeet high, of soil and rocks at the center and to the side of the enclosure, covering more than 50% of the enclosure. On\nthe side of the enclosure furthest from the camel barn, there was a pile of metal cattle gates in one area and in another,\nremnants of a platform composed of propped up large wooden poles with many exposed nails. On the side closest to the\nbarn, there were 2 parked tractors, some exposed and damaged wires, broken wooden pallets, as well as a pile of PVC\npipes. In front of the entrance to the barn, there was a more than 7-foot drop-off creating a cliff, spanning the entire length\nof the large barn, that the camels had to go around in order to go in and out of their shelter. Set ups such as these, as well\nas maintaining such items within enclosures, could result in injury to the animals within.\n\u2022 Small gaps are forming at the bottom of the fence of the hoofstock enclosure towards the far side of the facility. This\nenclosure is currently housing bison and cows, but previously also housed elk. Per a facility representative, coyotes have\nbeen seen within this enclosure and the facility believes that the coyotes chased the elk causing them to jump out of the\nenclosure. The representative explained that the elk were euthanized in order to prevent them from continuously getting\nout. Such an enclosure is not protecting or safely containing the animals within.\nDamaged primary enclosures as well as enclosures containing possibly injurious items, may negatively impact the health\nand comfort of the animals within. Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect\nthe animals from injury and to safely contain the animals."

In the case of the tiger and wolf enclosures, the facility had two\nfences in place; the first made up of electrified wire while the second was a black chain link fence. However, the first fence\nin both instances were not sufficient to truly contain the animals as a primary enclosure.\n- The first fence in the wolf enclosure was made up of a single electrified wire, approximately 2 to 3 feet from the\nground depending on the location. The wire was held up by approximately 4 feet tall thin plastic poles evenly dispersed\nthroughout the enclosure which were about 2 feet away from the second black chain link fence. The first fence alone\ncannot contain the wolves who could jump above or crawl below it and therefore is not a sufficient primary enclosure.\n- The first fence in the tiger enclosure, approximately 2.5 feet tall, was made of 3 electrified wires held together by\nabout 3 feet tall wooden cylindrical poles evenly dispersed throughout the enclosure. The first fence was at least 3 feet\naway from the second black chain link fence. The first fence was about the same height or even slightly shorter than the\ntigers contained within. This fence therefore is not a sufficient primary containment for the tigers that could jump above it.\nIn these two enclosures, the two fences together make up the primary enclosure, and there is no perimeter fence\nsurrounding them.\n\u2022 Furthermore, beneath the gate that is part of the non-human primate perimeter fence, as well as beneath the gate of the\nadult bears\u2019 perimeter fence, there is an approximately 1.5-foot gap which could allow animal passage.\nThe lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn\u2019t an\nadequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier\nto keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The facility must ensure that the above listed animals being housed\noutdoors are enclosed by a perimeter fence, 8-feet tall for dangerous animals and 6-feet tall for the non-human primates\nor shall obtain a variance from the regional office. The perimeter fence must be effective, continuous, and at least 3 feet in\ndistance from the primary enclosures."
