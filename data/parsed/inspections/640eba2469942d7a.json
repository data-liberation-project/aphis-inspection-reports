Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin\nwhich can be painful and has a high potential to causing skin irritations. In addition several of the dogs have long\nnails that need to be trimmed. Long nails can get caught in the wire mesh or curl under into the foot pad. Grooming\nand nail trims should be done on a routine basis to prevent these issues for the health and comfort of the dogs.\nSeveral of these dogs were the following:\n1.dog # 120 has matted fur around the face and anal region with feces trapped in the fur.\n2.dog # 2536506 a poodle has matted fur around his legs.\n3.dog # 072514278 male has matted fur behind the ears and has no teeth.\n4. dog # 88 Millie a sheba has long nails that need to be trimmed.\n*** One large breed dog: Duke #71 has some pressure sores developing on the back legs. These sores need to be\nassessed and a method of treatment developed for the comfort of the animal.\n*** Several of the dogs had teeth that were varying stages of dental disease. Many had tarter build up and some of\nthe dogs had receding gum lines and a few dogs had lost several teeth. The facility currently does not have a plan\nto address dental issues in these dogs. Bad teeth in dogs can cause health issues or be painful and there should be\na plan to treat and prevent dental disease for these animals.\nCorrect by: March 26, 2016"
