Also, the fur in the corner and under both eyes was discolored reddish-brown and wet. Portions of the skin\nwere visible through the wetted hair. The dog had recently been groomed; however, there were focal areas of\nmatted fur on top of the dog's rear feet, in the abdominal/inguinal region and surrounding the scrotum. There was a\nthick, yellowish-green, moist material noted on the fur in the dog's abdominal/inguinal region. On the dog's scrotum\nthere was an approximately 1/4 inch reddened lesion which may have resulted from the grooming, according to the\nlicensee.\n***There was a male Maltese (109*838*262) with a large amount of dark brown to black material noted in the left\near. This dark brown to black material was at the opening to the canal as well as in the fur surrounding the inside of\nthe ear. The dog also had some mats present at the corner of the right eye.\nEye discharge could be the result of infection, allergies, injury and/or other veterinary medical conditions.
