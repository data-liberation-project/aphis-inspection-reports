Records indicate that four out of the eight Yorkshire Terrier puppies born on 3/19/2023 died in close\nproximity to one another. The licensee stated that they had observed that this litter of puppies was nursing well, but were\nfailing to gain weight. The licensee stated that they felt it was an issue with the mother\u2019s milk so they gave Amoxicillin to\nthe mother, Rixy #02. There are no instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care or SOPs that instruct the licensee\nregarding the course of action when puppies that are failing to gain weight and the licensee did not report these findings\nto their Attending Veterinarian. Three puppies (#23-35, #23-36, and #23-37) died on 3/22/2023 and the fourth puppy\n(#23-34) died on 3/25/2023. The licensee also did not report the deaths of these puppies to the Attending veterinarian\neven after finding the first three puppies had died. Failure to communicate problems of animal health to the attending\nveterinarian can lead to mis-diagnosis and delays in providing proper care to animals resulting in worsening of their\ncondition and possibly additional deaths. Correct by ensuring that information about problems with animal health,\nbehavior, and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian directly in a timely manner. Correct by May 2, 2023."
