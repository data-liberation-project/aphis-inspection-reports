She placed the fox on the ground of the room and hung the\npouch that contained the 8 month old male kangaroo on the wall. She then left the animals unattended for approximately\n5 minutes. Upon her return, there was blood on the fennec fox\u2019s face and the kangaroo\u2019s ears were injured and bleeding.\nThe licensee then obtained veterinary care for the kangaroo and, during this inspection, it was observed that the ears had\nhealed with sections missing, scaring and damage as a result of this encounter. This includes a left ear containing a small\n\u00bc cm long section missing and a right ear missing the top 1/4 of the ear and three \u00bd-1 cm long cuts into the ear. Lack of\nadequate conditions while the animals were on exhibit resulted in injury of the kangaroo. Animals that are exhibited\ntogether must be maintained in adequate conditions to include compatibility and sufficient supervision.\nCorrective actions were implemented prior to this inspection on: 12/20/2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
