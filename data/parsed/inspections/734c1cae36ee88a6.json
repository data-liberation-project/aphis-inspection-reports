The sheep interaction area is closest to the parking lot and there were no attendants or\nemployees present.\nWhile the employee was stationed at a booth directly in front of the primary camel enclosure/interaction area, there\nwere two additional camel enclosures where the attendant could not visually monitor the animal-human interactions.\nThe mom and younger camel were visually blocked from the attendant by a shelter structure, and three camels\nwere in an adjacent pen where the interaction area was slightly downhill and blocked by rocks.\nLack of employee oversight of direct interactions between the animals and the visitors may lead to injury to the\nhumans and/or injury or distress to the animals. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or\nattendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.\nCorrected during inspection by the facility owner as soon as the need for attendants was identified by the inspector\nby closing off the camel area and moving the attendant to the sheep area.\nThe focused inspection on animal handling during public exhibition and exit interview were conducted with the\nfacility owner."
