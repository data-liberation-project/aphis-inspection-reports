The river otter exhibit is constructed of a\ncement wall that varies in height due to the topography of the land that it is on. On the back side of the exhibit it is\napproximately 4' high. There is also an approximately 2' tall chain link fence secured to the top of the wall. However,\nthere are no other precautions present to keep the public from gaining access into the exhibit. This chain link\nsection, on the wall, is not of sufficient height to assure the safety of the animal. A correction date of October 1,\n2017 was given. However, the facility owners have not addressed this exhibit. The situation remains the same. The\nheight of the exhibit wall is not sufficient to ensure the safety of the otter. This will need to be addressed."

The concrete was severely cracked along the water line of this pool.\nThere was also a leaking water line within the wall that may be undermining the integrity of this wall. At the time of\nthis inspection (11/30/17) the repairs had just been started that morning to fix the leaking water line. However the\nrepairs were not finished by the time I left the property. Again, this facility was given until October 1, 2017 to\naddress the exhibit. However, the owners of the property have not completely addressed the issue.
