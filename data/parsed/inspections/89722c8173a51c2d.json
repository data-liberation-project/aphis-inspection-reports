The underlying skin in these areas is pigmented, typical for the species and there is no obvious\nsign of redness. There is no crusting of the skin or obvious signs of scratching and the animal was not observed\nhair plucking during inspection. The primates condition has not changed since the last inspection and the licensee\nstated that the monkey was not currently receiving any treatment for this or any other medical condition. The new\nattending veterinarian did not recommend diagnostics or treatment but there was no documentation at the facility\nregarding the hair loss and no record of the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding this animal or the hair loss.\nWhile the condition has not worsened, it also has not improved and may require further diagnostic work. Any\nrecommendations by the veterinarian must be written and maintained by the facility to assure that the\nrecommendations are followed. Correct by having this animal re-examined by a licensed veterinarian and following\nall recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Additionally the licensee shall maintain record of this\nexamination, the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations, and any treatments for future evaluation by APHIS Officials upon\nrequest.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility Director."
