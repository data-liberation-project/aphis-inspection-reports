Protocol #47056 stated that\n\"(cid:28)No items were found for either key word search\".(cid:29) A search yielding low numbers of articles indicates a strong\nlikelihood that the terms used were to restrictive. In both Protocols the Pl used qualifiers that would limit the\nusefulness of the search. The principal investigator must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more\nthan momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and provide a written narrative description of the methods\nand sources, used to determine that alternatives were not available. Alternatives that would: Reduce, Refine, and/or\nReplace the procedures performed on animals will lessen the overall pain and distress.\nAn exit interview was conducted with the facility Attending Veterinarian."
