Excess equipment and\nsupplies are filling one side of the animal room.\nThe licensee has removed some of the animal equipment that was present in front of the hedgehog building;\nhowever, many items still remain. There is no organization of these materials, and the majority are being kept in\nunsanitary conditions and could potentially contribute to disease hazards within the facility.\nAccumulated bedding and fecal material on the floor contribute to odor and make it difficult to maintain adequate\npest control. Excess equipment and clutter make the animal room difficult to clean and sanitize, and accumulated\ncaging and other equipment preclude adequate pest control on the premises.\nThe floors and walls of the animal housing room must be cleaned, and clutter and debris removed from the room.\nThe licensee must also ensure that any unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property, and\nthat the premises are kept clean in order to minimize odor and pests. Additionally, useful items must be properly\ncleaned, organized and stored so that all areas of the facility, especially the animal housing room, are kept clean\nand free of accumulation of materials in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices.\nThe facility was previously cited under this regulation on 7/18/16, 9/11/17, 12/11/17, 3/14/18, 2/19/19 and 6/13/19.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative."
