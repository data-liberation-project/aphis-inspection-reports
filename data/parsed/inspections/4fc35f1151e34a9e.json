The injured macaque was\npromptly evaluated by the clinical veterinarian and underwent surgery to repair the wounds. The macaque healed\nwell from the injuries, and none of the other NHPs in the room were injured. It was determined that the NHP was\nable to escape from its primary enclosure because personnel had failed to secure the side door of the enclosure\nfollowing cage change earlier in the day.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain\nthe non-human primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.\nThe research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the event to\nOLAW, and implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent recurrence including hands-on retraining of all\nanimal caretakers on the proper cage change procedure and the proper method of securing all of the locking\nmechanisms of the enclosures. No additional incidents have occurred.\nThis item has been appropriately addressed by the research facility and it has been corrected.\nNOTE - Inspection conducted 9/12/16 and 9/13/16. Exit interview held 9/13/16 on-site with facility representatives.\n*END OF REPORT*"
