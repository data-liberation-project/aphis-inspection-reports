Critical item: In June 2024 two 13-lined ground squirrels sustained degloving injuries to their tails, which this species is\npredisposed to, during cage change that resulted in amputation of the distal part of their tails. The animals had arrived at\nthe facility less than one week prior. Technicians were following the standard operating procedure used with this species\nfor cage changes that minimizes direct handling of these fast-moving and jumpy small sized rodents. A PVC tube is used\nto scoop the animal inside one end, technician blocks the open ends of the tube with their hands, and the tube containing\nthe squirrel is then placed in the new cage. The tail of one animal was injured when it became caught between the edge\nof the tube and the hand of the technician and the tail of the second animal was injured when the technician grasped the\nlower body and part of its tail when it suddenly tried to escape. In each instance, technicians immediately contacted\nveterinary staff who examined and treated the animals. Both squirrels recovered uneventfully.\nPer this Section, the handling of animals by all personnel should be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The two squirrels sustained degloving injuries to\ntheir tail during handling for cage change that subsequently resulted in tail amputation. The research facility addressed\nthis incident prior to the inspection by refresher training in husbandry and handling practices. No additional incidents have\noccurred.

Non-critical item: On the morning of 5/18/24 facility personnel found one marmoset was outside its enclosure on the top\nof another enclosure and was observed fighting with the two marmosets that were inside that enclosure. The loose\nmarmoset was caught and returned to its enclosure. The lower lift door of its enclosure was open, and it was determined\nthat the door had not been secured by personnel.
