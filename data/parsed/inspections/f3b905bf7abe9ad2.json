These include:\n1. A adult guinea pig (mostly brown with some white spots) had an area of wet fur over the left side of its face and\nneck. The affected area is approximately 1.5 x 2.5\". The underlying skin is moist, exudative, and irregular in\nappearance. This condition had not been identified by the licensee prior to inspection. The lesion may represent an\ninfectious disease or injury, and a veterinarian must be consulted to provide appropriate veterinary\nrecommendations and care.\n2. Two animals, one tricolor young adult located in the top enclosure of the last row and one adult brown and white\nsow in pen 38, were identified with crusting around their left eyes. These animals had not been identified by the\nlicensee prior to inspection. The Program of Veterinary Care outlines a treatment plan for this condition. Treatment\nmust be initiated according to the Program of Veterinary Care or the veterinarian must be consulted.\n3. A total of 24 animals were identified with swellings under their chins. These animals had been identified by the\nlicensee prior to inspection. A treatment plan for this condition is described in the facility's Program of Veterinary\nCare, but this plan had not been initiated by the licensee. A description of a representative sample of these animals\nis presented below. When problems of animal health are identified, the licensee must initiate treatment according to\nthe guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the veterinarian for guidance.\n(a) In Pen 3, a brown and black adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 1\" in diameter under its chin.\n(b) In Pen 3, a tricolor adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 1.5\" in diameter under its chin\n(c) In Pen 7, an adult sow, mostly grey with a white blaze, has a firm swelling approximately 2\" in diameter under\nits chin. There is some regions of hair loss over the swelling and there is a red area of disrupted skin approximately\n1/4\" in diameter, consistent with a wound or draining tract, over the swelling.\n(d) In Pen 7, an adult sow, mostly brown with a white blaze, has a swelling approximately 1.5\" in diameter under\nits chin.\n(e) In Pen 14, a brown and white adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 1\" in diameter under its chin.\n(f) In Pen 15, an adult guinea pig, mostly white with grey, has a swelling approximately 1.5\" in diameter under its\nchin.\n(g) In Pen 16, an adult guinea pig, mostly white with brown, has a swelling approximately 2\" in diameter under its\nchin. This swelling is asymmetrical and larger on the right side of the animal.\n(h) In Pen 19, a tricolor adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 2\" in diameter under its chin. This swelling\nextends almost to the floor of the enclosure.\n(i) In Pen 22, a white adult guinea pig has a firm swelling approximately 3\" in diameter under its chin. This\nswelling extends up behind the jaw bilaterally.\n(j) In Pen 45, a tricolor adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 2\" in diameter under its chin. There is\npatchy hair loss over the swelling.\nDaily observation to assess the health and well being of the animals must be conducted to identify health issues.\nAny health problems that are identified must be treated according to the guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care\nor the veterinarian must be contacted to provide guidance. Direct and frequent communication with the attending\nveterinarian is required to convey problems of animal health and to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary\ncare.\nTo be corrected by June 5, 2019."

This corrosion and rust has resulted in rough surfaces that are difficult to sanitize and sharp, jagged\nmetal edges that present a risk of injury to the animals.\n2. In Pen 42, a row of wires on the wire mesh front panel has broken. The sharp, broken ends of the wires are bent\nsuch that they protrude into the enclosure. These wire ends present a risk of injury to the animals in this enclosure.\n3. The bottom pen in the first rack of the last row is missing a piece that secures the door panels of the enclosure.\nThese front panels therefore are not held closed, leaving a 2-3\" gap between the panels. Furthermore, one of the\npanels, which holds the feeder, is freely movable by the animals in the enclosure. It was seen to be pushed further\nopen by the guinea pigs at the time of inspection, which increased the distance between the enclosure floor and the\navailable food. This may prevent smaller animals from accessing food, while the unsecured panel presents a risk of\ncrushing injury or entrapment to the guinea pigs in the enclosure.\nPrimary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The\nfeeders should be evaluated for safety and repaired or replaced as needed. Broken wire mesh should be repaired,\nmodified, or replaced to prevent the guinea pigs having access to sharp wire ends. The broken enclosure door\npanels should be repaired or replaced to protect the animals.\nTo be corrected by June 30, 2019."
