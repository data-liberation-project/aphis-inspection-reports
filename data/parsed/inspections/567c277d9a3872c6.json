A female Yorkshire pig was observed to have a circular mass, approximately 1 and 1/2 inch in diameter,\nlocated below her right eye. A second female Yorkshire pig had a \u00bd inch diameter open and reddened wound on her\nupper left rear leg, right above the knee. This pig also had an \u00bd inch diameter dark red to black bruise at the same\nlocation above the knee on her right rear leg. For both of these conditions, the attending veterinarian had not been\nconsulted. Medical care that is not being done per a veterinarian\u2019s instructions can result in inappropriate methods to\ndiagnose and treat conditions such as these.
