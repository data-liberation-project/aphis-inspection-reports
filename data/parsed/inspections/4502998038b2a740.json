The Program of Vet Care prescribes for camelids\nand bovine species to be tested for Tuberculosis (TB) annually. There are no records indicating testing in the past year\nand the licensee also states that it has not been done. Tuberculosis is a contagious disease of mammals, including\nhumans. Close contact with an infected animal is necessary for transmission. It is characterized as a slowly progressive\ndisease with a long incubation period. Annual testing, as stated in the Program of Vet Care, is the most accurate way to\nmonitor a herd for TB. To correct, the licensee must follow the prescribed Program of Vet Care, by testing annually for TB,\nto utilize the most appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by: October 9, 2023\nA red and white male goat has overgrown hind hooves. The right and left hind outside (lateral) claws are too long and are\ncurving upward. The facility representative states this goat\u2019s hooves grow quickly and almost always needs them done\nmonthly but isn\u2019t sure if he was done last month or not. Overgrown hooves can cause issues with ambulation which can\nlead to tendon and muscle strain. Overgrown hooves may get caught on housing structures or vegetation, thus leading to\ninjury. Additionally, overgrown hooves are more prone to infection. The facility must ensure that appropriate methods are\nbeing used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by establishing and maintaining a regular foot care\nmaintenance program, along with records of animal identification, to ensure individual animals are receiving regular hoof\ncare.
