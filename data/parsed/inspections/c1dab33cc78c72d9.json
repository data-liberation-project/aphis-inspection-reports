The area of the floor around the enclosures was\nvisibly wet with wet shavings present outside the enclosures. The entire bodies/haircoats of the two guinea pigs in\none of the enclosures (#46) were observed to be soaking wet including their backs. The guinea pigs were not able\nto find any dry shavings to sit on. The inspector informed the warm room attendant who had the owner add dry\nbedding. On the morning of 11/9/18 the inspector again noted that all the shavings in the enclosure housing 2\nguinea pigs (#46) were completely wet and that half the shavings in the other two guinea pig enclosures were\nsoaking wet. Wet bedding can no longer absorb and cover excreta and can cause the animal distress. Guinea pig\nenclosures must contain clean litter. Correct from this day forward."

The enclosure was picked up, righted and replaced on a shelf (approximately 3 feet\nabove the floor) holding hedgehog enclosures. It was observed that due to the large number of enclosures and\nlimited shelf space that hedgehog enclosures on several shelves were stacked such that the enclosures extended\n1-3 inches past the edge of the shelf. This would make it more likely for an enclosures to fall if brushed by a person\nwalking through the narrow walkways or even if the animal itself shifted too much weight to the portion of the\nenclosure overhanging the edge of the shelf. A fall may lead to distress, injury or escape if the enclosure were\ndamaged during the fall. All primary enclosures used to transport live animals shall not be stacked in a manner\nwhich may reasonably be expected to result in their falling.
