The equipment on site for use for\nventilatory support by the facility when the veterinarian is not present include a face mask, ambulatory bag, and oxygen\ntank.\nSuccinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this drug\nfor routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered distressful to\nthe animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug can also paralyze\nrespiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated they can die of\nsuffocation while they remain conscious. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which\nare able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia. Because of\ntheir distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or neuromuscular-\nblocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of general anesthesia and\nrespiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.\nThe licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care as\nrequired by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and is likely\nto result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your attending veterinarian\nto identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides adequate care for all species\nbeing handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of administration of each drug for each\nspecies if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer.
