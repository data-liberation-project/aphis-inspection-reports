Vaccines were last given on May 24, 2023, and were due again on May 24,\n2024.\nAdditionally, the facility is overdue for the yearly testing of intestinal parasites, as prescribed by the PVC. The last\nintestinal parasite tests were performed in February 2023, and were due again in February 2024.\nFailure to follow the PVC leaves the dogs susceptible to intestinal parasites, distemper, parvovirus, and rabies. If\ncontracted, these disorders will cause pain, distress, and possible suffering. Intestinal parasites can be passed through\nthe placenta, through nursing, or from oral ingestion from contaminated surfaces. Vaccinations are important in dogs that\nwill become pregnant because they will pass immunity from the vaccines onto their offspring. It is also important for dogs\nto be vaccinated since rabies is a disease that can infect humans. Correct by administering all of the vaccines required by\nthe Animal Welfare Act (distemper, parvovirus, and rabies), and performing intestinal parasite testing in accordance with a\nschedule approved by the Attending Veterinarian and vaccine manufacturer recommendations.
