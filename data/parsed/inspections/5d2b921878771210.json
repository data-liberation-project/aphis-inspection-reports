Use of a loose tarp, and the method in which it was attached to the\ndoor led to injury and death of the kangaroo.\nUpon arrival a black pygmy goat was seen easily going though a hole in the 6\" X 6\" wire fence along the drive.\nLater two black pygmy goats were seen going through the hole. The fence needs to be repaired to where the\nanimals are always contained.\nAll facility structures are to be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to protect animals from\ninjury and to contain the animals.
