Rabbit #836 has one area of hairloss\nabout 1inx1/2 in in size on the bridge of its nose with the skin appearing reddened. Rabbit #832 has two irregularly\nshaped areas of hairloss on the lower bridge of the nose and over the left nares with hair thinning between the left eye\nand nares. The skin appears reddened. These two rabbits have not been evaluated by a veterinarian. A review of the\nattending veterinarian\u2019s written medical plan dated July, 28 2023 for rabbit #733, which was identified with hairloss during\nthe last inspection, shows that the attending veterinarian recommended that all rabbits be given Revolution monthly. A\nconversation with animal care staff determined that Revolution has not been administered monthly as they did not have\nany Revolution available to apply. Medical records reviewed for the rabbits with hairloss did not note any application of\nRevolution. Adequate veterinary care including the use of appropriate methods to diagnose and treat diseases and\ninjuries including following the treatment plan of the veterinarian is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the\nanimals.\nRabbits #832 and836 need to be evaluated by a veterinarian and all veterinary treatment plans must be followed. The\nfacility shall ensure the availability of adequate veterinary care to include the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries."
