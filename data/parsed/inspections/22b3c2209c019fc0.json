The wolves walk on this wire to access water. The licensee stated that when the trough water\nover flows during watering the run off clears away the dirt exposing the wire fencing. The wolves could potentially\ncatch a paw or hang a toenail injuring themselves when walking across it. Also in the adjacent enclosure, containing\nfour arctic wolves, there was an area along the fence line where the water run off has exposed the buried wire\nfencing. These wolves could injure themselves when running the fence line. The wire fencing needs to be covered\nto prevent the wolves from injuring themselves. Correct by January 26, 2016\nThe inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee."
