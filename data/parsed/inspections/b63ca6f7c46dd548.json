In the\noriginal approved protocol(cid:25)'s description of how the animal numbers requested were calculated there is no mention\nof hamsters or hamster numbers. On the renewal form, which also requests 70 hamsters, under \"How was this\nnumber of animals determined\" it states: \"By considering power analyses and genetic characteristics\", but these\nanalyses or further info is not provided. It is uncertain why 70 hamsters are needed, or why this number was\napproved. Additional documentation provided by the facility also mentions power analyses used to determine the\nneed, but does not include any such calculations to explain how the hamster numbers were generated.\nProtocol # 9677 was approved for 300 gerbils per year. In the description of how the animal numbers requested\nwere calculated there is a reference to a \"Table of Animal Usage\". The facility provided this document, and it\nexplains that there are three stages to the study that each call for 100 gerbils, but there is not an explanation as to\nwhy 100 gerbils are needed. In the renewal document, under \"How were the animal numbers determined?\" it says\nthat the numbers were based on last year(cid:25)'s animal usage (which was 0 gerbils) and refers to the aforementioned\n\"Table of Animal Usage\".\nFailure to provide a rationale for animal numbers requested for use could result in unnecessary use of animals. The\nIACUC should ensure that the investigator has provided a clear, adequate rationale for the number of animals\nrequested.\nTo be corrected by 6/1/16 in these two protocols, and in all approved protocols by the time of the next routine\ninspection."
