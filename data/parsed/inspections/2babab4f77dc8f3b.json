The facility sent\nthe attending veterinarian (AV) a text message on June 20, 2024, to notify him of the injuries and stated that they were\napplying antibiotic spray and giving a dose of Metacam. There was no indication of response by the AV to this text. These\ntreatments were administered without direction from the AV and there is no guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care.\nThe capuchins were not examined by the AV until June 23, 2024. Regarding \u201cGolden Child,\u201d the AV directed the facility to\n\u201ctake to [consulting veterinarian] ASAP for examination and debridement.\u201d The AV also directed the administration of\nClavamox BID, Metacam SID and to continue Gabapentin. According to facility records, there is no documentation that\nClavamox or Metacam were given. When asked why only Gabapentin was recorded, the facility stated that the animal did\nnot receive Clavamox or Metacam due to a staff error. According to the consulting veterinarian, the animal was only seen\nby him on June 27, 2024, for euthanasia after \u201cGolden Child\u201d had become moribund. In the communication between the\nfacility and the consulting veterinarian on the morning of June 27, 2024, the facility states that, \u201cGolden Child was pulled\nlast night because he was found stiff and inactive in his enclosure,\u201d and that they couldn\u2019t reach the AV. The necropsy\nreport from June 29, 2024, states, \u201cright distal leg: cellulitis, foul smelling, devitalized, pus from wound, muscle is dark and\ndiscolored, got septic from wound\u201d and \u201ccause of death: cellulitis secondary to bite wound on right lower leg, cellulitis,\nsepsis.\u201d\nLack of appropriate veterinary care and not following the instructions of the attending veterinarian can lead to the\nprolonged suffering of animals and even death. The facility must give medications and follow treatment plans as directed\nby the attending veterinarian. The facility must ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries, and ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care."
