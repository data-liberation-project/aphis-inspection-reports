There is a thick, creamy, white/yellow discharge coating the underlying tissues. The Licensee\nstated that he noticed the issue on 10/2/2018 and started treating with Dermajell. This product was prescribed to\nthe Licensee for another animal with a past issue (no diagnosis or reason for treatment was listed on the\nprescription). In addition, there was no written guidance in the Program of Veterinarian Care for the use of Dermajell\nor how to treat lesions of this size.
