      "narrative": "The 10/24/2019 meeting minutes described an incident where a Rhesus Macaque escaped from his enrichment cage into\nthe main animal room. The room was composed of 6 cages housing other Rhesus Macaques. The escaped animal bit the\nfinger of another through the cage door resulting in a fractured digit. The bitten animal was anesthetized, and the digit was\namputated. Following surgery and treatment, the animal healed without complications. The escaped macaque voluntarily\nreturned to its home cage and was found to only have minor abrasions that did not warrant treatment. Upon further\ninvestigation, the facility found all latches and locks to be functional, therefore concluding that the exterior latch on the\nenrichment cage might not have been fully engaged allowing the animal to force it open. The inappropriate containment\nwithin the enrichment cage did not allow for safe handling of the animal and further resulted in serious injury to another.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm.\nThis item was corrected prior to this inspection. Corrective actions and preventative measures were implemented."
