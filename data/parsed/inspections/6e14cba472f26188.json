      "narrative": "An expired (September 2022) bottle of Safeguard dewormer was being used to treat the cats for internal parasites.\nUsage of expired medication can lower the efficacy of said drug, prevent treatment, and prolong illness.\nThere was a female adult Asian Leopard cat (microchip ID #: 933000320250935) in the cattery that was displaying ocular\nissues in the left eye, where she was squinting, had a moderate amount of clear discharge, showed sensitivity to light,\nand there was an accumulation of black crust about a quarter of an inch below the eye. The licensee was unaware of her\ncondition. There was also an enclosure housing three Bengal kittens in the living room of the home where one of the\nkittens had diarrhea (the color and consistency of melted chocolate), another had a slightly rounder abdomen than\nnormal, and the other had a thin body condition (body condition score was 2.5/9 \u2013 including sunken flanks; prominent\nspinal processes, shoulder blades, and hip bones; and a mild distended abdomen; microchip #: 985141005230533)\ndespite a seemingly healthy appetite, that the licensee was aware of but had yet to address with her Attending\nVeterinarian (AV). Lack of an adequate assessment of the health and well-being of the animals delay the onset of\ndiagnosing and treating ailments and can consequently lead to unnecessary suffering.\nEach dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. In addition, all four cats need to be examined by a\nveterinarian.\nCorrect by: January 5, 2023"
