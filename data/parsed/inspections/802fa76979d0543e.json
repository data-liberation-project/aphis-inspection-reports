An internal investigation revealed that the failure to transfer the animals from the holding protocol to ACUP #24-10-\n030B prior to the initiation of the study was the result of an administrative oversight. Corrective actions were implemented\nwhere the standard operating procedures were updated, Study Director was assigned the responsibility of transferring\nanimals to the correct ACUP before any study procedures commenced, and the study technician training was updated to\ninclude verification of both animals identification and the ACUP number prior to any procedure to ensure that each animal\nis on the correct ACUP. It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research\ntechnicians, animal technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform\ntheir duties.

      "narrative": "On September 19, 2024, the technical staff were working in the animal room housing NHPs, including Cynomolgus\nmacaque 20019, until approximately 1330 when they left the room after completion of the protocol driven activities. At this\ntime, all animals were behaving normally and no problems were noted by the staff in the room. At 1413, a technician\ndiscovered Subject 4M 20019 with its collar, which is required due to protocol required chair restraint, lodged into a space\nbetween the upper and lower cages. Technical staff immediately freed animal 20019 and called veterinary staff who\nresponded immediately. Veterinary staff quickly determined that animal 20019 was deceased and time of death was\nestimated to have occurred within 5-15 minutes prior due to absence of rigor, warm body temperatures and the presence\nof moist mucous membranes. The rack enclosure was in proper working order and was being used according to factory\ndesign. However, the vertical divider was open to allow for vertical socialization that left a gap that normally holds the pan\nwhen the vertical divider is closed. It was here that this animal was small enough to get into the space between the upper\nand lower cages which would normally house the waste pan for the upper cage and allowed for the animal to become\nentrapped because of its collar. This animal\u2019s equipment made it necessary for the enclosure to be modified to keep the\nanimal safe and the facility failed to do so. Corrective action developed after this incident included all vertical partitions in\nthis style of cage were closed (elimination access to the space between the upper and lower cages), removal of all\ncollars, enhanced monitoring and revised socialization practices. When enclosures are not constructed or maintained to\nprotect the nonhuman primates from injury, injuries can occur and increase the probability for stress, discomfort,\ndeveloping health issues, or even death. Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed so that they protect the\nnonhuman primates from injury. Corrections were made prior to the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian and facility representatives.\nn"
