This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the teeth and extended into the gum-line. The\ngums had receded along some of these teeth and a creamy, grey to white material was noted along the gum line of\nsome of these teeth. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth\nstructures. This can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall\nhealth of the animal. The licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the\noverall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility.\nA female Boston Terrier # 4C13036D22 had areas of hair loss, with small reddened skin lesions within these areas,\non the front of both front legs just above and just below the joints above the feet. The skin in these areas appeared\nflaky and pinkish red and each had a few pin head sized reddish skin lesions and/or brown scab-like skin lesions.\nThese areas of hair loss and skin lesions could be the result of injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition\nwhich could negatively affect the health of the animal and/or may be uncomfortable. According to the licensee,\nneither of these dogs had been seen by a veterinarian nor were they being treated for these current conditions.\nThe licensee must have these dogs seen by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are\nmade and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must document this\ninformation and make it available to the inspector upon request. All dogs must receive adequate veterinary care at\nall times."
