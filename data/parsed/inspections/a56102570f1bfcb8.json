Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase\nthe risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed and establish an appropriate grooming\nschedule for all dogs.\nThis dog also had excessively long toenails. Excessive long nails can potentially cause pain and distress and can\nbe an injury hazard should they get caught in the flooring. The licensee must trim the toenails. The toenails were\naddressed at the time of inspection. A program of toenail maintenance must be established to prevent long toenails.\nThis dog was observed excessively scratching and rubbing against the wire divider. Along the back of the dog there\nwas areas of missing hair and penny sized raised- reddened spots. There was areas of slight scabbing in the area\nmissing fur. These sores could be the result of an injury, infection, or other veterinary medical condition which may\nbe painful.\nA male shih-tzu ( 020-353-084) had a lesion on the left shoulder.
