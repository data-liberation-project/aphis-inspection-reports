The facility reports that a\nbarrier/safety panel was not erected according to protocol in time to prevent the animals from climbing on the exhibit\nisland while the water level was low. The animals fell from the island into water at a level too low to protect the\nanimals from injury. The female died on 22 May 2016 and the male died on 13 May 2016, both of apparent\ncomplications from the fall. Failure to follow established protocols can result in injury to animals. The facility must\nensure that handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
