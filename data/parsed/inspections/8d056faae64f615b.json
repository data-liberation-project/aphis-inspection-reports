      "narrative": "*On Nov. 30, 2021, a male Cynomolgus macaque (~1.5-2 kg), a stock animal, was found dead in a slide style restraint\nchair while out for a routine cage change/sanitization. It was the second time these primates had been placed in restraint\nchairs. Also, during this restraint period, there was a female that had to be removed from the chair due to not acclimating\nwell to the restraint and was placed into a slide and clip style chair with no further issues. Prior to this date, it was noted\nthat a male had to be removed due to not acclimating well to the restraint and was placed into a slide and clip style chair\nwith no further issues. He was persistently trying to escape from the chair and appeared to be compromising his\nrespirations in the attempt. There were two (2) technicians present during the routine cage change/sanitization, one\nprimarily observing the primates in the chairs and the other cleaning/sanitizing the animal room.\n*On March 10, 2022, a male Cynomolgus macaque (~1.5 kg), a stock animal, was found unresponsive in a restraint chair\nduring an animal room sanitization. He was removed from the chair and the veterinary staff was immediately notified.\nUpon veterinary exam, no respiratory effort or pulse was noted, and he was pronounced dead. It was the second time he\nhad been placed in a restraint chair which was equipped with a slide style top. Shortly after this incident on the same day,\na second primate began to show signs of distress in a slide style restraint chair, and he was immediately removed from\nthe chair and given oxygen before recovering. There were at least three (3) technicians in very close proximity. Mitigation\nefforts were planned to modify the chairs in this building to restrain the collar only but were delayed due to a shortage of\nhardware. Approximately 50% of the chairs had already been modified and the remaining were modified by the end of the\nday.\nThe previous style of the primate restraint chairs (slide style), in combination with the primate collars and size of the\nprimates available, did not adequately protect the animals from injury during handling.\n*On Dec. 7, 2021, a male pig (5M024, repeat dose toxicity study) was evaluated due to lameness that had persisted since\nDec. 6, following a toxicokinetic blood collection, during which manual restraint was used. Upon palpation of the right\ndistal hind limb, the Attending Veterinarian noted swelling and crepitus, as well as a likely fracture of the mid-tibia. Deep\npalpation, further diagnostics and treatment were not performed due to the scheduled necropsy of this animal on that day.\nEuthanasia and necropsy occurred after the examination (on Dec. 7). Necropsy revealed fractures in both the tibia and\nfibula.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrective actions already taken for the primates: the restraint chairs have been modified, additional monitoring has been\ninstigated and there is a plan to review and implement an acclimation process.\nCorrect by further evaluating handling techniques and devices, conduct appropriate training or re-training as needed, and\nevaluate methods of monitoring, to include the importance of proper care and monitoring of all animals."
