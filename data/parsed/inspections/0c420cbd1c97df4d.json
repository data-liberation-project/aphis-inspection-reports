The licensee reported that the nilgai had been under\nveterinary care for being thin prior to dying. The adult dog had given birth to one puppy and then died overnight. The rest\nof the deaths were reported to be sudden with animals found dead in the morning. No veterinary exams or necropsies\nwere performed to determine cause of death. No follow-up veterinary care or diagnostics were reported for any cohoused\nanimals. The facility representative reported that they believed that the one audad, one goat, and one African crowned\ncrane had run into fences and broken their necks.\nThe death of seven animals in three months, six of which were not under veterinary care prior to their death, or evaluation\nafter their deaths, indicates that there is not a robust program in place to determine the cause of unknown deaths and\nmay indicate an underlining herd health or other husbandry problem. Since the cause of death was not determined for the\nanimals in question, there is a potential for disease or facility conditions that could affect other animals at the facility.\nA facility must have a program of veterinary care in place that uses appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,\nand treat diseases and injuries."
