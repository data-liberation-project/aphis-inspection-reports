He trimmed one of those rabbit\u2019s nails but is waiting for the attending veterinarian to trim the rest of their\nnails on 8-June-2023. He trimmed an additional rabbit\u2019s nails during this inspection. Excessively long toenails can break\nand cause injury as well as affect the animal\u2019s gait when walking. Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee must trim all the rabbits\u2019 nails and create an appropriate\nplan to ensure the nails are kept at a proper length.\nThe licensee failed to have the black and white, adult, male rabbit with nasal discharge and sneezing evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian by the correction date of 26-March-2023. The inspector asked what the veterinarian had prescribed\nfor this rabbit, the licensee showed a container of TC Vet with directions stating \"use as directed\". No other\ndocumentation of the rabbit being evaluated so the inspector called the attending veterinarian, whom stated he had not\nseen the rabbit. The licensee only spoke to the attending veterinarian and the licensee suggested an antibiotic treatment\nprescribed by another licensed veterinarian in July 2022. The attending veterinarian agreed to this treatment and the\nrabbit did not have nasal discharge when looked at by the inspector on 31-May-2023 and seemed bright, alert, and\nresponsive. The attending veterinarian is scheduled to evaluate this rabbit during the 8-June-2023 facility visit. Failure to\nhave the rabbit evaluated in person by a licensed veterinarian does not ensure the rabbit is receiving appropriate\nveterinary care. Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.\nThe licensee must have the above-mentioned rabbit evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
