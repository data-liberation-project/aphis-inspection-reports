The arm was surgically amputated under anesthesia, just above the\nelbow, to facilitate a rapid recovery and return to the dam as well as the social group. The facility\u2019s internal investigation\nconcluded that the infant got out of the cage through a square hole, approximately 3 inches long by 3 inches wide, a\nstandard caging feature used to access food from the attached feeding bin at the front of the cage. This enclosure did not\nproperly contain the infant allowing for the subsequent escape and injury. Housing facilities for non-human primates must\nbe designed to contain the animals securely and protect them from injury. At the time of inspection, corrective actions and\npreventative measures had been implemented.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nLisa Ekman, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
