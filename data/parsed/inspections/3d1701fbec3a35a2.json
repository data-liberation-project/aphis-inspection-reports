One small black pig had two small scabbed over areas on its left side and one small scabbed\nover area on its left center hip. One medium black pig had a dark brown, roughened, raised area on its right upper\nhip. One spotted pig had a black raised area approximately the size of a quarter on its left flank area.

The\nlicensee must contact a licensed veterinarian for appropriate treatment instructions for this condition and follow the\ntreatment plan. The license must also ensure that accurate information concerning medical issues for all of the\nanimals is relayed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner as required.\nTo be corrected by April 20, 2018.\nThis inspection began at 1142.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nEnd of report."
