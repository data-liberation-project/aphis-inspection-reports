The medication was needed to treat a sore located on\nthe dogs back-right paw pad. The inspector counted 10 amoxicillin capsules that were still in the bottle. The\ndirections listed on the bottle are: give (1) capsule twice daily (every 12 hours) until gone.\nAn adult Shar-pei named 'Cookie' was prescribed 20 cephalexin 500mg capsules on 4/11/16. The licensee stated\nthe medication was used to treat an ear infection. The inspector counted 8 cephalexin capsules that were still in the\nbottle. The directions listed on the bottle are: give 1 capsule twice a day for 10 days.\nIf the medication was used as directed, there would not be any capsules left after 4/20/16. The licensee did not\nmaintain a log to document when the medication was being administered. The licensee stated that she forgot to\nfinish giving the dogs the remaining capsules after she believed their health problems were resolved.\nAt the time of inspection the two dogs listed above appeared to be in good health and exhibiting normal behavior.\nFailure to administer medications as directed by the veterinarian does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate\nveterinary care. The licensee must administer all medications as directed by a veterinarian.\nExit briefing conducted with the licensee."
