Under the glob of discharge the eyelid appeared slightly crusted over. Upon examination\nof the eye an indentation (approximate size the tip of a ballpoint pen) was observed. Eye issues may be painful and\nindicative of injury, irritation or other medical conditions. Licensee must ensure this dog is examined by a veterinarian to\nprevent further pain, suffering or damage to the eye as soon as possible (preferably within a couple of days.) DIRECT\n- The toenails on the dog's feet were long with at least one of them curving around causing the toe to splay to the side\nwhile walking. Long toenails can be painful and impair the dogs ability to maintain correct posture during normal\nmovement. Licensee must trim toenails and maintain appropriate length to allow for normal movement and minimize\ninjury.\n* The following medication was past the labeled expiration date: Metronidazole Tablets 250 mg \u2013 August 2022. This\nmedication was intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility (110 dogs) and therefore was\nready for use. Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. The\nlicensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled properly in accordance with standard\nveterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.\nThis inspection and phone exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nANGELA DEPOE, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOR n"
