A code 3 was called and work began on re securing the animal.\nStandard operation of emergency procedures were followed, which involved veterinary staff, curators, and assigned\nemergency response team members. After roughly three minutes, the rhino was able to be lured back into his\nprimary enclosure with food from the secondary containment area. The gate was then locked safely. The facility was\nable to safely secure the gate and contain the rhino without the use of chemical restraint or shooting/dart\nequipment.\nA debriefing occurred following the incident determined the escape was due to keeper error. The keeper was\ncounseled on the incident immediately and proper disciplinary action was taken. The gate is not in need of repair,\nhowever, it was modified to reduce the chance of another incident in the future. A restrictor will be installed to allow\nlimited opening of the gate as well as a stop to prevent it from swinging out.\nAnimals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Though the\nrhino remained within secondary containment, had they gained outside access it could have resulted in serious\nanimal or human injury. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained to protect and contain the\nanimals.\nCorrect by: This day forward\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the general curator."
