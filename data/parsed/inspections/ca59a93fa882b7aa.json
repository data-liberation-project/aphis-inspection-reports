Currently the height and structural composition of the primary fencing for these tiger's\nenclosure is not constructed of such material and of such strength to securely contain the tigers. All enclosures\nfencing for big cats should be measured. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be\nmaintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner."
