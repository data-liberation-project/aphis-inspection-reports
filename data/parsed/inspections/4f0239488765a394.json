The cement wall is flush on the public\nviewing side and there is a 4 to 6 feet wide sloping grade on the animal side. There is a meandering adjacent\nsidewalk available to the viewing public that is approximately 5-6 feet from the moat. A grass covered area\nseparates the public from the giraffe exhibit. During the inspection it was observed that 3 members of the public\nwalked onto this grass strip and approached the \u00bd foot-wide cement wall and stood on the wall surrounding the\nmoat. With the current design of the exhibit there is potential for contact between the public and the giraffe. During\npublic exhibition there must be sufficient distance and/or barriers between the public and the animals to assure the\nsafety of animals and the public. Correct by 14 August 2014"

This occurred in the lemur immersion exhibit in which the facility allows the public to have supervised\ndirect contact with the nonhuman primates.

The car seat was part of a stroller, which is not allowed\ninto the exhibit per facility policy. The car seat portion containing the infant was removed and carried into the exhibit.\nThe portable car seat, with baby toys attached, was placed on the ground. The attendant did not notice that the car\nseat was on the ground or that the lemur was interacting with and sitting on the infant. This uncontrolled,\nunsupervised interaction between the infant and the lemur resulted in risk of disease transmission, injury to the\npublic, and injury/stress of the animal. The facility must ensure that all nonhuman primates in public contact exhibits\nare under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is\npresent.
