      "narrative": "An adult male Boston Terrier (#0003), \u201cAlec\u201d, was observed squinting his left eye which also had a heavy amount of\ndischarge surrounding it. Upon closer observation, the eye itself was difficult to visualize and the dog would close his eye\nharder and frequently turn his head away while trying to get a closer look. After a brief glimpse of the eye, it appeared to\nbe cloudy and reddish blue in color. The fur surrounding the eyelids and within the skin fold down the left side of the nose\nwas wetted down from eye drainage. The drainage appeared mostly clear with some small yellow-like crusts noted\naround the eye. The dog\u2019s right eye also had a slight clear discharge noted. After the licensee talked by phone to the\nother owner it was discovered that the dog\u2019s eye condition had been identified during an early morning check by the other\nowner but he left the facility prior to addressing the dog and letting the other owner know about it. The licensee mentioned\na plan to use an eye medication for treating the dog\u2019s eye which is instructed in the facility\u2019s Program of Veterinary.\nHowever, at the time of inspection which was around 2pm, the dog had not yet been treated and the medication could not\nbe located at the facility. This dog\u2019s eye condition appears to be painful and could be due to an injury, infection or other\nveterinary medical condition which could worsen with time. The licensee must ensure that if a treatment plan has been\nestablished by a veterinarian which addresses the animal\u2019s condition, then the treatment plan must be followed and in a\ntimely manner. The licensee must ensure that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\ndiseases and injuries at all times. To be corrected by: October 7, 2020\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
