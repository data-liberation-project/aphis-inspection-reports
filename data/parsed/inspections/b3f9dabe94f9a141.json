The facility representative stated they were\nold and arthritic and so were removed from public contact. The facility representative also stated that they thought\nthe old wolves were not in pain. One inspector asked if the veterinarian had been consulted and the licensee stated\nthey had been recently vaccinated. In a subsequent telephone conversation with the veterinarian that had\nvaccinated them, they stated that they had prescribed medication for the wolves and recommended the facility\nprovide proper bedding for the animals. The facility representatives were not aware of any medication(s) being\nprescribed or given to the old wolves. Concrete is the floor of the wolves enclosure. A few strands of hay were\npresent which the representative called bedding. The amount of hay was insufficient for bedding as prescribed by\nthe veterinarian.\nArthritis can be painful affecting the animal\u2019s mobility and willingness to participate in daily activity of the animals\nand may interfere with obtaining water and food if reluctant to rise.
