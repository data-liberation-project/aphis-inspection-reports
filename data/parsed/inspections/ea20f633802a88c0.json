In the backstage area of the shoe, a cat enclosure had wire mesh that\nwas rusty and broken, making cleaning and sanitizing difficult and creating sharp points that might injure the cat. In\nthe foster dog magnum, the wooden baseboard had been chewed, exposing damaged raw wood that is not\nimpervious to moisture, which impedes cleaning and disinfecting. Approximately 3-5 crate doors of transfer cages\nwere excessively rusty, and could no longer be effectively sanitized. Surfaces in the cat and dog areas should be\nconstructed of appropriate materials, maintained in good repair so they can be readily cleaned and disinfected, in\norder to maintain a healthy environment for the cats and dogs.\nCorrection date: 21 Feb 2018\nExit interview conducted with facility representatives."
