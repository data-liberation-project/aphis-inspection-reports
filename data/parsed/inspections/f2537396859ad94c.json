The skin is thickened and swollen with multiple crusts and scabs present on the surface. According to the\nlicensee, he had noticed the skin lesion on the puppy and begun treating it with triple antibiotic ointment.\n- A 5-year-old, female golden retriever (ID# 900215004880065) has brown, waxy debris in both ears. A small 1 mm, white\nnodule was found in the right ear. Additionally, just below the entrance to the left ear, there is a small matt of fur with\nbrown discharge at the center.\nAccording to the program of veterinary care at the facility, skin issues that are found require consultation with the\nattending veterinarian. For ears that are dirty, the ears should be cleaned and ears that are swollen or bleeding require\nconsultation with the attending veterinarian. There are no documented records indicating that any of these abnormalities\nwere found by the licensee prior to inspection or treatments initiated.\nAnimals with untreated medical conditions including skin irritation and hair loss or excessive debris and wax in the ear\ncanals may suffer from unnecessary pain, discomfort, infection, and stress. Daily observations of animals to identify\nmedical problems is essential to identify injury and illness quickly, initiate treatment quickly, and prevent unnecessary\nsuffering. Correct by observing all animals at least daily to identify physical, medical, or behavioral problems. Additionally,\nensure that all findings are communicated in a timely manner to the attending veterinarian so that they can examine\nanimals and ensure that appropriate treatment is provided as required by section 2.40(b)(2).
