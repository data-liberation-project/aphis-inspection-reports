Three of the enclosures contained 4 puppies and one contained 3 puppies. The truck attendant\nwas in the process of watering the animals inside the truck and had not yet reached these puppies. Once provided\nwater, the puppies were observed drinking continuously, in some cases for up to 2 minutes without stopping. The\npuppies were pushing each other to get to the water and they were all trying to fit their heads into the water\ncontainers to drink; however, they could not all access the water at the same time because the containers were\nsmall, holding about 1-2 cups of water each. As one puppy would raise its head, another would push its face into\nthe container to drink. The puppies quickly depleted the water. Four Blue Heeler puppies in one enclosure were\nobserved licking the empty receptacle and chewing on the sides until a second serving of water was provided of\nwhich they also drank completely. An inadequate supply of water can result in unnecessary discomfort and physical\nharm. The registrant was verbally instructed to ensure that all dogs are provided with an adequate supply of water\nas frequently as necessary to ensure their comfort and well-being from this point forward.

The puppies in these enclosures did not have enough space for all puppies to\nlie down in a normal position or turn around without contacting the other puppies in the enclosure. When all the\npuppies were lying down, there was no visible open floor space in the enclosures. Without adequate space these\npuppies cannot make normal postural adjustments which are crucial to their health and well-being. Primary\nenclosures used to transport dogs must provide adequate space for each animal to turn about normally while\nstanding, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position.
