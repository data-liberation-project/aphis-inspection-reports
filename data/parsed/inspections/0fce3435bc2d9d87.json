The kennel containing 5 cocker spaniel puppies and their dam had an uncovered plywood wall on one\nside. The adjacent kennel, housing an adult light brown miniature poodle, had plywood walls on two sides; the plywood\nwall containing the dog door was dark colored and mildly warped along its base consistent with previous water damage.\nThe licensee stated that these plywood walls were not impervious to moisture and she avoided spraying them during\ncleaning because they would get wet.\nSurfaces that absorb moisture cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, and may harbor odors, organic debris, or bacteria\nwhich may negatively impact the health and well-being of dogs in the enclosure.\nCorrect by housing dogs and puppies in enclosures in which the floors, walls, boxes, houses, dens, and other hard\nsurfaces in contact with the animals are impervious to moisture.
