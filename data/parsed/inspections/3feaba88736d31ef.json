The flanks were\nsunken from the base of the where the ribs attach to the spine to the protruding hip bones. This dog was extremely\nthin. This dog also had hair loss on the lateral sides of both front legs approximately two inches above the feet.\nThese areas were bright pink with a few small scabbed areas and other areas that were raised and pinkish/clear as\nin the appearance of a blister. There was also hair loss (dime size) across the front paws, the back legs\napproximately four inches above the feet, the tail, spine and hip bones. The hair loss had extended across the digits\nof the front left foot. There was a crusty area of hair loss on the back area in between the shoulders, just at the base\nof the white hair around the neck. He also had toenails that were long enough that they were beginning to turn the\ndigits. The eyes appeared to be sluggish and dull. The facility representative stated that this animal had been\ndewormed recently due to being thin and that the hairloss was from digging. This dog was housed on cement. This\ndog had not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian as instructed in the report for the February 10, 2015\ninspection.. Bone protrusion and hair loss can be indications of a serious medical condition. Long toenails left\nunattended can turn the digits and cause discomfort, pain or lameness.\n***In the outdoor facility, there was a male Shih Tzu identified as 00070C34D8 \"Willie\"- DOB 1/4/09 was moving in a\nmore normal manner yet had not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian as instructed in the report for the\nFebruary 10, 2015 inspection.
