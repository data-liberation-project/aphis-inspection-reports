Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. The facility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns\nare found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nThis pig must be examined by a veterinarian by July 14, 2017."
