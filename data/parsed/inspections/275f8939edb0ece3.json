      "narrative": "***On May 2, 2013, a 1-month old male pig-tailed macaque (ID #Z13068) along with its mother, were introduced to\ntheir assigned breeding group following a 2 day protected contact period when the infant was attacked.\nApproximately 15-20 minutes after open contact was established, the single adult male of the group attacked the\ninfant. The infant sustained extensive trauma and was euthanized by the veterinarian.\nIn a separate breeding group, on May 30, 2013, a 6-month old male pig-tailed macaque (ID #Z13080), was attacked\nby the adult male in its group. That animal (ID #Z13080), subsequently died from its injuries. In another separate\nincident on June 12, 2013, a 9-month old female pig-tailed macaque (ID #Z12341) was attacked by an adult male,\nthrough mesh contact and was euthanized by the veterinarian.\nFollowing the May 2nd attack, the veterinarian notified the facility behavioral management group of the incident. The\nveterinarian and the behavioral group also discussed the temperament and behavioral history of the male that was\ninvolved in the May 2nd attack. There were no subsequent dam/infant pairs placed with the male involved in the\nMay 2nd attack. Following the May 30th attack, all males were removed from breeding groups until new group\nassignments and behavioral assessments were complete. Mesh contact remained following the May 30th attack, as\nto not completely disrupt the groups.\nIt is common for males, including male primates, to attack and kill young offspring of their species (known as\ninfanticide). Knowing this behavior (as stated by the facility) and that it was occurring at the facility, it is the\nveterinarian's and the facility's responsibility to prevent this behavior and any subsequent injuries. Preventative\naction should have been taken following the May 2nd attack, before the attacks on May 30th and June 12th. The\nfacility has implemented changes in their group housing policy. After June 12, 2013, young primates are no longer\nhoused with adult males, in order to prevent future attacks.\nAn inspection was started on 7/14/14 and finished on 8/1/14 to review animal enclosures and animal medical\nrecords.\nExit interview was conducted on-site with the veterinarian on 8/7/14."
