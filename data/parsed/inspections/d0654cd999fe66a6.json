      "narrative": "The facility did not perform adequate daily observations of a sheep and failed to identify her thin body condition and\nrapid breathing.\nDuring a walk-through of the sheep barn at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital on June 20, 2017, APHIS inspectors\ndiscovered that a female sheep, ID KC02, appeared thin and was breathing rapidly. The sheep had undergone\nsurgery as part of a research protocol #17-7213A. There were three other sheep in the enclosure that had\nundergone surgery as part of the same protocol; all of these sheep were breathing normally. There was an\nadditional 12 adult sheep in the neighboring pens of this sheep\u2019s enclosure who were also breathing normally.\nThere is no documentation or record indicating that these clinical signs had been noticed or communicated to a\nfacility veterinarian prior to the APHIS inspection. As a result, veterinary care for the sheep had not been provided.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized and conveyed to a facility veterinarian in a timely manner so that appropriate methods can be\nemployed to ensure adequate care. The facility must conduct appropriate daily observations of all animals to ensure\nthat all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the\nattending veterinarian.\nAt the time of the inspection, a veterinarian examined the sheep and initiated treatment. Additional training of staff\nhas also been implemented by the facility.\nTo be corrected from this date forward.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted from 06/20-06/23/17. This report is limited to the direct and critical\nnoncompliant items identified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items\nwill follow. Both the inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives on 06/23/17.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
