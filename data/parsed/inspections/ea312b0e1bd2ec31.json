      "narrative": "The following animals identified during this inspection were exhibiting symptoms indicative of compromised health\nand must be examined by a veterinarian, a diagnosis obtained and appropriate treatment rendered:\n*A mature aoudad ram was unable to use either front foot/leg in a normal manner when walking and the front\nhooves appear to be overgrown. The animal was seen ambulating on the knees and when attempting to weight\nbear on the front feet an obviously abnormal, exaggerated gait and weight shifting was apparent. The licensee\nstated that the ram\u2019s difficulty walking was first identified about a week ago. Abnormal postures and gaits can\nindicate a serious, painful problem with the feet.\n*A mature beefalo cow, possibly older than 20 years, was dorsally recumbant in an open pasture. The cow\u2019s right\neye globe was opaque and white. The animal exhibited a low body condition score with pin and hook bones visible,\nprominent spine, some visible ribs and scarce body fat. Respiratory rate appeared rapid. Facility staff tried to\nencourage the animal to her feet but were not able to get her in a standing position. Inability to stand may indicate a\nserious health condition due to infection, parasites, metabolic compromise or injury.\n*A mature Watusi bull, \u201cSteve\u201d exhibits a continuous dramatic head tilt or torticollis to the left side. The licensee\nstated the condition has been present for several years and is undiagnosed. Steve also has a copious mucous\ndischarge dripping from the left nostril. The Watusi bull \u201cGoliath\u201d also has a slight head tilt or torticollis to the right\nside. Head tilt and torticollis can be indicative of infectious or non-infectious disease processes or trauma and may\ncause discomfort to the animal.\n*A mature female dromedary camel \u201cCleo\u201d who is possibly older than 20 years, was dorsally recumbent in an open\npasture. Facility staff were requested to encourage Cleo to stand and were successful. However, the camel was\nslow to rise, appeared stiff, inflexible and reluctant to walk. Compromised ability to stand or walk can indicate pain,\nweakness or discomfort.\n*A mature female waterbuck was noted to be very thin with prominent hook and pin bones, visible ribs, minimal\nmuscle tone and body fat. The licensee stated the animal\u2019s poor body condition was identified a week ago but no\ntreatment had been provided because the animal couldn\u2019t be captured or restrained. Poor body condition can be\nindicative of parasites, disease or other conditions that adversely affect animal health and well-being.\n*The black and white domestic cow has an obvious lump or swelling under the skin on the right side mid-body just\nbelow the spine. An abnormal swelling could be caused by infection, trauma or disease processes and may be\npainful or harmful to the health of the animal."

In multiple areas throughout the facility, sections of this fencing were\nexcessively rusted, corroded to the point that there were small gaps noticed in some areas, and damage causing\nsharp and twisted points in the fencing.\nIn the Giraffe enclosure, there was a large wooden support beam made to hold the enclosure fencing up that was\nbent and loose. In the same area, damage to the fencing was causing sharp and rusted points to be exposed. The\nlarge male Giraffe was observed putting his head over this section of fencing, laying his neck over the section with\nsharp points. In the indoor section of the Giraffe enclosure, the metal cattle panels making up the front of the\nenclosure were pocked and discolored, and flaked when one inspector picked at it. The licensee stated that it was\nrust build up. In the same enclosure, there was a galvanized metal fencing piece towards the rear of the indoor\nsection that had been damaged and had a long straight piece of sharp wire exposed towards the enclosure where a\njuvenile and pregnant female giraffe resided.\nThe enclosure holding at least two Axis Deer contained sections of fencing that was excessively rusted. The\noutdoor shelter provided to the Axis Deer was damaged, containing a large section of one wall that was missing.\nThe tin type building used as a shelter for a Rhinoceros and multiple Aoudad had excessive rust and corrosion\nbuildup towards the bottom of the back of the enclosure causing several small gaps in the wall. At least one of the\nlarge metal panels used to enclose the Rhino was corroded to the extent that pocking and a hole was observed in a\nsection by the water trough.\nThe American Buffalo enclosure contained several areas of fencing that were excessively rusted or damaged,\nexposing bunched up and/or sharp points.\nThe hay barn, which also has a shelter built out of each side of the barn, contained walls and ceilings that were\nexcessively rusted. Support beams on the ceiling were corroded to such an extent that the inspectors could see\nthrough them. Some panels on the back walls were separating and folding out, causing sharp surfaces near\nfeeding troughs. Sharp, rusted nail heads were observed in this same area, near feeding troughs.\nIn the enclosure housing two javalinas, a portion of wire mesh had come apart and was hanging down several feet\ninto the enclosure. Other sections of the enclosure fencing were bowing down into the enclosure.\nA cattle panel type door where four camels were during the inspection was broken and in disrepair, causing sharp\nand rough points to protrude out.\nIn the Patagonian cavy enclosure, a hole approximately one foot by two feet in diameter and an undetermined depth\nwas observed on the ground. Exposed fencing material could be seen in the hole which was full of water. A section\nof the front of the enclosure was excessively rusted.\nThe enclosure containing two Watusi and two cows contained sections of damaged and rusted fencing.\nThe enclosure containing at least one wallaby contained sections of damage and excessive rust. The shelter inside\nthe enclosure was made of wood and was cracked and bowing outward, separating from the frame.\nAn open enclosure beside the Kangaroo enclosure, which most animals in the facility have access to, contained a\nwooden shelter that was bowed and warped, beginning to separate from the frame. The same enclosure contained\nareas of excessive rust and damage causing sharp points to be exposed.\nFencing and shelters in disrepair can cause animals within to become injured and poses hazards including but not\nlimited to injury, animals escaping or unwanted animals entering enclosures.

An environment\nenhancement plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards and should meet the\nneeds of all nonhuman primates at their facility. This plan needs to be evaluated and signed by the attending\nveterinarian and made available to APHIS upon request. This plan is important for promoting the psychological\nwell-being of nonhuman primates, and must address social needs, environmental enrichment, and any special\nconsiderations. \nCorrect by 8/8/2017\n3.83\nWATERING.   \nAll the lemurs are located on islands surrounded by a pond, which is the only source of drinking water for the\nlemurs.  The water is very dirty with algae floating on the top.  Potable water must be provided to all non-human\nprimates at this facility or offered as often as necessary to ensure their health, but no less than twice daily for at\nleast 1 hour each time.  \nCorrect by 8/5/2017\n3.125(a)\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \nThe facility grounds are surrounded by a barrier made up of a mixture of a thick density steel type fencing, what the\nlicensee called pig wire, and cattle panels.  In multiple areas throughout the facility, sections of this fencing were\nexcessively rusted, corroded to the point that there were small gaps noticed in some areas, and damage causing\nsharp and twisted points in the fencing.\nIn the Giraffe enclosure, there was a large wooden support beam made to hold the enclosure fencing up that was\nbent and loose.  In the same area, damage to the fencing was causing sharp and rusted points to be exposed.  The\n\nlarge male Giraffe was observed putting his head over this section of fencing, laying his neck over the section with\nsharp points.  In the indoor section of the Giraffe enclosure, the metal cattle panels making up the front of the\nenclosure were pocked and discolored, and flaked when one inspector picked at it.  The licensee stated that it was\nrust build up.  In the same enclosure, there was a galvanized metal fencing piece towards the rear of the indoor\nsection that had been damaged and had a long straight piece of sharp wire exposed towards the enclosure where a\njuvenile and pregnant female giraffe resided.\nThe enclosure holding at least two Axis Deer contained sections of fencing that was excessively rusted.  The\noutdoor shelter provided to the Axis Deer was damaged, containing a large section of one wall that was missing.\nThe tin type building used as a shelter for a Rhinoceros and multiple Aoudad had excessive rust and corrosion\nbuildup towards the bottom of the back of the enclosure causing several small gaps in the wall.  At least one of the\nlarge metal panels used to enclose the Rhino was corroded to the extent that pocking and a hole was observed in a\nsection by the water trough.\nThe American Buffalo enclosure contained several areas of fencing that were excessively rusted or damaged,\nexposing bunched up and/or sharp points.\nThe hay barn, which also has a shelter built out of each side of the barn, contained walls and ceilings that were\nexcessively rusted.  Support beams on the ceiling were corroded to such an extent that the inspectors could see\nthrough them.  Some panels on the back walls were separating and folding out, causing sharp surfaces near\nfeeding troughs.  Sharp, rusted nail heads were observed in this same area, near feeding troughs.\nIn the enclosure housing two javalinas, a portion of wire mesh had come apart and was hanging down several feet\ninto the enclosure.  Other sections of the enclosure fencing were bowing down into the enclosure.\nA cattle panel type door where four camels were during the inspection was broken and in disrepair, causing sharp\nand rough points to protrude out.\nIn the Patagonian cavy enclosure, a hole approximately one foot by two feet in diameter and an undetermined depth\nwas observed on the ground.  Exposed fencing material could be seen in the hole which was full of water.  A section\nof the front of the enclosure was excessively rusted.\nThe enclosure containing two Watusi and two cows contained sections of damaged and rusted fencing.\nThe enclosure containing at least one wallaby contained sections of damage and excessive rust.  The shelter inside\nthe enclosure was made of wood and was cracked and bowing outward, separating from the frame.\nAn open enclosure beside the Kangaroo enclosure, which most animals in the facility have access to, contained a\n\nwooden shelter that was bowed and warped, beginning to separate from the frame.  The same enclosure contained\nareas of excessive rust and damage causing sharp points to be exposed.\nFencing and shelters in disrepair can cause animals within to become injured and poses hazards including but not\nlimited to injury, animals escaping or unwanted animals entering enclosures.  The licensee must repair, replace, or\ndiscontinue using these areas to enclose animals.\nCorrect by 11/4/2017\n3.125(c)\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \nIn the hoof stock feed room inside the main barn a large black trashcan full of feed pellets was uncovered, exposing\nthe feed.  In the same room, a hole in the wall that appeared to be indicative of rodent activity was observed.\nIn the secondary feed room in the main barn where rabbit pellets and primate biscuits are stored, the floor was\nobserved to have a layer of brownish tan, organic material and feed bag waste covering it.  At least two large\ncockroaches were observed in this room.  One bag of rabbit pellets was open and uncovered, exposing several\ninches of pellets.\nThe large hay barn by the Alligator enclosure contained hay that appeared to be soiled and in some sections,\nmoldy.  The licensee stated that some of the hay is fed to the animals.\nExposed feed can become contaminated by insects, vermin and bacteria, causing a hazard to any animals that may\ncome in contact with it.  Food must be kept in sealed containers and away from vermin, insects and the elements in\norder to remain fresh and wholesome.\nCorrect by 8/6/2017\n3.125(d)\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \nIn several areas throughout the complex, there were areas in excess of ten feet wide and up to several feet thick of\nwhat appeared to be excreta and used hay.  Animals had access to these areas.\nExcreta, rubbish, and used bedding that is not properly disposed of in a timely manner can soil the animals, and\nattract insects and vermin to the area.  Areas within the complex must remain clean and free of excess waste.\n\nCorrect by 8/20/2017\n3.127(d)\nFACILITIES, OUTDOOR. \nThe entire facility ground is surrounded by a perimeter fence.  However, a majority of the hoofstock animals have\nfree range access within the complex and are not enclosed in any type of pen causing the complex fence to act as a\nlarge single enclosure without any sort of perimeter fence or secondary containment.\nThe licensee stated that the perimeter fence is approximately 7.5 feet tall.  One rhinoceros at the facility requires a\nperimeter fence at least 8 feet fall.  \nAn appropriate perimeter fence is required to prevent public contact with the animal and to serve as secondary\ncontainment. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high or less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, such as the\nrhino, must be approved in writing by the Administrator and the facility needs to send in a variance request for this.\nApplicant will submit a variance request for this.\nCorrect by 9/4/2017\n3.129(b)\nFEEDING.    \nThough food receptacles were seen in several of the enclosures, the following enclosures contained animal feed\nand vegetables that appeared to have been dropped onto the ground inside the enclosures instead of being placed\ninto sanitized receptacles:  Javalinas, Kangaroo, Wallaby, Muntjac, Axis Deer, White Tailed Deer.  Flies and mud\nwere observed on several of these piles of feed and vegetables.  Contamination of food by animal waste, insects or\nvermin can cause animals who ingest it to become ill.  Food must be given to animals in sanitized receptacles.  \nCorrect by 8/5/2017\n3.130\nWATERING.  \nThe licensee stated that the animals in the complex drink from the various ponds and streams on the property.  No\nfresh, clean water is provided.  Many of the ponds contained a complete surface cover of green organic matter. \nExcreta was seen close to many of these bodies of water and vermin such as snakes and rats were noted in and\naround many of these bodies of water.\nSome water receptacles and troughs were observed throughout the complex.  The Rhino is provided a trough of\nwater since no natural body of water exists in his enclosure.  The inspectors could not see through the water and\n\nthe licensee stated it is emptied and cleaned once a year.  Several troughs of water including but not limited to one\nby the hay barn had insect larva swimming in it.  Several natural bodies of water also had an excessive amount of\ninsect larva and small flying insects in and around the water.\nAnimals are susceptible to parasites and can become ill from contaminated or unclean water.  Animals must be\nprovided clean fresh water in sanitized receptacles.\nCorrect by 8/10/2017\n3.131(a)\nSANITATION.   \nShelters inside enclosures containing the following animals: Rhino, Camels, Aoudad, Kangaroo, Wallaby,\nPatagonian Cavy, Muntjac, Axis Deer, and the enclosure beside the Kangaroo enclosure that was open with access\nby many species of animals, all had an excess amount of excreta and hay in them ranging from several inches to\nseveral feet thick.  The licensee informed the inspectors that some of these enclosures get cleaned out once a year.\nInadequate cleaning practices draw insects and vermin to the area, can soil the animals and contaminate food and\nwater supplies, and cause overall unhealthy conditions for the animals within.  Enclosures must be cleaned as often\nas necessary to ensure no excessive buildup of waste material accumulates.\nCorrect by 8/20/2017\n3.131(d)\nSANITATION.   \nNo formal pest control program could be presented to the inspectors.  During the inspection, Roaches were noted in\nthe feed room, as well as signs of rodents present in the same area.  A rat and a snake were observed in an area\nwhere ring tailed lemurs were present.  Living insect larva was seen in several of the water troughs.  All of the\nponds currently used as water supplies contained a variety of insects, larva, reptiles and vermin.  The licensee also\nstated there is a problem at the facility with buzzards.\nWithout a formal and active pest control program, there is a serious health and safety risk to the animals, and risk of\ncontamination to food and water stores.  The licensee must develop and execute a pest control plan throughout the\nfacility in order to attempt to mitigate the above mentioned problems.\nCorrect by 8/28/2017\n3.132\n\nEMPLOYEES. \nDuring the inspection, one of the inspectors witnessed two children approach the Javalina enclosure and stick their\nfingers through the enclosure fencing.  When an employee was asked where the area attendant was, the inspector\nwas told that the single employee running the pony rides also watched the area and that it was up to the adults who\nbring children to the facility to watch their children.  With out an adequate number of employees, there is a\nsignificant health and safety risk for both the animals and public.  The licensee must ensure that areas with public\naccess be attended by an adequate number of knowledgeable employees to ensure that the animals remain\nsecured and unmolested in their enclosures. \nCorrect by 8/11/2017\nThis inspection was conducted on 8/3/2017 with the owner and an employee.\nThe exit interview was conducted on 8/4/2017 with the owner.\nAdditional Inspectors\nIrwin Bryan, Compliance Specialist\nMoore Mary, Veterinary Medical Officer",
