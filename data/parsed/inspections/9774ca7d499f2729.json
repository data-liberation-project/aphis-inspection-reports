According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature last night was 34\ndegrees Fahrenheit and the low for tonight will be approximately 30 degrees Fahrenheit.\nFailure to provide clean and dry bedding does not ensure the animals can remain warm and dry during low\ntemperatures. This can potentially lead to health hazards and cause discomfort for the animals.

Additional\nclean and dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.
