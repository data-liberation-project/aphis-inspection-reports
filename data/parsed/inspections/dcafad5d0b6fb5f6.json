An area of hairloss\nat least 1 inch in diameter was noted on the cat's underside near the cat's left front leg. A swelling or mass\napproximately 3/4 in in diameter was noted in this area. No wounds were visible. The caretaker reports that the cat\nhad visited the vet on Dec. 8, 2015 for vaccinations, fecal exam and deworming. The caretaker called the vet's\noffice and talked to the receptionist today. No notations of a mass were noted in the cat's record. The caretaker\nmade an appointment to take the cat to the vet clinic tomorrow.\n*A female mouflon first noted in quarantine during the Oct. 19, 2015 inspection for weight loss issues is still being\nkept separate from the others. The attending vet recommended deworming. The caretaker reports the mouflon is\ndoing better but is \"still not right\" and that \"she doesn't look like the others\". The mouflon appears alert today but\nquiet. She is thin with muscle loss and a tucked in abdomen. Her haircoat appears dull and has not shed\nnormally/completely and her eyes have a glazed appearance.\nThe facility needs to maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries in order to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. The\nSavannah cat and mouflon need to be examined by a veterinarian who shall make a diagnosis and develop a\ntreatment plan."
