The animal was euthanized due to its condition and a necropsy was\nperformed. The incident triggered an alert to the management of the institution, whereupon it was decided to\nconduct re-training for all technicians on rabbit handling.\nEvery interaction between humans and animals poses some degree of risk of physical injury, distress, and other\nharm to all parties involved. Therefore, handling of animals must be conducted as carefully as possible in a manner\nthat does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThis incident was thoroughly investigated by the IACUC and corrective actions were taken starting within one week\nof the occurrence.\nCorrect from this time forward.\nThe physical inspection and records review was conducted on 28-30 June with the IACUC Administrator, Attending\nVeterinarian, and Animal Husbandry staff by Mike Neafsey, VMO, and Kathy Campitelli, VMO. The exit interview\nwas conducted on 30 June with the aforementioned personnel and the Global Director for Preclinical Lab Animal\nMedicine and other management staff.\nAdditional Inspectors\nNeafsey Michael, Assistant Director"
