      "narrative": "One of the three metal shelters located within the cattle pasture was in significant disrepair. On the front left side of\nthe shelter part of the frame had broken away from the sheet metal walls. This particular piece of frame contained a\nsharp jagged edge which was protruding approximately \u00bd to 1 inch into the shelter. On the top right portion of the\nsame structure, a second portion of frame was rusted and broken away from the sheet metal walls. The portion of\nframe was approximately 2 feet long and was also protruding into the shelter preventing cattle from being able\nexhibit natural standing postures. At this same location, approximately two feet of sheet metal edge was also\nexposed containing jagged edges. Two other similarly constructed shelters, one in the cattle pen and the other in a\ngoat pen, were observed to have large areas of rust, approximately 5in x 5in, on the sheet metal in the bottom\ncorner. Each shelter was observed to have one corner affected. Keeping shelters in good repair and maintaining\nstructural integrity is crucial to preventing animal injury. All outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and\nshall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nTo be corrected within 48 hours\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
