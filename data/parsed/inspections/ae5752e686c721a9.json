The current NDSU IACUC Adverse Event\nand Protocol Deviation Reporting document requires that the PI and/or animal care staff must report an\nunanticipated adverse event or protocol deviation within 72 hours to the IACUC Office. The IACUC Office in turn\nnotifies the attending veterinarian. The document also stipulates that animals that die unexpectedly, or are\neuthanized unexpectedly in a research study, must be submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory for necropsy.\nThe institutional attending veterinarian was not informed about the lamb deaths until May 04, 2018. This was\napproximately 6 weeks after the adverse event occurred. Additionally, none of the eleven lambs that died were\npresented for necropsy to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory.\nDirect and timely communication with the attending veterinarian and appropriate diagnostic testing are essential to\nthe well-being of all institutional animal herds, flocks and colonies when unexpected mortality or morbidity occurs. A\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of\nanimal health, behavior and well-being is communicated to the attending veterinarian."

The\nsheep were under IACUC approved protocol #A16045 at the time of the event. The attending veterinarian for the\ninstitution was informed of the lamb deaths by ANPC personnel on May 04, 2018. On May 11, 2018, following an\ninvestigation of the deaths, the attending veterinarian contacted the USDA inspector (VMO) to inform the USDA of\nthe adverse event and investigation results.\nThe holding pen was empty at the time of USDA inspection on 05-23-2018. Discussion with facility personnel\nrevealed that 150 lambs and 63 ewes had been placed into the pen on 03-23-2018 for the purpose of staging the\nlambs for weaning, elastrator band placement and vaccinations. Approximately ninety minutes after the pen had\nbeen filled, barn personnel discovered the sheep had piled to one side of the pen and eleven lambs had died. The\nlambs, which were 8 to 13 weeks of age at the time, had not yet undergone any of the weaning procedures\ndescribed above. Square footage of the pen was measured at the time of USDA inspection and was found to be\napproximately 348.5 square feet (25\u2019 2\u201d L (length) X 13\u2019 2\u201d W (width), with an additional 10\u2019 11\u201d L X 4\u201d W wall cove\narea).\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible, and in a manner that does not\ncause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Failure\nto restrain and handle animals properly may result in increased animal distress, injury or death.\nDuring the inspection, facility representative proffered corrective actions to help prevent future mortalities during\nweaning and processing of lambs. The corrective actions include: reduced ewe and lamb group sizes in holding\npens when processing, additional training for students and personnel on handling, increased observation frequency\nduring processing, and timely communication with the attending veterinarian when issues occur.\nCorrect this date forward."

The fourteen hogs were then moved to\nanother pen with water on the same day. One of the fourteen hogs was found dead later during the day of May 09.\nAnother hog in the group subsequently died on the morning of May 10. A third hog from the group, which had\nbecome debilitated, was euthanized on May 11. The affected hogs were under IACUC approved protocol #A17043\nand were 6 months of age at the time of the event. The remaining eleven hogs from the pen survived and were\nreported to have no outward signs of distress nor debilitation.

The hogs were then moved back into the pen (pen 6) on May 02. Facility personnel\ndiscovered that the water line fitting had not been repaired and the line was non-functional on May 09 2018.\nSubsequent necropsy of one of the hogs that died (VDL Ascension Report #18-5104) revealed findings consistent\nwith dehydration and water deprivation.\nIf potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health\nand comfort of the animal.
