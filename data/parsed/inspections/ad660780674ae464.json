      "narrative": "During the inspection two of the goat barn fencing panels were not in good repair. The four bucks housed in this area are\ngenerally maintained in the pasture, but they have access to the barn for feeding and additional shelter during inclement\nweather. The barn fence paneling consists of 8x8 inch metal wire squares and the wires have been broken such that one\nfencing panel had four consecutive 8x8 inch squares that are no longer intact. The broken squares were creating 8-inch-\nlong sharp projecting points and a large horizontal opening that measured approximately 3.5 feet in length. A second barn\nfence section had several consecutive 8x8 inch squares no longer intact creating a gaping 2ft x 5 ft hole with long\nprojecting wires. Some of the projecting wires were approximately 32 inches in length. Failure to maintain enclosure\nfencing can cause projecting sharp wires to serve as a source of injury or holes that serve as an entrapment hazard to the\nanimals.\nThe affected fencing panels were removed on January 29, 2025 prior to the conclusion of the inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
