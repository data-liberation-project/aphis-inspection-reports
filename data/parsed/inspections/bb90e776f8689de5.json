      "narrative": "The written program of veterinary care is incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of veterinary\ncare is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written PVC\ncontains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended treatments\nconsist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of\nadministration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no\nmanufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding\nfrequency of administration the written PVC says \"as needed\" for the majority of the species. There is no guidance\nelsewhere clarifying what \"as needed\" means. A written program of veterinary care is required when attending\nveterinarians are employed on a part time basis to ensure that the licensee and facility staff understand the direction\nof the Attending Veterinarian and provide a mechanism by which APHIS Officials can determine their compliance\nwith those directions. Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure good\nwelfare of the animals maintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for\nprevention, control, and treatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that\ncomplete guidance regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species\nthat are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. At\na minimum guidance must include species-specific directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and\nthe prevention, control, and treatment of internal and external parasites.\nThe attending veterinarian has given his authority for \"farm personnel\" to perform tail docking and castrations for\nsheep, goats, Tahr, and Aoudad. This note does not provide adequate guidance to carry out these procedures:\nthere are no detailed instructions indicating how these procedures are to be done, on what ages of animals, the\nlocation where they are to be performed, if any drugs are to be used and what dose, route, and frequency to give\nthem for each species, and any post-procedural care or complications to watch for. The licensee stated that he is\nthe only person who is doing these procedures, and he is only doing them on sheep and domestic goats. Tail\ndocking and castration can cause significant complications if performed incorrectly, including severe bleeding,\ninfection, retained fertility (if castration is incomplete), and non-healing wounds. Failure to maintain a written\nprogram of veterinary care, including guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or facility staff, does\nnot ensure adequate care for the animals on hand. The licensee must obtain adequate guidance including detailed\ninstructions from the attending veterinarian in order to perform these procedures in accordance with accepted\nstandards of adequate veterinary care. Correct by maintaining a written program of veterinary care that includes\nspecific written guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or other facility personnel.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED"

      "narrative": "The following animals were identified in need of veterinary care during the inspection:\n***A male brown white and black Nubian-type goat without identification had an injured area on its scrotum. The\nbottom half of the scrotal skin was severely scabbed with hardened debris. Most of this affected skin appeared\nnecrotic and contaminated with dirt and grass. When examining the area to ensure that this was not surface debris\nthe gentle wiping caused the area to bleed and there was yellow-white pus localized in pockets. The upper half of\nthe more normal-appearing scrotum (above this tissue) was swollen and firm. The goat appeared abnormal when\nrunning (wide legged stance and occasionally shaking a rear leg), although no gait abnormalities were detected at\nthe walk or when standing. There was no documentation available to indicate that facility personnel had observed\nthis abnormality or were providing any form of treatment. When asked, the licensee stated that the animal was one\nof several purchased on 15 August 2015 and that all of them were normal at that time. On 27 August 2015,\ndocumentation was provided by the facility manager from the seller (also a veterinarian) stating that he had\ncastrated the goats prior to sale. This documentation stated that 3 goats were castrated 3-4 weeks prior to sale and\none 10 days prior to sale using an open castration technique. Swelling, pain, and infection are all possible\ncomplications of castration and post procedural monitoring is necessary to ensure that animals which develop these\nissues are treated appropriately. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated\naccording to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions.\n***A female light gray mini-zebu had an approximately 1-inch by 3-inch area of ocular drainage and darkly stained\nfur under the right eye. The drainage extended from the middle of the lower lid to the corner of the eye on the nasal\nside and two-thirds of the way down the face towards the mouth. The zebu was seen squinting her right eye during\nthe inspection. Eye injuries can be extremely painful, and if left untreated can lead to additional complications such\nas scarring of the cornea, rupture, or blindness of the affected eye. Correct by having this animal examined by a\nlicensed veterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions.\n***A spotted fallow deer in the drive-through area near the entrance gate was lethargic and dull in mentation. Her\neyes were closed and she was neither eating nor chewing her cud (as all the nearby animals were). Initially her\nhead was extended with her nose nearly touching the ground though she periodically picked it up holding it upright\nwith eyes still closed. When stimulated by making noises like revving the engine of the truck, clucking/whistling, and\nslamming the truck door, the fallow deer barely raised her head and failed to startle or open her eyes. Only when\nthe truck door was within feet of her and opened and slammed shut did this animal open her eyes fully and turn her\nears and head towards the source of the noise. Other fallow deer that were significantly farther away (had moved\nas the truck approached) startled, turned, and /or moved a short distance farther away from the noise. Inspectors\nobserved this animal for more than 10 minutes when first encountered in the drive-through area. On exit of the\ndrive-through park approximately an hour later, the fallow deer was located again in a nearby area and was\nobserved for a similar period of time. Her appearance and reactions to the same stimuli had not changed.\nLethargy, dull mentation, and lack of cud-chewing in ruminant species are signs of illness and inappetence. This\nanimal(cid:25)s overall behavior is not normal and indicates that veterinary examination is necessary to properly diagnose\nand treat this animal. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated according to\nthe veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions. NOTE: At the conclusion of the inspection the licensee asked the Farm Manager to\ngo into the drive through to look for fallow deer that wouldn(cid:25)t move when approached. On the day of the exit\ninterview the farm manager informed APHIS Officials that facility personnel had driven through the park several\ntimes and were unable to locate any fallow deer that were acting abnormally.\n***A brown and white female Boer-type goat, #7016, in the Daughty Barn had a significant amount dark brown\nmaterial caked on the tail, peritoneal area, and hind legs that appeared to be loose stool that had dried on the fur.\nThis goat was housed with 5 other goats in the same primary enclosure. The licensee stated that this animal had\nhad a fecal analysis performed and had been treated for coccidiosis; however, there was no record indicating this\nindividual had a fecal analysis or was examined by a veterinarian. Additionally, a note documented in the farm's\ntreatment logs indicated that this animal and another individual were treated with Di-Methox and ProBios, but there\nis no written authorization in the program of veterinary care on the use of these drugs in goats without additional\nguidance from a licensed veterinarian. Diarrhea can result from many causes including several infectious diseases\nthat are easily spread between animals in close contact. Additionally, untreated diarrhea can cause excessive\ndehydration, abdominal pain, inappetence, and weight loss. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed\nveterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions including specific information regarding the\nproper dose, frequency, and route of administration for all drugs that are to be used in an off-label manner.\n***A female elk, #0119, was seen in the drive-through area with a large mass on the right side of her jaw. The\nlicensee stated that this animal is an older animal and the mass has been there for years. He indicated that he\nwould attempt to contact the attending veterinarian for any record of the initial evaluation of the mass; however, no\ndocumentation of any examination taking place prior to the inspection was sent to APHIS Officials. There was no\nwritten record that there has been any prior examination or documentation of the nature of this chronic condition,\ntreatments if required, or instructions for what to do if the condition changes. Large masses may result from either\nchronic or acute conditions and depending on cause may worsen causing degradation of normal tissue, infection, or\nphysical impairment. The location of this mass in particular can potentially cause discomfort while the animal is\neating. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian. If no treatment is necessary\ndocumentation including the diagnosis, nature of the condition, the expected prognosis, and any complications to\nwatch for that may indicate the need for additional treatments.\n***The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian has made one minor change regarding the chemical restraint\nmethods being used that did not significantly alter how they conduct chemical restraint. The licensee was unable to\ndescribe exactly what that change was when asked by inspectors. The current program of veterinary care still\nauthorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or\nanalgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat,\nAoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai, Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. The veterinarian has\nadded an assurance that (cid:28)no invasive or painful procedures will be performed on any animal without a veterinarian\npresent or notified before doing so(cid:29). The veterinarian had signed the log book which includes the times and use of\ntranquilizing drugs had been documented for each individual animal; however, the licensee stated he wasn(cid:25)t exactly\nsure what the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s signature on that page indicated. He further stated that the attending\nveterinarian was not present for all of the animals restrained using chemical restraint. According to the log\npresented a total of 10 animals have been restrained using only a paralytic agent since the last inspection.\nAlthough this log contains information regarding species, animal size, dose, and the time (cid:28)down(cid:29) and (cid:28)up(cid:29), there is\nno information regarding staff involved in the procedure, the reason the animal was being restrained and/or\nprocedures that were being done, any monitoring parameters, or notations about recovery.\nSuccinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this\ndrug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered\ndistressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug\ncan also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated\nthey can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,\nor training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis\nof respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available\nwhich are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.\nBecause of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or\nneuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of\ngeneral anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.\nThe licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care\nas required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and\nis likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your\nattending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides\nadequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of\nadministration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all\nchanges or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must\nmaintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.\nThis is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.\nNote: According to the licensee, the five animals identified on the previous inspection as needing veterinary care\nwere not being housed on the premises at the time of this inspection. There are disposition records for the same\nspecies of animals, though individual animal identification numbers were not included on this documentation. The\nmovement of these particular individual animals cannot be farther verified at this time."

  "narrative": "2.40(a)(1)                    REPEAT\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\nThe written program of veterinary care is incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of veterinary\ncare is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites.   Currently the written PVC\ncontains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed.  Additionally, the recommended treatments\nconsist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of\nadministration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no\nmanufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration.  Regarding\nfrequency of administration the written PVC says \"as needed\" for the majority of the species.  There is no guidance\nelsewhere clarifying what \"as needed\" means.  A written program of veterinary care is required when attending\nveterinarians are employed on a part time basis to ensure that the licensee and facility staff understand the direction\nof the Attending Veterinarian and provide a mechanism by which APHIS Officials can determine their compliance\nwith those directions.  Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure good\nwelfare of the animals maintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for\nprevention, control, and treatment of disease.  Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that\ncomplete guidance regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species\nthat are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care.  At\na minimum guidance must include species-specific directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and\nthe prevention, control, and treatment of internal and external parasites. \nThe attending veterinarian has given his authority for \"farm personnel\" to perform tail docking and castrations for\nsheep, goats, Tahr, and Aoudad.  This note does not provide adequate guidance to carry out these procedures:\nthere are no detailed instructions indicating how these procedures are to be done, on what ages of animals, the\nlocation where they are to be performed, if any drugs are to be used and what dose, route, and frequency to give\nthem for each species, and any post-procedural care or complications to watch for. The licensee stated that he is\nthe only person who is doing these procedures, and he is only doing them on sheep and domestic goats. Tail\ndocking and castration can cause significant complications if performed incorrectly, including severe bleeding,\ninfection, retained fertility (if castration is incomplete), and non-healing wounds. Failure to maintain a written\nprogram of veterinary care, including guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or facility staff, does\n\nnot ensure adequate care for the animals on hand. The licensee must obtain adequate guidance including detailed\ninstructions from the attending veterinarian in order to perform these procedures in accordance with accepted\nstandards of adequate veterinary care. Correct by maintaining a written program of veterinary care that includes\nspecific written guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or other facility personnel.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n2.40(a)(2)\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\nA male buffalo exhibiting bilateral corneal opacity is reportedly blind according to facility representatives and as a\nresult has been housed in confinement in the giraffe barn for observation and intermittent treatment since at least\nMarch. On 23 May 2015, the attending veterinarian re-examined this animal and documented that acute and\nconvalescent titers were evaluated for BVD1, BVD2, and IBR (bovine viral diseases). Results showed no significant\nchanges and the record stated that as a result it was considered an inconclusive diagnosis.  The same treatment\nsheet indicated that the buffalo will be euthanized. As of the inspection on 25 August 2015, the buffalo was still\nbeing kept in confinement for observation, and had not been euthanized thus far. This is not ensuring that the\nattending veterinarian has appropriate authority to provide adequate veterinary care for this animal. The licensee\nmust follow the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions and recommendations regarding all aspects of animal care and\nuse. Correct by ensuring the attending veterinarian has the authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary\ncare by following his recommendations for treatments of animals examined.  If the attending veterinarian has\nreconsidered the proposed euthanasia and is recommending an alternate treatment, these changes must be\ndocumented and maintained for future inspection by APHIS officials.  \nCorrect from this day forward.\n2.40(b)(1)                    REPEAT\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\n*** The following medications and equipment were found to be expired during this inspection:\n1.  One box of 22 gauge 1.5(cid:29) hypodermic needles found in the drug storage area of the machine shop expired July\n2014.\n2.  One box of 20 gauge 1.5(cid:29) hypodermic needles found in the drug storage area of the machine shop expired\nNovember 2011.\n3.  6 tubes of ToMorrow (cephapirin benzathine) found in the kitchen area of the horse barn expired on 01\nSeptember 2014\n4.  One multi-dose vial of Resflor Gold was found in the production sheep barn.  The prescription label on this\n\nmulti-dose vial stated it was dispensed on May 4, 2015.  Needle marks on the bottle show it has been already in\nuse.  The manufacturer label on the bottle states (cid:28)use within 28 days of first use.(cid:29)  There is no date to determine\nwhen this bottle was opened and first used.\nThe use of expired drugs or materials can be dangerous to the animals.  Expired drugs may be harmful or\nineffective and expired materials such as sterile needles to be used for injection may lead to infection in the animals.\n  Additionally, using drugs past the manufacturer recommendations can also be harmful to the animals. Correct this\nby using only drugs and material within date and ensure all drugs that are opened for use are dated to ensure use\nper manufacturer recommendations.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLAINT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n2.40(b)(2)                    REPEAT\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\nThe following animals were identified in need of veterinary care during the inspection:\n***A male brown white and black Nubian-type goat without identification had an injured area on its scrotum.  The\nbottom half of the scrotal skin was severely scabbed with hardened debris.  Most of this affected skin appeared\nnecrotic and contaminated with dirt and grass.  When examining the area to ensure that this was not surface debris\nthe gentle wiping caused the area to bleed and there was yellow-white pus localized in pockets.  The upper half of\nthe more normal-appearing scrotum (above this tissue) was swollen and firm.  The goat appeared abnormal when\nrunning (wide legged stance and occasionally shaking a rear leg), although no gait abnormalities were detected at\nthe walk or when standing.  There was no documentation available to indicate that facility personnel had observed\nthis abnormality or were providing any form of treatment.  When asked, the licensee stated that the animal was one\nof several purchased on 15 August 2015 and that all of them were normal at that time.  On 27 August 2015,\ndocumentation was provided by the facility manager from the seller (also a veterinarian) stating that he had\ncastrated the goats prior to sale.  This documentation stated that 3 goats were castrated 3-4 weeks prior to sale and\none 10 days prior to sale using an open castration technique.  Swelling, pain, and infection are all possible\ncomplications of castration and post procedural monitoring is necessary to ensure that animals which develop these\nissues are treated appropriately.  Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated\naccording to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions.\n***A female light gray mini-zebu had an approximately 1-inch by 3-inch area of ocular drainage and darkly stained\nfur under the right eye.  The drainage extended from the middle of the lower lid to the corner of the eye on the nasal\nside and two-thirds of the way down the face towards the mouth.  The zebu was seen squinting her right eye during\nthe inspection.  Eye injuries can be extremely painful, and if left untreated can lead to additional complications such\nas scarring of the cornea, rupture, or blindness of the affected eye.  Correct by having this animal examined by a\n\nlicensed veterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions. \n***A spotted fallow deer in the drive-through area near the entrance gate was lethargic and dull in mentation.  Her\neyes were closed and she was neither eating nor chewing her cud (as all the nearby animals were).  Initially her\nhead was extended with her nose nearly touching the ground though she periodically picked it up holding it upright\nwith eyes still closed.  When stimulated by making noises like revving the engine of the truck, clucking/whistling, and\nslamming the truck door, the fallow deer barely raised her head and failed to startle or open her eyes.  Only when\nthe truck door was within feet of her and opened and slammed shut did this animal open her eyes fully and turn her\nears and head towards the source of the noise.  Other fallow deer that were significantly farther away (had moved\nas the truck approached) startled, turned, and /or moved a short distance farther away from the noise.  Inspectors\nobserved this animal for more than 10 minutes when first encountered in the drive-through area.  On exit of the\ndrive-through park approximately an hour later, the fallow deer was located again in a nearby area and was\nobserved for a similar period of time.  Her appearance and reactions to the same stimuli had not changed. \nLethargy, dull mentation, and lack of cud-chewing in ruminant species are signs of illness and inappetence.  This\nanimal(cid:25)s overall behavior is not normal and indicates that veterinary examination is necessary to properly diagnose\nand treat this animal.  Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated according to\nthe veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions.  NOTE:  At the conclusion of the inspection the licensee asked the Farm Manager to\ngo into the drive through to look for fallow deer that wouldn(cid:25)t move when approached.  On the day of the exit\ninterview the farm manager informed APHIS Officials that facility personnel had driven through the park several\ntimes and were unable to locate any fallow deer that were acting abnormally.  \n***A brown and white female Boer-type goat, #7016, in the Daughty Barn had a significant amount dark brown\nmaterial caked on the tail, peritoneal area, and hind legs that appeared to be loose stool that had dried on the fur. \nThis goat was housed with 5 other goats in the same primary enclosure.  The licensee stated that this animal had\nhad a fecal analysis performed and had been treated for coccidiosis; however, there was no record indicating this\nindividual had a fecal analysis or was examined by a veterinarian. Additionally, a note documented in the farm's\ntreatment logs indicated that this animal and another individual were treated with Di-Methox and ProBios, but there\nis no written authorization in the program of veterinary care on the use of these drugs in goats without additional\nguidance from a licensed veterinarian.  Diarrhea can result from many causes including several infectious diseases\nthat are easily spread between animals in close contact. Additionally, untreated diarrhea can cause excessive\ndehydration, abdominal pain, inappetence, and weight loss. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed\nveterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions including specific information regarding the\nproper dose, frequency, and route of administration for all drugs that are to be used in an off-label manner.\n***A female elk, #0119, was seen in the drive-through area with a large mass on the right side of her jaw. The\nlicensee stated that this animal is an older animal and the mass has been there for years. He indicated that he\nwould attempt to contact the attending veterinarian for any record of the initial evaluation of the mass; however, no\ndocumentation of any examination taking place prior to the inspection was sent to APHIS Officials. There was no\nwritten record that there has been any prior examination or documentation of the nature of this chronic condition,\n\ntreatments if required, or instructions for what to do if the condition changes.  Large masses may result from either\nchronic or acute conditions and depending on cause may worsen causing degradation of normal tissue, infection, or\nphysical impairment. The location of this mass in particular can potentially cause discomfort while the animal is\neating. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian.  If no treatment is necessary\ndocumentation including the diagnosis, nature of the condition, the expected prognosis, and any complications to\nwatch for that may indicate the need for additional treatments.\n***The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian has made one minor change regarding the chemical restraint\nmethods being used that did not significantly alter how they conduct chemical restraint. The licensee was unable to\ndescribe exactly what that change was when asked by inspectors.  The current program of veterinary care still\nauthorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or\nanalgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat,\nAoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai, Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk.  The veterinarian has\nadded an assurance that (cid:28)no invasive or painful procedures will be performed on any animal without a veterinarian\npresent or notified before doing so(cid:29). The veterinarian had signed the log book which includes the times and use of\ntranquilizing drugs had been documented for each individual animal; however, the licensee stated he wasn(cid:25)t exactly\nsure what the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s signature on that page indicated.  He further stated that the attending\nveterinarian was not present for all of the animals restrained using chemical restraint.  According to the log\npresented a total of 10 animals have been restrained using only a paralytic agent since the last inspection. \nAlthough this log contains information regarding species, animal size, dose, and the time (cid:28)down(cid:29) and (cid:28)up(cid:29),  there is\nno information regarding staff involved in the procedure, the reason the animal was being restrained and/or\nprocedures that were being done, any monitoring parameters, or notations about recovery. \nSuccinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this\ndrug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered\ndistressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug\ncan also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated\nthey can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,\nor training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis\nof respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available\nwhich are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia. \nBecause of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or\nneuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of\ngeneral anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care. \nThe licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care\nas required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and\nis likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your\n\nattending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides\nadequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of\nadministration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer.  Documentation of all\nchanges or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must\nmaintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request. \nThis is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.\nNote:  According to the licensee, the five animals identified on the previous inspection as needing veterinary care\nwere not being housed on the premises at the time of this inspection.  There are disposition records for the same\nspecies of animals, though individual animal identification numbers were not included on this documentation.  The\nmovement of these particular individual animals cannot be farther verified at this time.   \n2.40(b)(3)                    REPEAT\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\n*** Five animals were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection including a grey mini-zebu with an eye\ndischarge, a fallow deer in the drive thru that was lethargic, a Nubian goat in the walkthrough area that has a\nswollen scrotum, and a female elk in the drive thru with a jaw mass. Although the facility currently maintains logs of\ndaily observations, all of these veterinary problems were identified by USDA inspectors during this routine\ninspection and were not observed by the facility. All licensees must establish and maintain an adequate program of\nveterinary care which includes daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Additionally, a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian (AV) is required so that timely and\naccurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the AV. Correct by\nensuring that adequate daily observations are conducted and that information is conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian as required.  This continues to be a problem at this facility.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLAINT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n2.75(a)(1)                    REPEAT\nRECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.\nThe following non-compliant items were noted in the records during this inspection:\n   *** Disposition information was missing for the following species / animals:\nSheep: There were 75 sheep present on the last inspection. There are 17 acquisition records for a total of 248\n\nsheep and 20 disposition records for a total of 192 sheep (a total of 131 expected sheep, a difference of 56\nadditional sheep since the last inspection). There were 57 sheep present on today(cid:25)s inspection (18 less total sheep\nthan the previous inspection, and 74 less than expected according to the transfer records up through 24 August\n2015). The facility is missing records of disposition for at least 74 sheep.  Failure to provide accurate records\nimpedes the inspection process and also inhibits the ability to successfully track animal movements. This is\nespecially important in the event of a disease outbreak.\n  Additionally, there are entries in the facility records stating (cid:28)sheep to Indiana from Ohio(cid:29) and (cid:28)ewes to Ura(cid:25)s house.(cid:29)\n  These entries do not fully disclose required information for animals purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or\notherwise controlled by the facility.\nAccurate animal records regarding births, deaths, acquisition and disposition are used to help evaluate the facility's\nanimal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make,\nkeep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals\npurchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his \nor her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor, including any\noffspring born of any animals while in his or her possession or under his control.  Additionally this must include:\n     (i) The name and address of the person form whom the animals were purchased or otherwise\nacquired;\n    (ii) The USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is licensed or registered under the Act;\n    (iii) The vehicle license number and State, and the driver's license number (or photographic identification card for\nnondrivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered under the Act;\n    (iv) The name and address of the person to whom the animal was sold or given;\n    (v) The date of purchase, acquisition, sale or disposal of the animal(s);\n    (vi) The species of the animal(s).\n    (vii) The number of animals in the shipment.\nCorrect by maintaining accurate records regarding all acquisitions (including all births) and dispositions (including all\ndeaths) from this day forward.   \nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n2.131(c)(1)                    REPEAT\nHANDLING OF ANIMALS.\n*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of\nanimals. This includes camels, cows, sheep, goats, African porcupines, kangaroos, muntjac deer, and mini-zebu\n\ncattle. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the pastures near the parking lot, the walk through area\nof the zoo, the production barn, the dairy barn, the Daughty barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to\nthe public.  There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to\nfeed food sold at the entry gate. There are no attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly\nup to enclosures and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for\nthe guests to reach through and touch the animals. Several members of the public were observed putting hands\nand even entire arms in the animal enclosures.  Unattended public contact continues to be a problem at this facility\nand has been documented on many previous inspections.  Continued unattended public contact does not ensure\nsafe public interaction with these animals. During this inspection, the licensee stated that he believes there is no\nneed for a barrier and that the animals and the public need only to take one step back from each other to break any\npotential contact.  A lengthy conversation about this non-compliant item took place during this inspection with the\nlicensee disagreeing that there is a need for barriers or attendants.    He stated that if there were a reason this that\nmade sense, he would consider making changes to his current operation.  Licensees must ensure that during\nperiods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the\ngeneral viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent\npublic contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of\nthese locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n2.131(d)(2)                    REPEAT\nHANDLING OF ANIMALS.\n*** Guests are still allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. Public contact with animals in this\narea is encouraged through the sale of food.  No attendant is present in the drive through area when these\nunaccompanied visits and public contact are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: watusi, elk, eland,\nTahr goat, deer, antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. A hand-out pamphlet given to\nguests at the entry gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but also provides instructions for\nfeeding from the buckets provided.  This facility also has horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows\npublic feeding with an attendant present. During this inspection, the farm manager directed USDA inspectors to the\nkitchen area of the horse barn to review additional instructions for the drivers of the wagons.  On the wall of the\nkitchen area of the horse barn, directions stating the following were found:  (cid:28)Attention Wagon Drivers See list of\nrules cars doing the drive thru are given at the t-booth when checking in.  Wagon drivers are to monoter to ensure\nthey are following rules.  Any violators: If you have any chance to talk to them, do so nicely. If not call on radio for\nhelp Per USDA rules(cid:29)   Allowing guests to feed from vehicles without attendants present does not protect the\nanimals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by\nproviding an attendant at all times during public contact.\n\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n3.125(a)                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \n*** A metal gate panel for the entrance to the pasture housing five 4-horn sheep has a space between the bottom of\nthe gate and the ground that measures at least 8 inches.  Additionally, the fencing from this gate and running to the\nleft approximately 20 feet to the corner of the pasture has areas where the space between the bottom of the fence\nand the ground was at least 8-10 inches depending on the location.  The space under this gate and area of fence is\nlarge enough for the sheep in this enclosure to escape should they be motivated to do so, or be injured if caught\nunder the fencing. The facility must ensure that all enclosures are constructed to protect the animals from injury and\nproperly contain the animals. This space is a potential escape and injury hazard. Correct this by repairing or\nreplacing this gate and section of fencing.\n*** The fence gate at the top of the mini-zebu pasture has loose wires, a section of loose chain link fencing used as\na patch, and a section of loose metal fencing near the ground.  These loose wires and fencing pieces are a potential\ninjury hazard for the animals in this enclosure and must be repaired or replaced to reduce the potential for injury.\nThe licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures housing animals are maintained on a regular basis to properly\ncontain the animals and protect them from injury.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n3.125(d)                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \n*** The large heap of animal waste and bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals continue to\nhave access to this large pile and have been observed on previous inspections browsing and lying in the pile.\nDuring today(cid:25)s inspection, no animals were observed in or on the pile, but additional spent bedding continues to be\nadded to the existing pile. When discussing this concern with the licensee, he stated that he will continue his current\npractices until he is told that there is another process that makes sense.   He maintains that the previous review of\nhis operation by a professor of poultry science who visited the facility to give recommendations and \"strengthen the\ncomposting plan\" ensures that his current practices are safe for the animals.  This previous review did not address\nanimal disease concerns or potential for disease transmission via movement of fecal material and/or potentially\ncontaminated spent bedding from animals in other areas of the zoo into the drive through area. The licensee stated\nthat depending on when the spent bedding is added, it could remain on the surface of the pile for up to a week\nbefore being turned in.  Continued animal contact with this waste pile has been a concern on many previous\n\ninspections (including 4/20/15, 3/2/15, 11/12/14, 6/4/14, 2/19/14, 10/22/13, 6/12/13, and 12/4/12) as this\nunnecessarily exposes the animals to potential disease transmission. Correct this by removing this waste pile and\ndispose of all animal wastes properly.\nTHIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED\n3.129(b)\nFEEDING.    \n*** Along the entire fence line enclosing the 14 goats in the pasture near the house / parking area there is an\naccumulation of spilled feed on the ground. There is also abundant similar spilled feed along the fence lines for\npastures housing the camel, miniature zebu, kangaroo, and African crested porcupine.  The feed appeared as\nthough it had become wet, expanded, and crumbled.  In many places the deteriorated feed was also mixed with\nfeces.  The animals in these enclosures  have access to the feed both on the inside of the enclosure and by\nreaching through the fenceline.  Several goats were observed eating this spilled feed on both sides of the fence. It is\nunclear how long this accumulation has been on the ground. Although public feeding is encouraged at this facility, it\nis still important to implement a mechanism to prevent excess spilled feed from accumulating and deteriorating. \nAccumulated food left on the ground and that mixed with fecal contamination poses a disease risk to the animals if\ningested.  Food shall be placed so as to minimize contamination, and measures shall be taken to prevent molding,\ncontamination, and deterioration or caking of food. Correct by employing measures to prevent these disease\nhazards, like removing old feed that has accumulated on the ground, in order to reduce contamination of the feed. \nCorrect by: September 3, 2015.\n3.131(d)\nSANITATION.   \n*** Evidence of bird pests were found in the hay storage area in the dairy barn.  A bird nest was observed in the\nrafters, a broken egg was found on the floor, and there were feathers and bird droppings on several of the bales in\nthis storage area.  The licensee must ensure an adequate pest control program is established to minimize risks from\nthese avian pests.  Additionally, measures must be in place to ensure the feed in this area is protected from\ncontamination from these pests.   Correct this by establishing an effective pest control program.\nCorrect by: October 1, 2015\n\n** Inspection conducted on August 25, 2015 with the licensee, farm manager, and other facility personnel.
