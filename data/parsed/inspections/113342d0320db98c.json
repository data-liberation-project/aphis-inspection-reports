In the living room there was a kitten (microchip # 985141005227690) \u2013 which was\nidentified at the last inspection on 2/16/2023 as the cat without a microchip number \u2013 that still has diarrhea (color and\nconsistency of melted chocolate) throughout his litter box, but otherwise appeared normal. Also in the living room, in an\nenclosure housing the mom and a total of five kittens, there was a kitten that was underweight (BCS of 2-3/9) and a mild-\nmoderate amount of black exudate in both ears, where it was scratching at its ears, but otherwise appeared normal. This\nkitten was the smallest of the bunch and identified by the facility representative as having had trouble eating/thriving\nearlier in its life. One of the adult female Leopard cats (microchip #985141005229824) that was identified with having\n[watery] diarrhea, had a dull appearance, was underweight (BCS = 2/9), and had periods of squinting in her right eye. The\nother animals that were identified with diarrhea (also the color and consistency of melted chocolate) during this inspection\nwere: two male Leopard cats (microchip #: 98112011806118 and 985112011806600) housed inside of the home in the\nfirst room on the left off of the hallway; cage # 10 housing one male Leopard cat, one female Bengal/Leopard cat hybrid,\nand one female Bengal in the cattery/garage in the third enclosure to the left; and one of the female Bengal cats\n(microchip #: 985112011806548), also housed in the cattery/garage, in the first enclosure on the left (this was also one of\nthe cats identified on the last inspection as having diarrhea).\nThe licensee has not had the cats identified during today\u2019s inspection seen by her attending veterinarian (AV), only a fecal\nsample collected and assessed by the AV. The licensee did not have the cats identified with diarrhea at the last site visit\nexamined by the veterinarian, as per the corrective actions of this subpart in that report. Failure to use appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can foster an unhealthy environment, delay the\nonset of diagnosing and treating ailments, and can consequently lead to unnecessary suffering. Each dealer shall\nestablish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. All cats that the inspector identified in this citation need to be examined\nby a veterinarian."
