This worn area has pieces of plastic missing exposing the wire fencing beneath it and creating jagged\nedges. A single piece of plastic that is approximately 1.5 inch in width by 2.5 inches in length, has been stripped partially\naway from this panel.\nWithin this enclosure is a dog kennel located in the back left corner. The plastic panel is adjacent to the kennel and has\nclaw marks that start at approximately 1.5ft away from the top of the kennel. Above the kennel and approximately 8\ninches from the torn plastic panel are 4 exposed roofing nails. These nails project from the metal roof exposing its shank\nand tip into the enclosure.\nAreas of worn and broken plastic can cause harm to the animal if ingested. The placement of the kennel next to the wall\ncan help create a platform for the animal to jump on. If used this way, the act of jumping on it can put the animal in close\ncontact with the sharp ends of the nails leading to potential injury. The licensee must ensure that the facility is constructed\nof materials that are of appropriate strength for the animals involved. Indoor and outdoor facilities must be structurally\nsound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain them.\nTo be corrected by 8/15/2025."
