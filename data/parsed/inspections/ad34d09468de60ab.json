      "narrative": "A male Poodle, (cid:28)Rocket(cid:29) microchip #076623263, was observed in his enclosure with severe matting on his head,\nneck, back, chest, abdomen, and legs. He was also observed sitting in a hunched position and almost unwilling to\nmove. The matting of the hair was so tightly bound that it was pulling on the skin, which was easily visible in\nbetween the matts, that the skin was reddened in some areas. The matting on the abdomen, legs and feet\nappeared dark brown and moist. Matting of the hair coat can be painful, can lead to the development of skin\ninfections, and reduces the ability of the coat to insulate the animal. In addition to the matting of the hair coat, this\ndog also had an extremely foul odor emitting from his mouth. Upon closer observation it was noted that his tongue\nwas partially protruding from his mouth and there is a heavy accumulation of a light to dark brown material covering\nthe majority of the cheek and back teeth, of which some could not be visualized. The gum line is reddened and\nswollen and there is a whitish to cream colored line of material. These signs are consistent with the presence of\ndental disease, which can be painful, lead to the development of other health problems, and can inhibit the ability of\nthe animal to eat normally.\nA red male Pomeranian, microchip #010813009, was observed sitting by himself in the back corner of the outside\nsection of his sheltered enclosure. He was observed shaking and scratching almost constantly during the time he\nwas observed. Upon closer observation of this dog it was noted that under his matted hair coat the majority of the\nskin was covered with yellowish sand-like granules. The facility representative was not aware of this condition until\nit was pointed out to her by the inspectors. This could be a sign of a medical condition. The matting of the hair coat\nwas observed on his neck, chest, back, abdomen, and legs. Matting of the hair coat can be painful, can lead to the\ndevelopment of skin infections, and reduces the ability of the coat to insulate the animal.\nA male Lhasa Apso, (cid:28)Romeo(cid:29) microchip #047348261, was observed in his enclosure with a heavily matted hair coat\non his face with large golf ball sized clumps of a dark brown grainy material entangled with the hair. These large\nclumps of hair and brown grainy material greatly reduced his field of vision. This could be a sign of a medical\ncondition. In addition to the matted condition of the face this dog was also heavily matted on his chest, abdomen,\nlegs, and feet. The matted hair was bound closely to the skin. Matting of the hair coat can be painful, can lead to\nthe development of skin infections, and reduces the ability of the coat to insulate the animal. The facility\nrepresentative was not aware of this condition until it was pointed out to her by the inspectors.\nA female Beagle, microchip #047368034, was observed limping on her left hind leg. This dog was mostly\nnon-weight bearing on this leg. The facility representative stated that the dog had gotten out of her enclosure a few\nweeks ago, became injured and was evaluated by a veterinarian at that time with no treatment prescribed. This dog\nis still showing signs of pain and needs to be re-evaluated by a veterinarian for more accurate diagnosis and\ntreatment plan.\nThe licensee was verbally instructed to have the above stated animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an\naccurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan, and for the dogs affected by matting to receive hair coat\nmaintenance by close of business on Wednesday 29 October 2014. The outcome of these exams must be\ndocumented and provided to the inspector upon request. Licensee must ensure that all veterinary care issues are\naddressed in a timely manner.\nA female black Labrador Retriever, (cid:28)Shadow(cid:29) microchip #010860001, has a deep, approximately \u00bd inch, open\nwound on the right side of her muzzle. The wound is approximately 1 \u00bd inch in diameter with a crusty brown to\nyellow material around circumference of the wound. In addition to the wound on the muzzle the pad above the\npastern on the left front leg also has an open wound. This wound is at the base of the pad next to the leg and is\napproximately 2 inches in length. The facility representative stated that this dog was in a fight the previous day and\nthat she had removed the dog from the enclosure, and treated the dog with a (cid:28)shot of penicillin(cid:29) but had not\ncontacted or consulted with a veterinarian.\nA female white Husky, microchip #047351095, was observed limping on her right rear leg. The licensee had not\nnoticed this until it was pointed out to her by the inspectors and had not contacted or consulted with a veterinarian.\nThis could be a sign of an injury or other medical condition.\nA female Cocker Spaniel, microchip #010531612, was observed rubbing her abdomen on the floor of the enclosure.\nUpon closer observation it was noted that the abdomen was hairless and had several small reddened bumps. The\nfacility representative was not aware of this condition until it was pointed out to her by the inspectors. This could be\na sign of a contact allergy or another medical condition.\nA female Cocker Spaniel, microchip #021063566, was observed with a greenish (cid:19) yellow discharge on the surface\nand around the left eye. There is also some crusted brownish colored material around the outside of the left eye\nentangled with the hair. The facility representative was not aware of this condition until it was pointed out to her by\nthe inspectors. This could be a sign of an injury or other medical condition. This dog also had large, lemon-sized,\nmatted hair on her right ear. This matted hair appeared wet and dirty. This dog needs to be groomed.\nA male red Poodle, microchip # 047378792, was observed with a clouded, light blue to gray in color, right eye. The\nfacility representative was not aware of this condition until it was pointed out to her by the inspectors.
