After talking with the\ninspector, it was determined, they need to be licensed as a class \u201cB\u201d license with USDA. They negotiate or arrange for the\npurchase, sale, or transport of the animals in commerce. This individual stated they understood and would get licensed\nbefore conducting regulated activity. They sent a text to the inspector shortly after this phone call stating, \u201cThank you for\nexplaining everything to me today. I\u2019m definitely getting licensed.\u201d\nOn 1-August-2022, the inspector found evidence that this individual had received 11 dogs from the USDA licensed facility\non 31-July-2022. The inspector visited the site but was unable to contact this individual at that time. Shortly after leaving\nthe site, the individual called the inspector, and the following information was collected from that phone call. They\ntransported 11 dogs; 2 dogs were approximately 10-12 weeks of age; 2 dogs were approximately 1 year old and 7 dogs\nwere approximately 6 years or older per this individual. The individual kept one older adult dog as a personal pet and\ntransported the other 10 to another person. This individual refused the inspector several times to provide any information\nabout the person who received the 10 dogs during phone calls on 1-August-2022 and 3-August-2022. The individual\nstated that they understood what they did was wrong, but they are unwilling to get anyone else in trouble.\nFailure to be licensed as a class \u201cB\u201d license does not ensure the animals were transported in an appropriate and humane\nmanner. It also does not ensure that APHIS officials can track the movement of animals involved in regulated activity.\nThe individual must become licensed with a class \u201cB\u201d license before conducting regulated activity.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nn"
