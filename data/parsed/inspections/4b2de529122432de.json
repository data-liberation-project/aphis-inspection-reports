An employee was tending to the animal's general husbandry by washing and filling up a circular\nmetal tub (approximately 3 feet in diameter) with water. While tending to the otter, the employee dropped the tub on\nthe animal and the otter died due to the injuries caused by this incident. Following the incident, proper disciplinary\naction was taken and the facility developed preventable measures.\nThe handling of animals should be done in a manner that prevents trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort. All animals must be handled in ways that prevent stress or physical harm to their well\nbeing.\nCorrected by: This day forward"

Perimeter fences must be properly constructed as a secondary containment so as to protect and contain\nthe regulated species and prevent unwanted entry by animals and unauthorized persons.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager."
