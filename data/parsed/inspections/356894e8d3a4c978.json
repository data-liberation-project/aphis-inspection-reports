      "narrative": "On August 6th, discussions with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) for this facility revealed that she did not have experience\ntreating exotic species beyond small pocket pets such as guinea pigs and ferrets. After inspectors explained the role and\nresponsibilities of an attending veterinarian for USDA licensed facilities, the AV expressed concern over her ability and\navailability to continue as the attending. The AV repeatedly said she was not comfortable treating exotic animals. Per her\nexplanation, she had not received training or had experience in the care and management of the various exotic species\npresent at the auction. She also commented that it would be unlikely she could be available to attend to veterinary care\nneeds for the entire duration of the auction (Tuesday-Sunday).\nFurthermore, the AV was unsure of her responsibilities and role as the facility\u2019s Attending Veterinarian. She explained that\nthe facility\u2019s Office Manager had given her a blank Program of Veterinary Care and a Blue Book without further\nexplanation. Additionally, the Office Manager had not explained the AV\u2019s role at the facility. Inspectors found that the AV\nhad not physically examined the animals in the \u201cwarm room\u201d and most of the animals in the auction barn pens beyond a\nfew individual animals requiring health certificates. She was unaware she was allowed to do so.\nDuring a walk through of the barn pens with the AV, a female camel was identified by inspectors as a concern due to the\npresence of an open draining abscess on her right mammary gland. The Office Manager was contacted as well as the\nowner of the camel. The owner of the camel requested that the AV treat her with an antibiotic, Draxxin. Inspectors\nwitnessed the AV admitting that she did not know the proper dosage for a camel. The owner of the camel instructed the\nAV to dose the camel the same as a cow and provided her the animal\u2019s approximate weight. The Office Manager also\napproved of the suggestion by the camel owner. When inspectors requested that the temperature of the camel be taken\nprior to receiving the antibiotic, the AV admitted that she did not have a thermometer and did not feel comfortable taking\nthe camel\u2019s temperature. The Office Manager and owner offered to locate and provide a thermometer with the statement\nthat the AV would not have to do \u201cany hands-on work\u201d on the animal.\nInspectors were unable to review the program of veterinary care due to a refusal of inspection by the Office Manager on\nAugust 7th. Lack of a valid program of veterinary care and an attending veterinarian with training and/or experience in the\ncare and management of the exotic species present at this auction puts animals at risk for improper treatment of disease\nand injury. Additionally, it can lead to suffering and death. The licensee must have an attending veterinarian who shall\nprovide adequate veterinary care to its animals. The attending veterinarian must have received training and/or experience\nin the care and management of the species being attended. Correct from this day forward."
