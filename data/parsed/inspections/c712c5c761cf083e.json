There is no specific guidance for the parasite control of various species, only a list\nof drugs. Species specific dosing and route is not included for any species or drug in either PVC. There is no\nspecific clinic or veterinarian specified for emergency care. For capture and restraint method there is listed only\nchemical restraint with no species specific drugs, dosing or route. Additionally there is no guidance for anesthesia\nmonitoring, recovery or other pre or post procedural care where specific guidance is required. The method of\neuthanasia lists injectable euthanasia solution but does not provide any species specific drugs, dose or route for the\nlicensee to use. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee.\nTreatment records provided by the facility document that animals have been treated without written attending\nveterinarian guidance such as goats treated for lameness.\nAdditional specific guidance is required for the Programs of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate\nguidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does\nnot ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by\ndeveloping and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.\nThis is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.\nAn exit briefing was conducted on September 30, 2015 with the facility vice president."
