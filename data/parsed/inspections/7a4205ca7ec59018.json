      "narrative": "At time of inspection the following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:\nA tri-colored (brindle, tan, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #36 housing 9 adults and 1 newborn was observed\nwith hair loss over the right lower back and rump that was approximately 2 inches in diameter. The underlying skin was\nred, irritated, and had actively draining lesions and scabs. There was another area of hair loss on the left medial lower\nback that was approximately 1 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.\nA tri-colored (brown, tan, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #56 housing 8 adults and 1 newborn was observed\nwith hair loss on over both sides of the lower back and rump. The right area was approximately 2 inches in diameter. The\nunderlying skin was red and thickened with multiple areas of lesions and crusts. On the left side, there were two areas of\nhair loss. The anterior area was approximately 1/2 of an inch in diameter and the posterior area was approximately 1.5\ninches in diameter. The underlying skin was red and thickened with multiple areas of lesions and crusts.\nA tri-colored (tan, black, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #57 housing 10 adults and 10 newborns was observed\nwith extensive hair loss on the lower back and rump that was approximately 5 inches in length that encircled the back.\nThe underlying skin was red and thickened with actively draining lesions with red discharge and crusts. There was one\narea on the left lower back with thick, white, actively draining discharge.\nA white adult female guinea pig in enclosure #5 housing 11 adults and 14 newborns was observed with moderate\ngeneralized hair thinning on both sides of the lower back. The underlying skin was crusty.\nA tri-colored (reddish brown, brown, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #16 housing 10 adults and 15 newborns\nwas observed with severe hair loss on the left lower back that was approximately 3 inches in diameter. The underlying\nskin was thickened with open, draining wounds. Toward the middle of the back, the underlying skin was crusty with scabs\npresent. The animal was observed continuing to bite at the affected areas.\nA tri-colored (brindle, tan, white) adult female guinea pig in enclosure #22 housing 7 adults and 3 newborns was observed\nwith a cloudy and dull left eye that was much smaller than the right eye with thick, white ocular discharge.\nOne newborn was found dead in enclosure #4. The lower half of its body had been cannibalized.\nTwo recent newborns were found dead in enclosure #28.\nThere were no records to determine if these animals with hair loss, crusty skin, and/or with scabs were observed prior to\nthis inspection. There were no treatment records or medications present to treat these animals. The program of veterinary\ncare mentions bacterial skin infections. For treatment, it states \"[s]eparate animals as soon as possible. If superficial,\ntopical neosporin. If severe, consult a veterinarian.\"\nA failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of\ncare provided to animals and can prolong animal health problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their\nhealth and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.\nThese 6 guinea pigs with veterinary conditions identified above require examination by a veterinarian to prevent\nworsening of the conditions and unnecessary suffering. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such\nexamination and treatment to APHIS officials upon request. Remains uncorrected."
