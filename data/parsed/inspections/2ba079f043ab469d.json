      "narrative": "At the time of inspection, several birds were identified in need of veterinary care. The facility had not identified the\ncondition affecting many of those birds while others were known but had not been communicated with the attending\nveterinarian.\nThe following birds had conditions that were not identified by the facility:\n- In the cockatiel aviary, a dominant yellowcheek cockatiel was seen alone, perched on the side rail, at a corner of the\nenclosure. The bird was completely missing all his tail feathers, and the feathers at the back of his head. Feathers were\nalso missing on the top section of his left wing, creating an approximately 1-inch-long area of exposed pink skin. The bird\nwalked on the floor or climbed the side of the enclosure not seeming able to fly thus also not able to use the perches or\nenrichment items within the enclosure. When walking, he was seen limping on the left leg.\n- A Peach-faced lovebird in the large mix small birds\u2019 aviary had many of the feathers on the right side of his face and\nneck plucked off. The skin underneath appeared pink/red and the few remaining feathers were moist clinging to his face.\nThe right eye was abnormal and all that could be seen was a small black dot where the eye should be. This bird was in\nthe same condition at the last inspection but was not evaluated by a veterinarian.\n- A Lutino cockatiel in the mix small birds\u2019 aviary had a completely hairless right leg and connecting lower right abdomen\narea. The skin underneath appeared dark red and three small ulcerative lesions were seen at the intersection between\nthe leg and the abdomen. Per the facility\u2019s records, this bird was seen on May 3, 2024 by the vet to examine the hairless\nright leg. However, the bird did not have the lesions at the time and the facility did not identify this change in his condition.\n- The African Grey was seen with an approximately 1-inch-long section on the chest where the hair had been plucked.\n- Several other birds, 2 in the cockatiel enclosure and 2 in the mix small birds\u2019 enclosure, were seen with feathers missing\nfrom the back of the head. The facility had identified and provided medical care for one but not for the others.\nThe facility knew of the condition affecting the following 2 birds but had not communicated these findings with the\nveterinarian claiming that these birds \u201chave always been this way\u201d:\n- One cockatiel in the cockatiel aviary had a completely hairless head, face and neck exposing the grey skin underneath.\n- A Brozefallow cockatiel in the mix small birds\u2019 aviary was seen with a mostly hairless neck, a large section of feathers\nmissing from the top of the head and a missing toe on the right foot.\nFailure to identify such conditions and to communicate findings with the veterinarian, delays treatment and causes undue\nanimal pain and distress. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all the birds must be implemented to properly\nassess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for\ntimely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. The currently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an\nappropriate diagnosis and treatment plan."
