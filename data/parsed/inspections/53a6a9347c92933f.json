All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and\nwell-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and\naccurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.\nThese 3 guinea pigs identified with masses require examination and treatment by the attending veterinarian to prevent\nworsening of the conditions.
