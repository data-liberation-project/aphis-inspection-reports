At this\ntime the wildlife staff conclude that the duck has been taken off property, escaped or is deceased. The ducks at this\nfacility are flight-restricted and are allowed to freely roam within the outdoor housing facility.\nFailure to conduct daily observations of this bird does not allow for accountability of the bird in the collection or for\nmonitoring changes in health status or injury, which may lead to animal death. Daily observation of all animals must be\nperformed to assess their health and well-being. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
