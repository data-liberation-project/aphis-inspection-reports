A ticket booth vendor was sitting in sight of the barn, but the person in the ticket booth\ncould not act as an attendant as it was impossible to see and manage all of the activity between the public and the\ngiraffe at all times. A facility employee immediately added an additional barrier to the barn entrance so that the\npublic could not have any contact with the giraffe without an attendant present.\nAppropriate barriers and/or distance between animals and the general viewing public must in place to assure the\nsafety of the animals and the public.\nMaintain correct from this day forward.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility employee.
