These three juvenile sheep, assigned to a\nUSDA-regulated IACUC protocol, were diagnosed via fecal floatation with gastrointestinal parasites. Under veterinary\ndirection, the herd Animal Care Manager administered levamisole and other medications. The Animal Care Manager\ncontacted a veterinarian immediately after observing muscle tremors, a clinical sign of possible toxicity, however all three\njuvenile sheep died approximately 30-60 minutes after the levamisole was administered.\nThe facility promptly reviewed all treatments and doses and determined the Animal Care Manager was supposed to\nadminister the recommended volume of 15mls of diluted \u201cStandard Drench Solution\u201d (\u00bd fluid oz/50lbs) but had instead\nprepared and gave 15mls of the \u201cConcentrated Drench Solution\u201d (2mls per 50lbs). This error resulted in the Animal Care\nManager administering 15mls of concentrated drench instead of 2mls causing an acute levamisole toxicity and death.\n***On October 27, 2021 a female Mexican free-tailed bat escaped from a research staff member\u2019s hand while it was being\nhand fed. While trying to locate the bat on the floor, the staff member moved a large shelving unit on wheels and injured\nthe bat. The bat was euthanized immediately due to the injuries it sustained.\nInadequate training in the proper handling and care of animals can lead to injuries or death. The research facility must\nensure that all personnel with direct animal contact are qualified and properly trained in the handling and care for the\nvarious species of animals used by the facility. It is the responsibility of the research facility to provide continued training\nand instruction to all personnel with sufficient frequency to fulfill the research facility\u2019s responsibility and maintain the\nhealth and well-being of the animals.\nCorrections had been instituted prior to the inspection by retraining all protocol personnel with animal care responsibilities\non handling and protocol techniques.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nEnd Section"
