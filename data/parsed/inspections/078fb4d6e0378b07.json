Flies were noted sitting and flying all over the shavings on the floor of the spider\nmonkey enclosure and the floor of the marmoset enclosure. The screen door to the indoor portion of the housing\nwas damaged leaving a large gap between the top of the door and the door frame allowing flies free access to the\nbuilding. Food debris present on the floor of the spider monkey enclosure appeared to be attracting the flies. No\nevidence of any pest control program such as fly traps or fly strips were present. Flies can act as irritants to the\nmonkeys, keep them from accessing the indoor portion of their housing and can spread disease. The facility shall\ndevelop and follow an effective program for the control of insect pests in the indoor portion of the monkey housing.\nCorrect by July 15, 2019."
