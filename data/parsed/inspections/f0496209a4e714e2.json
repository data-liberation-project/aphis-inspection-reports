The licensee was aware of the issue, but had not done\nanything for the dog. Skin conditions on dogs can cause irritations to the dog.\nThe licensee was following a different protocol than the program of veterinary care for routine shots and deworming,\nand also added Metronidazole and Albon without consulting their attending vet. There were also medicines on hand\nthat had no directions from a veterinarian. Giving medications to dogs or puppies without the direction of a\nveterinarian may harm the animals.\nThe licensee must consult a veterinarian about the skin condition, giving medicines without veterinary direction, and\nupdate the program of veterinary care to reflect what is being done in the kennel.\nTo be corrected by: March 13, 2020."
