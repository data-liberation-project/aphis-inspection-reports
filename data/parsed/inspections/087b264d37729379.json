The attending vet has not examined these animals to assess their health as a\nbaseline of care. The current professional standard of care for non human primates is that during a quarantine\nperiod the animals would have a vet assessment to assure their health care needs are being met and to rule out\nany zoonotic disease hazards including TB. In addition one of the capuchins was to be transferred out of state to\nanother facility the next day and did not have a valid health certificate at the time of the inspection. The facility\nneeds to have the animals assessed by the vet for their health and well being and to ensure the vet has proper\nauthority in the guidance and care of the animals. In addition a valid health certificate must accompany the animal\nout of state.\nCorrect Immediately.\n(The licensee contacted the inspector by phone within an hour to state he had vet appointments for both animals)\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection."
