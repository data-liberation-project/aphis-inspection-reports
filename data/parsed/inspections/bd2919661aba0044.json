The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel\npoles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest\nupon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep\nroots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is\napproximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. There is now an 8 foot high tensile wire barrier fence approximately\n20 feet from the front of the enclosure.\nThe enclosure currently houses a -4 year old male lion and a \u2013 3 year old female lion with limited mobility. The\nenclosure is only 12 feet in height. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure\ncontainment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats,\nmodifications to the enclosure to increase the height must be made to prevent escape.\nNOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were made.\n*** The following additional structural strength items were noted during this inspection:\n***Pot belly Pigs: A portion of the buried wire fencing is exposed and bent upwards along the front of the enclosure.\nThe corner edge of the fence is pointed and could potentially be a source of injury to the animals in the enclosure.\nThere is exposed wire fencing along the majority of the back side of the enclosure on the ground which could injure\nthe legs of the pigs. Fencing must be constructed in a manner that prevents the animals from escaping or injuring\nitself. The exposed portion of buried fence must be removed or buried in a manner that will prevent the potbelly pigs\nfrom exposing and pulling up the fencing for their safety and proper containment.\n***The bottom fencing for the bear, alpaca, and potbelly pig enclosures have edges that leave sharp points. The\nanimals can come in direct contact with these areas and injure themselves. Modifications must be made to the\nbottoms of the fence to eliminate the sharp points or prevent the animals from coming into contact with the points.\n***Bale twine is securing gates in some of the primary enclosures including five (5) llamas, and kulan. The gate for\nthe back pasture of goats and sheep is secured with a black bungee cordon one side and bale twine on the other\nside of the gate. Enclosure fencing and gates must be properly attached to poles and gates must be secured in a\nmanner that prevent unwanted entry into the enclosure to contain the animals and to prevent injury.\n***The shift door slide to the bear shelter is detached and protruding outwards. Without the shift door working\nproperly the bears cannot be closed off safely for cleaning the dens. Additionally, the bears could be injured by the\nprotruding piece of metal that extends into the enclosure. The shift door must be repaired to prevent injury to the\nbears and ensure the animals can be shifted when needed.\n***The enclosure fence for the sheep/goats (back pasture) and deer secured fencing is damaged. There are\ndetached sections of fencing and section at the front of the deer that are bent downward. The fence must be\nrepaired\n***The door to the outdoor tiger enclosure was being secured by a rachet strap and two hinges on the right side of\nthe gate. Correction: Additional chains and locks were added to the right side of the gate during the inspection.\nAll primary animal enclosures shall be structurally sound, maintained in good repair and constructed in a manner to\nprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals."
