The defect was\nvisible across almost the entire width of the ceiling and penetrated the dry wall and paint. Although no water stains\nwere seen in the ceiling, the area surrounding the defect appeared moist and prolonged rainfall has recently\noccurred in the area. Continued deterioration may cause the dry wall ceiling to collapse into the room. Facility\npersonnel indicated the exterior roof will be checked for possible leaks immediately.\nAll animal housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to prevent injury to the animals and\nfacilitate required husbandry procedures. The above identified non-compliances should be repaired or replaced.\nCorrect by: April 13, 2017."
