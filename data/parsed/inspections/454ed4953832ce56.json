During\nreintroduction of the male and female following her recovery from surgical amputation of her right front leg on\n2/19/17, growling and swatting behaviors were exhibited in the shift hallway on the 25th and 26th. On the morning\nof the 27th, growling again occurred and the male shifted into the exhibit. The female remained in the hallway and\nwould not enter the exhibit with the male. The animals were left together with access to exhibit and shift hallway.\nPer the specimen report, in the afternoon, the male was observed to be \u201cchewing on the head\u201d of the deceased\nfemale in the exhibit. There was evidence of a fight in the shift hallway. The female was deceased and had many\nscratches and bite wounds, her amputation site was opened up and she was missing a 5 x 4 cm area of skin on top\nof skull and right ear.\nJulius, the 11 year old male giraffe #208070 suffering from chronic lameness who was euthanized on April 13, 2017,\nexperienced antagonistic behavior from Jabari, the 7 year old male giraffe with whom he was housed. The necropsy\nreport states that Julius had been \u201charassed and been forced into the corner of the exhibit\u201d the day before his death\nand there were many previous instances of Jabari pushing and herding Julius around documented in his record.\nManagement had recommended on 3/16/17 that the giraffes be separated during the day. Separation occurred for\nseveral hours a day but the intimidation continued. Necropsy results revealed a torn infra-spinatus muscle in the left\nshoulder with deep hemorrhage and torn connective tissue. There were older healing areas on the left lateral neck\nwith evidence of previous trauma incidents.\nCompatibility of animals may change following an illness, injury or surgery. Aggressive behavior towards an already\ndebilitated animal can increase stress and cause further injuries to the animal. Animals being reintroduced or who\nare experiencing a chronic situation (pain, lameness) need to be closely observed for compatibility and separated if\nneeded to prevent discomfort, injury or death.\nTo be corrected from this point forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nThis inspection report closes out the incients under review from IR #2016082568294028 dated 16 May 2017."
