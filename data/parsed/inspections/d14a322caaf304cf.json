      "narrative": "* \"Maisey\", a five year old tan and white, ShihTzu, female, (ID # 004357808) had an excessive buildup of a greenish\nbrown to brown tarter on the upper front, cheek and canine teeth (the large carnassial tooth) extending up to the\ngum line. The tarter covered over half of the canine and front teeth. The upper back cheek teeth could not be\nvisualized and had a buildup of tarter. The gums were swollen and dark pink to light purple. This dog also had a\nmild watery discharge from both eyes and the hair around the mouth was mildly wet.\nThe buildup of abnormal tarter on teeth can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the\nhealth of the animal. Eye discharge and drooling from the mouth can occur due to infection, allergies, injury,\nirritation or other medical conditions that could be painful.\n* \"Cookie\", a five year old chocolate and white, Cocker Spaniel, female, (ID # 025798513) had an excessive buildup\nof a brown tarter on the upper front, cheek and canine teeth (the large carnassial tooth) extending up to the gum\nline. The tarter covered over half of the canine and front teeth. The upper back cheek teeth could not be visualized\nand had a buildup of tarter.\nThe buildup of abnormal tarter on teeth can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the\nhealth of the animal.\n*An adult, fawn colored, five year old male Pug, (ID# 841008009), has a thick build-up of grayish-brown tartar\ncovering the upper-half of most of its teeth. The gums are reddened and moderately swollen. There is a pronounced\narea of gum recession directly above the upper right canine tooth. There is also a creamy gray discharge present\nalong the upper gum line.\n*A cream colored, adult, male Poodle (ID#604520312), has an abnormal build-up of dark brownish tartar covering\nthe upper-half of most of its teeth. The gums are also reddened and swollen. The upper front teeth also have a\ncreamy gray discharge along the gum line.\nThe abnormal build-up of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures, be painful,\nimpact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal.\nThe dogs listed above have not yet seen a license veterinarian for tarter buildup. The licensee stated, that they were\naware they needed to be cleaned.\nThe licensee must have the dogs examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: March 20, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).\nThis inspection will be sent by e-mail.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRanslem Corbin, Animal Care Inspector"
