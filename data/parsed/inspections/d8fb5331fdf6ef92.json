In order to normalize the animal's core temperature during the procedure, a staff member\nwas directed by a veterinarian to use a hot air source; however, the nozzle of this hot air source was inappropriately\nplaced in a location which subsequently led to thermal injuries and later, euthanasia.\nIt is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians,\nand other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform necessary or directed\nduties.

      "narrative": "Review of facility records for a cynomolgus macaque which was euthanized in August 2015 due to complications\nresulting from an approved procedure indicate that the animal did not receive adequate veterinary care during this\nprocedure.\nAccording to anesthesia records, there was a period of over 30 minutes in which no temperature was recorded\nwhile the animal was under anesthesia for this procedure. This is contrary to the approved protocol which states\nthat a rectal temperature will be continuously monitored under anesthesia. By monitoring the temperature at more\nfrequent intervals, changes in temperature may be identified and addressed sooner. Records indicate that the\nwarming blanket used to maintain body temperature during anesthesia had not been turned on by the veterinary\nteam. Subsequently, the veterinarian authorized the use of a hot air source in an attempt to raise the animal(cid:25)'s body\ntemperature; however the source was inappropriately placed by a staff member and led to thermal injuries to the\nanimal.\nA review of this adverse event indicates that although a clinical veterinarian was present during the procedure, there\nwas a failure of appropriate communication and oversight. The result led to the inappropriate placement of a hot air\nsource by an individual staff member and subsequent animal injury severe enough that euthanasia was warranted.\nFailure to provide animals with appropriate methods of veterinary care and oversight during approved procedures\nmay cause unnecessary pain and distress to the animal.\nEach research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the availability\nand use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to the animals.\nThe research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting a thorough investigation, self-reporting\nthe incident, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Corrective\nactions provided retraining of all personnel involved in the procedure including monitoring associated with this\nprotocol.\nThis item has been corrected by the facility.\nThis inspection was conducted on 04/26/2016 and 04/27/2016.\nExit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
