There were no vital signs entered at the 8:15pm and 8:30pm and timepoints\n2. No entries of PCO2 from 2:45pm-6:15pm and the CO2 monitor was not working for an unspecified amount of time.\n3. No blood pressure readings for the noon-2:00pm timepoints and the 7:30pm-11:15pm timepoints\nNoted in the surgical records was an incident in which the tracheal tube was noted to have filled with phlegm at 2:45am.\nAppropriate interventions were administered but Pig #9 ultimately died under anesthesia because of a decline of its vital\nsigns and O2 desaturation. Records indicate the EtCO2 ranged from 21- 35 mm Hg from 7:55am to 2am. The EtCO2\nvalue was out of range except between 11pm \u2013 2am. (The protocol indicates the EtCO2 would be monitored and\nmaintained at 40 +/- 5.) The pO2 was within normal range until 2:45am when phlegm was noted in the tracheal tube.\nPersonnel responsible for monitoring the pig #9 under anesthesia missed timepoints for monitoring as indicated in the\nprotocol and facility SOPs and failed to recognize in a timely manner that the animal was not being adequately\noxygenated as outlined in the study protocol.\nThe protocol indicates the principal investigator will provide training and that inexperienced personnel will be under the\ndirection of the principal investigator or senior investigators. Personnel were not following the guidelines for monitoring\nand interventions outlined in the protocol. Some personnel involved in the study are not adequately trained in the process\nand interpretation of monitoring of all vital signs as indicated in the facility surgery records.\nAn appropriate training program must be implemented that ensures all persons on the study are properly trained to\nperform the necessary procedures and is knowledgeable of monitoring parameters of vital signs as outlined in the\nprotocol and in surgical documents. This training must occur before any additional procedures are performed under for\nthe welfare of the animals on Protocol A.
