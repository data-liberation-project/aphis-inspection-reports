The hairless skin is generally\nthickened and dark in color. There are some lighter colored scabs on the abdomen and some linear red scratches\nwith scabs on the neck and under the ears. The is a small amount of thick discharge in and around both eyes. The\n(cid:28)\"white\"(cid:29) of the left eye is more red than the right eye.\nThere is a thick coating of greenish-brown material coating the entire surface of all of the upper premolars and some\nof the upper canine teeth and remaining incisors. There is one upper loose premolar tooth on each side. The gums\nare recessed away from the upper canine teeth and remaining incisors and there is a greenish brown discharge\nalong the gum line of the upper left premolar teeth. These signs are consistent with dental disease in dogs.\nDental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the\nability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The hair loss and skin abnormalities can\nbe caused by a variety of medical problems and can be itchy and painful. The linear red scratches are consistent\nwith ongoing scratching at the skin. Eye problems can be caused by infection, trauma (including rubbing/scratching\nat self) and a variety of other medical problems and can be painful.\nThe animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis\nis obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,\ntreatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\nThis routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO\nand Kendall Lundy, ACI.\nAdditional Inspectors\nShaver Margaret, Veterinary Medical Officer"
