      "narrative": "Several guinea pigs were observed during inspection with a variety of medical conditions. This included:\n1. In Pen #7, an adult female with mostly black hair with some tan was noted to have 2 firm movable masses under\nits chin. The masses were approximately 1 inch in diameter each. This animal also had a slightly bulging right eye\nand the animal appeared to be blinking more frequently over that eye. No ocular discharge was noted. The bulging\neye had not been noted by the licensee.\n2. In Pen #7, an adult black and white guinea pig was noted to have a large, fluid filled mass under its chin\napproximately 3 inches in diameter.\n3. In Pen #7, an adult grey and white guinea pig was noted to have a firm 2 inch diameter mass under its chin.\n4. In Pen #7, an adult guinea pig, mostly white with some tan coloring and black ears, was noted to have a 1 inch\ndiameter mass under its chin.\n5. In Pen #8, an adult tricolor guinea pig, mostly black with some tan and white, was noted to have a firm 2 inch\ndiameter mass under its chin.\n6. In Pen #8, an adult roan and white guinea was noted to have a 2 inch diameter mass under its chin.\n7. In Pen #11, an adult white guinea pig was noted to have diffuse hair loss over 90% of its body. A small circular\narea, approximately 3/4\" diameter, of reddened skin can be seen on the top of its shoulders.This animal also had a\nmildly swollen left front foot with some reddening of the skin. The guinea pig was ambulating normally, but was\nnoted to hold the limb up when resting. The hair loss had been treated by the licensee according to the facility's\nprogram of veterinary care, but the swollen foot had not been noted by the licensee.\n8. In Pen #27, an adult guinea pig, with tan, white, and black coloring, had 2 firm masses under its chin. One was\napproximately 1.5\" in diameter, and the other was approximately 1\" in diameter. A 1\" diameter area of hair loss is\npresent on its right flank.\n9. In Pen #27, a brown and white adult guinea pig is noted to have approximately 2\" diameter areas of hair loss\nbilaterally on the top of its lower back. The skin in this area on the left side of the animal is pink and there are\nregional areas of dried blood and dark crust. The skin in this area on the right side is mostly smooth with some\nresolving dark crusted material.\n10. In Pen #27, an adult brown, tan, and white guinea pig had a 1 inch diameter firm, freely movable mass under its\nchin.\n11. In Pen #28, an adult white and grey guinea pig had a 2 inch diameter firm mass under its chin.\nThe licensee had identified guinea pigs with masses in the last few days, but had not contacted the veterinarian or\nstarted treatment as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care. When animals are identified as needing care, the\nfacility must either initiate treatment as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending\nveterinarian. Guinea pigs described in the report as numbers 1, 7, and 9 with additional problems of animal health\nhad not been identified by the licensee or communicated to the attending veterinarian. Licensees must conduct daily\nobservations to assess health and well-being.\nThe licensee must initiate treatment as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending\nveterinarian regarding the masses. The attending veterinarian must be consulted about animals 1, 7, and 9 so that\nadequate veterinary care can be provided. Correct by June 5, 2019."
