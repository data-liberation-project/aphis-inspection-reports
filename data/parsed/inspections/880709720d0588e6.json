The right side cheek teeth are covered\nwith a buildup of grayish material. The gums were swollen on both sides of the mouth and dark red on the right side\nof the mouth. Part of the gum tissue was eroded away where the canine tooth (the large carnassial tooth) and gum\nline meet on the right side of the mouth. There was a grayish creamy material along the gum line near the large\ncanine teeth (the large carnassial teeth) and cheek teeth on both sides.\nThe buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the\ndog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal.\nThe licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by, 30-August-2015.\nThis inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).\nThis inspection report will be sent by e-mail."
