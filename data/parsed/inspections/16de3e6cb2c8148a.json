The facility veterinarian was contacted, immediately\nassessed the animal, and began treatment. The condition of the animal declined during the day despite intensive\nappropriate treatment and the NHP was euthanized. Upon being notified and in response to this information, the\nIACUC and AV immediately looked into the incident.\nIt was determined that there were inconsistencies in the actions of investigator staff for some of the procedures\ndescribed in the approved protocol related to compound dosing, timing of the administration of compound relative to\nthe operative procedure, and the monitoring the animal following dosing of the compound. In addition, investigator\nstaff failed to contact the facility veterinarian when the NHP developed unexpected symptoms intra and post\noperatively. These inconsistencies contributed to the adverse effects experienced by the NHP that resulted in the\neuthanasia of the animal.\n***In June 2016 an NHP was noted to be weak and recumbent in its enclosure several days following the\nadministration of a compound that was given to the animal as per the IACUC approved protocol. The facility\nveterinarian was contacted, immediately assessed the animal, and began treatment. Following several days of\nintensive treatment, the animal went on to make a full recovery. Upon being notified and in response to this\ninformation, the IACUC and AV immediately looked into the incident.\nIt was determined that the NHP was not monitored and treated by investigator staff as described in the IACUC\nprotocol following the administration of the compound that resulted in the animal experiencing adverse effects that\nrequired veterinary intervention. In addition, investigator staff failed to notify the facility veterinarian of the\nunforeseen changes in the NHP\u2019s condition that were identified prior to the onset of the illness.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain program of adequate\nveterinary care that includes adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care that are in accordance with current\nestablished veterinary medical and nursing procedures. Investigator staff must follow the pre and post procedural\ncare as described in the IACUC approved protocols to ensure the health and well-being of the animals, and to\nensure the provision of adequate veterinary medical care.\nThe research facility acted promptly to address both of these incidents by conducting an investigation, reporting the\nincident to OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in\nthe future. Corrective actions included but were not limited to implementing changes to study procedures and\nproviding additional retraining of investigator staff. To date, no additional incidents have occurred.\nThis item has been appropriately addressed and corrected by the research facility.\nNOTE \u2013 Inspection conducted 6/19/17 thru 6/21/17. Exit briefing held on-site 6/21/17 with facility representatives.\n*END OF REPORT*"
