The wound approximately two inches in diameter was circular in shape, reddened, moist with\nfresh blood and was hairless. Additional, older, scabby lesions outlined the edge of the fresh wound. The licensee\nstated that this was the first time the wound had been noticed. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian\nhad not been consulted and no treatment had been administered. An open wound can be painful causing\ndiscomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health and well-being of the guinea pig. The\nlicensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis\nand treatment of the wound is provided. Any medical records must be made available to the inspector upon\nrequest. The licensee was given verbal instruction to have this animal examined by the end of business 7/26/17.\nThe outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee\nmust ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 7/26/17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
