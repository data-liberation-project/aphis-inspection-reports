      "narrative": "There is male, white tiger named \"Casper\" (date of birth 6/04) with an open wound on the inside of the left front leg\nthat is about two inches by three inches in size. The skin around the wound is red and swollen and the skin is pulled\nback exposing red tissue in two places. Casper was seen licking this wound. The animal also has a moderately thin\nbody condition with mildly protruding hip bones and vertebrae. This animal was acquired on 10 July 2014.\nAccording to the licensee, he was thin and had cuts and sores on his face and legs at that time and she had\ndocumented those problems. The attending veterinarian evaluated the tiger on 25 August 2014. No treatment\nguidelines were given to the licensee at that time. No treatment for the skin or wounds has been given to this\nanimal. The licensee gave deworming medication to the animal on 14 September 2014. because of the thin body\ncondition. The licensee states that the animal has not gained weight as she expected after the deworming\nmedication was given. The attending veterinarian has not evaluated this animal since the initial exam in August.\nSkin wounds can become infected and be painful for the animal. Also, a thin body condition can indicate other\nmedical problems occurring in the animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian\nby close of business on 9 October 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis for the thin body condition and\nskin wound is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must\ndocument the outcome of this consultation, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, and\nmake it available to the inspector upon request."
