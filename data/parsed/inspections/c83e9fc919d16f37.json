      "narrative": "Two IACUC-approved protocols do not accurately or completely describe the animal activities being performed.\n***Protocol 20-187 (\u201cIACUC 20-187 Protocol Application Rev3\u201d) Experiment 2 is an activity that includes exposing piglets\nto hypoxic conditions. The protocol says weight gain will be monitored. A description of a method of measuring body\nweight is included in the protocol. A monitoring sheet was developed for the protocol, which includes a column in which\nweights may be recorded in kilograms. A timeline was created showing that body weights would be measured (\u201cweigh\nanimal\u201d) throughout the study, depending on the length of time the animal would remain on the protocol. The protocol also\nidentifies 20% weight loss as a humane endpoint. All of this documentation was submitted to the IACUC prior to the\nIACUC's approval of the protocol.\nOn October 26th, 2022, a group of piglets was placed on the protocol; the health records and monitoring sheets for this\ngroup were reviewed. Half of the piglets were assigned to a hypoxic group while the other half served as controls. From\nOctober 26th, 2022 to November 4th, 2022, there are no body weights or other descriptions of weight gain recorded. On\nNovember 4th, 2022, an amendment (Amendment #10) was approved by the IACUC to add a daily body condition scoring\nof piglets \"to monitor weight gain\". Amendment #10 also stated that \"humane endpoints will remain the same as\npreviously approved\". On November 5th and 6th, 2022, body condition scores were noted in the records for the hypoxic\npigs only. Body condition scores were not recorded for any pigs on November 7th and 8th, 2022. The piglets finished out\nthe study on November 8th, 2022, and at no point were body weights measured as stated in the protocol. Additionally, the\nprotocol stated that blood samples would be collected from the pigs on specified days, and there is no record of blood\nsampling being performed. The PI confirmed that blood samples and body weights were not collected.\nThe protocol also says pigs will be housed in a \u201cwire pet cage (24\u201dL x 18\u201dW x 19\u201dH) within a custom made hypoxia\nchamber (\u201c30\u201dL x 20\u201dW x 20\u201dH) with a clear plexiglass viewing pane.\u201d Instead, starting on October 26, 2022, the pigs were\nhoused in a brand-new customized hypoxia chamber which is intended to improve animal welfare by allowing social\nhousing. Amendment #10, approved by the IACUC on November 4th, 2022, included a description of the new housing.\n***On Protocol 21-023, an adverse event occurred and was reported to the IACUC. The facility's internal review of the\nincident lead to the finding that that facility personnel had not placed an IV catheter in a calf within 2 days of administering\nthe infectious agent as was required by the protocol. The animal was inoculated on April 26, 2022 and should have had\nan IV catheter placed by April 28th, 2022. The animal became ill on May 2nd, 2022 at which time the animal was sedated,\nan IV catheter was placed, IV fluid administration began, but despite these interventions the animal died shortly thereafter.\nThe protocol states that \u201cwithin 1-2 days of oocyst challenge, calves will have a jugular catheter placed\u201d. Furthermore, the\nprotocol states, \u201cthe catheters are designed to facilitate administration of rescue therapy in the event that a calf becomes\nseverely debilitated and requires supportive care.\u201d\nIncorrectly or incompletely describing animal activities undermines the IACUC\u2019s ability to review and approve these\nactivities. IACUC oversight of animal activities is essential for ensuring animal welfare and oversight of research using\nanimals.\nCorrect by ensuring that animal activities are accurately and completely described so that the IACUC can have oversight\nas required by the Animal Welfare Act regulations."
