The third puppy, \n7199 measured 14.5 inches in length requiring 420.25 sq. inches of space (14.5\u201d + 6\u201d = (20.5 in)2 = 420.25 in2). All three \ndogs together require 1,220.25 sq. inches (400 in2 + 400 in2 + 420.25 in2 = 1220.25 in2) and are provided 956.75 sq. \ninches.\n\n- A large enclosure contained two Bulldogs (ID#s 7125 and 7124). Bulldog # 7125 measured 24 inches in length, requiring \n900 sq. inches of space (24\u201d + 6\u201d = (30 in)2 = 900 in2). Bulldog # 7124 measured 21 inches in length, requiring 729 sq. \ninches of space (21\u201d + 6\u201d = (27 in)2 = 729 in2). Both dogs together require 1,629 sq. inches (900 in2 + 729 in2 = 1629 in2) \nand are provided only 1,608 sq. inches. \nIn the NICU, two dogs in one enclosure failed to meet minimum space requirements. Two Chows are housed in a \n\u201cdouble-wide\u201d enclosure formed by removing a divider panel. Their large enclosure measures 41.5 inches by 26 inches \n(1,079 square inches). \n- The two chows (ID#s 7189 and 7190) each measured 19 inches in length, requiring 625 sq. inches of space each (19\u201d + \n6\u201d = (25 in)2 = 625 in2). Together, they require a minimum of 1,250 sq. inches but are only provided with 1,079 sq. inches. \nIn the Nursery, there are five enclosures, each housing one puppy, that failed to meet minimum space requirements. \nThere are four puppies individually housed in the smallest sized enclosures which measure 22 inches by 16 inches (352 \nsquare inches). \n- A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy (ID# 7225) measured 13 inches in length, requiring 361 sq. inches of space (13\u201d \n+ 6\u201d = (19 in)2 = 361 in2) but are only provided 352 sq. inches. \n- Three individually housed Cockapoo puppies (ID#s 3693, 3691, and 3692) each measured 14 inches in length, requiring \n400 sq. inches of space (14\u201d + 6\u201d = (20 in)2 = 400 in2) but are only provided 352 sq. inches. \n- One Standard Poodle puppy is housed in a medium sized enclosure which measures 20.5 inches by 26 inches (533 \nsquare inches). The Standard Poodle puppy (ID# 7213) measured 19 inches in length, requiring 625 sq. inches of space \n(19\u201d + 6\u201d = (25 in)2 = 625 in2) but was only provided 533 sq. inches. \nFailing to provide adequate space can cause discomfort, crowding, poor sanitation, increased incidence of illness, and \nlead to developmental abnormalities especially in larger breed dogs.\n\nCorrect by the end of business on September 6, 2022, by ensuring that all dogs are provided with at least the minimum \nspace required by the Animal Welfare Act. This issue was identified to facility representatives each day as the rooms were \ninspected (9/1 and 9/2). \n3.6(c)(1)(iii) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nA Golden Retriever puppy housed in the largest enclosure on the sales floor is not being provided the minimum interior \nheight as required by the Animal Welfare Act. The Golden Retriever puppy (ID# 7165) is being housed in the largest \nenclosure which measures 67 inches long by 24 inches deep by 22 inches high. When the puppy is in a normal standing \nposition with his head held in line with his body, there is only about 1.5-2 inches of clearance between the top of his head \nand the ceiling of the enclosure. All dogs required a minimum of 6 inches of clearance above the top of their heads. \nFailing to provide adequate head space in a primary enclosure prevents normal postural adjustments, including stretching \nthe neck up and can lead to discomfort and potential developmental abnormalities, especially in larger breed dogs. \nCorrect by the end of business on September 6, 2022, by ensuring that all dogs are provided with at least the minimum \nspace required by the Animal Welfare Act. This issue was identified to facility representatives as soon as it was found on \n9/1. \n3.8 \n   \nExercise for dogs. \nThe facility does not have a written exercise plan approved by their attending veterinarian for all dogs over 12 weeks of \nage who are not provided with either twice their required floor space or those who are pair housed and are provided with \n100 % of the required floor space for both dogs. According to the General Manager and husbandry staff, the dogs in the \nNICU and sales floor are temporarily moved to an \u201cexercise pen\u201d while their enclosures are being cleaned daily and are \nthen moved back to their primary enclosures. After consulting with the attending veterinarian, there is no exercise plan\n\nthat has been developed and approved for this facility. \nIt is important for proper development and maintenance of muscle, joint, and tendon strength to provide dogs over 12 \nweeks of age exercise. \nCorrect by September 9, 2022, by creating a written exercise plan approved by the attending veterinarian that includes \nstandard procedures to provide all dogs over 12 weeks of age the opportunity for exercise. \n3.11(a) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nEnclosures in the nursery and NICU are not being spot cleaned frequently enough to provide the dogs freedom to avoid \ncontact with their own excreta. The enclosures are made out of stainless steel with wire floorings and are cleaned out \ndaily by employees. However, some of the puppies are pooping frequently enough that there is not enough space in the \nenclosure to avoid coming into contact with their own feces. One Pomeranian puppy was lying on a bed inside the \nenclosure where feces had been crushed into the bed underneath the dog\u2019s rear and appeared to have been that way for \nseveral hours. The Pomeranian also had fecal material on all four feet, up to its hocks. \nAnimals that do not have enough space in their enclosure to avoid coming into contact with their own feces are at a higher \nrisk for diseases and reinfecting themselves with potential pathogens. \nCorrect by the end of business on September 6, 2022, by ensuring all enclosures are being cleaned with enough \nfrequency that animals have the freedom to avoid contact with their own excreta and soiling of the dogs. \n3.11(b)(2) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nAll dog kennels are being cleaned with either dilute bleach or a product called Fresh Scent. Both products are considered \ndisinfectants but require a detergent prior to application in order to work as a disinfectant. Although the kennels are being \ncleaned out daily, they are never actually sanitized appropriately due to the absence of a detergent cleaning step.\n\nAdequate cleaning and sanitization are critical for eliminating disease risks, especially in young puppies that are still \nestablishing a strong immune system and, in an environment, where turn-over is high. \nCorrect by September 16, 2022, by incorporating a detergent to clean the enclosures and remove all organic material \nprior to the application of a disinfectant at least once every 2 weeks. \n3.11(c) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nThere is an excessive amount of dust and cobwebs in the room containing the sales floor enclosures. There is a solid, \nthick coating of dust covering all the air conduits just below the ceiling. The ceiling is comprised of drop tiles, some of \nwhich have a three-dimensional buildup of dust hanging down from the tiles. In the corner closest to the back exit of the \nbuilding, there are cobwebs and dust adhered to the wall. In the \u201ctunnel\u201d leading between the back of the puppy sales \nfloor to the small animal supplies area of the store, there is a large accumulation of wood, boxes, bins, reptile enclosures, \nand other miscellaneous supplies and materials that block access to the shelving. The overcrowding of the storage tunnel \ndoesn\u2019t allow for adequate inspection behind the shelving to check for pests and provides areas for harborage of pests. \nIt is important to maintain a basic level of husbandry in and around animal areas to avoid potential illness or discomfort \nfrom breathing in too much dust and be able to inspect around the premises for evidence of pests. \nCorrect by October 4, 2022, by keeping premises clean and free of accumulations of trash, junk, or discarded matter to \nreduce or eliminate living areas for rodents and other pests and to facilitate basic husbandry practices. \n3.31(a)(1) \n   \nSanitation. \nAll guinea pig and hamster enclosures are being cleaned with dilute bleach and Windex on a daily or bi-weekly basis. \nAlthough bleach is an acceptable disinfectant, it requires all organic material to be removed prior to application to work as \na disinfectant. Although the enclosures are being cleaned out frequently, they are never actually sanitized appropriately\n\ndue to the absence of a detergent cleaning step. \nAdequate cleaning and sanitization are critical for eliminating disease risks, especially in an environment where turn-over \nof animal groups is high. \nCorrect by September 16, 2022, by incorporating a detergent to clean the enclosures and remove all organic material \nprior to the application of a disinfectant at least once every 2 weeks. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. \n \n n",
