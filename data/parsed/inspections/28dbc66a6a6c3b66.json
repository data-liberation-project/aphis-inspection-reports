I informed him of the consequences of the\nrefusal, to which he debated with me about the unfairness of the situation and made many accusatory statements,\nincluding that I was inspecting too frequently. I explained to him the nature of past non-compliances and the inspection\nfrequency, among other things in response to what he mentioned. He continued to debate with me some more and\nthreatened to get rid of his license. I reminded him that it is his right, as well as familiarizing himself with the activities and\nspecies which fall under our purview by reviewing the AWA/Blue book. I also explained what he would need to do to\ndiscontinue his license with us. Once I saw the matter was not being resolved, and he was not providing anyone to\naccompany me on an inspection, I told him I would leave and document the visit as a refusal; to which he agreed and said\nthat would be best. Refusal to allow inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Each dealer, exhibitor,\nintermediate handler or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept\nby the Act and the regulations in this part, and to inspect and photograph the facilities, property and animals, as the\nAPHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act, the regulations and the standards in this\nsubchapter.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
