      "narrative": "***One adult female giraffe named (cid:28)Mary(cid:29) was observed to have overgrown feet. She was not noted to be limping at\nthis time and was moving around the enclosure. The inside claw on both rear feet on this animal are elongated,\nextend past the outside claw and are starting to twist away from the outside claw. The left rear foot is more severely\naffected with the inside claw curling upwards off the ground in addition to twisting. Untreated overgrown hooves can\ncause discomfort to the animals and can cause abnormal forces to be placed on the joints in the foot and limb\ncausing additional medical problems. When hooves do not wear naturally, routine hoof trimming (as directed by the\nattending veterinarian) is necessary. Review of veterinary records states that the attending veterinarian noted the\nelongated hooves on 4/4/16 and stated that hoof trimming is to (cid:28)be done ASAP(cid:29). The facility representative stated\nhoof trimming had been scheduled but had to be cancelled due to scheduling. The giraffes shall be evaluated for\nhoof trimming needs and any giraffes with long hooves including the female (cid:28)Mary(cid:29) shall have their hooves trimmed.\n***The current program of veterinary care, updated since the Mar. 2015 inspection, indicates that for all hoofstock\nspecies except Blackbuck and Nilgai succinylcholine will be the sole agent used for capture and chemical restraint\nfor procedures such as exams and lameness treatment. During conversations with facility representatives it was\nascertained that succinylcholine is the sole current drug being used as recently as last week to immobilize\nhoofstock. The veterinarian approved instructions discuss the care and monitoring of the animal during the use of\nthe neuromuscular blocker but makes no mention of the fact that during immobilization with neuromuscular blocking\nagents the animals remain fully conscious and are sensitve to pain, stress and stimulation. Succinylcholine is a\nparalytic agent that has no pain relieving or tranquilizing properties. In addition, this type of drug paralyzes\nrespiratory muscles causing decreases in respiration rate that can be severe enough to lead to death if the animals\nare not ventilated appropriately. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities or training to intubate or\nmechanically ventilate animals if they stop breathing. Neuromuscular blockers such as succinylcholine should not\nbe used without concurrent appropriate use of anesthesia/analgesia and support measures (ventilation and\nmonitoring) to avoid the distressing effects, respiratory depression and enhanced risk of death due to paralysis of\nrespiratory muscles. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which are able to\nchemically restrain animals without causing paralysis while providing anesthesia and analgesia. The licensee must\nmaintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods of immobilizing and restraining\nhoofstock that are consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.\nCorrect by: June 15, 2016."
