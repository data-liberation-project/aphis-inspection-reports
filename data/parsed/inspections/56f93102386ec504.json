A female lion had a bloody ear lesion that the owner said had surgery\nto remove a mass. A tiger had severe generalized patchy hair loss which was more pronounced on the neck and\nshoulder areas. Another female lion had hair loss around the eyes, face, back and ear margins. A white raccoon\nwas thin, had hair loss and was walking stiffly. When asked for information regarding what veterinary care these\nanimals were receiving, the owner state that she does not keep any veterinary medical records at all and that\neverything is with her attending veterinarian. She claimed the veterinarian had been out recently and seen some of\nthese animals. Some she described as having ongoing problems but when asked for records of what diagnoses or\ntreatments were being given she repeated several times that she didn\u2019t keep any medical records. She provided\nthe number for the veterinarian and told us we would have to call him to get any information that we needed on any\nof the sick animals. Some text communications were eventually shown to the inspectors to show that the\nveterinarian had been on his way out to the facility recently to look at the lion with the ear lesion. The inspectors\ncalled the veterinarian\u2019s office twice on the morning of May 24,2017 and waited nearly three hours but no calls were\nreturned in that time frame. Therefore, the information available at the time of the inspection and the following day\nwas not sufficient to demonstrated adequate veterinary care for these animals.\nLicensees shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods\nto prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Every facility should have a system of health records\nsufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate the delivery of adequate health care. Animals that are sick, injured, or\nhave medical problems must be examined by a veterinarian.\nCorrect by 5/30/2017"

Also, the Environmental Enhancement Plan did not\naddress considerations for a nonhuman primate that could not see or hear animals of their own or other compatible\nnonhuman primates. The owner stated that the lemur had been separated from another one due to aggression but\nno reason was provided for the animal being house out of sight and hearing of others of its species. The reason\ngiven by the licensee for the bush baby being housed singly was the loss of its mate approximately a year\npreviously.
