For instance, two identical minor deficiencies were\nidentified during the program reviews on the Oct 2014 and April 2015 reports. Neither included a specific plan and\nschedule with dates for correction. The April 2015 report identified a significant deficiency noted during the facility\ninspection. No specific plan and schedule with dates for correction was stated. The IACUC shall prepare a report\nbased on its semi-annual evaluations for the IO that identifies all deficiencies found, designates them as minor or\nsignificant and that contains a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.\nExit conducted with the Institutional Official and other facility representatives."
