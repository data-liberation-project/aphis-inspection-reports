The protocol states that the criteria for euthanasia for regulated\nanimals in the study will be based on a Pain Assessment scoring guide. Upon inquiry by the inspectors, the\nreferenced guide is actually not in use at the facility. Another section of the protocol contained a statement that the\ncriteria for euthanasia would be based on the facility(cid:25)'s humane endpoint policy. Personnel at the facility stated this\npolicy was current and active and was intended to be used in the protocol for euthanasia selection criteria. The\ndescription of the procedure is not accurate. A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make\nsignificant changes in an ongoing activity involving animals, must contain a description of procedures designed to\nassure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically\nvaluable research. The IACUC must review and approve that the description for procedures match the criteria that\nis being implemented in the study.\nCorrect by: October 24, 2015\nNOTE: Incident involving biosecurity breach is currently under review.\nThis inspection took place from September 15 - 17, 2015 and was conducted with APHIS personnel Dr. Simone\nTomlinson, VMO and Dr. Mary Moore, VMO and multiple staff members of the facility.
