This\nsupport is rusted at ground level and structural integrity of this support has been compromised. There is enough\nhorizontal support in this area to keep the animal contained at the time of the inspection. However, there is potential\nfor the animal to be injured by the support or for the support to be further damaged leading to a failure to contain the\nanimal.\n* Several doors in the llama and sheep enclosure were in disrepair. The wood on the door was broken and\nprotruding nails were exposed.\n* In the majority of hoofstock enclosures there was downed chain-link fence. This fence was not a part of the\nenclosure or the perimeter, but rather was a part of field dividers. The downed chain-link fence may lead the\nanimals to become entangled or injured.\n* In the Elk and Fallow Deer enclosure there was metal debris on the ground next to the barn. There was also a\nsignificant amount of chain-link fence in rolls next to the feeders. There were three potential shelters for the animals\nin this enclosure. The \"ice-house\" building had approximately 50% of the roof was missing or in disrepair. The metal\nwas falling into the \"ice-house.\" There was limited drainage of water from this shelter, there was water pooling on\nthe ground. The \"old barn\" had a hard pack of hay and fecal material for the flooring. This hard pack is a significant\ndepth and has accumulated to the point that the mature fallow and elk would be too tall for the barn. Between the\nthree shelters in this enclosure, there is insufficient space for the animals to be protected from the elements.\n* The shelter in the Patagonian cavy enclosure was found to be in disrepair. The flooring was broken and the wall\nhad an approximately 10in round hole in the side. This could cause the animals to become entrapped or injured by\nthe shelter. There was also a hole along the fence that had been dug by the animals. This hole was almost\ncompletely under the fence and could allow the animals to escape if not repaired.\nAnimal enclosures be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to\ncontain the animals.\nCorrect the lion enclosure vertical support and the shift door by 11/25/2017\nCorrect the downed chain-link fence in the hoof-stock enclosures by 11/3/2017\nCorrect the shelters for the fallow and elk by 11/25/2017\nCorrect the doors in the sheep and llama enclosure by 11/3/2017\nCorrect the shelter for the Patagonian Cavy by 11/3/2017\nCorrect the hole in the Patagonian Cavy enclosure by 10/26/2017"
