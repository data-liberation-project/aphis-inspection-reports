It was explained that this is not a new occurance, and this sheep normally rubs its wool along\nthe fence panels, with goats contributing to the problem by chewing at the wool of this sheep. This sheep had not\nyet been evlauated by the attending veterinarian for this problem.\nLarge areas of hairloss in sheep and other animals are abnormal, and may signify underlying illness. This can\ninclude parasitic, viral, and some systemic diseases. As certain types of illness causing hairloss and/or itching can\nbe transmitted to other animals, it is important to have animals with patches of hairloss or evidence of excessive\nrubbing evaluated by a veterinarian. Itching can also cause the animal discomfort.\nPrompt and appropriate diagnosis, treatment and control of the disease is necessary and, in this case, can prevent\nthe problem from potentially spreading to the other sheep and goats. Treatment should also make the animal more\ncomfortable.\nCorrect by 5/14/14.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
