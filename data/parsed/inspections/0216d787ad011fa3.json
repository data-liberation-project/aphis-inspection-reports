      "narrative": "One older male lion named Aslan was in the outdoor portion of a sheltered housing enclosure. The lion was missing\nhair over both lower front legs (just above paws), both lower rear legs (just above paws) and along the right\nhindquarters from the hip to the knee. The skin showing in all places was pink to red in color. An open, raw, bright\nred, round lesion approximately \u00bd inch in diameter was visible on the lower right rear leg. The lion was observed\nrising from a lying position and walking. The lion appeared stiff and stilted during rising and walked with an\noccasional slight stumble. The flooring of the enclosure was concrete both indoors and outdoors. A white firm\nslippery looking resting mat was noted on the floor indoors. The facility representative states the lion is on a joint\nsupplement but no other medications and has gotten worse in the last couple of weeks. Untreated skin and joint\nissues can lead to pain and distress to the animal and secondary infections. The attending veterinarian last saw the\nlion on Jan. 9, 2016. She has not been contacted since the lion(cid:25)'s condition worsened.\nOne 14 year old white tiger named Kailash was very thin with protruding vertebrae along his back and protruding hip\nbones. The facility representative stated they were aware he was losing weight and were trying to feed him a\nspecial diet. She stated he was eating but was not gaining weight back. The attending veterinarian last saw the tiger\non Jan. 9, 2016. She stated she recommended blood work be done, but the facility declined. The facility has not\nupdated the veterinarian on Kailash(cid:25)s condition since then. Weight loss can be a sign of many different medical\nconditions.\nOne tiger named Mooton was housed separately in an outdoor area behind the barn. The facility representative\nstated that he was not eating well the last few days and seemed stressed by ongoing construction. He was\nseparated to monitor his appetite and well-being. Loss of appetite can be a symptom of a medical issue, stress or\nother issues. The veterinarian has not yet been contacted about this tiger.\nThese cats were seen by the attending veterinarian during this inspection and further treatments were prescribed.\nTreatments to be instituted by 2-24-16."

Each of the metal feeding stations are\napproximately three feet tall, two feet wide and six feet long, all connected by a hallway. The facility representative\nstated the leopards were rotated so each could get some exercise. The feeding stations section is not large enough\nto provide the leopards adequate space to perform normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of\nmovement. The vertical height restriction of the feeding stations prevents the leopards from jumping and stretching\nvertically. The short crate sections prevent the leopards from running, jumping and climbing. Inadequate space may\nlead to stress, poor condition and abnormal behavior patterns. Enclosures used to house the leopards must be\nconstructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow the animals to make normal postural\nadjustments with adequate freedom of movement.
