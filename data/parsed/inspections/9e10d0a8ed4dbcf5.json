The cavy, attempting to avoid the dog, ran\ninto the sides of its enclosure which resulted in injuries. The injuries include a laceration to its face which required sutures\nfrom the Attending Veterinarian. A perimeter fence is necessary to keep out unauthorized animals and persons and to act\nas a secondary containment fence if the animal were to get out.
