The inspector was able to reach across\nthe barrier and grab onto the chain link fence. For the safety of the animals and guests the barrier needs to be\nmoved back or raised up so there is a sufficient distance and guests are not able to touch the enclosures or\npotentially the animals.\nAt the last inspection the facility had indicated that it was making progress in funding and planning out the removal\nof old fence and construction of new fence that would have been further back and higher to prevent guests from\nbeing able to touch the primary enclosure. The facility has not completed this project but has closed the park for the\nseason.\nThe fencing around the wolverine exhibit needs to come into compliance by the time the facility opens in the spring\nfor the safety of the guests.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection."
