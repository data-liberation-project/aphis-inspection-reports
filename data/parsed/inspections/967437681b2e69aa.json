There were several red raised areas on the skin under the\nleft front leg, the right chest area and the right hip. The licensee stated that this dog whelped puppies approximately\nthree months ago and began losing hair at that time. There was also another female Bichon identified as #322 that\nhad hair loss under the chin and down the neck. The licensee stated that a veterinarian had not been contacted.\nHair loss is an abnormal situation that could indicate a serious medical condition. The licensee must have these two\ndogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, follow the treatment plan and assure that all of the dogs are provided\nwith adequate veterinary care as required.\nTo be corrected by August 24, 2015."
