      "narrative": "On March 29, 2017 at 9:00 am inspectors made contact with Mr. Stark at the front gate of his property. When Mr.\nStark approached the team he was wearing a gun on his belt on his right side, in full view. This is the first time that\nMr. Stark has been seen carrying a gun during an inspection. Mr. Stark stated that he would allow inspectors on his\nproperty, however our armed security had to stay behind. He stated 'I do not approve of guns on my property and I\nhave never approved of you bringing them on my property'. He continued to state 'there are only two reasons why\nyou can be allowed to bring guns on my property, one is with a missing animal and if I give permission, and I do not\ngive permission, I am tired of the bullying by bringing them on my property', while holding his cell phone presumably\nshowing this information.\nIt was explained to Mr. Stark that there has been security coming to do inspections for the past 2-3 years, and that\ntoday is no different. It was difficult to get complete sentences communicated due to Mr. Starks' constant\ninterruptions where he continued to state that he feels bullied and he is refusing to let the security with guns on his\nproperty. At this time one of the security officers who was at the inspection on March 17, 2017, asked Mr. Stark why\nthere is a problem as they had gotten along fine at that time. Mr. Stark addressed the security officer and stated\n'yea, I got along with you just fine, but I\u2019m tired of being bullied'.\nI pointed out to Mr. Stark that he appeared to be putting on a show of intimidation toward inspectors by coming to\nthe front gate with a visible side arm, which he has never worn in past inspections. Mr. Stark stated 'yes I did, I\nfigured fair was fair', meaning since we had armed security, he was going to be armed also. Then he stated, 'I forgot\nI had it on I was in with big tigers and had it for protection', while he took a hold of the bottom of the holster with his\nright hand and pulled it up toward his waist, acting like he forgot he had it on. It should be noted that there was\napproximately a 5 minute delay from when a worker was contacted at the front gate, until he called Mr. Stark who\neventually came from his house to the gate. He had not been in a tiger pen immediately prior to coming to the gate,\nas we were standing near the tiger area, and he was called by phone by the worker who was standing next to the\ntiger enclosures when he contacted Mr. Stark. He could have left the gun at the house, if he indeed had it on for\nprotection from the tigers. We felt that his wearing the gun to interact with the inspectors and his comment that he\n\u2018figured fair was fair\u2019 meant that he had brought the gun to intimidate the inspectors.\nIt was made clear to Mr. Stark that we could not conduct an inspection without our armed security, and the situation\nis more concerning because he is attempting to intimidate us by coming to the inspection armed for the first time in\n3 years. Mr. Stark was adamant that he was told that he did not have to let us on the property with the armed\nsecurity, but would let inspectors on alone. I advised him that we could not conduct an inspection on this facility, as\nhas been the case for the past 2 years without them and that if he did not allow us all on, it would be considered a\nrefusal. This was explained several times to Mr. Stark, and when asked if he was refusing the inspection, Mr. Stark\nstated 'Yes, I have no choice, I have to, I\u2019m tired of the bullying factor'.\nThe refusal of an inspection is not acceptable due to the inability of inspectors to determine the health and welfare\nof the animals at the facility, and prevents the performance of an inspection which is required in order to uphold the\nAWA standards and regulations. When a USDA license is given, a licensee is required to allow inspectors on the\nproperty to conduct their inspection and be allowed to perform their duties.\nThe licensee must allow inspectors on their property anytime during regular business hours to conduct routine,\nfocused or other related inspections.\nThis was intended to be a focused inspection of the three Direct Non-compliant items listed on the inspection dated\nMarch 17, 2017\nDue to the refusal the licensee was advised that a copy of the report would be sent by regular and certified mail.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGage Laurie, Big Cat Specialist\nNeafsey Michael, Assistant Director"
