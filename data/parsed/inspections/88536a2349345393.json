Upon further observation, in between the digits, the tissue was swollen and red with a\ndarkened area in the center. The facility representative stated that this problem had been noted this morning during\nwalk through and would be treated with medication today. According to the program of veterinary care there is no\ntreatment plan from the attending veterinarian for this type of issue. Limited weight bearing or non-weight bearing\nlimbs are an indication of discomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the risks of further deterioration if not\nproperly diagnosed and treated or left if left unattended. The licensee must have this animal evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian for appropriate diagnosis by May 6, 2014 and treat as directed.\n***In the outdoor facility, there was a female French Bulldog identified as Sara Jo #041.366.568 that was walking\ncautiously inside the enclosure. Some of the toenails were wrapping around the wire flooring and turning the toe\ndigits in an abnormal manner as pressure was applied. The facility representative trimmed the toenails during the\ninspection. Long toenails can cause discomfort or pain and can lead to injury if left unattended.\n***In the medication ready to use storage area, there was a bottle of Vetericyn that expired 02/14. Expired\nmedications may not produce the desired result. The licensee must remove this medication from the ready to use\nmedication storage and assure that all medications used on regulated animals is within the manufacturer's\nexpiration date.\nThe licensee must assure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.\nThis inspection began at 0903.\nThe inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.\nEnd of report."
