This fence was bent toward the billy-goat enclosure at the top and the bottom near the front of the\nenclosure where public feeding could occur. The bending created gaps between the fence and the ground at the\nbottom and between the fence and the support bar at the top. These gaps were sufficiently large that a goat might\npass its head thru and possibly become entrapped. In the upper pasture also containing five goats, there was a\ngrounding bar outside the shelter that was bent away from the enclosure and presented an end nearly chest height\nthat could cause injury to the animals. Correct by assuring that bent and damaged fencing and metal posts are\nidentified and corrected to maintain good repair and protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by 4 November\n2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner."
