The\nopossum has a right head tilt and was observed moving very slowly around her enclosure with a stiff and uncertain gait.\nWhile standing still, her lower jaw quivered and she was making chittering noises. There is a large portion of hair missing\non her back along with multiple scabs. Scabs and sores are also present along the tail, right cheek, and under her jaw on\nthe left side. According to the licensee, she is a very old opossum and was briefly placed in a different outdoor enclosure.\nThey found her with the scrapes/sores and moved her into her current enclosure. The licensee is currently applying\nentederm ointment but has not contacted the attending veterinarian. An older animal with multiple abrasions and scabs,\nalong with signs of mobility and possible neurologic issues can indicate discomfort, pain, stress, or other underlying\nconditions/diseases.\nFrequent and direct communication with a veterinarian is paramount to ensuring animals nearing the end of their life still\nhave an adequate quality of life and their specific needs are being recognized and provided for.\n*An adult, male goat has a large split in the wall of his outside left front hoof. Abnormalities in the hoof wall can lead to\nchronic hoof problems, conformation issues, lameness, and further pain and suffering. This animal's condition was not\nnoted by the facility during daily observations. Hoof wear needs to be monitored and addressed for preventative care.\nCorrect by having the hoof evaluated by a professional and determine an appropriate course of action to correct the hoof\nwall."
