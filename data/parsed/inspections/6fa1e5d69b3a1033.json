      "narrative": "A female Lhasa Apso (#956 000004174161 & 0A02201909) had discharge around both eyes and long toenails. An\nabundance of black to dark green crusty material was matted in the fur surrounding both eyes with a thick amount of\nthe material present in the corners of the eyes. The left eye had a heavier amount of discharge present around it\ncompared to the right eye. The left eye also had a thick green mucous-like discharge that covered a portion of the\nsurface of the eye. The dog\u2019s right front and right rear toenails were observed to be very long and were curling\noutward. According to the licensee, he was not aware of the dog\u2019s eye condition. There was no written\ndocumentation of any treatments administered for the dog\u2019s current condition. Eye discharge can be due to an\ninfection and/or other veterinary medical condition which can be uncomfortable and may lead to more serious health\nproblems. Long toenails can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of an abnormal gait. The licensee must\nhave this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian for its eye condition. The licensee must also ensure this dog\u2019s\ntoenails are trimmed and establish an appropriate nail trimming schedule for all dogs. The veterinary examination is\nrequired in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed\nand followed. The licensee must document this information and provide it to the inspector upon request. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times."
