The deer spent approximately\n27 hours in the sorting box for the handling system for procedures without access to feed, water and other deer, which\nmay have caused distress for the deer.

The event involved a total of fourteen turkey deaths from 4/17/2024 - 4/23/2024. Reported were the deaths of two\nturkeys on 4/17, one on 4/18, three on 4/19 and seven on 4/20 which was above expected 20 % loss for production of\nyoung turkeys. An additional turkey died on 4/23. The veterinary visit on 4/20 determined that the heat lamps used for\nsupplemental heat were lamps with a shatterproof coating on the bulbs. The shatterproof coating on the surfaces of the\nheat lamp bulbs is toxic to turkeys. Ensure that primary enclosures for poultry have interior surfaces, including furniture\nand supplemental lighting, do not have any surface materials that are toxic or hazardous to the poultry. The facility\ninitiated an immediate corrective action on 4/20/24 of replacing the heat lamps with lamps without shatterproof bulbs and\nwill maintain a policy that lamps with shatterproof bulbs are not to be used for poultry. Corrected prior to inspection.\nMaintain correction from 13 February 2025 forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Facility Representatives.\nEnd of report.\nn"
