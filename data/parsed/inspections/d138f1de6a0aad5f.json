When she\narose and began to walk to her den, her gait was very slow, stiff, and unsteady. The Caretaker reported that she\nhad been running around when last observed up, but has been lying down in her den more often as the weather\nturned colder. It is thought that Cheyenne is 18 years old.\nChanges in gait and reduced mobility often indicate pain or discomfort in animals. This animal should be evaluated\nsoon by a veterinarian to determine an appropriate method to diagnose and treat her condition.\nCorrect by 10/24/2015.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Caretaker."
