While the animal appeared to have a normal body condition and its new winter coat with no fecal\nstaining during this inspection, slower winter coat development and problems maintaining a normal weight as\ndescribed above may be indicative of disease. This arctic fox must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with\nthe species and the recommendations followed as soon as possible.\n***The bobcat cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for abnormal pacing in its enclosure and for spending\nthe majority of its time in the rafters has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. During the inspection the bobcat\nwas actively moving about in the rafters. No pacing was observed. The bobcat still spends most of its time in the\nrafters according to the licensee. Abnormal behavior patterns may be indicative of physical or psychological issues\nthat may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modifications, and must be evaluated by the attending\nveterinarian as soon as possible to receive appropriate treatment and management.\n***The large brown nosed coatimundi cited as a direct NCI under 2.40(b)(2) on the 1-19-17 inspection report was\nnot present for this inspection.
