In the\nSpider Monkey enclosure there are metal supports for perches that have significant corrosion, including a hole\nthrough the metal that is 1/2 inch in diameter. Some animals, such as the marmosets and and brown lemur, have\nwooden den boxes that are soiled and porous.\nFailure to maintain surfaces in good repair impedes cleaning and disinfecting, which could be detrimental to the\nhealth of the animals. Additionally, corrosion of perch supports could threaten their structural strength, which could\nbe hazardous.\nAll surfaces in primate enclosures should be maintained in good repair in order to protect the well-being of the\nanimals. To be corrected by 5/17/17.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the zoo administrator."
