An enclosure that is not structurally sound for the species of monkey\ncontained within the enclosure allows for the possibility of injuries to occur to the animals within that enclosure. The\nenclosure must be fixed so that hazards that could cause injury to the monkeys within the enclosure are eliminated.\nCorrect by 10/21/16.\nNote: The enclosure was under construction at the time of inspection. The licensee has made adjustments to the\nenclosure containing the Brown-headed spider monkeys to eliminate possible hazards that could potentially cause\ninjury to the animals within that enclosure in the future.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd of report."
