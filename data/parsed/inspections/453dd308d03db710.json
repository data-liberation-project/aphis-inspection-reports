Per the\nprotocol and client-provided formulation procedure, rabbits should have received eye drops with pH in the range of 6-7.4.\nDuring formulation of the eye drops, performed by the registrant, the pH was not checked. When rabbits displayed eye\nirritation following dosing with the eye drops, the dose formulation was investigated, including the pH, which was\ndetermined to be between 5.09-5.56. The Study Director and Client determined that any further data from the study would\nbe unusable due to the incorrect formulation being given to the animals. Therefore, the decision was made, in\nconsultation with the Attending Veterinarian and IACUC Chair, to euthanize the animals to prevent additional unnecessary\npain and distress. The IACUC investigated the incident and requested corrective actions from the Study Director. The\nstudy was amended, and a full committee review was conducted prior to approval.\nOn records review, it was found that on July 27, 2022, two Crab-eating macaques #1512524 & #1601460 were given a\ntest article in the wrong muscle group (hamstring) going off protocol #6109 22.02.001 which indicated the calf muscle was\nto be injected. A consultation with subject matter experts was conducted as soon as the error was realized, and it was\ndetermined that this was problematic as the test article entrance into the bloodstream was dependent on muscle size and\nso the injection site was integral for comparing results. IACUC members were consulted, and it was decided to euthanize\nthe two mis-dosed macaques as they could not provide scientifically valid data and to spare them any further unnecessary\nadverse effects. Euthanasia occurred approximately eleven hours post injection.\nFailure to follow the protocol as written and approved may adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals.\nThese were serious deviations from the ongoing activities regarding the care and use of animals that the IACUC had\nreviewed and approved. The IACUC must review and approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or withhold\napproval of those components of proposed activities related to the care and use of animals. All staff involved in the matter\nreceived retraining as a corrective measure.\nCorrected by 3-Aug-2023."
