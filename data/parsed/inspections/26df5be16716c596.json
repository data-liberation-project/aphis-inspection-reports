One female deer appeared to have a lip avulsion where the lower lip\nappeared to have separated from the gum line.

None of the deer had been evaluated by a veterinarian. Both deer\notherwise appeared in good health and were observed eating and drinking acceptably. Another young deer in the\nenclosure had a fresh, small, open, superficial wound on her back. It had fresh, bright red blood present.\n--A couple of Patagonian cavies that are housed just outside the back of the main building entrance had what appeared to\nbe fly bites and open wounds on both ears with several flies present on the tips of both ears. They were both visually\nuncomfortable and shaking their heads in order to deter or remove the flies. They had not been examined/evaluated by a\nveterinarian at the time of the inspection.

The licensee must maintain primary enclosures so that they are structurally sound, protect the \nanimals from injury and restrict other animals from entering. \n3.128 \n   \nSpace requirements. \nIn a barn housing two mountain coatimundis there wasn't sufficient vertical space for the housed species to make normal \npostural movements and adjustments. There were no shelves, platforms, perches, or elevated resting surfaces for the \nanimals to rest on. Both coatis were observed laying together on the concrete floor in the back corner of the enclosure. \nThere was a hammock hanging towards the front entrance of the enclosure, but it was not free-hanging and was at an \nawkward angle and resting against the wire making it difficult for the animals to enter and would not allow for a \ncomfortable, stable resting surface. Normal postural adjustments for coatis include running, climbing, jumping, and resting \non elevated surfaces. Coatis who do not have the opportunities or the space to make normal postural adjustments such\n\nas resting on an elevated platform or climbing may suffer from stress, poor condition, debility, or abnormal behavior \npatterns. The enclosure needs to be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to \nmake normal postural and social adjustments for the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by: 4/25/2024 \n3.130 \n   \nWatering. \nIn an outdoor enclosure housing two whitetail deer there was a water receptacle that contained dark green-brown water. \nThere didn't appear to be any other accessible drinking water. This appeared to be the only water source in the enclosure. \nThe water receptacle had an algae-looking substance in it. You could not visualize the bottom of the receptacle through \nthe drinking water. Contaminated water that is no longer potable could lead to potential health risks. Animals who do not \nhave adequate access to potable water may suffer from discomfort, thirst, dehydration, or constipation. Water receptacles \ncontaining an algae-looking substance indicates a lack of cleaning and sanitation. They must be sanitized as often as \nnecessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The licensee must \nensure all water receptacles are cleaned and sanitized more often for the health and well-being of the birds at all times. \nCorrected on: 4/17/24 \n3.33(b) \n   \nClassification and separation. \nIn the main building just past the front entrance to the petting zoo, there was an enclosure housing a hamster and a degu. \nHousing degus and hamsters in the same enclosure can increase the risk of stress, disease hazards, and interspecies \naggression. The facility must ensure that hamsters are not housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species \nof animals. Correct by: 4/18/2024 \n3.152(b) \n   \nFacilities, outdoor \nIn the peacock enclosure housing ten peacocks, there were only three shelters for the birds to go into during inclement \nweather. The two larger shelters measuring approximately four feet wide by four feet deep appeared to be only large \nenough for approximately two birds at a time. The smaller of the three shelters, measuring approximately two feet wide by \ntwo feet deep was only large enough for one bird. Lack of adequate protection from the elements can lead to discomfort \nand potential distress. Correct by ensuring adequate shelter to protect all of the birds at the same time from any adverse \nweather conditions. \nCorrect by: 5/9/2024 \n3.153(a)(2)  Repeat\n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nSeveral enclosures throughout the facility housing pigeons and doves did not have enough or lacked appropriate perches \nfor the birds housed within. An enclosure near the front entrance of facility housing two pigeons had wooden perches, but \nthey had fallen to the bottom of the enclosure and were not being utilized by the pigeons. They were perched instead on \nthin, round, smooth, metal frames that are meant to hold food receptacles. Just inside the main building there were two \ngrey doves in an enclosure, and they were also perched precariously on thin, round, smooth metal frames meant to hold \nfood receptacles. One dove was seen rocking unsteadily on a metal frame. The narrow, smooth metal frame is very \nslippery and doesn't allow for bird to grip it properly and comfortably. This can cause stress and discomfort to the bird. No\n\nother perches were being provided. In an enclosure housing approximately seventy-five doves and pigeons, there weren't \nnear enough perches for the birds contained so that each bird could have a variety of places to rest. The large pigeon and \ndove enclosure had vertical branches in the middle but lacked a sufficient number of horizontal perches. Perches enrich a \nbird\u2019s environment and must be maintained in good condition and of sufficient size and are species appropriate. A \nsufficient number of perches must be available that vary in size, shape, strength, texture and placement to comfortably \nhouse all the birds contained. The perching for these birds needs to be addressed for their psychological and \nphysiological well-being. \n3.158(a)(1) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nIn an outdoor chicken coop enclosure, there was a excessive accumulation of excreta covering a portion of the wire \nflooring housing nine chickens. Excreta and food waste must be removed from the enclosures as often as necessary to \nprevent excessive accumulations. Failure to clean accumulations of excreta and food waste can increase disease \nhazards, insects, pests, and odors. The licensee must ensure animal enclosures are kept clean to prevent accumulations \nof excreta and food waste at all times. Corrected on: 4/17/24 \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nBONNIE BOONE, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n",
