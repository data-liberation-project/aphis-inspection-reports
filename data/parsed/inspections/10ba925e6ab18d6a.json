Over the following 12 hours, the animal developed persistent, severe hypoglycemia that became\nrefractory to treatment. Early in the morning of January 17, 2024, the animal became lethargic, disoriented, and had\ndifficulty breathing and subsequently died at ~3:30am.\nMaintaining the animal on study when the procedures described in the protocol were unsuccessful at resolving a\nprogressive clinical condition constituted a significant change that did not undergo IACUC review and approval. In order\nfor the IACUC to be able to fulfill its responsibilities under the AWA, the IACUC must review and approve significant\nchanges regarding the use of animals in ongoing activities prior to implementation.\nThis incident was voluntarily reported to the USDA and corrective measures had been implemented prior to inspection.
