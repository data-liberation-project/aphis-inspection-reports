      "narrative": "On 9/25/19 seven ring-tail lemurs that ranged in ages from 7 months to 5 years were inappropriately handled that\nresulted in the death of one adult male lemur. The licensee's employee moved the lemurs from their primary\nenclosures and loaded the animals into plastic crates where they stayed for 1.5 to 3 hours awaiting pick up by the\nbuyer. According to the ranch manager and the primary caretaker, one adult male lemur was discovered in serious\ncondition at the time when the animal was removed from the facility\u2019s holding plastic crate and transferred to the\nbuyers crate. He was suffering from multiple fight/bite wounds. Large wounds were present on the thigh, forearm,\ninguinal area, testicle and the skull was described as exposed with a wound that extended down the neck. The tail\nwas also broken.\nMultiple lemurs were placed in single crates. The 3 crates each measured 24\"L x 20\u201dW x 23\u201dH for a total of 3.33\nsquare feet per crate. This is an inadequate amount of space for multiple lemurs (Group 2 species) to be housed or\ntransported together. Furthermore, the primary caretaker who captured and moved the lemurs on 9/25/19 said he\nwas unaware of the genders or ages of the lemurs and did not know what genders were placed with the injured\nmale. The ranch manager and animal caretaker stated the animals were checked on several times after being\nplaced in the crates and appeared to be calm.\nThe injured lemur died a few days later as a result of the trauma. Immediate veterinary care was provided by the\nlicensee\u2019s veterinarian and a few days later the wounds required additional surgical repair by the buyer\u2019s\nveterinarian.\nThese lemurs were handled in a manner that was not as expeditiously or as carefully as possible to prevent trauma\nor unnecessary discomfort. Disrupting the social group and housing animals of mix ages and unknown genders is\nlikely to cause aggression between primates. Compounding this by housing them in crowded confinement for\nseveral hours further increased the behavioral stress (increasing the likelihood of serious injury). As a result of this\ninappropriate handling, this male lemur experienced significant pain and distress later dying as a result of the\ntrauma. Animals must be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible that does not cause trauma or\nunnecessary discomfort.\nCORRECT BY: 10/12/19\nThe focused inspection was conducted with the ranch manger and the exit briefing was conducted with the\nManaging Member.\nNote : This facility no longer has non human primates."
