Both deer had been medically treated over the past month, however, the attending veterinarian was not\nconsulted.\n\u2022 In an incident occurring July 2-3, 2021, gerbils located at CAF were regrouped the afternoon of Friday, July 2 for\nexperimental purposes which led to fighting. This resulted in death of one gerbil and injuries in another, which was\ndiscovered the morning of July 3. The injured gerbil was euthanized July 3, 2021 without consultation of the attending\nveterinarian or designee. Communication with the attending veterinarian\u2019s designee regarding this incident did not occur\nuntil July 6, the first business day after the holiday weekend. The attending veterinarian was notified five days after the\nfighting was discovered, on July 8, 2021.\nDirect and frequent communication of problems to the attending veterinarian is critical to maintaining the health and\nwellbeing of the animals and to address health issues in a timely and adequate manner. Medical care that is not being\ndirected by a veterinarian can result in inappropriate methods to diagnose and treat conditions.\nThe facility shall ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to the attending veterinarian is in place.\nTo be corrected: 09/3/2021"
