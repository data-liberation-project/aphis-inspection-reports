The facility failed to inform the\ninspecting VMO on this and previous unannounced routine inspections of these areas.

During this and previous inspections the VMO inquired about the area\nhousing the goat enclosure and the reptile building, and was told by the facility director, that the areas only\ncontained the garbage dump, birds and/or reptiles. These areas were not disclosed as containing regulated\nanimals until the VMO asked to see the areas. During today's inspection of these areas, several non-compliances\nwere identified.\nFailure of the facility to notify/inform the inspecting APHIS official, of all areas containing regulated animals, does\nnot allow for that official to enforce the regulations and standards set forth in the Animal Welfare Act.\nEach dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect\nand photograph the facilities, property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the\nprovisions of the Act, the regulations and the standards in this subchapter.\nTo be corrected by 5/12/15"

From\n10:30 a.m. to approximately 11:15 a.m., the Animal Care (AC) Veterinary Medical Officer (VMO) observed that there\nwas no attendant present at the giraffe exhibit. During this time the inspector observed several instances in which\nmembers of the public (up to 15 people at a time) were feeding the giraffes without an attendant or employee being\npresent. On one occasion the VMO observed a member of the public touching the giraffe's nose while feeding the\nanimal. Over the course of approximately an hour, no attendant or employee was observed in the immediate or\nsurrounding areas where the giraffes are fed.\n***There is not an identifiable attendant, present at all times, in the kangaroo walkabout area, where the public can\nhave contact with the animals. The public is allowed to walk through the kangaroo walkabout area, unescorted, on\nthe designated path. The public can contact the animals, as the animals are not restricted from crossing the\ndesignated path. From 10:25 a.m. to approximately 11:15 a.m., the Animal Care (AC) Veterinary Medical Officer\n(VMO) observed several instances, from the public side, members of the public (up to 30 people at a time) walking\nthrough this area without an attendant or employee being present.\nThe absence of an attendant, whose sole responsibility is to oversee public contact with the animals, in these areas\nendangers the health and well-being of the animals by potentially allowing activity (rough handling, improper\nfeeding, etc.) that is harmful to the animals. The licensee must ensure during periods of public contact, a\nresponsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable attendant is present in these areas at all times.\nTo be corrected by 5/13/15"
