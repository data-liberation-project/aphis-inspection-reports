On\n9/8/15 it showed that the vet had visited, and (cid:28)CoRid(cid:29) and tetracycline were prescribed. The licensee stated that the\ntetracycline is still in use. The licensee stated that the vet came to re-evaluate the animals in early October, but no\nrecords were available to document the outcome of the visit.\nThe goats appear not to be responding to the medications. When animals do not respond to the prescribed\ntreatment, they should be re-evaluated to ensure the treatment is still appropriate for the ongoing medical problems.\nThe licensee must have the four goats re-evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plan. The licensee must make documentation available upon request. The licensee must\nensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: OCTOBER 16, 2016\nThe inspection was at the Gretna, NE location known as Vala(cid:25)'s Pumpkin Patch.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee."
