      "narrative": "At least 5 goats and 2 pigs in the petting zoo area had excessive hoof growth.\nA mature Aoudad ram continues to be unable to use either front foot/leg in a normal manner when walking and the\nfront hooves appear to be overgrown. There was another Auodad located beside the entrance road that had an\novergrown hoof on the left hind foot. The hoof was beginning to curl upward. This Auodad had a slight limp on the\nleft hind leg. The attending veterinarian has not examined either of the Auodads in at least two months. Abnormal\npostures and gaits can indicate a serious, painful problem with the feet.\nA Male Pere David's Deer had a front hoof that appeared to be twisted approximately 90 degrees outward from the\nother three hooves. The affected hoof was overgrown and pointing skyward. There appeared to be a significant\nbuildup of brown wet organic matter on the hoof that made it impossible to see the foot or most of the hoof. The\nowner stated that the animal was injured approximately three years ago.\nA Gaur standing beside the Rhino enclosure stopped in front of the inspectors and lifted its tail. It proceeded to\nevacuate a watery brown fluid from its rectum for several seconds before walking on. When asked, the owner\nstated that he was unaware of any of the Gaur having diarrhea.\nA ten year old Watusi named Goliath was observed to be noticeably thinner than it had been on the prior inspection.\nSeveral ribs and its hip bone was prominent through its flesh and it had a slight but noticeable tilt in its head. The\nowner stated that he had given the animal several dewormers and that the attending veterinarian had not been\nmade aware of the situation\nThe attending veterinarian must be made aware of changes in animals health in order to adequately treat them.\nThe licensee must have the above listed animals assessed by the attending veterinarian and a written plan of\ntreatment or diagnosis must be created and followed."
