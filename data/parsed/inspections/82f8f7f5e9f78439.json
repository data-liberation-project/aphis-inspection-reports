Rabbit (D-193) had an opaque white appearance with a disturbed surface covering its right\neye. This rabbit died on November 6, 2015 before receiving any veterinary care. The second rabbit (H-721) has a\nwhitish-yellow crust and substance draining from the left eye which is barely opening. Rabbit (D-374) had excessive\ndrainage from the right eye and the skin beneath the hair appears reddened with a crusty brown substance around\nthe edges.\nThese conditions were noted at the previous inspection and has yet to receive veterinary care which was stated by\nthe staff. One animal has already died and to avoid any further discomfort, pain and/or deaths these animals need\nto be seen by a veterinarian immediately. A mechanism for direct & frequent caretaker communication is required\nso that timely information about the animals health may be conveyed to the attending veterinarian and the animals\ncan receive treatment as expeditiously as possible.\nThis was a focused inspection on the veterinary care of the animals.\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the Animal Caretaker."
