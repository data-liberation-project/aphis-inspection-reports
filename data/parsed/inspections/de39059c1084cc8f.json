Two elephants, Viola and Isa, were being bathed\noutside in a U-shaped area closed off by section of steel crowd control fencing with four attendants present. A pickup\ntruck with loud pipes/backfire startled everyone. Viola was nearest the fence and knocked it down and started walking\nwest along civic center drive. Two handlers immediately followed Viola while the other elephant was secured, and one\nhandler remained with her. With three attendants closely following, Viola walked along the north edge of the civic center,\ninto the road and then back onto the east side of the street reaching a green lawn where she started calmly grazing and\nremained until the trailer was brought around. Viola was loaded onto her trailer without incident. The entire event took\nabout 12-19 minutes. No human injuries occurred. Viola was examined by a veterinarian, found to be free of injury or\ndistress and cleared for performances the same day. The elephant could have been injured or caused injury as it walked\nalong the city street. Elephants must be housed in enclosures which are structurally sound and in good repair to protect\nthe animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nTo be corrected by 5/2/2024.\nThe evening performance of the circus was observed on April 30, 2024. Two Asian elephants, Viola and Isa (both F, 54\nyears old), were inspected at the Central Wyoming Fairgrounds, Casper WY on May 1st, 2024. This inspection and exit\ninterview were conducted with the elephant handler.\nn"
