The male, Yorkshire terrier identified by tag number 047, received veterinary care. \nThis non-compliant item has been corrected. \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. \n*The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information\nmanagement system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was\ndeployed, the \u201cprepared by\u201d date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the\noriginal inspection report, which occurred on August 23, 2016.",
