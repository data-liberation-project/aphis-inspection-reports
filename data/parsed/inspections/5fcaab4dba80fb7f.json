      "narrative": "There are 2 yorkies (#30, #32) and 2 Shihtzus' (#844, D28) that have a multiple matts on their heads, over their\neyes or on their body that need to be trimmed. The shihtzu #D28 has several matts with dirt clumped up under the\ntail. The eyes are covered on all of the shihtzus' (4). The yorkie M (#32) has multiple matts on his head and flanks\nthat stick out, he also has an injury to his left eye that appears to be a small tear on the top eyelid, that had bled in\nthe recent past, with a buildup of green mucus in the corner. The left rear leg appears swollen and discolored\nlooking like it has been bruised or injured in some way. This male also has excessively dry skin, with white flakes all\nover the body. There is a yorkie M (#6449) that has a white, ulcer like spot on his right eye near the pupil area\napprox 1/8\", with a tiny white spot starting on the pupil area of his left eye, the eyes are watery in appearance. This\nyorkie also has a large buildup of brown tarter on his teeth, with red, receding gums with gray spongy material\nbetween the gumline and teeth in some areas. There are several dogs that need their nails trimmed on the Corgi\nside of the kennel.\nMatted hair coats can cause discomfort to the regulated animals, and covered eyes can cause irritation and mask\neye problems if left unchecked. Untreated eye injuries or ulcers can cause pain and possible chronic issues if left\nuntreated. Untreated teeth with a large buildup of tarter and receding gums can cause serious health issues if left\nuntreated and managed.\nThe licensee must keep all hair coats and nails trimmed on a regular basis to prevent the regulated animals from\ndeveloping mats that can cause discomfort, or blind the animal by covering their eyes. All eye issues must be\nidentified and treated in a timely manner. There needs to be a dental program provided for all dogs in the facility to\ninsure that all dogs are treated that have a large buildup of tarter and receding gums under the supervision of the\nattending veterinarian.\nTo be corrected by: May 1, 2017\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee."
