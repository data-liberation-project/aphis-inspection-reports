The gums were inflammed and swollen above the upper premolars and molars. Green material was noted\nat the gumline adjacent to the upper canines. The gums were swollen and pulled away above the upper canines.\nRecords indicated this animal was acquired in 2010, and has not had a dental cleaning performed while at the\nfacility.\n*Animal #4489-F, a beagle, had brown to tan hard material covering the surface of all visible cheek teeth and the\nupper canines. The gums above the affected teeth were red and swollen. A review of medical records indicated this\nanimal had a dental cleaning 13 months ago.\nThe above described signs are consistent with dental disease which can be painful and cause systemic health\nproblems.The veterinarian should be consulted for the identification, diagnosis and treatment of any dogs affected\nwith these symptoms.\nAlthough the facility has performed 40 dental cleanings since the last inspection some dogs are still in need of\nveterinary care and treatment. The facility should assess the adequacy of the current treatment plan to ensure\nappropriate dental health is maintained for the dogs at the facility.\nExit interview conducted with the Vice President."
