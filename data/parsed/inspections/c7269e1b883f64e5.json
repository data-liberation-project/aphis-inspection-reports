This brings the total of probable predation\ndeaths for Grant\u2019s gazelles to eight for 2020, with only three animals remaining at the time of inspection. The facility\nattributes these most recent deaths to coyotes, whereas earlier in the year there was evidence of mountain lion predation.\nAlthough the facility has installed two sonar deterrent devices, and three motion activated light deterrent devices along the\nfencing for the \u201cHill\u201d enclosure, as well as three game cameras and one trap, the current efforts have not prevented these\nadditional deaths.\nThe California Fish and Wildlife warden, to whom the facility referred me, stated that coyotes must get under or through\nthe fence in order to prey upon the animals inside, and that the facility should regularly walk the fence to ensure its\nintegrity. The facility has been encouraged by Animal Care to work with state, county, and federal wildlife control officials\nto further explore methods to prevent predation. The current devices deployed seem inadequate considering the size of\nthe perimeter, and the on-going occurrence of predation incidents.\nFailure to exclude predators puts the animals at risk. The facility should continue to pursue methods to exclude and deter\npredators in order to protect the animals within.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd Section"
