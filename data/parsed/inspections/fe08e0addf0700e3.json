      "narrative": "-An approximately 3 year old female Golden Retriever, \u201cSassy\u201d (#97), with a litter of six 4 week old puppies\nappeared emaciated. She had an obvious visible waist and accentuated abdominal tuck. The tops of her lumbar\nvertebrae were easily visible and the pelvic bones were prominent. There was no discernible fat palpable with a\ngloved hand, bones were easily felt and the dog appeared to have a loss of muscle mass. The dog consistently\nmaintained a hunched posture and would often go out of view of the inspector by going in or out of the sheltered\nbuilding. According to a facility representative, he had noticed that the dog had gradually been losing weight since\nshe had whelped. He continued that the dog had been offered full access to dry puppy kibble since prior to whelping\nand the dog had been de-wormed about a week prior to the inspection. Although the dog continued to lose weight,\nthe facility had not communicated the dog\u2019s thin body condition to the attending veterinarian. The program of\nveterinary care did not instruct the licensee on how to address this problem. Poor body condition in dogs can be due\nto inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee must communicate with a\nveterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for this dog\u2019s condition. The\nlicensee must ensure that the treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all\ntimes. To be corrected by: November 29, 2018"

      "narrative": "-There were at least 9 enclosures throughout the facility housing dogs that contained greater than a day's worth of\nfeces. Some of the enclosures were in the outdoor facility and others were in the outdoor portion of a sheltered\nbuilding. It appeared difficult for some of the dogs to maneuver around the fecal material in the outdoor portion of\nthe sheltered building, however, there were some small areas of flooring available to the dogs that did not have\nfecal material and the dogs could avoid it. When asked when the enclosures were last cleaned, the facility\nrepresentative stated it had been 3-4 days ago. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease\nhazards and of the dogs becoming soiled. The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from the primary\nenclosures daily as well as from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive\naccumulation of feces and food waste. According to the facility representative, he would remove the excreta from\nthe enclosures by the end of the day of inspection. To be corrected by: November 29, 2018\nThe inspection and initial exit interview were conducted on 11/28/18 with a facility representative. A final exit\ninterview was concluded on 11/29/18 with the same individual."
