      "narrative": "Direct Non-compliance\n* A white intact female beagle identified by the licensee as \u201cSnow\u201d (with a date of birth of 01-02-2014) was observed\nto have abnormal eye discharge and red glandular tissue protruding from the 3rd eyelid area of both eyes. The\nsurface of the left eye also appeared cloudy. Examination of the mouth revealed a buildup of dense brown material\nin contact with the gums along the upper right and left cheek teeth with reddening of the gum lines. The licensee\nstated that the dog had not been seen by a veterinarian and there was no documentation provided at the time of\ninspection to indicate that the dog was being treated for any ocular conditions.\nCloudiness, discharge and protrusion of tissue from eyes can be an indication of on-going eye disease. Untreated\neye diseases may lead to increased animal discomfort, acute eye pain and blindness. Reddening or inflammation of\nthe gums with debris/plaque buildup on teeth and at the gum line may be an indication of beginning dental disease.\nUntreated dental issues may result lead to animal discomfort, difficulty chewing and weight loss.\nThis dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian within the next 72 hours to ensure that an accurate diagnosis\nis obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,\ntreatment and resolution of all identified conditions, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon\nrequest. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.\nDirect Non-compliance\n* A female Shih Tzu, identified by the owner as Ruuds Red Cool 3 (with a date of birth of 07-1-2011) was found to\nhave dense brown debris/plaque material covering the upper cheek teeth and upper canine teeth. There was also\nevidence of gum swelling, abnormal cream-colored discharge and retraction of gums from the teeth in areas in\ncontact with heavy debris/plaque buildup.\nYellow or cream colored discharge from the gums can be an indication of serious gum infection. Excessive tartar\nbuildup on teeth and dental disease may also lead to discomfort, difficulty chewing and weight loss. These\nconditions can further impact the overall health and comfort of animals. The animal listed above must be examined\nby a licensed veterinarian within 72 hours in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an\nappropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and\nresolution of the condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee\nmust ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.\n* A pregnant female red Pomeranian originally identified by the licensee as \u201cPurdy\u201d with an age of 10 years, and\nlater identified by the owner as \u201cSasha\u201d (date of birth 06-10-2007), was found to have dense brown debris/plaque\ncovering the upper left canine tooth with evidence of gum swelling and retraction at the area of contact with the\nheavy debris buildup. The majority of its teeth were no longer present.\n* A black/white colored female Shih Tzu, identified by the licensee as \u201cSilver Chocky 2\u201d with a (date of birth of\n07-1-2011) was found to have brown debris/plaque covering the upper right canine tooth with evidence of gum\nswelling and retraction at the area of contact with the heavy debris buildup. The majority of this dog\u2019s teeth were\nalso no longer present.\nExcessive tartar buildup on teeth, dental disease and tooth loss may lead to discomfort, difficulty chewing and\nweight loss. These conditions can further impact the overall health and comfort of animals. The animals listed\nabove must be examined within 10 days by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is\nobtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,\ntreatment and resolution of the condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.\n** Unable to identify, with certainty, the dogs cited under Section 2.40 (b) (2) from inspection dated 9-August-2016,\nreceived veterinary care.\nThese dogs were:\n*An adult, white, female Bichon (ID #082-600-008) and a white, female, Bichon approximately four years old (ID\n#16) both have an accumulation of dark brown and tan colored material coating the surface of the upper cheek\nteeth. The gum line is red and swollen and has receded away from the upper cheek teeth. The buildup of abnormal\nmaterial on the teeth can be painful and lead to a decrease in appetite. It can impact the ability of the dogs to eat,\naffecting the health and well-being of the dog.\n* An adult, female, Beagle with no identification, has excessively long toe nails on all four paws. Some of the toes\nnails were curving around and underneath the dog's foot pads. Long toe nails can get stuck in the holes of the\nflooring and break off causing injury. This can be very painful for the dog and affect the normal gait. All dogs must\nhave regular toe nail maintenance. From regular toe nail maintenance, the prevention of abnormal gait, injury from\nlong toe nails breaking off and growing is minimized.\n* The last document visit by the attending veterinarian (AV) was on 20-April-2016. With potential veterinary care\nissues cited for three dogs from the inspection on 9-August-2016, and dogs on this inspection, another yearly visit\nby the (AV) is needed.\n* There was a bottle of Oxytocin intermingled with other medications and ready for use that had an expiration date\nof February 2017.\nMedications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents of the\ncontainer can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications are not used\npast their expiration dates. Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could\nharm the animals. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled\nproperly in accordance with standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's\nrecommendations."
