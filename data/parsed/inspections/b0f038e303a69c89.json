The dog's ribs, spine and hip bones were easily visualized from a distance. At the\ntime of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted regarding this dog(cid:25)s condition nor was the dog\nreceiving treatment for it. Poor body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other\nunderlying medical problems.\nThe licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding these animals(cid:25) conditions in order to ensure that\naccurate diagnoses are obtained and appropriate treatment plans are developed. The licensee must ensure that the\ntreatment plans are followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: August 29, 2014\n*** There was a bottle of \"Gentamicin\" within the small breed whelping building that was past the labeled expiration\ndate of 6/2014. This medication is currently stored with other medications at the facility and is therefore ready for\nuse. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary\npractice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected\nresults when expired drugs are administrated could or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that\nall medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date.\nThis item was corrected during the inspection."
