Review of the\nfacility records showed that 2 parakeets and 1 finch had also died in April. The licensee said that she had discussed the\nbird deaths with the attending veterinarian during an appointment for her personal pet. The attending veterinarian stated\nto the inspector that she does not remember the licensee reporting the bird deaths because the licensee has not\ncommunicated with her about the animals at the store since her facility visit in September 2024. Not communicating\nmedical problems, including deaths in the colony with the attending veterinarian can lead to delays in assessment and\ntreatment of individual animals and undetected colony health concerns. A mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being\nis conveyed to the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by 7/20/2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
