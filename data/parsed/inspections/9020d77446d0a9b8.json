The four enclosures had tape applied to the exterior that sealed all ventilation\nopenings on the enclosures. Removal of the externally applied tape on one enclosure revealed the openings had\nalso been sealed with a layer of tape applied to the inside of the enclosure.\nNo dealer shall offer for transportation any live animal in a primary enclosure that does not conform to the following\nventilation requirement: when there are ventilation openings located on all four walls of the primary enclosure the\nventilation openings on each wall shall be at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each wall.\nBy sealing the openings on all four sides of the enclosures the animals were essentially provided with no openings\nfor ventilation. Insufficient ventilation during transportation will compromise animal well being by restricting oxygen\nand could result in death of the animal. Animals must not be accepted for transportation when housed in primary\nenclosures that do not meet requirements for adequate ventilation under the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect by: Immediate.\nThe inspection was conducted with United Airlines representatives. The exit interview was conducted on February\n25, 2016 with the licensee via telephone."
