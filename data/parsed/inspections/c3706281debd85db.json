The capybara was placed in its enclosure housing building. No additional measures or monitoring for body\ntemperature were performed during transport or after being placed in the housing building. The capybara was noted to be\nawake but sedate when the keepers left for the evening. The capybara was found deceased on the following morning of\nMarch 5, 2022.

The\notter was placed in an incubator following the exam for monitoring. The otter was checked on and vitals taken every 30\nminutes. After approximately 1 \u00bd hours, the otter's body temperature was very high at 107.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Cold\nwater baths and ice packs were used to cool the animal down to a normal body temperature of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe attending veterinarian indicated the temperature was not monitored closely enough to detect an increase in body\ntemperature in a timely manner. The otter died that evening. Medical record notes states his primary cause of death was\nmetastatic adenocarcinoma as well as \"there may have been damage(d) sustained to the tissues because his\ntemperature got dangerously high.\" Monitoring and care following the exam under anesthesia was inadequate to ensure\nthe otter successfully recovered.\nPost procedural care should include adequate monitoring and care to ensure appropriate recovery from anesthesia\nincluding monitoring the body temperature of an animal at an acceptable frequency to ensure it remains in a normal\nrange.
