At the time of\nthis inspection there was 1 female and 1 male in full antlers in the enclosure. The male had to duck his head to get\ninto the shelter.\nAdequate shelter includes allowing the animals to make normal postural adjustment while in that shelter, the ability\nto enter or exit the shelter without stepping on or over another animal, and the opportunity to remain shielded from\nwind, rain, and sun. The male ducking his head to get into the shelter is not normal postural adjustment. The\nplastic tanks do not allow the animals to enter or exit without stepping on or over another animal.\nAdequate shelter from inclement weather and shade during the summer must be available for all animals at the\nfacility at all times. The plastic tanks should not be used as the only shelter for groups of animals.\nTo be corrected by: June 1, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
