Review of the daily feeding log during the inspection on the afternoon of 11/5/24 showed that there\nwere no entries for feeding the red-tailed hawk and the barred owl on 11/3/24 or 11/4/24. The refrigerator contained\ndefrosting food which was assumed to be for the 11/5/24 meal. The facility representative was not the person feeding the\nbirds/keeping the log. I spoke with the main caretaker when she returned on 11/6/24. She stated that the birds were\nfasted on 11/3 and 11/4 as they normally are fasted two days a week. There were no documented veterinary directions for\ntwo consecutive days of fasting (confirmed with the Attending Veterinarian). Professionally accepted practices for raptors\ncan include fasting once a week if needed to maintain optimal body condition for the birds based on regular weighing and\nbody condition scoring of the birds. Fasting raptors of this size for two consecutive days should be instituted only under\ndirection of the attending veterinarian based on the medical needs of the birds to ensure appropriate nutrition for and the\nhealth and body condition of the birds. The birds must be fed at least once a day except as directed by the attending\nveterinarian or by other professionally accepted practices. Correct by 11/10/24.\nThis inspection was conducted with a facility representative on 11/5/24 and the exit interview was conducted with main\nfacility representative on 11/6/24.\nn"
