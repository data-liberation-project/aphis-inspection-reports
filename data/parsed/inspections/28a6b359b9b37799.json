Records on hand show that the facility is still currently using the drug.\nSuccinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this\ndrug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered\ndistressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug\ncan also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated\nthey can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,\nor training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis\nof respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available\nwhich are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.\nBecause of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or\nneuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of\ngeneral anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.\nThe licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care\nas required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and\nis likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your\nattending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides\nadequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of\nadministration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer.
