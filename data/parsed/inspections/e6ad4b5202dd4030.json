At the ends of these areas closest to the rear, the skin appears to be dry and\nflakey, with an area approximately one inch by one inch that has a brownish crust. The licensee states she has\nobserved the dog rubbing against the chain-link divider wall, but thought it was due to the dog'(cid:25)s loss of a mate.\nShe has not consulted a veterinarian about this issue. Skin problems can be caused from allergies, parasites or\ninfection, can be itchy or painful, and can affect the well-being of the dog. The licensee must consult with a\nveterinarian for proper diagnosis and to develop and follow a treatment plan. The licensee must document the\nveterinarian(cid:25)s findings; the treatment plan that is followed, and have the records available to the inspector upon\nrequest. To be corrected by: April 15, 2014."
