At various points of the inspection, no facility employees were present to deter the\npublic from handling the animals. The inspectors notified staff members about the animal contact, however, a consistent\nattendant was not present in these areas to observe the public during the duration of the auction. In the hoofstock barn,\nmembers of the public were observed touching and petting two juvenile dromedary camels.
