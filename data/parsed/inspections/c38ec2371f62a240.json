This primate has lived in this enclosure since July, 2009 and was only observed entering the moat on two\noccasions that first year, and none since that time until this incident. The enclosure was not adequate to prevent\nthe primate from being injured.\nThe facility has corrected this citation by placing hot wires at the edge of the primate side of the moat, hardware\ncloth mesh over the moat fence on the primates side, and electifying the new secondary separation fence on the\nlions side. Measures are also in place to report and take actions if animals go into the moat.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representatives."
