The facility had contacted their veterinarian over the phone on 11/4/16. At that time, the veterinarian\nprescribed a new ointment that the facility is currently using. The animal has not been evaluated by a veterinarian\nsince 8/25/16 and no additional diagnostic testing has been done.\nEye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical\nconditions and can be painful and distressing. Furthermore, not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting\nthe health and well-being of the animal and has the potential for further injury.\nThe licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by no later than 5:00 p.m on November 18, 2016, to\nobtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the ocular issue cited above. The outcome of this\nconsultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the\nveterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian,\nany medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal\nhealth record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and\nthe need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate\nveterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for\nproviding adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries.\n***There are several animals at the facility that are in need of hoof trims (three pigs, housed in the indoor barn, 3\nsheep and 3 goats) which were pointed out to the facility/animal manager during the inspection. The hooves on the\nanimals were excessively long, extending out approximately three to five inches. Failure to appropriately maintain\nhooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
