This included 3 unit managers, 1 faculty member and 1 researcher.\nThey each indicated that they would call someone other than the AV, such as the Field Services Unit, a clinician on call, a\nprivate veterinarian, or some other entity. Upon phone contact with one of the listed private veterinarians to be contacted\nregarding equine concerns, the private veterinary hospital indicated that they had not provided services to NCSU since\nDecember 2000.\nThe lack of the required direct and frequent communication between staff conducting the AV-delegated daily observations\nof animals and the institution\u2019s AV is pervasive. Per the regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain\nprograms of adequate veterinary care that include: Daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being.\nProvided, however, that daily observations of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the AV; and\nProvided, further, That a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior and well being is conveyed to the AV. Correct by 11Aug2021. The AV\nhas begun correcting this lapse by developing new SOPs outlining the role and authority of the AV and the requirements\nfor direct and timely communications from whomever is performing daily observations to the AV."
