The room had flooded because the pit drain was plugged but the pit flush valve was left open. Four\npiglets were found dead. The room was drained, and the sows and surviving piglets were dried, and it was determined\nthat they did not need any further medical care. To avoid incidents such as this from happening again, the facility must\nensure that all daily care for the animals and their enclosures is done in a manner that they are protected from injury or\nharm. The facility has replaced the drain plug with a re-designed plug that allows water to drain before the pit fills and\noverflows into the room. The issue was corrected prior to the time of the inspection.\nCorrected Date: April 23,2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
