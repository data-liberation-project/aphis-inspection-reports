In addition, several totes are cracked and do not\nhave the structural strength necessary to withstand the rigors of travel. At the time of this inspection, an associate\nreturned from a party with 15 rabbits in three of these totes. One tote contained two rabbits, one contained a doe\nand her four week old litter of seven kits, and the last contained a doe and her four week old litter of four kits At least\none of these totes had significant cracks, potentially exposing sharp edges and making it difficult or impossible to\nclean and disinfect.\nAll licensees are required to ensure that transport enclosures for rabbits have ventilation openings located on two\nopposite walls of the primary enclosure and that the ventilation openings on each wall are at least 16 percent of the\ntotal surface area. Alternately, transport enclosures for rabbits may have ventilation openings located on all four\nwalls of the primary enclosure provided that those openings are at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each\nwall.\nAs they are currently constructed the Rubbermaid-type totes do not provide adequate ventilation or structural\nstrength as required. Correct by ensuring that all transport enclosure used in the future are constructed in a manner\nthat adequate ventilation is provided to all animals and that all other requirements for enclosure construction are\nmet.\nThis is a repeat noncompliant item cited previously on reports dated 4/1/2015, 4/29/2015, and 11/30/2015.\n\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives on 4/12-13/2016.",
