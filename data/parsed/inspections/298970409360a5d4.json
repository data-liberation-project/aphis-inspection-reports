There is an approximately\n3.5 feet long gap measuring 2 inches wide in the primary enclosure fencing located approximately 2.5 feet from ground\nsurface that allows the public to stick a hand through. The animals were observed sniffing the gap area and being able to\nreach the gap. The primary enclosure wall is constructed of solid metal paneling approximately 3 feet tall with an inward\ntilted metal mesh panel topper measuring approximately 18 inches tall. A member of the public may be able to reach over\nthe primary enclosure fencing to make contact with animals. Failure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers between\nthe animal and the viewing public may pose a risk of harm to the animal and to the public.
