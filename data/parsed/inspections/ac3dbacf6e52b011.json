To protect the animal from excessive wind/rain, a wind/rain block needs to be added to the sides of the enclosure\nthat face the prevailing winds. Adding this protection prevents any potential discomfort for the animal, but should still\nallow adequate airflow.\nCorrect by: July 8, 2014\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Licensee."
