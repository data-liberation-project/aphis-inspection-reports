Many of the enclosures had smeared feces tracked on the flooring from the\nexcessive fecal buildup on the flooring. Many of the animals were not able to move around the enclosure freely\nwithout stepping in feces. The outside portion of the facility there was a build up of fecal waste under the\nenclosures. The fecal build up was about 2-3 ft. under the dogs' flooring. The licensee stated it had probably been\nabout a month since that area was cleaned. The accumulation of waste can increase health hazards, attract insects\nand pests, and produce odors. The licensee must spot clean daily all surfaces that come in contact with the dogs,\nother surfaces must be cleaned at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation\nof waste.\nTo be corrected by: Aug. 30, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
