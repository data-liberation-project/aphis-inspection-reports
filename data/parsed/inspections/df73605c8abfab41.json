The licensee has never returned\nany phone messages or tried to make contact with this inspector. On this date I stayed in the driveway for 25\nminutes honking the horn several times after knocking on the trailer. There were 2 cars in the drive and the TV was\non as it could be heard when I knocked on the trailer. There was a tall male who came to the window of the back\ndoor and watched me in the driveway, however they would not make contact. I tried leaving messages however the\nhome phone is now disconnected and the cell phone was set to not take any messages. This licensee has actively\nrefused to communicate with the inspector to allow an inspection and has continually made no effort to work out any\narrangements for future inspections. Attempts have been made on multiple days and times with no results, and the\nlicensee has not communicated any 'optimal times for inspection' options after repeated messages and 'attempted\ninspections' requesting this information.\nPlease contact this inspector at 618-315-3649 ASAP in order to sort out optimal times for inspections."
