The mats were located on the dog's feet, legs, abdomen, back, sides,\nneck, and ears. Many larger mats were firmly attached to the underlying skin. No skin disease was noted. Mats may\ncause discomfort or pain to the animal, limit mobility, and trap moisture leading to skin disease. Mats may also hide\nunderlying skin infections. Correct by regular monitoring of hair coat and grooming as necessary to prevent\ndevelopment of mats. Correct by December 18th, 2019."
