The facility must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is\nof sufficient height (at least eight feet) to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. This height must be\nmaintained for the entire length and vegetation must not be allowed to compromise the integrity and effectiveness of\nthe fence. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and\nunauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that\nit can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility director."
