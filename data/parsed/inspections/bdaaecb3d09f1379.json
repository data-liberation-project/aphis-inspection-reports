The approved protocol provided for the use of ketamine for\nrestraint/sedation for minor experimental/diagnostic procedures (pulse rate, blood pressure, weight etc.). Based on a\nconversation with the Attending Veterinarian, the inadequate restraint occurred because the animal was no longer\nadequately responding to the drug. Instances were also identified where lab staff recorded specific values in animal\nrecords without performing the corresponding necessary measurements/procedures. The laboratory staff did not notify the\nfacility's veterinary staff of the lack of expected response to the ketamine dose and the resulting lack of appropriate\nrestraint to allow for the minor procedures to be performed. The reports reviewed stated that there were no negative\nhealth impacts on the animal. Lack of adequate and timely communication of problems with the veterinary staff can lead\nto inadequate care of the animals, distress to the animals and health issues. The facility needs to ensure that they\nestablish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care in which there is a mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is\nconveyed to the attending veterinarian.
