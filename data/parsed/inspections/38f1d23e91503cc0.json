The protocol contains contradictory statements regarding pain and distress, stating that\n\"There is no discomfort or pain associated with these studies\" while acknowledging \"...minimal stress associated\nwith holding animals and restraining the animals for approximately 5 - 6 hours during the study and for drawing\nblood samples.\" The protocol then states that to minimize stress the animals are to be handled by a person who is\nwell trained in animal handling. There is no description of potential signs of pain or distress from drawing blood or\nbeing restrained for five to six hours, nor is there any description of what the handler should do if the animals\nappear to be stressed or painful. The protocol also includes a reference to the use of Ketamine for anesthesia for\nuse during surgery, however no surgical procedure is described in the protocol. If Ketamine is to be used during\nblood collection, the protocol does not describe when or how often it should be used.\nRestraining animals for prolonged periods of time may cause pain and/or distress to the animals. The IACUC should\nensure that protocols contain a description of procedures designed to address pain and distress that may occur\nduring those activities.\nCorrect by June 26, 2015.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative."
