The facility representative currently taking care of the animals for the licensee has not\ntaken the guinea pig to a veterinarian. The licensee was reached by phone and stated that another guinea pig was seen\nfor a foot injury a couple of weeks ago and that was when the Animax ointment was prescribed. This particular guinea pig\nwas just recently injured, no foot wounds were noted and she has not been seen by a vet.\nWhen an abnormal observation is noted about an animal's health or well-being, the attending veterinarian should be\ncontacted and the animal examined to allow for proper diagnosis and treatment of all injuries and illnesses. The wounded\nguinea pig needs to be seen by a veterinarian within the next 24 hours (9/2/23). This was communicated to the licensee\nby phone plus email and the facility representative in person during the inspection."
