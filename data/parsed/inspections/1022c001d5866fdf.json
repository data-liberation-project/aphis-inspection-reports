She was found on the ground approximately 10 feet away from the\nenclosure and was outside of the enclosure for an estimated maximum of 12 hours. The bat was checked by the keeper\nand a veterinary technician same day and found to have no injuries. The next day, a veterinarian completed an intake\nexam and found the bat to be healthy with no new injuries. It was discovered that the mat in the tray slot at the bottom of\nthe enclosure allowed a gap big enough for the bat to fit through. The gap was eliminated with additional corrugated\ntwinwall plastic material and the animal has since been contained. Animals that escape their enclosures may sustain\ninjuries. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities for animals are constructed of appropriate material for the\nanimal, are in good repair and that they contain the animals."

Humane euthanasia was elected due to severity of injuries. A report of a necropsy performed by a\nveterinary pathologist on 7 February 2023 confirms that the lacerations to the left eye, head and face are consistent with\nbite wound trauma. Animals housed with other animals that interfere with their health or comfort may result in injury or\ndeath of the animal.
