Also, the black and white guinea pig has multiple rounded, crusting skin lesions over the\nback and neck. Per a facility representative, these animals had already received their daily observations this morning and\nthese issues have not been noted at this morning's daily observation or since their acquisition two days ago.\nIn another enclosure in Lane 4, a black \"Skinny guinea pig\" is observed with multiple healing scratches across its back\nstarting behind its shoulders, continuing down its back to across its rump, with associated scabbing that was not\npreviously noted on daily observation logs including this morning's daily observation that had already occurred.\nThese conditions were not identified by the facility and thus the attending veterinarian had not yet been contacted, nor\nhad appropriate veterinary care been administered. Failure to adequately observe animals for unmanaged health\nconcerns may delay care and cause undue pain, discomfort, or stress. The facility must maintain a more comprehensive\nmethod to perform daily observations of all animals to identify problems and to assure direct and timely communication\nwith the attending veterinarian.\nUpon recognition of these animals' conditions by the inspectors, the animals were transferred to another area for care and\nmonitoring and examination by the veterinarian.\nCorrect by November 18, 2024."
