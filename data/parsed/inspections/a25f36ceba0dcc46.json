The pigs\nwere provided \u201cwarming buddies\u201d which are warmed saline bags placed beside the animal. At 10:35am the Attending\nVeterinarian came into the procedure room and asked if the pig\u2019s temperature had been checked and it had not been. The\npig\u2019s temperature was 93.2 degrees Fahrenheit. (normal body temperature is around 100-99F) Additional heat support in\nthe form of a warm blanket under and over the pig was provided. Until that point, the anesthesia monitoring forms, present\nin the room, were not being used. Body temperatures were periodically checked and recorded from that point on. At\n11:30am the pig\u2019s temperature was 91.4 and at 11:45 it was 90.4. By 12:05 the pig was awake and on it\u2019s feet.\nInvestigation by the facility found that the study coordinator had not assigned anyone to monitor the pig while under\nanesthesia.

The SOP does say that a heat source \u201cmay be necessary depending on the\nanesthetic regimen and the procedure being performed\u201d. The protocol for the study also does not provide this information.\nAccording to the current interim Attending Veterinarian, no other training has been documented.\nGeneral anesthesia is always a risk, and it is not possible to predict how each animal will respond. For these reasons,\nproperly trained staff to administer anesthesia and monitor the animal\u2019s response to it must be present and attentive.\nEach research facility must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that provide adequate guidance\nto personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia. analgesia,\ntranquilization, and euthanasia.\nTo be corrected by: April 1, 2024"

      "narrative": "Over a period from December 1, 2023 to December 4, 2023 three Guinea pigs (ID numbers 4046, 4011, and 4020) in the\nsame study developed hind leg lameness and were removed from the study and humanly euthanized. The guinea pigs\nwere housed in enclosures with \u201cbeddingless\u201d flooring. The flooring system has many small circular holes that allow for\nwaste to pass through and has larger square openings in a triangular pattern at each corner that are slightly larger and\nappear large enough that a guinea pigs foot could fall through. The guinea pigs were housed in these enclosures from the\ninitiation of the study on November 14, 2023. Necropsies revealed that guinea pig 4046 had a fracture in the left rear leg,\n4020 had a fracture of right rear leg, and 4011 had a severe left knee injury. Although no animals were seen with their\nlegs caught in the flooring, the facility was suspicious that this was the cause of the injuries. On December 5, 2023 all the\nremaining guinea pigs in the study were moved to enclosures with solid flooring and no further injuries have occurred. On\nDecember 8, 2023 a fourth guinea pig developed lameness in one of it\u2019s front legs and was removed from the study and\neuthanized. The facility concluded that the injury likely occurred prior to being moved to the new enclosures, but that\nvisible clinical signs of the injury had not occurred until December 8. The manufacturer of the \u201cbeddingless\u201d enclosures\nwas contacted on December 5, 2023 and they confirmed that these types of injuries were a known animal welfare\nproblem with these \u2018beddingless\u201d enclosures, but admitted they had not disclosed this to MRI at the time the facility\npurchased them.\nEnclosures used to house animals must protect them and keep them safe from injury. Flooring in enclosures that allow\nurine or feces to pass through must be constructed so as to protect the animal\u2019s feet and legs.\nTo be corrected by: January 23, 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.\nn"
