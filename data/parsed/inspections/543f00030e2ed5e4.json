One male ( C\n69023 ) housed indoors for the winter months was observed to have generalized alopecia.. At time of the\ninspection, food enrichment had been given but there were no enrichment devices in his enclosure. The alopecia\nmay be an indication that the psychological /social needs of this animal are not currently being met. Enrichment\ndevices such as forage feeding, puzzle devices and even visual barriers may improve the psychological well being\nfor this animal and others.The facility does have a plan in place to address alopecia and enrichment however there\nis inconsistency in the way it is followed in different areas of the facility.The enrichment plan must be followed and\ninclude environmental enrichment for all animals.\nCORRECT BY : 3-14-16\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted by Dr. Pannill - USDA with facility employees."
