As defined in the regulation, the itinerary shall include the following:\n(i) The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes,\nincluding any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is\nleased, borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who owns such animal;\n(ii) The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and age\nof each animal; and\n(iii) The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,\nincluding all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require\nremoval of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length shall be reported to the\nAC Regional Director the next APHIS business day. APHIS Regional offices are available each weekday, except on\nFederal holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nAs a Class C exhibitor with no reported primary site, submitting an itinerary for the traveling animals is crucial to\nensuring that the animals are maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. There have been no\nitineraries submitted to the AC Director or ACWest@aphis.usda.gov since 2016. Online records and news articles\nidentified the licensees exhibiting their Fido 500 show at the Ventura County Fair (Aug 1-12, 2018), the Western\nIdaho Fair (Aug 17-26, 2018) and the Twin Falls County Fair (Aug 19-Sep 3, 2018). The news articles on the\nVentura and Twin Falls Fairs include interviews with the licensees, and the Western Idaho Fair schedule includes\nmultiple Fido 500 shows a day. The Inspector left a message for the licensee on October 11, 2018, requesting an\nitinerary or location in order to inspect the facility with no response."
