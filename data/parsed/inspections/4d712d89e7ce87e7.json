Some of the nails are\novergrown to the point that the toes are distorted from their normal position.\nRecords for 34397 do not show any nail trims between 9/11/12 and 12/11/14. He was trimmed on 12/11. He was\nnext trimmed on 9/24/2015, then on 12/30/2015, then 2/17/2016, 8/10/2016, and again on the day of inspection\nafter the situation was pointed out.\nRecords for 44652 show he was trimmed on 1/8/2015, 3/19/2015, 9/24/2015,12/30/2015, and 2/24/2016. On\n8/24/2016, the record says his claws were overgrown and breaking, and a trim was performed. He was trimmed\nagain on the day of inspection after the situation was pointed out.\nRecords for 34490 show she was trimmed 9/16/2013, 9/15/2014, and 12/11/2014. Entry on 5/29/2015 says\n\"overgrown hooves,\" but doesn't note that they were trimmed. A trim is documented on 7/8/2015, 12/9/2015, and\n1/28/2016. On 9/1/2016, it is noted that she had \"Overgrown front nails, trimmed nails.\" Nails were trimmed again\non the day of inspection after the situation was pointed out.\nRecords for 38876 show no nail trims between 9/14/2012 and 9/16/2013 when she was trimmed. She was next\ntrimmed on 2/4/2016, 3/16/2016, and on the day of inspection.\nRecords for 32376 show no trims from 9/10/2013 and 9/15/2014 when they were trimmed. He was next trimmed on\n12/9/2015, 8/31/2016, 9/14/2016, and on the day of inspection when long nails were pointed out.\nThe records of these five animals show that trimming is inconsistent in frequency, and likely quality. Improved\nsupervision of the personnel doing the trimming should be implemented.\nOvergrown nails to this extent can cause discomfort to the animal and the misalignment it causes can contribute to\ndegenerative joint disease. Animals that have progressed to the point of anatomical distortion need frequent\ncorrective trimming to get and maintain them as close to normal as is possible.\nCorrected on the day of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel on 9/21/2016, and additional information\nreview and exit briefing was conducted on 9/26/2016 with LARC and IACUC personnel."
