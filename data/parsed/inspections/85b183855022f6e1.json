These\nsupport structures had each been supporting the wire flooring under and between two enclosures. Approximately\nhalf of one of the rusted support structures and the majority of the other support structure were disconnected near\nthe back walls and hanging from under the enclosures. When the dogs walked on the flooring a small gap could\noccasionally be visualized between the back wall and flooring. Also, there were portions of broken rusted wires in\nthe 1x1 inch flooring in one of these enclosures. The broken wires created larger holes in the wire flooring which\nwere big enough for a foot of one or both of the Yorkshire Terriers, housed in the enclosure, to have a foot pass\nthrough. The holes in the flooring and the rusted support structures under the enclosures increase the risk of injury\nto the dogs. TO BE CORRECTED BY: November 24, 2014.\n***The solid walls on the backs of the outdoor portion, inside and under the enclosures, of the facility were\nexcessively rusted. There were holes visible in some of the areas of rust on the wall under the primary enclosures.\nRust was also present around/near the in/out doors inside of the outdoor portion of the enclosures. Excessive rust\ncan decrease structural strength and can prevent the required cleaning and sanitization which can increase the risk\nof disease hazards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: February 17, 2015.\nThe licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are kept free of excess rust that prevents the\nrequired cleaning and sanitization or that affects the structural strength of the surface."
