One section of fence, near\nthe entrance gate on the south side of the field, is leaning sharply and has numerous broken and loose pieces of\nbarbed wire. The second fenceline is an older section of fence which runs along a treeline in the middle of the\nnorthern side of the field. This fenceline is no longer standing, but is mainly just lengths of wire lying on the ground\nand attached to the accompanying treeline. Neither of these fencelines serves as an effective barrier at this point,\nand both are actually a potential source of entrapment and injury to any animals which have access to them. These\nfences need to be removed or repaired so that they are functional and safe.\nCorrect by: 15 June 2014\nInspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative."
