The only source of ventilation for the transport container are\n10 holes each approximately 3/16 inch in diameter that had been added to the cover. According to the facility\u2019s\nSOP for transport of un-anesthetized NHPs within the main building, only sound proof and ventilated carriers will be\nused.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including laboratory staff, should be\ndone as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause overheating, physical harm, behavioral stress, or\nunnecessary discomfort.\nThe design of the plastic transport container that is being used does not include an adequate number nor placement\nof openings to ensure sufficient ventilation for the NHP during the time when the animal is inside the container and\nbeing transferred between the housing room and the testing laboratories. Sufficient ventilation is important to\nprovide for the health and well-being of the animals.\nThe research facility needs to evaluate the current transport container and ensure it provides sufficient ventilation\nfor transport, and if inadequate, procure another type of transport container that meets the requirements for\nventilation to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals.\nCorrect by 6/1/17."
