When asked to look at him the inspector noticed a big fecal/hair ball the size of a baseball ball hanging from his\nanus. There was also a fecal/hair ball the size of a golf ball hanging in front of his anus where the only way to visualize his\nanus was to physically lift away the fecal/hair ball. Upon looking at the anus the inspector noticed it was very red and\ninflamed. Poor coat care can lead to matting close to the skin such as the collection of fecal material which can lead to\npain, discomfort and have a negative impact on the animal\u2019s well-being. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure all\ndogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected: April 18, 2025"
