When asked, the\nlicensee explained that he did discuss using this medication with his veterinarian but was unable to obtain a dosage.\nThe licensee created his own drug dosaging and route protocol to treat. The licensee provided the medication to the\nrabbits orally and through muscle injection. The licensee explained that the treated rabbits did not respond or\nrespond well to either treatment, many of them going off feed and getting worse.\n-At least one black and white rabbit (Pecan side, second group) was identified by the licensee as having coccidia.\nThe licensee explained that he is treating animals with coccidia with Toltrazuril and that his veterinarian was\nconsulted on this. The licensee indicated that he determined dosaging on his own through research.\nTreating animals and/or dosaging without guidance from a veterinarian could lead to inappropriate methods\n(under/over dosing, inappropriate route) to treat diseases that can be detrimental to animal\u2019s health and well-being.\nThe licensee, in connection with the attending veterinarian must develop an adequate program of veterinary care\nthat includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nDepoe Angela, Animal Care Inspector"
