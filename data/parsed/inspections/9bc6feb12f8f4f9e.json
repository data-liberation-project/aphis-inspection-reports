Both cats were active and bright, with no additional signs of pain or eye infections.\nOne Bengal cat (Ruby \u2013 Microchip # 985141003971033) in the cattery (enclosure # K-2) had clear serous discharge from\nher right eye. There was no other sign of inflammation, pain, or infection in that eye.\nOne Bengal kitten (MC # 985141005790790) in the top cage of the living room - housing four total Bengal kittens - had\nmild, brownish, crusted nasal discharge. The cat was otherwise bright and active with no other sign of respiratory illness.\nOne Bengal cat (Puzzle \u2013 Microchip# 643094800132892) in the cattery (enclosure #K-4) had mild, brownish, crusty nasal\ndischarge. There were also signs of \u201ccow patty like\u201d loose stool on the litter box and floor. This cage housed three total\nBengal cats \u2013 Kai (MC # 985141005230112), Roxie (MC #98514100466201) and Puzzle, so it is unclear which of the\nanimals was affected with loose stool.\nIn the Quarantine room, one Bengal kitten (No microchip number) had mild white discharge from the right nostril. The cat\nhad no other signs of illness and was housed with one other Bengal kitten.\nIn the living room, a singly housed Bengal kitten (Microchip#985113007513687), in the left middle cage, had loose \u201ccow\npatty\u201d like stool in the litter box. The cat was otherwise bright and alert with no other sign of illness.\nIn the cattery a singly housed leopard cat (Eve \u2013 Microchip# 985141004661885) had loose \u201ccow patty\u201d like stool on the\nfloor of her enclosure. The cat has been treated by the attending veterinarian for multiple problems earlier in the summer,\nbut it has been almost a month since her last veterinary visit and the loose stool has still not resolved.\nNone of the cats are currently under treatment from a veterinarian for the aforementioned conditions. Loose stool and\nocular or nasal discharge is an indication of illness, infection, or other health conditions. If left untreated the underlying\nproblem may progress to a more severe condition. All cats listed must be examined and treated by a licensed veterinarian\nwithin 48 hours.\nAccording to the records reviewed during the inspection, the licensee is not following the vaccination protocol as indicated\non the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). Failure to follow appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat\ndiseases can negatively impact the overall health and well-being of the animals, and could possibly lead to avoidable\nsuffering and death. Each dealer must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use\nof appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
