On June 30, 2017 the facility completed the pre-license inspection process, but failed to meet the\nrequirements of the Animal Welfare Act, therefore, the facility did not obtain a USDA license to exhibit animals to the\npublic. As stated on the June 30th inspection report and reiterated by the inspectors at that time, the facility would\nhave to wait 6 months before reapplying for a USDA license and exhibiting the animals without a license would be a\nviolation of the Animal Welfare Act.\nConducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license does not ensure the animals are receiving the care\nrequired by the federal Animal Welfare Act. The facility must have a valid USDA license before continuing to exhibit\nregulated animals to the public. Continuing regulated activity without a valid USDA license is a violation of the\nAnimal Welfare Act.\nNO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and the facility\nrepresentative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRanslem Corbin, Animal Care Inspector"
