The licensee noted that she had not noticed his condition. On his right side most of his teeth were about a\nquarter to halfway covered with a light to dark brown hard substance. The gums on this side were red and swollen. The\nupper tooth behind his canine tooth had some gum recession with a small amount of root exposure. This tooth was loose\nand painful to the touch. Anytime that tooth was touched Prince would shy his head away from the inspector. On his left\nside the front top and bottom teeth were half to three quarters covered with a brown to dark brown hard substance, while\nthe back top and bottom teeth were completely covered in a dark brown material. The licensee called and made an\nappointment with her attending veterinary for this dog before we continued with the inspection. Poor dental health can\ncause pain and discomfort to the animal as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. Each dealer must follow an\nappropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that includes preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy teeth for\nall dogs.\nCorrect by: October 30, 2022\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
