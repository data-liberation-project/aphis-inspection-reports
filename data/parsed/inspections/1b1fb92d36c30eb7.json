A review of the anesthesia monitoring records for the\nanimals showed that there were no adverse effects on the animals as a result of the use of the outdated\npre-anesthetic.\nUpon being notified by veterinary services staff and in response to this incident, the IACUC determined that a\nmember of the veterinary technical staff had mixed the medication correctly but had not labeled the bottle of\npre-anesthetic with the date of reconstitution and the use by date, and had subsequently administered the outdated\npre-anesthetic to the 3 pigs.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, all personnel involved in the anesthesia of animals should be qualified and\nappropriately trained in the proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers for the species of animals that\nthe personnel will be working with.\nThe IACUC acted promptly to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and\nUSDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions\nincluded but were not limited to providing all veterinary technical staff with additional training on proper drug\nhandling and use, adding drug handling and use to ongoing annual training requirements, and implementing new\nrecordkeeping requirements.\nThis item has been corrected."

The procedure was halted to allow additional time for the local anesthetic to take full\neffect then the procedure was completed and the rabbit was returned to its enclosure. No lameness or other\nabnormality were observed in the rabbit at the conclusion of the procedure or after it was back in its enclosure. The\nfollowing day the rabbit was noted to have difficulty moving and was immediately examined by veterinary staff who\ndetermined the animal had paralysis and had no deep pain perception in both hind legs. Spinal fracture was\ndiagnosed and the rabbit was euthanized.\nThe incident was reported to the IACUC by veterinary technical staff and an investigation was conducted. Although\nit could not be determined exactly how the spinal fracture happened, the IACUC concluded that it most likely\nhappened during the routine procedure or when the rabbit was returned to its enclosure.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, handling of animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThe IACUC acted promptly to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and\nUSDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents.
