One caretaker told the other one to hold the\noutside door shut as she went into the primate cage with a cleaning bucket and a bucket of food. She thought the\nother caretaker was on the outside of the cage and door, but the caretaker was still inside the double entry. Zander\ncame out of his cage into the entry area, jumped on the back of the employee and bit her on both ears. The primate\nwas pulled off by the other employee. On 5-23-14, another caretaker went into Zanders double entry, retrieved a\nwater bowl through a slide pass, then left the entry area to get water. Zander went through the water bowl holder\nholes and out of the enclosure. The employee did not realize the macaque had left until it was found outside the\nenclosure where it attacked and bit a three year old child on both legs and one arm. The procedures currently in\nplace for cleaning and feeding in non-human primate enclosures are not adequate to prevent potential injuries and\nescapes. There was not appropriate supervison of caretakers to assure incidents like this would not happen.\nCleaning and feeding procedures need to be revised to provide for the safety of humans and non-human primates.\nAn appropriate training program needs to be initiated for all non-human primate caretakers to prevent further\nincidents.
