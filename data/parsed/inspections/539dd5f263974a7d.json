The facility is not\ncurrently using this enclosure to house animals.\nFailure to provide a safe primary enclosure can result in injury and/or death of the birds contained within. Housing facilities\nfor birds must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of bird housed in them.\nHousing facilities for birds must be kept in good repair, protect the birds from injury, and restrict other animals from\nentering that may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within.\nTo be corrected from this day (6/21/24) forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
