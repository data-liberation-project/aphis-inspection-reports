Upon inspection, it was observed that the facility has\nnot followed this instruction.\n- In the budgie enclosure, there is a spiral rope bird perch that has worn fibers. 172 budgies are housed in the budgie\nenclosure and several budgies are observed to be perching on the perch. The AV has instructed the facility to remove this\nperch due to the potential for injury to the birds if their claws were to get caught in the rope fibers.\n- The military macaw and hybrid macaw have overgrown claws. According to facility representatives and the AV, the AV\nhas instructed the facility to schedule claw trimming. The birds do not allow their claws to be trimmed while conscious and\nneed to be sedated for the procedure. Upon inspection, the claws are observed to be curling back towards the toes and\nare overgrown.\nFailure to follow the Program of Veterinary Care or specific directions given by the AV undermines their authority to\nprovide timely and adequate veterinary care to the species under their care. This can lead to worsening injuries or\ndiseases as well as unnecessary discomfort, stress, and/or pain to the animals.\nCorrect by February 11, 2025 by ensuring that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate\nveterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use."
