According to the curator and the treatment log on this animal's enclosure this\nmedication is used on a daily basis for the black-footed ferret. The usage of expired medications on regulated\nanimals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care.\nThe effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could\nbe drastically changed or may not work as anticipated.\nThe pot-bellied pig, (cid:28)\"Flower\"(cid:29) is housed in the quarantine building for treatment of a broken nail. The left and right\nrear outer toe nails are overgrown and curling inward. The junction of the nail and the skin on the left outer nail is\nrough and has a dried dark colored discharge . According to the keeper records, \"Flower\" was seen by the\nveterinarian on 4 June 2015 for concern of her left hind leg and the record notes states (cid:28)\"On closer inspection the\nlongest nail is severely broken near the base.\"(cid:29) The recommendation from the veterinarian at that time, according to\nthe keeper notes was amputation of the nail. The veterinarian left antibiotics (Ditrim 960) with directions on the label\nto give 2 tablets twice a day for the first 3 days and 2 tablets once a day thereafter. The bottle did not note how\nmany tablets were dispensed. The facility had the empty bottle and verbally reports that all the medication was\ngiven but does not have written documentation to support that the medication was given as directed.\nAs of the morning of the inspection 17 June 2015, the nail had still not been addressed by the veterinarian beyond\nthe initial exam on 4 June 2015. The curator reports that the pig has been eating well but she believes the pig has\nbeen limping. During the inspection, the pig was lying on the floor of the stall and stood when prompted but\nappeared reluctant to take more than a couple of steps. There are no notes in the keeper records to document\nwhether the pig was limping or was walking well during the time between 4 June 2015 and today's inspection.\nAccording to the curator there was no pain relief medication prescribed for this pig. The veterinarian did report to the\nfacility at the conclusion of this inspection to address the pig(cid:25)'s toe.\nFailure to address medical issues can cause pain to the animal. This licensee must use appropriate methods to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries in a timely manner."

Daily\nobservation and direct, frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the heath and care of\nthe animals. Lack of communication of ongoing problems might result in a delay of treatment if severity of the\nproblem is not known by the veterinarian.
