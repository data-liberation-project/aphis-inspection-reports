The following procedures\nwere performed by the investigators on piglets experiencing health issues without consultation, approval, or\noversight of the attending veterinarian or designee:\nGas anesthesia was used to replace feeding tubes on 03/27/19 for piglet 1-3 and piglet 1-4.\nPiglet 1-10 underwent gas anesthesia for replacement of a feeding tube on 03/25/19, 03/27/19, and 03/28/19.\nPiglet 2-5 was given a blood transfusion on 04/15/19. This piglet died 1 hour later.\nIn addition, during a conversation with the attending veterinarian the attending veterinarian stated that one of the\nclinical veterinarians observed one of the piglets in distress during her rounds. The clinical veterinarian directed the\ninvestigators to euthanize the piglet immediately due to its poor condition and suffering. The investigator argued\nwith the clinical veterinarian and did not euthanize the piglet as directed.\nMultiple instances occurred under Protocol 18-021.0 Version 4 involving piglets in which information on problems of\nanimal health were not communicated in a timely manner to the attending veterinarian or designee. The following\npiglets exhibited acute health issues. A veterinarian was not contacted in any of these instances. In each case the\npiglet died despite interventions initiated by the laboratory staff without veterinary input.\n13 piglets were involved in Cohort 1, which began on 03/22/19. On 03/26/19, piglet 1-8 was observed to be weak\nand lethargic. The piglet clinically deteriorated and died 3 hours later. On the evening of 03/23/19, piglet 1-13 was\nobserved to have poor circulation. The piglet died one hour later. On the evening of 03/23/19, piglet 1-7 was\nobserved to have poor circulation and weakness. The piglet died one hour later.\n13 piglets were involved in Cohort 2, which began on 04/12/19. On the morning of 04/15/2019, piglet 2-5 was noted\nto be lethargic and pale. The piglet was observed to have died 3 hours later. On the morning of 04/14/2019, piglet\n2-10 was noted to have respiratory difficulty. In the mid-afternoon the piglet was observed to have severe difficulty\nbreathing. The animal died that evening. On the morning of 04/13/2019, piglet 2-8 was noted to have a weak pulse\nand respiration. The animal died 30 minutes later. On the evening of 04/13/2019, piglet 2-13 was observed to have\nlabored breathing. The animal was observed to be paddling and was discolored. The animal died 3 hours later.\nThe research facility shall assure that the attending veterinarian has authority to ensure the provision of adequate\nveterinary care for animals in the protocol in order to minimize pain and distress and to improve health for the\nresearch animals. The attending veterinarian has knowledge and expertise in the care and treatment of animals,\nand must have the authority to recommend and require treatments as necessary to improve animal health and\nprevent, address, and alleviate animal suffering.\nThis issue was identified and corrected prior to today's inspection. The protocol is no longer active.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian and facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nJernigan Courtney, Veterinary Medical Officer"
