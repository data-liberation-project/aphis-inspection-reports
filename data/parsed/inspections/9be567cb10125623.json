They are not receiving the\nrecommended dose of their nutritional supplement, and no alternatives sources are being used. The supplement provides\nessential vitamins and minerals that these animals cannot receive from their current raw meat diet alone. When asked if\nshe was increasing the amount of supplement provided to the animals, the owner stated that she was decreasing it\nbecause they did not like the taste. When asked if she had discussed alternatives with her attending veterinarian or if she\nwas given any guidance, she responded that she had not. At the time of inspection:\n\u2022 The lynx is thin and observed walking with an abnormal gait. The right rear leg bows outward, and instead of walking on\nits toes with the heels off the ground, the sole of the right rear foot is making contact with the ground. The lower front right\nlimb and foot angle outward. These conditions are consistent with abnormal bone development.\n\u2022 The lion is thin, appears weak and has itchy skin lesions with alopecia, resulting in a bare spot over his shoulders and\nthe loss of most of his mane. There was a fresh raw spot with swollen itchy skin, on the right side of his neck just behind\nhis mane.\n\u2022 The serval was observed laying in his plastic shelter. The animal\u2019s body condition could not be properly assessed\nbecause it would not rise or respond to our presence. It is on a raw chicken only diet.\n\u2022 Both tigers are thin.\nImproper nutrition can negatively impact the well-being of the animals and lead to various health issues such as abnormal\nbone development, poor coat condition, compromised skin health, reduced activity, loss of coordination, weakened\nimmune system, stunted growth, or poor weight gain.\nThe food shall be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
