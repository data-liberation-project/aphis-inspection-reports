This condition was noticed by the licensee who alerted\nhis veterinarian previously and a treatment was prescribed. The licensee began applying an ointment prescribed by the\nveterinarian on the ears, but the issue never fully resolved. The licensee did not alert the attending veterinarian that the\nskin didn't heal completely.\n\u2022 The lemurs are not being fed per the attending veterinarian\u2019s instructions. Per the attending veterinarian, the lemurs\nshould be fed a 50/50 mix of nonhuman primate biscuits with a mix of fruits/vegetables. Instead, per the licensee, the\nlemurs are fed a ration comprised of only 10 percent nonhuman primate biscuits and the remaining 90 percent is a mix of\nbananas, peppers, celery, apples, grapes, carrots, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, tomatoes, and eggs.\nMedical care that lacks a post-treatment re-evaluation, if the veterinary care issue is not resolved, can result in delayed\ncare and inappropriate methods to diagnose and treat the condition. Also, not feeding per the attending veterinarian\u2019s\ndirections can cause nutritional deficiencies and/or impact the animals\u2019 health and wellbeing. The licensee must consult\nwith the attending veterinarian to obtain a treatment plan for the alpaca noted above and follow the veterinarian\u2019s feeding\nplan for the lemurs. Moving forward, the licensee must establish a clear method of frequent communication with the\nattending veterinarian to establish detailed and appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and\ninjuries while also giving the veterinarian appropriate authority to direct the husbandry and feeding recommendations.\nCorrect by 09/30/2023."
