This occurred while workers were bringing a large load of hay inside the enclosure while the young wallaby\nwas allowed free roam of the entire area. Video footage of the area shows the wallaby sustained its lethal injury when it\nplaced its head inside a gap on the hinge side of the open primary enclosure gate, and the gate closed while the animal's\nhead was in the gap. Staff realized the injury immediately afterward and contacted the attending veterinarian, but the\nanimal died from its injury in only a few minutes. Following this incident, the facility installed a guard covering to prevent\nfuture entrapment of animals during gate operation.\nBennett's wallabies are a marsupial species that normally remain in the pouch of their dam until nine months of age, after\nwhich they remain unweaned, cared for and nursed by the dam and in her protective pouch intermittently for several more\nmonths. Allowing this young animal to roam the large enclosure while staff were distracted and unable to view the whole\narea while moving the large load inside presented a higher risk of injury to the animal. The licensee must ensure that\nhandling of all animals is done as expeditiously and as carefully as possible, in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.\nCORRECTED BEFORE THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION CONDUCTED ON 08/20/2024"
