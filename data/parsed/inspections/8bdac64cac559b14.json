The underlying skin was crusty and had numerous scabs.\nThese two animals were not on any treatment and had not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian. These\nconditions are not covered by the current program of veterinary care. Hair loss, sores, and scabs of this type can\noccur for a number of reasons including both infectious and traumatic. Failure to properly diagnose and treat animal\nconditions can result in worsening of the condition. These two guinea pigs must be examined by the attending\nveterinarian so that appropriate veterinary can can be provided. Additionally, the licensee must maintain records of\nveterinary recommendations and treatment provided by future evaluation by APHIS officials. Correct by March 15,\n2018."
