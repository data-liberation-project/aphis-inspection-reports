When questioned\nduring the inspection about her food intake leading up this date, licensee stated that he had noticed that she had not been\neating as much.

The AV did not have a record of attempted contact from the licensee\nand was unavailable at the time of death. No other veterinarian was designated to cover in absence of AV. Necropsy\nresults showed a poor body condition adult female with severe widespread loss of all body and internal fat stores resulting\nin a severely underweight adult animal (3.66 kg, normal adult weight for adult female 5-9 kg).\nLack of timely and accurate communication with the attending veterinarian can result in lack of timely and appropriate\nveterinarian care and intervention leading to illness or death of an animal.\nA system of daily observations to assess the animal's health and well-being must be in place to assure that timely and\naccurate information is conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that proper veterinary care and intervention is provided\nto all animals.\nTo be corrected by May 15, 2025."

The following list\nincludes specific examples of inadequate perimeter fence, but is not all inclusive because there were areas of the\nperimeter fence that were inaccessible due to safety concerns and steep topography.\nIn the red fox exhibition pen (red fox was in the pen at the time of inspection) there is no perimeter fence, although a new\napproximately 4 foot barrier fence has been added along the road, there is nothing but enclosure fence elsewhere.\nIn the lynx exhibition pen (lynx was in the pen at the time of inspection) and the wolf (wolf was in the pen at the time of\ninspection) studio F enclosure there was no perimeter fence.\nThe bear yard has hot wire strands on the inside of a 4-6\" livestock wire fence, partially surrounded by chainlink/wire\nfence that is in disrepair. At the front side of the yard the topography reduces the effective height of the livestock wire, and\nthe wire fence is curled over. The licensee referred to the livestock wire as the perimeter fence around both the yard and\nthe den/shelter area, but it was incomplete, with multiple open doors and an area that was removed for a pulley system\nanchor.\nAdjacent to the house, the perimeter fence had a gap where it met the house at the corner of the deck, near the pen the\nporcupine was in.\nIn the reindeer yard, there were multiple gaps along the bottom of the fence large enough for animals to pass through or\nunder the fence. This fence serves as the primary enclosure for the reindeer and the perimeter fence for the fox and\nwolverine enclosures contained within. Various gaps measured at least 6-10 inches, and at least the same width. One\narea of perimeter fence had fence holes that were 6-10 inches.\nAround Asheena the wolf enclosure, there is a broken board that, according to the licensee had filled the gap, but at the\nmaximum depth it is almost a foot of space under the fence.\nA perimeter fence was under construction for the arctic fox, but had not yet been completed with gaps underneath, a large\nsquare hole and an entire side that was not enclosed.\nThe fox perimeter fence had a temporary roll of wire being used as a gate to access the enclosures, but the access point\ndid not provide an intact perimeter fence when closed.\nInadequate perimeter fencing can allow for access of unauthorized persons and other animals and fail to act as\nsecondary containment for the animals in the facility. This could lead to injury, escape, or death of the animal. It is the\nlicensees responsibility to construct and maintain the perimeter fence around all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities\nnot entirely indoors).\nAll outdoor housing must be enclosed by a perimeter fence unless the animals are exempt (reindeer). The perimeter\nfence must protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or\nunder it and having contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence must also function as secondary\ncontainment for the animals housed within."
