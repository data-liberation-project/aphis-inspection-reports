There are 3 mountain coati, and 1 \ndeclawed white-nosed coati.  The white-nosed coati was seen climbing the wall of the enclosure near the entrance gate.  \nThere is a gap large enough for the coati to stick its head and neck out of.  If this coati were to lose it's grip/footing this \ngap could cause injury or strangulation of the coati. \nThe facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor \nand outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals \nfrom injury and to contain the animals. \nAppropriate housing for the species must be provided and maintained to prevent injury or death to the animals possessed \nby the applicants. \nTo be corrected by February 4, 2022, or per language at the end of the report \n3.126(a)  Direct\n   \nFacilities, indoor. \nAt time of inspection the lead inspectors Kestrel 3000 read a temperature of 12.3 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of \n7.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The indoor temperature of the enclosure housing five kinkajous was only 45 degrees Fahrenheit. \nThe temperature was verified with the inspectors Kestrel 3000. A temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit is too low for \nkinkajous. Inadequate housing temperatures can lead to unnecessary discomfort and affects the animal\u2019s well-being. The \napplicant must sufficiently heat indoor facilities to protect animals from the extremes of cold temperatures, to provide for \ntheir health and to prevent their discomfort. The ambient temperatures shall not be allowed to fall below or rise above \ntemperatures compatible with the health and comfort of the animal. \nTo be corrected by end of business February 1, 2022\n\n3.126(c) \n   \nFacilities, indoor. \nOne striped skunk, eight cavies, two wallabies, four coatimundis, one red kangaroo, and two servals were housed in the \nindoor barn. The indoor barn did not have any lights. The only lighting came from three doors located on three different \nsides of the building. The lack of light prevents thorough daily observations and adequate routine cleaning. The applicant \nmust light the facility well enough to permit routine inspection, cleaning of the facility, and observation of the animals. \nLighting must be uniformly diffused throughout the animal facilities and provide sufficient illumination to aid in maintaining \ngood housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, adequate inspection of animals, and for the well-being of the animals. \nTo be corrected by February 9, 2022 or per language at the end of the report \n3.128 \n   \nSpace requirements. \nOne female juvenile cougar did not have an adequate enclosure. During the day, the animal roams the applicant\u2019s home. \nAt night, the animal is confined to a large wire dog crate that was in the furnace room. The crate was approximately 4ft x \n3ft x 2ft. The litter box inside the crate took up approximately one third of the floor space. Inadequate enclosures can lead \nto malnutrition, debility, stress, or abnormal behavior patterns. The applicant is responsible for constructing enclosures \nthat provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom \nof movement. \nTo be corrected by February 4, 2022, or per language at the end of the report \n3.129(a) \n   \nFeeding. \nThe applicant is supplementing the bone in chicken and chunk pieces of beef fed to the juvenile cougar and two servals \nwith a seaweed calcium supplement.  The applicant is using inadequate amounts of calcium supplement for the servals \nand juvenile cougar.  The applicant is using the amounts of calcium recommended for dogs listed on the packaging.  The\n\napplicant could not give the inspectors a specific amount of the meat diet fed daily, and the amounts changed numerous \ntimes when the applicants were asked about the diets. \nThe food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to \nmaintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and \ntype of the animal. \nWild and exotic felids must have calcium supplements added to their daily diet of slab meat to ensure they grow properly \nand do not develop painful bone or other diseases. \nTo be corrected by end of business February 1, 2022 \n3.130  Direct\n   \nWatering. \nThere was a layer of ice on top of the water trough for the zebra making potable water inaccessible. After the applicant \nbroke the ice, the zebra drank rapidly for approximately 90 seconds. The lack of accessible water can lead to animal \ndistress, dehydration, and death. The applicant must provide potable water as often as necessary for the health and \ncomfort of the animals. \nTo be corrected by end of business February 1, 2022 \n3.131(c) \n   \nSanitation. \nThe wire dog crate used for housing the female juvenile cougar at night was in the furnace room. The room was full of \nmiscellaneous clutter including foam strips, paper, carpets, a Nintendo controller, and a trash bag. The items were close \nenough to the cougar crate that the animal could reach out and grab the items with her paw.  There was evidence of \nchewed debris in and around the animal crate at time of inspection.  The lack of housekeeping can lead to animal disease \nand injury. The applicant must ensure that premises are kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury\n\nand to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and \ncleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. \nTo be corrected by February 2, 2022, or per language at the end of the report \n \nThis is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class \"C\" license. \nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the applicant. \nAll items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by March 29, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license \nfee and must wait 6 months to reapply. \nPlease contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection. \n \nRegulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nJUSTINE O MALLEY, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER \nGWENDALYN MAGINNIS \nLAURIE GAGEEnd Section",
