An IACUC investigation found\nthat 10 chicks died on March 10, 2024, 10 chicks died on March 11, and two chicks were humanely euthanized by the\nprincipal investigator on March 11. The IACUC determined that the principal investigator had deviated from the IACUC\napproved protocol and the standard husbandry practice of providing diurnal lighting. The principal investigator had also\nused gelatin beads containing an inoculate that was not approved by the IACUC and used the beads earlier than the\nIACUC had approved. The gelatin beads placed in the hatchers, which are set at elevated temperatures, coupled with\ncontinuous lighting, broke down the beads, increasing the humidity and adversely affecting the normal drying of chicks\npost-hatch. The veterinarian concluded that the beads were the source of moisture that caused the chicks to become\nwetter than normal after hatching.\nChicks are unable to self-regulate their body temperatures at hatch making them susceptible to chilling. The wet chicks\nwere then transported to another enclosure in the building, resulting in hypothermia and death of the chicks. A significant\nchange was made to the protocol without IACUC approval, leading to the death of 22 chicks. The IACUC must review and\napprove significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities before the changes are made to\nensure the welfare of the animals.
