      "narrative": "A male reindeer calf was noted to still be limping on his right hind limb as much or worse than noted during the\ninspection conducted on 8/26/2014. He was holding the limb off the ground when at rest, and the limb was noted to\nbe shaking after he had run around the pen 2-3 times with the herd during observation. Records from the attending\nveterinarian were available to APHIS officials during the inspection and indicated that this condition actually first\npresented on 6/2/14. This animal was re-examined and re-radiographed by the attending veterinarian on\n8/29/2014 after being required following the inspection by APHIS officials on 8/26/2014. The APHIS AC VMO met\nwith the attending veterinarian (AV) at an off site location following this inspection. Review of the records and\nradiographs was conducted with the AV. The AV had documented that she examined the reindeer calf during a visit\nto the premises for herd health work on 9/9/2014. The AV stated that she flexed and palpated the animal's leg\nduring this visit and didn't feel any instability nor did the animal appear to be in pain and she considered the\nlameness to be mild at the time of her examination.\nLameness is indicative of pain, possibly due to underlying problems with the healing of a fractured limb, which may\nbe intermittent and in need of monitoring daily. No detailed plan for monitoring the animal's progress, follow-up by\nthe AV to determine the level of healing, nor any criteria for when pain relief or ways to reduce pain or distress\nnoted during monitoring was documented as required following the citation for appropriate veterinary care during the\nprevious inspection. This was discussed with the AV and she stated she would provide this to the licensee so that it\ncan be properly followed and that APHIS can review to determine that appropriate care is being provided.\n**A plan needs to be documented, approved by the attending veterinarian (AV), and be available for review by\nAPHIS officials for the monitoring of this reindeer by the licensee for pain and to recognize changes in the animal's\ncondition. This plan should include criteria for when pain relief or other methods for reducing pain and distress need\nto be provided to ensure a good quality of life and to prevent worsening of the underlying condition. The licensee\nshould document that he is monitoring this animal and when pain relief or other methods are provided to reduce\npain and discomfort so the veterinarian and APHIS officials can evaluate if the plan is effective.\nA reindeer cow noted on the previous inspection on 8/26/2014 to have excessively overgrown hooves was trimmed\non 9/9/2014 and hooves appeared to be more normal. No plan, as required under the previous citation from the\n8/26/2014 inspection, was documented by the AV for addressing hoof conditions more frequently to prevent\novergrowth and chronic problems with which overgrown hooves may be associated.\n**A plan needs to be developed and documented, with the input of the attending veterinarian (AV), to address the\nneed for hoof trimming for any animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the development of chronic\nfoot and leg problems. This plan needs to be available for review by APHIS officials.(cid:29)\nEach exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries"
