Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas\nand cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.\nA barrier to prevent the horses from getting into the large pile on the South side should be placed by 7/19/2015 to\nminimize the risk of injury.\nPermanent removal of the debris and repair of any damaged fencing will be done by 7/30/2015.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the IACUC Chair and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM."
