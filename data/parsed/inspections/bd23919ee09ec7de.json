      "narrative": "Adult, female blue and white Italian Greyhound with number 933 has ongoing dental disease that has not been\naddressed. The gum line over the upper right large premolar tooth is red and recessed away from the tooth surface.\nThis large upper right premolar tooth is loose. The gum line over the lower left premolar teeth is recessed and one\nlower premolar tooth is loose. The front of the lower jaw is able to be moved when the two lower canine teeth are\ngently manipulated. The two lower canine teeth can be slightly moved toward each other. There is dark brown\nmaterial coating the upper right large premolar tooth and the lower left premolar teeth. There is a small amount\nwhite, creamy debris at the base of the lower left premolar teeth. The license stated that she believed that to be\npaper from the bedding. This dog is currently not receiving any medication or other treatment. The licensee had\nbeen giving this dog \"(cid:28)Plaque Off\"(cid:29) food additive and \"Tylan\" Powder in the water through the end of the month of\nApril.\nAdult, female Schnauzer with number 653 has ongoing dental disease that has not been addressed. The gum line\nover the upper premolar teeth of both sides is recessed away from the surface of the teeth. The roots of the large\nupper premolar teeth are exposed on both sides. One of the small upper premolar teeth is loose on the right side.\nOne of the small upper premolar teeth and the large upper premolar tooth is loose on the left side. There is a gray\ndischarge along the gum line of the lower right premolars. This dog is not currently receiving any medication or\nother treatment. The licensee had been giving this dog \"(cid:28)Plaque Off(cid:29)\" food additive through the end of the month of\nApril. These dogs were evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) on 26 April 2016. For the Italian Greyhound\nnumber 933, the documentation provided by the AV states: (cid:28)Has few teeth. Some plaque. Not enough teeth left to\njustify full anesthesia. Suggested (Licensee) do it herself.(cid:29) For the Schnauzer with number 653, the documentation\nprovided by the AV states: (cid:28)Recessed gums (cid:19) O L side. Doubt the scaler would even work. Suggested (Licensee)\nuse the sedative Dr. (Previous AV) dispensed and just clean them.(cid:29)\nWhen asked about her plan for addressing these dogs, the licensee stated that she planned to watch the teeth and\nat some point use the hand scaler to scrape the calculus from the teeth. She did not have a time planned to start\nthis. When asked what she planned to do for the dental disease -(cid:19) the loose teeth, recessed gums, and jaw\nproblems - (cid:19) the licensee stated that she believed that the loose teeth would fall out when they fell out. The licensee\nalso stated that the AV told her that the loose teeth could be removed but that she told the AV that she did not want\nto do that. Loose teeth, recessed and red gums are some of the signs of dental disease in dogs. Dental disease\ncan cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures (such as bone loss in the jaw), be painful, and\nimpact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animals listed above must\nbe re-examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and\nfollowed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented\nand made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee was reminded that the use of sedatives,\nanesthesia, and an ultrasonic dental scaler by the licensee to address the dental disease was only permissible with\na licensed veterinarian present for the procedure.\n* One black and tan adult male Dachshund ( number 1004 ) and one salt and pepper adult male Schnauzer\n(number 64) cited as a direct / repeat on the April 7, 2016 inspection report under 2.40 (b) (2) have a program of\ncoat maintance established for these two dogs by the licensee.\n* The focused inspection and exit briefing done on 5/10/16 were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver\nand Robert Bacon ACI.\nAdditional Inspectors\nShaver Margaret, Veterinary Medical Officer"
