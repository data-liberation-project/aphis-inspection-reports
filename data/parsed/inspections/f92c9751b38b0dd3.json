The fence shared by the muntjac and the ostrich enclosures was leaning into the\nmuntjac enclosure under the weight of large tree limbs that fell onto it. This excessive amount of fallen tree\nbranches was damaging the structural integrity of the fence in some areas and presented a risk of injury to the\nmuntjacs.\nOn the fence in between the two muntjac enclosures, on the side closest to the ostrich enclosure, there was a\nsection with a detached bottom. The licensee explained that this opening was created to allow passage between the\ntwo enclosures. A large metal part as well as multiple tree branches were placed there in order to obstruct that\nopening and prevent passage. This accumulation was protruding into the space occupied by the muntjacs and\ncreated an injury hazard for the muntjacs\nSharp points protruding into the muntjac primary enclosure could be seen in areas where wire fencing was laid over\nthe bottom portion of the primary enclosure fence. These may cause injury to the muntjacs contained within.\nExcess tree branches must be removed from the primary enclosure in order to prevent injury to the muntjacs and to\nprevent damage to the fence. All structures must be repaired or replaced in order to safely contain the animals. An\nongoing plan must be established in order to maintain the muntjac\u2019s primary enclosure in good repair in a manner\nthat contains and protects the animals from injury.\nTo be corrected by Feb 7th 2020.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMaxwell Kelly, Animal Care Inspector"
