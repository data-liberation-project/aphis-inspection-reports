      "narrative": "At the cargo facility serving Turkish Airlines, two fawn male juvenile dogs were inspected after arrival from Kyiv,\nUkraine via Istanbul, Turkey on waybill number 235-67264584.\n1. Fawn male juvenile dog #1 - This animal's enclosure contains a mixture of white and brown shredded paper\nmaterial. The quantity of material covers only ~50% of the solid plastic floor of the enclosure, leaving the plastic\nfloor exposed in the front half of the enclosure. Approximately 70-80% of the paper material is visibly soiled with\nboth liquid and solid excreta, and there is a pile of uncovered fecal material at the front of the enclosure. Small\namounts of brown, malodorous waste material are evident on the animal's feet and legs. A strong odor of animal\nwaste is present in and around the enclosure. There is not enough absorbent litter material to absorb and cover the\nexcreta, and as a result the animal is in direct contact with the excreta.\n2. Fawn male juvenile dog #2 - This animal's enclosure contains a plastic absorbent pad, which contains an\nabsorbent gel. Also present is an accumulation of loose, shredded paper litter material. One corner of the plastic\nabsorbent pad visible from the front of the enclosure is stretched and torn, exposing the absorbent gel within the\npad, and pieces of the blue plastic have been torn away, which is consistent with digging and/or chewing behaviors.\nThis plastic film and other components of this absorbent pad may be harmful to the animal's health if ingested.\nCarriers must ensure that primary enclosures with solid floors contain enough previously unused litter material to\nabsorb and cover excreta. The litter material must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic.\nThis inspection was conducted at the cargo facility serving Turkish Airlines. Two representatives from Customs and\nBorder Protection were present at the time of inspection. No airline representatives were available at this location."
