The IACUC\u2019s review of records of post-procedural care of 4 cats\ndocumented that one researcher failed to comply with three post-procedural monitoring and care requirements as\ndescribed in the IACUC-approved protocol: headwell cleaning frequency, appropriate body temperature care prior to\nreturn to housing enclosure after anesthesia and procedures, and post-procedural pain relief administration.\n\u2022 Per the approved protocol, headwell cleaning \u201cwill be done at least once per week, and more often if indicated.\u201d Medical\nrecords review of 4 cats revealed significant deviation from this instruction.\n\u2022 Per the medical record, the headwell of Cat 1 was cleaned only once at 10 days post-implantation in June 2021.\n\u2022 Per the medical record, the headwell of Cat 2 was not cleaned according to the approved protocol frequency between\nAugust 2020 and June 2021. According to medical record entries, the headwell was cleaned only 9 times, instead of the\nminimum of 42 times as required by the IACUC-approved protocol. The longest interval between cleanings was 25 days.\n\u2022 Per the medical record, the headwell of Cat 3 was not cleaned until 10 days post-implant surgery in June 2021.\n\u2022 Per the medical record, the headwell of Cat 4 was not cleaned according to the approved protocol frequency between\nSeptember and October 2020. The headwell was only cleaned 3 times. The longest interval between cleanings was 16\ndays.\n\u2022 Per the medical records, 4 incidents document cats being returned to their housing enclosures with recorded\ntemperatures below the normal range during the past year. The subnormal temperatures recorded were between 95.9-\nand 96.5-degrees F. Three incidents required AV team intervention. The fourth cat recovered uneventfully. Per the\nprotocol, \u201cthe research team will take appropriate measures to prevent significant drops in temperature in the procedure\nand in early stages of recovery.\u201d\n\u2022 Per the medical records, 10 recent instances where 4 cats did not receive protocol-required pain medication during the\npost-procedure recovery period were documented.\nThe multiple documented deviations from the IACUC-approved, protocol-directed post-procedural care requirements for\nthe cats indicates that one researcher was not effectively trained or qualified to perform their duties. These protocol\ndeviations may have resulted or did result in unnecessary discomfort, pain, and distress for the cats. Per the regulations,\ntraining and instruction of personnel must include guidance in at least the following areas: Humane methods of animal\nmaintenance and experimentation including: proper pre-procedural and post-procedural care of animals.

      "narrative": "Three separate research teams had adverse events involving the care and use of animals but failed to promptly\ncommunicate the events to the Attending Veterinarian (AV) team.\n\u2022 Based on available clinical and research records, a macaque was recorded as being hypothermic throughout a four-hour\nanesthesia (93.3 \u2013 93.7 degrees F) and vomited during recovery in January 2021. The research team did not contact the\nAV team to report timely and accurate information about the macaque\u2019s condition. The following morning during routine\ndaily observations, the AV team found the macaque unresponsive in its enclosure. It was noted that the anesthesia and\nrecovery records were incomplete, and that vomiting had not been recorded in the records. Despite immediate response\nby the AV team upon notification, the macaque\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate, and it was subsequently euthanized.\nThe necropsy documented bronchopneumonia. Due to the lack of communication from the research team, the AV team\nwas not afforded the opportunity to assess the animal\u2019s condition in a timely manner.\n\u2022 Five incidences of cats not recovering as anticipated from neuroscience research procedures over the past year were\ndocumented by an IACUC investigation. In each instance, the researcher indicated that the cats were QAR (quiet, alert\nand responsive) when returned to their housing enclosure following procedures performed under anesthesia as described\nin the IACUC-approved protocol. The researcher did not recognize any abnormal findings and did not communicate any\nconcerns to the AV team. Yet the AV team determined during same-day evaluations shortly thereafter that the cats were\nin fact painful, hypothermic, hyperthermic, in shock, and/or in distress and required immediate medical intervention by the\nAV team.\n\u2022 Five rabbits that had undergone prior IACUC-approved surgical procedures did not receive protocol-directed gabapentin\non a Sunday in May 2021. The research person responsible for administering the medication ran out of sufficient\nmedication but did not contact the AV team for guidance. The research team contacted the AV team on Monday morning\nupon noting the lack of Sunday medication administration. Upon notification, the AV team promptly evaluated the\nimpacted animals and reported that no ill effects were noted due to this missed medication administration. The AV team\nprovided gabapentin to the research team and it was subsequently administered per protocol. The AV team was not\nafforded the opportunity to evaluate the animals in a timely manner.\nFailure of research staff to make and communicate daily observations to the AV team in a timely manner can have direct\nand significant impacts on the health and wellbeing of research animals. Per the regulations, each research facility shall\nestablish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observations of all animals to assess their\nhealth and well-being. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV. Correct by 05Aug2021.\nCorrective actions already in progress (05August2021) by the institution include implementation of new AV-directed,\nIACUC-approved SOPs for all researchers. Subsequent significant training of research staff is in development for delivery.\nIncreased communication between research teams and the AV team has already occurred and will continue."

Necropsy results\nindicated that the cause of death of this rabbit was mechanical asphyxiation.
