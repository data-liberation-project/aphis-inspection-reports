Ten of these primates were either captured or returned to their enclosure on their own. One primate is\nstill missing.\nThe facility inspected the perimeter fence and did not find any cuts or openings along the fence. An inspection of\nthe perimeter fence today showed that there was a space between the 2 service gates adjacent to the enclosure\nwhich could be moved a few inches by hand. There was also a space between the bottom of another service gate\nand the ground near enclosures 163/164 which also can be moved a few inches by hand. The perimeter fence is\nnot 6 feet high on the left side of the old feed bunker, and this section shall be raised to at least 6 feet high.\nThe perimeter fence shall restrict unauthorized persons (and animals) from entering the facility and having contact\nwith the animals. The perimeter fence shall be at least 6 feet high along its entire length.\nSince this incident, the facility has provided additional security measures.\nCorrect by September 1, 2015\nThis was a partial inspection. The exit interview was conducted with the attending veterinarian."
