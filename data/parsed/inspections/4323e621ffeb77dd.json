      "narrative": "While moving through the kennel the inspectors noticed a female Yorkshire Terrier (ID #78) that was carrying the\nback right foot. During the entire time the dog was observed by the inspectors she never placed her right hind foot\non the flooring. The pads on the back right foot were mildly swollen and moderately reddened with superficial\nabrasions on the pads. One toenail was curled back into the pad, but no lesion was observed where the toenail met\nthe pad. The other toenails were long and starting to curl back under the right hind foot.\nInjured paw pads and long toenails can cause pain and discomfort to the dog and could lead to other veterinary\ncare issues. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\nDiagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspectors upon request. Licensee must\nensure that all animals received adequate veterinary care at all times.\nThe following dogs were evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and received treatment:\nFemale Yorkshire Terrier (#74)\nMale Yorkshire Terrier (#168)\nFemale Yorkshire Terrier (#84)\nFemale Yorkshire Terrier (#009)\nThe following dog was evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is under a treatment plan:\nFemale Boston Terrier (#175)\nThis was a focused inspection concerning the dogs cited under 2.40 (b)(2) Direct on the previous inspection report.\nExit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Heather Cole, VMO and the facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
