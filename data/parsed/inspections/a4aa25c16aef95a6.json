The inspector\nvisited the premises with a US Fish and Wildlife agent on July 30, 2015 where the individual admitted to selling a\njuvenile ringtail lemur on or about July 15, 2015. She also admitted to selling three other juvenile ringtail lemurs at\nsome point this year. In the presence of the US Fish and Wildlife agent, I informed her that conducting regulated\nactivity was in violation of the Animal Welfare Act. In addition, upon inspecting sale records from Madison Animal\nAuction on January 7, 2015, there was a record of her selling two coatis. There have been two application\npackages sent to this individual, one approximately two years ago, and the other early in 2015. According to an\nInspection and Licensing Assistant at the Western Regional Office who spoke with her over the phone after the\nsecond application packet was sent, she asked about what involved regulated activity. She still has not applied for\na license.\nPersons conducting regulated activity must have a valid USDA license to ensure compliance with the Animal\nWelfare Act by inspection of the animals, animal facilities, equipment and records.\nThe premise owner must not conduct regulated activity without a license. Any person operating or intending to\noperate as a dealer or exhibitor must have a valid license.\nAn exit interview was conducted by Lynn Clarke, ACI, with the premise owner and in the presence of a US Fish and\nWildlife agent."
