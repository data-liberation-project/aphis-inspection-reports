While there is an air conditioner on, the windows and doors are closed, with the\npresence of full litter pans, and wet papers from approximatley 1-2 days from the leopard. This is adding to the\nconfined area, which increases the strong smell of ammonia fumes.\nThe lack of ventilation to remove urine and ammonia odors can be a source of discomfort and possible health\nissues for the regualted animals.\nThere must be enough ventilation to provide clean air to the rooms where the regulated animals are housed.

The leopard is let out of the enclosure once per day in the\npresence of the licensee, however an adult leopard required more room for longer periods of time. There is\nsupposed to be new accommodation being made within the next few months according to the owner, however this\nsmall space is still keeping the animal from being able to partake in normal postural movements for the majority of\nthe day.\nThe lack of proper space for a regulated animal can be a source of physical and behavioral stress.\nThe licensee must provide more space for the leopard to be able to maintain normal postural movements and/or\nincrease the time she can be free from the enclosure to properly stretch and move around, until the new enclosure\nis completed by December 20, 2017.\nTo be corrected by: October 11, 2017\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee."
