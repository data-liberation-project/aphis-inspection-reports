      "narrative": "-Cheyenne, a 13 year old female wolf, was euthanized by gunshot. The director stated that Cheyenne was under\nvisual observation during March and April for an unspecified medical condition. The director stated that the animal\nhad been losing weight, not doing well, not eating sufficiently to maintain its weight, and was continuing to\ndeteriorate. However, no attempt to immobilize and physically examine or perform other diagnostics as part of a\nroutine veterinary examination was performed. A decision by the attending veterinarian was made on April 14th,\n2015 from outside the enclosure that the wolf should be euthanized by gunshot without examination of the wolf. The\ndirector stated that she searched for somebody capable of performing this act, and was unable to locate anyone.\nOn April 16 the order to euthanize Cheyenne by gunshot was given by the director. The gunshot euthanasia was\ncarried out in Cheyenne'(cid:25)s enclosure by an employee of the facility.\n-This facility does not have personnel or veterinary staff trained to immobilize animals to conduct routine physical\nexaminations on animals that cannot be handled; nor can they respond to sick, injured or escaped animals to\nprovide adequate veterinary assessment, diagnostics, and care. Euthanizing a wolf or other dangerous carnivore by\ngunshot, without ever giving that animal the benefit of a medical work-up or performing any diagnostics, is not\nadequate veterinary care for this industry. A program of training, acquiring trained staff, or an attending veterinarian\ncapable of performing sedation, restraint, operant conditioning for the purposes of veterinary assessment, routine\nhusbandry procedures, humane euthanasia and other tasks must be implemented to ensure the health and\nwell-being of the animals.\n-Correct from this day forward.\n-An exit interview was conducted with facility representative."
