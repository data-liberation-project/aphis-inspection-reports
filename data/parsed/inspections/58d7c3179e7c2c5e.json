The licensee just got this goat two days\nago. When she first got the goat, it did not have the open wound on its head, but did have the hair loss that leads down to\nthe back of the neck. The licensee has not contacted the Attending Veterinarian about this goat yet. Hair loss on the head\nand neck could be from the goat ramming its head into the fence, but considering the goat was acquired like this two days\nprior, the hair loss could be due to other things such as some kind of bacterial/fungal/skin infection. The hair loss may be\nirritating and depending on what it is caused from, it could be contagious to other animals or even people. The licensee\nmust contact the Attending Veterinarian and follow his or her treatment plan for this goat.\nP.S.
