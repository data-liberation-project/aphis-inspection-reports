When the licensee examined him, they noticed a swollen and blistered like left rear foot from a small string of fishing\nline that he got entangled on it. The licensee removed the fishing line from the foot, and to their understanding he was in\npain from having the string entangled on his foot. The licensee stated that he must have gotten injured during\ntransportation into his crate but was unsure on how the entanglement occurred or exactly when. They did not notice the\nentangled string until the foot was swollen. The licensee contacted the AV and followed their treatment plan, and the foot\nswelling is resolved. The inspector called the attending veterinarian, and they confirmed the occurrence of the event and\ntreatment plan. Improper handling of animals including not protecting them from potentially hazardous materials like the\nfishing line caused the injury in this animal. All animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a\nmanner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrection date: August 28, 2024, and this point forward."
