During that meeting the owner stated that he\nhad been selling and shipping puppies in sight unseen transactions. At that meeting, he stated that he now knew\nand understood the regulations requiring a license in order to sell puppies in that manner and further stated that he\nwould no longer ship puppies or do sight unseen transactions. He also stated that if, in the future he decided to\nresume shipping, he would apply for a license.\nA recent search of records of animals shipped through South Bend Airport revealed the shipping of at least 6\nanimals between March 2016 and February 2017 from this kennel.\nThe number of adult female dogs (approximately 120 -130) on site is greater than the limit to be considered exempt\nfrom the licensing requirements.\nThe sale and shipment of animals from a facility with more than 4 females requires a valid license.\nFailure to be licensed results in a lack of oversight on the kennel operation by the Department. The Department is\nresponsible for ensuring that all animals are raised and sold in a manner that maintains their health and safety.\nImmediately cease and desist the shipment of animals and the sale of any animal sight unseen until a valid license\nhas been issued by the Department.\nAn application was given to the kennel owner during this site visit.\nThe completed application should be mailed to USDA APHIS Animal Care Eastern Regional office, 920 Main\nCampus Drive, Suite 200, Raleigh, NC 27606.
