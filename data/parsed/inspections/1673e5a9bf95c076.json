It is important for the\nveterinarian performing site visits and providing direct care to the animals to sign and approve the program of\nveterinary care. This ensures that the attending veterinarian and licensee have a mutual understanding of what care\nis to be routinely provided for regulated animals and when a veterinarian should be consulted in case of illness. Site\nvisits are to be performed and program of veteirnary care approved by the site veterinarian at least once per year to\nensure that it is up to date and reflective of current veterinary practice standards for regulated species.
