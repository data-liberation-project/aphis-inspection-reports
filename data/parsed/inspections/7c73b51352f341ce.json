Closer inspection of the animal revealed a brown crust like material surrounding both eyes.

The back\nside of the left hind leg is hairless and the majority of the skin in this affected area is covered in a light colored\ncrust-like material.\nAbnormal eye and leg conditions and open wounds could cause pain and discomfort as well as lead to further\nhealth issues.\nThe above mentioned guinea pigs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and an\neffective treatment plan.
