The child grabbed the young lemur, which was then grasped by the mother resulting in a slight puncture to\nthe infant lemur's arm. Facility employees were able to intervene and prevent any further contact at this station. A short\ntime later as the group was exiting the lemur area, the same child left the group and ran back inside the public barrier\nwhere an employee was holding a one-year-old lemur named \"Sunday\". The child grabbed \"Sunday\" on the back and was\nsubsequently bitten or scratched on a finger. Park officials described the injury as a minor scratch with no bleeding and\nstated that it was just a reaction by the lemur and not an act of aggression. They also stated that the child continued the\ntour and was taken to Urgent Care later that evening. \"Sunday\" the lemur did not sustain any injuries from this encounter\nand is currently in quarantine with a local veterinarian. The infant lemur is recovering from his injury with no complications\nat this time.\nDuring public exhibition, all animals must be handled to minimize risk to the animal and to the public. Failure to provide\nproper handling poses a risk of injury to animals and members of the public alike. In this case, the result was a minor\ninjury to both a regulated animal and a member of the public. The facility must take any necessary steps to ensure the\nprotection of the public and animals.\nCorrect by 12 May 2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.\nn"
