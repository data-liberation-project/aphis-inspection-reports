  "narrative": "This is a focused inspection that was limited to re-inspecting \"BB\" and her enclosure. The licensee consulted with\nher veterinarian, & \"BB\" is currently undergoing treatment. The bridge of her nose appears slightly improved with\nless reddening. \"BB\" is scheduled for a re-examine in 4 days. The veterinarian has determined that her condition\nwas not attributable to her enclosure design, but to mosquitoes,\nContinue with the recommendations of your veterinarian until this condition is fully resolved.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. The licensee had to leave before an inspection\nreport could be prepared, and it will be sent by E mail.",
