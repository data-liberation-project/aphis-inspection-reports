Upon inspection of the crate of\na sixteen week old Spinone puppy arriving on a KLM flight to SFO from Rome via Amsterdam, it was discovered\nthat no feeding and watering instructions were attached to the crate. There was a sticker applied in Amsterdam\nstating that the animal had been fed and watered after arriving there, but it said the animal was last offered food and\nwater on 10/8 at 8:00. Assuming that was 8:00 AM, with the 8 hour time difference, that would have been 12 AM\nSFO time, thirteen hours previous to the time of inspection at SFO. But this is uncertain, as the information was\nunclear, and no feeding and watering instructions were provided from the shipper.\nWaybill # 074-57280510\nTransporters of dogs and cats must ensure that a certification is signed by the consignor that includes written\ninstructions for feeding and watering, and that this information is clearly visible on the primary enclosure so that the\nanimal can be properly cared for during transit. Upon taking possession of a dog or cat in transit, the intermediate\nhandler is assuming the responsibility of ensuring that all animal welfare act regulation requirements are met. The\nIntermediate Handler should take steps to ensure that the carriers for which they handle animal cargo abide by\nthese requirements.\nThis same issue was previously cited at this cargo office at SFO on 3/20/14 with an immediate correction date.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a cargo office representative."
