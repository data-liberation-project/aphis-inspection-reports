Approximately 10% of the fish had observable health issues during the inspection.\nFailure to adequately observe animals on a daily basis and failure to communicate promptly with the attending\nveterinarian may be detrimental to the health of the animals and cause unnecessary pain and distress. Daily\nobservation of all the animals to access their well-being and direct and frequent communication with the attending\nveterinarian regarding health issues is necessary to ensure that the animals receive timely and adequate veterinary\ncare. A system should be in place to ensure that all animals are observed daily and the attending veterinarian is\nnotified when necessary.\nCorrected by June 14, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRosendale Marcy, Veterinary Medical Officer"
