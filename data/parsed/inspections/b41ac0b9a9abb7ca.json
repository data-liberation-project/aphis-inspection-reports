According to zoo records, a containment and recapture procedure was initiated. To evade capture,\nthe animal eventually climbed into the moat of the Siamang enclosure and swam to the Siamang rock bridge. The\nSiamangs approached quickly but a zoo employee used a nearby hose to create a water barrier between the animals to\nprevent contact. The Black Howler Monkey went back into the moat twice more before being netted. Visual assessment of\nthe animal found no injury but did note that his legs were trembling. This trembling lasted approximately 2 hours before\nresolving.\nAnimals that escape their enclosure may be subjected to injury, trauma, and undue stress.\nHousing facilities for nonhuman primates must protect the animal from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict\nother animals from entering.
