On February 1, 2017, the bobcat was captured on property in a live animal trap that\nwas placed by facility staff. The bobcat was unharmed.\nAs part of an internal review of the escape, a hole was noticed in the netting that covers the top of the enclosure. On\ncloser examination, it was noted that certain portions of the netting was frayed or worn, which may have allowed the\ncat to easily create a hole large enough to pass through.\nPrimary enclosures should be maintained in a manner to ensure the integrity of the enclosure and contain the\nanimals within. The cover of the bobcat enclosure must be replaced. Additionally, an appropriate schedule for\nmaintaining the structural strength of the the enclosure must be established and followed. Correct before placing\nbobcats or any other exotic cat in the enclosure.\nNOTE: An appropriate corrective action plan has been developed in response to the escape. The bobcats are\ntemporarily housed in another enclosure until the primary enclosure can be appropriately modified.\nThis is a focused inspection to evaluate the animal care program for small exotic cats.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
