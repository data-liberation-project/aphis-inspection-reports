After water was added to a bucket in another enclosure\nUSDA observed a fox circling the water bucket that was too tall, trying to find a way to access the water. The foxes'\nimmediate attempt to drink when water was provided indicates the foxes were thirsty. Insufficient provision of water may\nlead to dehydration, poor health and possibly death.
