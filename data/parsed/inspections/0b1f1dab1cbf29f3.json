In one of the two previous weeks he had left a message to let me know that he was\nunavailable for inspection the entire week. The CEO of the facility has stated that he is the only person that can\nhost USDA inspections. He has designated that he is available Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning of\neach week for these inspections. This facility has a poor history of compliance and requires an additional inspector\nto conduct inspections. These inspections are set up well in advance with the additional inspector. This poor\ncompliance history makes it imperative that we conduct timely unannounced inspections. When on site we left a\nmessage on the facility answering machine and waited outside the gait for 30 minutes.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBongard Carrie, Animal Care Inspector"
