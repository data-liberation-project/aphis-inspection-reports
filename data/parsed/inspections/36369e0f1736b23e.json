Five additional horses were added to the study, however the\nIACUC was not informed of this protocol deviation. A post-approval monitor (PAM) detected the use of the\nadditional horses after the study had been completed.\nAdditionally, APHIS personnel discovered the following procedures were conducted instead of those approved in\nthe protocol:\n-Sedation of 28 horses with detomidine instead of the approved sedation xylazine\n-Injection with lidocaine prior to the nerve block instead of application of an approved topical anesthetic\n(benzocaine)\n-The use of hemostats to tap the teeth instead of the approved use of Von Frey filaments or thermal testing for\nconfirmation of local analgesia\n-The euthanasia of three horses rather than the approved two horses\n-The use of six control horses was not included in the protocol. These horses were sedated but did not receive a\nmental nerve block prior to the responsiveness testing.\nUnapproved significant changes to a protocol can result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal\u2019s\nwelfare at risk. All activities involving animals must adhere to those in the IACUC-approved protocols and\namendments. This conformance to protocol is necessary to ensure that the IACUC has the authority to assure the\nproper care and use of animals in research projects. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be\nreviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementing the changes."
