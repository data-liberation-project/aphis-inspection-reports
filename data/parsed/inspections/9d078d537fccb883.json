      "narrative": "During inspection, the following were found:\n- In an enclosure containing 5 \u201cSkinny Guinea Pigs\u201d, 3 of the animals contained skin lesions. A black and white guinea\npig, the smallest in the enclosure, had a large number of white lines carved in his skin covering his entire back, neck and\nboth sides. Several sections of crusty black raised scabs could also be seen associated with scratches throughout. A pink\nguinea pig contained three small circular lesions that were slightly reddened, raised, and flaking. One in the middle of his\nlower back, one over his left leg and another in the left posterior area. A grey guinea pig contained a moderate amount of\nscratches with crusty red/black scabs across the top of his back and right side with some fresh blood noted in some of the\nlesions.\n- In an enclosure housing 17 male hedgehogs, 6 had lesions on their ears. Two had a swollen right ear with black raised\ncrusty material around the edges as well as small open wounds and reddened skin. Two had a moderate amount of thick,\ncrusty black material at the tip of an ear (left ear for one, right for the other) with some reddened mildly ulcerated skin\nbeneath. One had thick black crusty material covering a large portion of both ears with reddened skin beneath. One had\nhis right ear made up of an ulcerated bleeding lesion with a moderate amount of thick crusty black material to the side.\n-In an enclosure housing 20 parakeets, 6 parakeets contained approximately dime sized circular areas of feather loss at\nthe base of their tails with some scabbing, with little to no feather regrowth and 2 were seen actively itching at the base of\ntheir tails.\nAll animals identified were in otherwise good health and did not show signs of discomfort. However, these conditions were\nnot identified by the licensee, therefore care had not been initiated. Failure to promptly identify such conditions delays\ncare and may result in undue discomfort. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented\nin order to properly assess their health and well-being. Correct by November 29, 2023."
