The entire right side of his\nface was also swollen.\n\u2022 In two separate enclosures, two different hamsters appeared unthrifty, underweight and each with a wet belly and tail\ntrying to clean themselves of the wetness/discharge.\n\u2022 A thin unthrifty robo dwarf female hamster was found lying on its side not moving in the back of the enclosure. Once\nroused, she stood unmoving with her eyes closed appearing dull and lethargic.\n\u2022 One unthrifty dwarf hamster was found in a corner at the back of an enclosure with a mostly hairless face and\nreddened/crusty skin underneath.\n\u2022 A teddy bear hamster with approximately 50 percent of its hair missing appeared thin and unkempt.\n\u2022 A black and white female rabbit housed singly in an enclosure was noted to have increased respiratory effort with yellow\nnasal discharge and yellow crust present around her right eye.\n\u2022 22 hamster enclosures were found to have cannibalism occurring in them. One enclosure had a hamster that was\nactively being cannibalized while it was still alive and another enclosure had active cannibalism of a recently deceased\nhamster. Two enclosures had approximately 8 pieces of deceased hamster with 7 alive hamsters remaining. One\nenclosure had a recently deceased hamster located under the feed bin. Another enclosure had deceased hamster pieces\nin the feed bin on top of the pellets for consumption and in the bedding material as well. The rest of the enclosures had\nvarying amounts of deceased hamster pieces in the enclosures with the remaining alive hamsters.\nThe conditions affecting these animals were not identified by the licensee, therefore the veterinarian had not been\ncontacted and care had not yet been provided. Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and\ncauses undue pain and distress in animals with conditions such as these listed here. A more rigorous method of daily\nobservation of all animals must be implemented in order to properly assess their health and well-being. Direct and\nfrequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention.\nThe animals identified during this inspection noted above were taken by the licensee for veterinary assessment and care\nat the time of the inspection.\nCORRECTION DATE: BY 08/05/2021"
