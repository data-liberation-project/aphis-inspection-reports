      "narrative": "Employees noticed the old female leopard repeatedly rubbing her ear on the cage fencing in January. The\nveterinarian was called and the leopard was put on oral antibiotics on 1-22-14. The veterinarian requested\ncaretakers get an ear swab if possible, but no diagnosis could be made from the one sample obtained. During this\ninspection, the leopard has both ear pinnae completely swollen and when she shakes her head, fluid sounds can be\nheard. She is still rubbing her ears on the cage and has rubbed a slightly bloodly raw area under the left ear.\nBecause the ears did not get better after several weeks of antibiotic treatment, the veterinarian should have been\ncalled out to see this animal. This animal needs to be seen by the veterinarian so a further diagnosis can be made\nand treatment given. The veterinarian was called during this inspection.\nOne speckled gray pygmy goat has a definite wheezing breath sound. The same goat has a very slight clear\ndischarge in the right eye. The owner states this young goat developed the breathing sound when it was a few\nmonths old and antibiotic treatment was tried at that time. The goat did not appear to get any worse or better, so\nno further treatment was done. This goat should be seen by the attending veterinarian to determine if any further\ntreatment is needed. To be corrected by 2-22-14."

The nails need\nremoval and the gap repaired to prevent potential injury to the zebras.\nThere are three broken boards in one side of the bear enclosure in the primate area. These boards are a visual\nbarrier, not part of the structural integrity, but still need to be removed or replaced as the broken ends are rough and\ncould cause potential injury.
