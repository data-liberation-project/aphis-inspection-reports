The licensee refused to provide the inspector with any information regarding where the\nanimals had gone stating \" I did not sell the animals, I gave them away so I don't have to tell you anything.\" I\ninformed the licensee at least twice that according to the AWA, the disposition of all animals, regardless of if or how\nthey left the facility or if a profit was made or not, must be made available during the inspection. At that point the\nlicensee became visually frustrated and told the inspector \"the government already knows too much about me. I\nhave never had to tell the inspector where my animals go and I am not going to do it now.\" In front of the licensee, I\nthen showed the male employee working with her how to navigate to the animal care website, and walked him\nthrough ordering animal disposition forms. After that I informed the licensee again that providing information on the\nanimals that left the facility was required, her response was \"I wish I still had my last inspector.\" I informed her that\nby refusing to provide me with the information, I would have to cite the infraction on her inspection report. Refusing\nto cooperate during the inspection process makes it impossible to properly conduct the inspection as required. She\ntold me she did not care, and that I could write whatever I wanted on the report, again stating that she had no\nintention of letting the government know what she does with her animals. The disposition of every regulated animal\nmust be provided in order to ensure that the animals were transferred in a safe and legal manner. Provide all\nrequired information during the inspection process.\nCorrect Immediately.\nA full exit briefing was not able to be concluded due to a refusal by the licensee to provide all required inspection\ndocuments to ACI 6021."
