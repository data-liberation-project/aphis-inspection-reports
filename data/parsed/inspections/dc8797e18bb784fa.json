A strong urine odor was noted when the APHIS inspector\nstood in front of the male rabbits\u2019 enclosures.\nPer this Section, the pans under primary enclosures having wire or mesh floors shall be cleaned at least once each week\nfor the health and comfort of the animals. The presence of urine-soaked shavings in pans under the male rabbit primary\nenclosures resulted in a strong unpleasant urine odor in the 3 housing rooms. The pans that contain urine-soaked\nshavings should be spot cleaned or cleaned on a more frequent basis to minimize urine odor and for the health of the\nanimals.
