The\nventilator testing was not successful, and the animals were not fully anesthetized. All four animals died immediately to\nwithin minutes. The PI did not report these unexpected deaths to the veterinary staff or the IACUC. A veterinary\ntechnician manager who became aware of the issues the next day while the PI anesthetized and attempted to intubate\nanother guinea pig reported the issues. The IACUC completed a lengthy investigation and determined that the animals\nexperienced undue pain and/or distress during the procedure to test the ventilator.\nThe guinea pigs in this instance were handled by the PI without the oversight intended by the IACUC. The handling was\nnot done as carefully as possible and caused undue pain and/or distress to the guinea pigs. All animal handling including\nstudy manipulations and immobilizations must be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause trauma, stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.\nThe IACUC suspended the protocol on Aug. 26, 2020.\nCorrected prior to this inspection."
