These animals were not identified by\nthe licensee prior to inspection.\nOne brown adult male alpaca was observed by inspectors to have creamy discharge present at the base of the right ear.\nThe licensee restrained the animal for inspectors to get a closer examination. Upon further examination there was dried\ndark brown exudate at the base of the ear and cream-colored discharge that was coming from a 2 cm circular mass at the\nbase of the ear. When light pressure was applied to this mass a large amount of thick cream-colored discharge was\nexpressed. Discharge coming from the ears of an animal can indicate an abscess or ear infection. Abscesses are known\nto be particularly painful before they are opened and leaving them without treatment can lead to unnecessary pain and\nsuffering.\nOne arctic fox was observed by inspectors to have excessively long nails. The nails were long enough that when the\nanimal was standing the nails extended through the wire floor approximately \u00bc of an inch. Excessively long toenails can\ncause difficulty walking and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures, causing injury.\nFive skunk were observed with excessively long toenails. The nails were long enough that they extended through the wire\nflooring of the enclosures while walking. Excessively long toenails can cause difficulty walking and can be caught in wire-\nbottom enclosures and cause injury.\nFailure to adequately observe animals daily, and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal animal health and behavior\nto the attending veterinarian in a timely manner, is not adequate veterinary care. Without adequate veterinary care, an\nanimal\u2019s condition may worsen, and if infectious, can spread to other individuals. Correct by ensuring that the animals and\nconditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be properly examined,\ndiagnosed, and treated. Additionally, ensure that daily observation of animals is adequate to identify all signs of abnormal\nhealth and behavior. Ensure that there is accurate and timely communication of problems of animal health, behavior, and\nwell-being conveyed to the attending veterinarian."

The licensee stated he had last watered the animals the prior evening around 7 pm.\nThe licensee stated that since the last inspection he has begun watering twice daily, but that he had not yet finished\nwatering that morning. At the start of the inspection, water receptacles in the front of the facility appeared to have water,\nbut the majority receptacles in the back of the property and mink barn were dry.

Approximately 105 mink, 36 ferrets, 8 striped skunks, 14 Arctic fox, 20 red fox, and 1\nraccoon all drank immediately when provided with water. Several animals were observed drinking voraciously including\nat least 3 red fox that drank for over two minutes and two mink which were observed drinking to the point of spitting up\nwater only to begin drinking again immediately. The eagerness and length of time spent consuming water when offered\nindicates that the animals are extremely thirsty, and that the current schedule for watering is not sufficient to meet the\nanimals\u2019 basic needs.
