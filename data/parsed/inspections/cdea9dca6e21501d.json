Over\nlong toes may alter the animal's gait and put undue stress on tendons and joint structures. In addition, the bottom\nincisors of one alpaca (\"Biff\" - 16 years old) were overgrown and protruding beyond the upper lip. Overgrown teeth\ncan lead to dental problems such as malocclusion, cause difficulty with prehension of food or chewing and result in\nweight loss or poor body condition. The licensee must correct these issues to ensure an appropriate program is\nmaintained for all aspects of animal care. The facility staff has contacted the attending veterinarian, and plans have\nbeen made for correction by November 25, 2015."
