The wallaby identified as (cid:28)\"White Left\"(cid:29) stopped breathing while anesthetized with isoflorane via a mask. The\nveterinary staff attempted to resuscitate the animal but she and her joey eventually died. While attempting\nresuscitation on this animal, the veterinary staff did not have emergency drugs or an ambu bag available in the\nbarn. Endotracheal tubes were available but a fully functional laryngeal scope with which to place the endotracheal\ntube was not. In addition, the (cid:28)\"bag\"(cid:29) on the isoflorane machine fell off at some point in the process, preventing staff\nfrom assisting with respiration for the animal. The absence of emergency drugs and appropriate equipment hinders\nthe ability to respond in case of a medical emergency. The facility must use appropriate methods to diagnose, treat\ndiseases and injuries, and provide emergency care. To be corrected by 29 October 2015.\n****Two separate enclosures housing the four Lar (white handed) gibbons contained loose-watery stool. One singly\nhoused female Lar gibbon was observed expelling watery stool during the inspection. When asked, a primate\nkeeper and interim superintendent stated that it is normal for white handed gibbons to have loose stool. They also\nstated that these animals have always had loose stool since arriving at the facility. As part of the facility'(cid:25)s\npreventative program of veterinary care, the animals undergo parasite screening via fecal exams twice per year.\nHowever, these exams have not been done recently, to screen for potential causes of the watery stool. Additionally,\nno other diagnostic tests have been done in order to determine the cause of the on-going current problems.\nWatery stool is abnormal and may be an indication of an underlying health issue including bacterial or parasitic\ninfection, increased stress or inappropriate diet.\nAs part of the programs of adequate veterinary care, the facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs\nof health problems are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner, including appropriate diagnostic tests, in\norder to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\n****The male singing dog (ID 13M016) was observed to persistently pace in a circular pattern within his enclosure.\nThe AC personnel observed the animal two different times, for approximately 10 minutes each, while the animal\nnearly continuously paced in the circular pattern. No notations were present in the animal's veterinary medical\nrecord regarding this abnormal behavior. When asked about this abnormal behavior, the attending veterinarian\nstated to the VMOs that she was aware that the animal paced but had not been consulted regarding the behavior by\nthe zoo staff. This abnormal behavior suggests that the animal may be experiencing psychological stress. The AV\nmust evaluate the animal and be involved in the development of a plan, implementation and follow-up of that plan,\nto minimize the stress and abnormal behavior of this animal.\nAs part of the programs of adequate veterinary care, the facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs\nof veterinary medical problems, including abnormal behavior, are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner in\norder to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\n****Several expired medications and suture material were found intermingled with current drugs in the storage areas\nduring this inspection: Rimadyl expired 12/2012, Artificial Tears expired 2012 October, PDS II expired Jul 01, and\nVicryl expired Jan 07 and Jul 00.\nThe use of expired medications is not considered to be safe or appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,\nand treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience\npain and distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.\nThe program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

All of the animals were reported to be stressed to some degree and not easily corralled during the capture\nprocess according to facility representatives. Two of the wallabies (\"yellow right\" and \"white right\") were showing\nsigns of significant stress and/or medical problems as a result of the capture procedure.\nThe wallabies were recovered from anesthesia in crates in the barn area and allowed to return to the exhibit when\nthey were ambulatory. All animals, including those with veterinary medical problems, were left in the multi-species\nexhibit (swans and emus) with access to the outdoor yard and heated barn overnight. The animals were monitored\nuntil the close of business at 5pm. According to the weather history on the Weather Undergound website, the low\ntemperature the night of 15 October was 36 degrees F. This facility did not have or arrange to make available an\nappropriate space suitable for housing of the compromised animals following the procedures for monitoring and\ntreatment consistent with veterinary medical and nursing care. \"Yellow right\" was found dead in the enclosure\nupon start of business on 16 Oct 2015. \"White right\" died during the day on 16 Oct 2015. Another wallaby identified\nas \"left blue\" and her joey died on 16 Oct 2015.\nFailing to separate compromised animals from the multi-species exhibit and allowing the animals with known stress\nand medical issues to remain in the exhibit overnight subjected them to the possibility of exposures to cold\ntemperature, compatibility issues with other animals, and physical exertion that could exacerbate the underlying\nconditions. The facility must ensure that pre and post procedural care is provided in accordance with established\nveterinary medical and nursing procedures. To be corrected by 29 October 2015."
