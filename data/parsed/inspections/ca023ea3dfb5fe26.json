Expired drugs may no\nlonger be effective and the use of expired drugs is not considered acceptable veterinary practice.

The dog was evaluated immediately after the incident and no injuries\nwere noted. Discussions with lab researchers and review of records showed that it was known beforehand by some\nof the lab personnel that there were problems with the door latching mechanism not latching securely. The person\ndoing the transport on this date however was apparently unaware of this problem. The facility shall ensure from this\nday forward that all facilities used to house dogs including during transport protect the animals from injury and\ncontain the animals securely. Corrections have since been made to this transport cage to ensure that the door is\nsecure during transport-corrected.\nInspection conducted June 8-12, 2015.\nExit conducted with Attending Veterinarian, IACUC Chair and Vice-Chair and other facility personnel.\nThis is an electronic version of the Word report with date prepared 12-Jun-15."
