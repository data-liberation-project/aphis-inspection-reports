Plans to improve the fence were postponed due to a delay in an expansion\nproject. The fence should be at least eight feet in height, due to the presence of animals defined as dangerous\nanimals, and it should prevent animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing secondary\ncontainment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The following shortfalls were noted:\nA.) There are portions of the fence that fall short of the six feet minimum height requirement, and other portions\nthat fall short of the eight feet minimum height requirement.\nB.) There are still some gaps under the fence-line of five or more inches that could allow animals to pass under the\nfence.\nC.) There are some gates where gaps exist underneath or between the gates of five or more inches.\nD.) There are places in the back elk/bison enclosure where there is debris or trees and bushed piled up against, or\nencroaching on the fence, reducing its effective height.\nE.) There are multiple locations where the fence is damaged, with fallen barbed-wire, missing structural support, or\nmissing fence boards.\nF.) There is vertical bar fencing near with four inch gaps between the bars, which could allow animals to pass\nthrough or under the fence. Additional there are two turn-styles with similar large gaps.\nG.) The primary enclosure for the elk and bison, and the veterinary hospital do not have a perimeter fence.\nThese observations are examples of where the perimeter fence does not meet the standards specified. The fence\nshould consistently meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. This facility should have a\nperimeter fence which adequately prevents people and animals from passing through or under the fence, and which\ncan also act as a secondary containment system for the animals on exhibit. This facility houses animals such as big\ncats, bears, hyenas, and elephants, and therefore the perimeter fence should be at least eight feet in height, and it\nshould either fully enclose the whole premises, or the areas where these animals are housed, with a perimeter\nfence measuring at least six feet in height for the other animals. There should be a separation of at least three feet\nbetween the animals on exhibit and the perimeter fence, and it should preclude contact with people or animals. The\nfence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here. Failure to\nmeet these standards could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.\nThis is a repeat citation; it was previously cited on 10/2/12 with a correction date of 8/1/13.\nInspection took place on 1/8/15 and 1/9/15.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative on 1/9/15."
