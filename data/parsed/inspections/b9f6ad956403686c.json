      "narrative": "At a public petting zoo event held outdoors at a public library there were 5 collapsible play pens set up under a very\nlarge shade tree on grass. 3 pens contained regulated species: a single rabbit, two guinea pigs, and a mini-pig.\nThere were also 3 goats staked and tethered with a leash and collar under the shade tree. The event began as\nscheduled at 11am and approximately 27 children were present with approximately 10 adults at this time. Only one\nattendant was available and she was still busy setting up the animals. During this period of time the inspector\nobserved two different children using sticks to poke the rabbit and the guinea pigs, one adult picking up a guinea pig\nand holding to her face to be photographed, and children using too much force when petting the animals. The\nattendant was not present to observe these events as she was back and forth to her vehicle collecting supplies.\nOnce the animals were completely set up the attendant was continually present within the area however she was\nalso displaying a snake and so frequently was unable to adequately visualize or hear what was occurring in all of\nthe animal pens. The attendant was notified by a child that a goat had tangled its leg in its leash and that one goat\nhad pulled out its stake. During the course of an hour the inspector counted two additional groups of children, 17\nand 27, with approximately 15 adults, coming to visit the petting zoo. This is a substantial number of people for one\nattendant to adequately oversee to ensure animals are handled carefully. An appropriate number of facility\nattendants must be present at all times during periods of public contact to ensure the safety and behavioral\nwell-being of the animals.\nCorrect from this day forward.\nThis inspection was conducted with the facility representative at the Blyden Branch Library in Norfolk, VA.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the licensee by phone."
