During this time period, the facility representative contacted the Attending Veterinarian who\nrecommended treatment with antibiotic and vitamins. The ewe was found dead 2/20/2017.\n****On 2/21/2017 the facility representative noticed another ewe attempting to give birth. He contacted the Attending\nVeterinarian who recommended antibiotic and vitamins. About nine hours later the facility representative observed a\nlamb's nose protruding from the vagina of the ewe. He again contacted the Attending Veterinarian who instructed\nhim to reposition the lamb internally. The facility representative was able to deliver the lamb, but it was dead. About\ntwenty minutes later the ewe delivered a second dead lamb. Five to six hours later the facility representative\nobserved the ewe trying to deliver a third lamb. It was also malpositioned so the facility representative repositioned\nthe lamb internally. He was able to deliver the lamb, but it was dead. The facility representative did not know if the\newe passed the afterbirths. For the next three days the ewe was weak, unable to rise on it's own and would not eat\nhay. On 2/25/2017 the ewe was found dead.\nEven though the facility representative contacted a veterinarian and provided treatment, neither of the animals were\nexamined and diagnosed by a veterinarian despite little or no improvement in the animals' conditions. The lack of\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can result in ongoing illness and\ndeath. The licensee must ensure that adequate veterinary care is provided at all times including nights, weekends\nand holidays.\nTO BE CORRECTED: FROM THIS POINT FORWARD\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGraves Alicia, Animal Care Inspector"
