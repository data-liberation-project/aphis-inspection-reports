      "narrative": "\u201cNigida,\" a 26 year old male chimpanzee, was injured on 12-09-18. A review of medical records indicated that he\nhad an open fracture of the toe with bone exposure, pain, clear signs of infection, and he was observed chewing at\nthe bone. The medical records indicated the \u201ctoe was dangling\u201d and a veterinarian did not see the animal until\n12-11-18. On 12-11-18, the veterinarian stated that the toe would likely \u201ccome off on its own.\u201d Intermittent antibiotics\nand pain meds were given, but no further treatments were administered. The medical records indicated that as late\nas 1-4-19 the wound \u201creopened\u201d and had still not healed. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care for wounds\ncan lead to unnecessary pain, infection, and/or prolonged healing of wounds.\nReview of medical records, meeting records, and other communications demonstrate a lack of adequate veterinary\ncare for a 13 year old female chimpanzee named \"Tiffany.\" Tiffany arrived at the facility on April 18th, 2018. The\nmedical records repeatedly documented anorexia (lack of interest in food, not eating enough chow, and/or not\neating enough calories) for over three months from 4/18/2018-7/28/2018. No diagnostics were done during that time\nperiod, and no treatments were given prior to 6/26/18 except for one dose of an anti-anxiety medication on 4/23/18.\nTiffany was sedated for diagnostics on 7/28/19 when the veterinarian documented a concern regarding Tiffany\u2019s\ncondition. The animal was euthanized on 8/19/2018 after continued anorexia and intermittent vomiting and diarrhea.\nLimited veterinary involvement and failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\nTiffany\u2019s condition demonstrates a failure to maintain a program of adequate veterinary care.\nEach exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency care.\nCorrect from this day forward."
