He did not display this reaction to touch of the corresponding area on the left side. After the saddle\nwas removed the haircoat over both shoulder areas, over the top of the shoulder and over the lower back where the\nsaddle rests was noted to have a very light almost white discoloration to the haircoat.

There was no\ndocumentation of any abnormalities noted or treatments of these areas in 2015.\n*One male chimp #1213 was noted to have multiple open superficial red areas/sores from \u00bc inch to \u00bd inch in\ndiameter on his face around and above the nasal area and on his left front shoulder area. The care staff reported\nthat they thought he was picking at the scabs in these areas that he had when he arrived at the zoo in June. Keeper\nand medical records do not document any lesions or scabs present in these areas or any diagnosis/treatment plan.\nAll problems of animal health, behavior or well-being shall be identified through daily observation and conveyed to\nthe attending veterinarian to allow for the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat\ndiseases and injuries. A veterinarian needs to examine the two animals identified for diagnosis and treatment if\nnecessary.
