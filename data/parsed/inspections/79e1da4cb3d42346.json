The old car inside the Jacob\u2019s sheep enclosure must be removed to prevent injury.\n3.131(d)                    REPEAT\nSANITATION.   \nPest Control\n*** Lemur enclosure (shelter): Rat holes were seen in the dirt area just in front of the lemur enclosure. A few holes\nlook as if they lead into the enclosure. Two (2) carrots and a bag with grapes in it are seen on the round just outside\nthe enclosure. Pests can be attracted to the food.\n*** Old muntjac (no longer housing an animal) shelter/enclosure: There is a food pan with leftover pellets in the\nenclosure, (No animal was being housed in the enclosure at the time of inspection.) The back wall of the enclosure\nhas a 4 inch hole that appears to have been chewed in the wood by rats. This enclosure is adjacent to the lemur\nenclosure and there is a shared wall on the left side of the lemur enclosure. Pests can be attracted to this area for\nfood.\n*** Rat holes are present around the Himalayan bear enclosure in the area of the den and the prairie dog enclosure.\n***Rat feces is present inside the Admission Booth that houses ferrets, guinea pigs, birds, and turtles.\nNo rats were seen at the time of inspection. However, there is evidence of their presence, i.e. active holes in the\nground around enclosures and rat feces seen in the Admission booth. Although traps have been used, more\neffective measures must be taken to reduce the population of rats. Additional measures to eliminate the attraction\nand harborage of pests must be implement to ensure an effective means of controlling the rodent population.\n3.132           CRITICAL\nEMPLOYEES.\n\n***There are currently 43 mammals and 25 non-regulated animals housed at the facility. Based upon the number\nanimals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal, maintenance, and veterinary care\nthere is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry responsibilities of the facility\non a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out the day to day husbandry\nduties and maintenance or the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to ensure that cleaning,\nanimal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at professionally acceptable level\nfor the current number of animals housed at the facility. Correct by September 30, 2016\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owners.\nThis is an electronic copy of the Microsoft Word inspection report dated 29-August 2016.",
