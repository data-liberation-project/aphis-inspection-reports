The inspector observed the dog constantly licking its teeth and gums. After about a minute, the\ninspector requested the licensee to remove the dog for a closer examination. Most of the dog's teeth are missing,\nbut among the remaining, are two upper canine teeth and one lower canine tooth. All three are partially covered with\na dark brown tarter and have a creamy grey discharge along the gum line. The teeth also felt loose to the touch.\nAfter the dog was returned to the enclosure, it continued to constantly lick its teeth and gums. A veterinarian has not\nevaluated the dog's condition. The dog's abnormal appearance and behavior can be an indication of mouth pain\ncaused by loose teeth and/or dental disease.\nThe licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan. Additionally, the licensee needs to consult the attending veterinarian to develop and follow a dental\nmaintenance plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon\nrequest. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: August 30, 2016\nExit briefing conducted with the licensee.\n*The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information\nmanagement system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was\ndeployed, the \u201cprepared by\u201d date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the\noriginal inspection report, which occurred on August 18, 2016."
