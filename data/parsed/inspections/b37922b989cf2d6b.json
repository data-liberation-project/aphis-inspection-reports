The water inside the receptacles appeared to be\ngreenish and difficult for the dogs to drink without getting the algae like matter. Water receptacles which are not\nproperly cleaned or sanitized can harbor disease-causing organisms. This could decrease the animals' acceptability\nof the water, as well as increase the risk of disease. The licensee must ensure that all food and water receptacles\nare sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris,\nfood waste and other disease hazards.\nTo be corrected by: June 1, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
