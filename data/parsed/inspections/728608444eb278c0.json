In one\noutdoor enclosure, one Great Dane was observed licking the snow and the other Great Dane was observed licking\nthe ice in the water receptacle. The facility representative was asked to provide the dogs with water and the dogs\ndrank enthusiastically for approximately 1 minute and 12 seconds. In another outdoor enclosure, two Great Danes\nand one Mastiff were licking the ice in the water receptacle and the facility representative provided them with water.\nAll three dogs drank enthusiastically and one dog drank for approximately 1 minute and 43 seconds. The facility\nrepresentative watered the dogs at 7:00 am that morning and will water them again later in the afternoon.\nThe extended amount of time that the dogs drank once water was provided indicates that the animals are extremely\nthirsty. Failure to provide the dogs with enough water to meet their needs could have a negative impact on their\nhealth and well-being.\nIf potable water is not continually available to the dogs, it must be offered to the dogs as often as necessary to\nensure their health and well-being, but not less than twice a day for at least one hour each time.\nAlthough the dogs are receiving water twice daily, the licensee must provide the dogs with enough water to meet\ntheir needs in order to support their health and well-being.\nCorrection date: The dogs were provided with water at the time of the inspection.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Autumn Unck, VMO, and the facility\nrepresentative."
