The heifers did not have access to water and were not able to comfortably rest during this unintended\nconfinement. This incident was not reported to supervisor until Monday, 5/15/2023, afternoon. Prolonged restraint in\nheadlocks can cause unnecessary discomfort and a lack of water can negatively affect animal health.
