The sow has been isolated in its own\npen for at least one week, however the veterinarian has not been contacted and no treatment or action has been\ntaken to address the obvious health issue. In the 'Grower' side of the finishing barn there is another 80lb female\nthat has an abscess approximately 8 inches in diameter, with a slightly purple color and tight in appearance located\non the underside of her left jaw, which was not observed until during the inspection. At this time the veterinarian\nhas not been contacted in regards to these two health issues, and no treatments have been given.\nAny health issue that is left untreated can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animals. The\nlack of response can cause a treatable condition to become chronic or fatal if left undiagnosed and treated for long\nperiods of time depending on the original condition.\nThe veterinarian must be contacted to properly diagnose and treat any condition that is required. The licensee must\nmake sure all conditions are treated according to the veterinarians directions and procedures at all facilities.\nTo be corrected by: November 26, 2014"
