      "narrative": "- In an outdoor enclosure there was a year old, male Boston Terrier named \"Brutus\" that had a moist looking,\nreddish 1/2''(cid:29) prolapsed growth of tissue protruding from the lower medial corner of the left eye and a 1/4'' red, moist\nprolapsed growth of tissue protruding from the lower medial corner of the right eye. This could be caused by\ninfection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee had noticed the\nred masses in each eye approximately four months ago and this animal had not yet been seen by a veterinarian for\nan evaluation. The animal's vision did not appear to be affected at the time of the inspection. This animal must be\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated. Documentation (health records)\nshould be available on all medical problems and made available to the inspector. The diagnosis and any\nrecommended treatment must be part of the documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 8/13/16."

The licensee stated that two separate air conditioners were installed in the spring and neither\none worked so the dogs had been without cool air inside the building all summer long. The ambient temperature\noutside was 97 degrees. The dogs did not appear to be overheated and had adequate shade and water. The doors\non each end of the building had been propped open creating a nice breeze inside the building. Allowing the\nambient temperature in a sheltered housing facility to exceed 85 degrees F for more than four hours at a time can\nresult in heat related stress and illness in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the ambient temperature must\nnot rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs are present in the building.\nTo be corrected by: 8/17/16."

There are 12 dogs drinking from the receptacles. The licensee stated that\nthey were cleaned every two weeks. Contaminated water is no longer considered to be safe for the dog to drink and\ncould lead to potential health risks. It indicates that a lack of cleaning and sanitation is occurring often enough to\nprevent the water from becoming contaminated. The licensee must ensure all water receptacles are cleaned and\nsanitized once every two weeks or more often if needed for the health and well-being of the dogs.\nTo be corrected by: 8/12/16.\nThe inspection and exit interview was conducted with Brittany Light, ACI and the facility representative."
