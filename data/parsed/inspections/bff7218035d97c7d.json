The straw in one shelter\nwas matted to about 1\" thick and there was matted feces inside the entrance of the shelter. There was not enough\nbedding material in the other shelter to cover the floor. The owner stated that he had placed fresh bedding material\nin the shelters 5 days before and that the dogs kicked it out. During the previous 5 days, temperatures at night have\nbeen less than 20F degrees and daytime temperatures have been less than 35F degrees. Lack of sufficient bedding\nin cold environments increases the risks of sickness and hypothermia situations. Sufficient clean dry bedding\nmaterial is necessary to provide protection when the temperature is less than 50F degrees. More bedding material\nis necessary when the temperature is less than 35F degrees for the dogs to burrow into and remain clean and dry\nand have better protection from the cold. The owner must provide more bedding for the dogs and maintain it at\nsufficient levels any time the temperature is less than 50F degrees and additional bedding must be added when the\ntemperature is less than 35F degrees.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: From this point forward.\nLicensee was verbally instructed to provide more bedding before the end of the day.\nExit interview done with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPlumlee Konnie, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
