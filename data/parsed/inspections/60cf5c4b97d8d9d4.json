Per a facility representative, the\nstudy member that conducted the procedure lacked experience in placing central venous catheters in rabbits under\nanesthesia. One of the necropsy reports supports the poor placement of the catheter because the heart was punctured.\nThe second rabbit, per the facility representative, most likely also died from poor placement of the central venous catheter\nbased on blood loss seen during the attempt and necropsy findings. Post-incident, the facility representative questioned\nthe study member on their experience with rabbit central venous catheter placements. It was revealed, even though the\nstudy member had experience placing central lines in other animal species, they had never done so in rabbits before.\n\u2022 Because the individual placing the central venous lines lacked experience in placing them in this study\u2019s species of\ninterest, rabbits, avoidable deaths occurred.

Even though CPR was performed, she had difficulty recuperating and died shortly thereafter.
