The combination of berm and tree trunk has reduced the effective height of the fence to less than\n8 ft in specific locations. Fences must be greater than 8 ft high to act as secondary containment system for\npotentially dangerous animals in the facility.\nThe fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized\npersons from going through it, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the\nfacility.\nCorrection Date: 10 December 2015\nInspection conducted by Jeanne Lorang, ACI and Dr. Katharine Frank, VMO\nExit interview conducted with facility personnel.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLorang Jeanne, Animal Care Inspector"
