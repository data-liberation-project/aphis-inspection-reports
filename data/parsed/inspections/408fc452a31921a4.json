The fence\nclosest to the entrance gate as well as the furthest one denoting the enclosures\u2019 end, were shortened and leaning under\nthe weight of the tree limbs.\n- The wooden door into the second muntjac enclosure was leaning into the animal\u2019s space. The base of the wooden poles\nmaking up the door frame had a brown/dark green color and appeared to be rotting with some fraying/gaps in the wood.\nAreas in disrepair such as these may affect structural integrity thus diminishing the enclosures\u2019 ability to safely contain the\nanimals.\nThe facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. Housing\nfacilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to safely\ncontain them. Correct by October 13, 2025."
