The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel\npoles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest\nupon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep\nroots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is\napproximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. There is now an 8 foot high tensile wire barrier fence approximately\n20 feet from the front of the enclosure.\nThe enclosure currently houses a -4 year old male lion and a \u2013 3 year old female lion with limited mobility. The\nenclosure is only 12 feet in height. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure\ncontainment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats,\nmodifications to the enclosure to increase the height must be made to prevent escape.\nNOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were made.\n*** The following additional structural strength items were noted during this inspection:\nPrimary enclosure fencing in several areas of the llama and deer fallow enclosures had large gaps at the base of\nthe fencing which could allow entry of unwanted animals. These gaps tended to occur at areas of water drainage\nwhere the ground had washed away.\nThe primary fencing of the fallow deer enclosure (across from the camel enclosure) is bowed and bent at the top of\nthe fence. This damage to the fence could potentially lead to further collapse thus not keeping the fallow deer\nsecure in their enclosure.\nAll primary animal enclosures shall be structurally sound, maintained in good repair and constructed in a manner to\nprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals."
