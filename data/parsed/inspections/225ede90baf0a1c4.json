      "narrative": "During the spring sale dates of March 23-25, 2023 , the auction accepted several animals for sale from un-licensed\nindividuals who were required to be licensed but currently do not hold a license. These included:\n* A consignor sold a skunk lot # 10390 and did not have a USDA license number. The skunk was sold to a licensed\nexhibitor 35-C-0399. Additionally, this same consignor sold a Patagonian cavy lot #5594 consigned on 9-15-2022. The\nlicensee was previously cited on 10-21-22 for knowingly purchasing from this consignor who requires a license.\n* A consignor sold two raccoons (lot # 9828 and 9829); three bobcats (lot # 9830, 9831 and 9832) and three skunks (lot #\n9833, 9834 and 9835). The consignment form did not contain a USDA license number. It was determined that several of\nthese animals were sold to current licensed facilities for exhibition purposes and that the individual should have been\nrequired to have a one-time exemption or an active license. The bobcat # 09830 was sold to a licensed exhibitor 23-C-\n0019, and raccoon lot # 9829 was sold to a licensed broker 31-B-0221.\n* A consignor sold a camel lot # 1316 and did not have a USDA license number or a onetime exemption. The camel was\nsold to a licensed exhibitor 55-C-0138. Due to the species and sale, this consignor should have had a license or one time\nexemption to sell the animal through the auction.\n* A consignor sold a camel lot # 1313 and did not have a USDA license number or a onetime exemption. The camel was\nsold to a licensed exhibitor 55-B-0225. Due to the species and sale, this consignor should have had a license or one time\nexemption to sell the animal through the auction.\n* A consignor sold a camel lot # 1314 and did not have a USDA license number or a onetime exemption. The camel was\nsold to a licensed exhibitor 55-B-0225. Due to the species and sale, this consignor should have had a license or one time\nexemption to sell the animal through the auction.\n* A consignor sold one Ringtail Lemur lot #11990. The consignor provided a seller name and USDA license number (31-\nA-0031) but then requested that the check be made out to a different name and sent to a different mailing address which\nis not associated with the license holder. Additionally, the actual license holder had already consigned animals including\nlot # 11893-11895 earlier the same day and requested that the payment be made to their name. The license holder of 31-\nA-0031 can not buy and re-sell animals with their current A-license, therefore, they cannot consign animals belonging to\nanother individual. Given that the Lemur consignor requested the payment be sent to their name rather than the license\nholder, it was clear that they were not in fact consigning the animal on behalf of licensee 31-A-0031 and that the\nconsignor was unlicensed.\nNo dealer shall knowingly obtain any animal from any person who is required to be licensed but who does not hold a\ncurrent, valid license or has not received a onetime exemption from USDA to sell the animals. Failure to ensure that\nconsignors of animals which are required to be licensed have a valid license prevents APHIS from ensuring the well-being\nof those animals at their originating facility. Correct by ensuring that animals are only obtained from sources that hold a\ncurrent, valid, and unsuspended licensed or from individuals that are exempted from licensure under the AWA.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nMark Sanderbeck, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOR n"
