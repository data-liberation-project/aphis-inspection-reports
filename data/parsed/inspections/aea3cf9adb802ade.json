Upon closer examination, the dog's waist was extremely tucked and the ribs,\nspine and hip bones were very prominent. The gums of the dog were noted to be white with no capillary refill time\nwhen pressed. At that time, I stopped the inspection and requested that the dog be taken to a licensed veterinarian\nfor examination immediately. An extremely thin body condition, if left untreated, can adversely affect the health and\nwell-being of the dog. Additionally, the dog may not be able to handle weather extremes due to her condition. Lastly,\nthe white gums may signify a serious medical condition.\n*The dog was not currently undergoing treatment for the condition.\n* The dog has constant and unfettered access to two self feeders that were full of dog food.\n*The licensee took the dog a licensed veterinarian immediately for an examination.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Licensee.\n*This was not a full and complete inspection due to a veterinary care issue noted at the beginning of the inspection."
