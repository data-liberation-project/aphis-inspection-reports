The caretaker stated that she has already called the\nveterinarian and expects the vet this afternoon. During the rest of the inspection of the inspection three more\nanimals were noted in need of veterinary care. The facility representative with inspectors was unaware of these\nissues and no records were available for review. One brown and white llama was noticed with its mouth open at all\ntimes. Saliva was drooling from its mouth. A thin piece of a light brown material such as a thick piece of straw or\nvery thing branch appeared to be protruding from the tongue. A female elk had a raised red area about 4inx5in on\nher left lower side. A female black and white goat with a newborn kid has an abnormal bowed out appearance to her\nfront legs along with thickened, curved abnormal hooves. She walks with a stiff, short stepping gait. The veterinarian\nneeds to evaluate these four animals to ensure a diagnosis and treatment plan is instituted. Correct by Dec. 14,\n2016."
