Fecal material was observed matted in\nthe fur under the dog's tail. A white female Poodle (#0A01693137) also had mats present throughout its haircoat,\ninlcuding along the chest, back legs and face. Some of these mats were also thick and closely adhered to the skin.\nMatting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure these dogs are\ngroomed and must establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs. The licensee must ensure that all\nanimals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n*Note - The male Poodle (#051*832*613) and the male Maltese (109*838*262) which were previously identified with\nveterinary care concerns during the inspection conducted on October 1, 2014 have been addressed."
