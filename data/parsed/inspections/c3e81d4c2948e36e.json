A minimum of ten feet of concrete block was broken and has been removed. Several of the decorative\nmetal rail sections of the fence were broken or bent in this area as well. A welded wire panel has been temporarily\nplaced in the perimeter fence gap. At the time of the inspection, it was also noted that there was a minimum of four\nfence posts to the north of this damaged section of perimeter fence that were extremely rusted. In the area where\nthese four decorative metal fence posts attach to the concrete block, much of the metal was rusted away entirely.\nA second 30 foot section of the zoo perimeter fence near the public parking lot has been damaged by vehicular\nimpact since the July 2016 inspection. A minimum of ten feet of concrete block was broken and removed. Several\nof the decorative metal rail sections of the fence were broken or bent in this area as well. A welded wire panel has\nbeen temporarily placed in the perimeter fence gap.\nThe structural integrity of this section of the zoo perimeter fence along White Sands Boulevard has been\ncompromised to the point where it can no longer function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the\nzoo. The perimeter fence must be constructed and maintained so that it protects animals in the facility.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives."
