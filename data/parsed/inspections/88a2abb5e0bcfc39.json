Six of the deer were run to death while two deer jumped the fence knocking it down in the\nprocess of escaping. Law enforcement was able to catch one dog while one escaped. The security on the premises\nsupposedly checked the enclosure every hour. The primary enclosure fencing was recently reinforced and there\nwere no possible deficiencies that could explain the way in which the dogs were able to get in the enclosure.\nHowever there was a storm drain that could have possibly given them access to the deer. Also there were some\nnoticeable paw tracks in the area of the outside drain. The drain is large enough that a medium-sized animal could\ngain access. The weak access point had been addressed pertaining to a previous incident involving a breach in the\nenclosure. It was stated that covering the drain to allow only water in could be sufficient in keeping predators out.\nThe outdoor enclosure should be constructed to keep animals from getting in and possibly injuring the deer. The\nfacility currently doesn't have anymore white-tailed deer in that enclosure. One deer has been seen on the premises\nbut they have not been successful in catching/containing him. Covers have been placed over the drain on both ends\nas a corrective action.\nThis was a focused inspection of the white-tailed deer exhibit.\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the curator."
