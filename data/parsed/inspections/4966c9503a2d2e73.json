During this inspection, the dog would repeatedly pull away while attempting to look inside of the\ndog's mouth. However, it could be observed that the dog's teeth still had a large accumulation of yellow to dark\ntan/brown to black build up covering the majority of the teeth. The build up appeared heavier on both sides of the\nback teeth. The dog's gums were reddened and had receded along some of the teeth as well. According to the\nlicensee, the dog had been taken to a veterinarian for an examination. After speaking with the veterinarian, a\nrecommendation of a dental cleaning for the dog had been made to the licensee to be performed as soon as\npossible. According to the licensee and the veterinarian, there had been no arrangements to schedule a dental\ncleaning at the time of inspection, approximately two months after the dog's veterinary examination.The dog was\ncurrently not receiving any treatment. The lack of treatment for this dog's dental condition can increase the risk that\nthe condition will continue or worsen. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum\ntissue and tooth structures. This condition could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and\nnegatively impact the overall health of the animal. The licensee must ensure that the veterinarian's treatment\nrecommendations for the dog's dental condition are followed for the health of the dog. The licensee must ensure\nthat all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."

There were no other sources of water provided inside of the enclosure. During the inspection\naround 1:45 pm, the inspectors asked a facility representative to fill the receptacle with water. After the bowl was\nplaced inside of the enclosure for the dam and her puppies, the dam was observed to immediately start drinking\nfrom the bowl continuously for over 1 \u00bd minutes. The puppies also started drinking from the water bowl consistently\na few seconds after the dam started drinking. A small amount of water remained on the bottom of the receptacle\nafter the dogs stopped drinking. When asked about the last time the dogs had been given water, the licensee stated\nthat they had all been given water yesterday evening. The absence of water can cause dehydration and can lead to\nserious illness in the animals. The licensee must ensure all animals have access to water as often as necessary to\nensure their health and well-being. A facility representative corrected this non-compliance during the inspection."
