Thermal support for the animal was needed during the post-operative recovery period but the heating\nblanket normally used was not working properly and an alternate method was used to provide thermal support\nunder the direction of the attending veterinarian. The marmoset subsequently sustained thermal injuries that were\nrecognized by veterinary personnel during the immediate post-operative recovery period. The animal was\nimmediately examined by the attending veterinarian and treatment was instituted. The marmoset's condition\ndeteriorated despite the treatment prescribed and the animal died 72 hours later.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible\nin a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThe use of the alternate method to provide thermal support to the marmoset during post-operative recovery induced\nthermal injuries that resulted in the death of the marmoset.\nUpon being notified and in response to this incident, the research facility acted promptly and conducted an\ninvestigation, reported the incident to OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implemented appropriate corrective actions to\nprevent any future incidents. Additional surgical procedures have taken place since the corrective measures were\nimplemented, and no additional incidents have occurred.\nThe research facility has taken appropriate steps to address this item and it has been corrected."
