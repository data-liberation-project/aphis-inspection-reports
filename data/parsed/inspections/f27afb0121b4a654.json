      "narrative": "A study procedure on an IACUC approved protocol involves the use of specialized equipment on anesthetized rabbits in a\ndarkroom. To conduct the procedure, an animal is placed on a platform and the device hood (which weighs approximately\n5lb) is lowered to cover the animal's head. When the hood is lowered, there is a gap between the device hood and the\nplatform through which the animal's neck and body extends. The specialized equipment, including the hood, is used to\nconduct studies on both rodents and rabbits. When in the fully closed position, the gap between the platform and the hood\nis approximately 1.5-2\". The manufacturer of the equipment sells a device that adjusts the resting height of the hood to\nincrease the gap by several inches to accommodate the larger body size of rabbits.\nWhen this procedure was conducted on a cohort of 18 rabbits on July 13th, 2021, the equipment was not configured to\naccommodate rabbits. 3 rabbits died acutely and in sequence while being handled in the device. After these adverse\nevents, the investigator continued the study on the remainder of the cohort.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort.\nThe research facility voluntarily reported this incident on discovery and had instituted corrective measures at the time of\nthis inspection, including the purchase and implementation of the device to adjust the equipment for rabbit use. To remain\ncorrected from May 2nd, 2022.\nThis is a continuation of the report for the focused inspection conducted April 27-28, 2022 and contains the remaining\nnon-compliances found during the inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted with the Vivarium Manager and IACUC Chair on April 27-28, 2022.
