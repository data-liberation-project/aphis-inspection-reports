The following\ndeer were observed to have visual signs of suspected illness:\n-Geriatric doe (~21 years old) with yellow ear tag \"151\" had large patches of hair loss over her entire body and legs. Some\nof the hair appeared to be slowly growing back in, whereas other small areas of hair loss had pink, irritated skin\nunderneath. She was very friendly at the fence line but was away from the rest of the herd, appeared uncomfortable with\nincreased respiratory rate and effort, and was seen intermittently open-mouthed breathing, especially after or during\nmovement across the enclosure.\n-Older buck: intermittent open-mouthed breathing with hunched posture while walking, head and neck extended, and\nincreased respiratory rate.\n-Adult buck: Area of hair loss and bare skin on the inside middle of the right rear leg.\n-Adult doe: Increased respiratory rate and intermittent open-mouthed breathing.\n-Yearling doe: thin, poor hair coat, increased respiratory rate and effort.\n-Yearling buck (lighter color)- thin body condition, walking slowly with extended head and neck and intermittent open-\nmouthed breathing.\nThe affected animals showed more signs of illness when stressed or caused to run across the enclosure and appeared\nmore normal once calm and relaxed. Daily observation of all animals on premises shall be made to assess their health\nand well-being and promptly identify injuries, disease, and other medical conditions. Untreated injuries, infections, and\nother conditions can be painful and cause suffering to the animals. Frequent communications with the attending\nveterinarian are required to allow for the veterinarian to advise licensees on needed treatments for health concerns, which\nhelps to mitigate the effects of adverse health conditions. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required\nso that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian.
