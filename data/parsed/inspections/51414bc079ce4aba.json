The principal investigator describes many\nbasic training protocols, but it is unclear as to which of these will be used on the regulated species. Sedation (and\nthe use of isofluorane) is briefly mentioned, but there is no description as to when these would be used, nor how\nthey would be administered or how the animals wil be monitored during induction and recovery. The protocol also\nstates that following immunization, animals will be monitored for adverse reactions, but no detail is given to how\noften or how many days monitoring will occur, or how the monitoring will be recorded. It is also unclear what the\ndosing schedule is for the animals; one part of the protocol discusses delivering 1.5 mls SC twice weekly, then it\nlater discusses giving 3 mls one time followed by boosting on a weekly basis. There is no discussion of needle\ngauge for the immunization or for the blood drawing. As this is a teaching protocol, and the students will be learning\nhow to draw blood, there should be information provided by the principal investigator as to how many attempts a\nstudent is allowed to draw blood. A complete description of the proposed procedures is necessary for the IACUC to\ndetermine that all the animals are being used in a humane manner. Failure to include such descriptions may result\nin misunderstanding between the IACUC and the principal investigator and could result in misuse of the animals.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the IACUC Chair."
