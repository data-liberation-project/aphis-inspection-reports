The facility\norganizes a monthly online auction business-per the applicant, acting as a broker by running an auction sale that includes\nexotic hoof stock animals including Scottish highlanders, yak, water buffalo and zebu. During the inspection, the inspector\nmade a fourth request to inspect the records of the past zebu and Scottish highlanders that were discussed the previous\ninspection on March 25, 2024 and May 15, 2024. This request to inspect records included those pertaining to: - Nine zebu\nthat were bought at an auction in MO on April 6, 2023 - Two miniature Highland cattle on February 2, 2024, for which\nAPHIS Officials received a copy of a certificate of veterinary inspection (CVI) from the Minnesota Board of Animal Health -\nTwo Highland Cattle received on March 5, 2024, from a facility in MN. Additionally, APHIS Officials requested to inspect\ninformation concerning the sale of at least one Yak sold through the auction from April 25, 2024 State Officials provided\nAPHIS with certificates of veterinary inspection concerning the Yak (CVI 4-8-2024-MN) and Highland Cattle (CVI 2-2-24\nand 3-5-24-MN), including two more Yak (CVI 5-10-2024 from WI) from the May auction, demonstrating that\ndocumentation was created.\nDuring the inspection, the applicant admitted they do maintain individual files on their cattle, zebu, highlanders and other\nhoof stock. When Officials requested to review the records, the applicant refused, stating that the USDA was over\nreaching and did not have a right to look at the records if they tell officials all of the hoof stock sold is only for food and\nfiber. It was explained multiple times that there needs to be records of all acquisitions and dispositions of animals and the\nability for inspectors to determine if the animals are being used for food/fiber or for regulated activity. This information can\nonly be determined by having access to the records of acquisiton and disposition for traceability.\nThe applicant was reminded about requirements to furnish information APHIS Officials request in connection with the\nenforcement of the provisions of the Act and was informed that continued refusal would result in the documentation of a\nnoncompliance with this section. The applicant continued to refuse access to these records.\nRefusal to furnish information relating to the business such as these auction records prevents the traceability of exotic\nanimals acquired by the facility and sold to the public.\nEach dealer, exhibitor, operator of an auction sale, intermediate handler, and carrier shall furnish to any APHIS official\nany information concerning the business of the dealer, exhibitor, operator of an auction sale, intermediate handler or\ncarrier which the APHIS official may request in connection with the enforcement of the provisions of the Act, the\nregulations and the standards in this subchapter.\nThis is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class \u201cC\u201d license.
