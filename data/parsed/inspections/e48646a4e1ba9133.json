The dog had\nhard lumps on both sides of his face halfway between the corner of the dog(cid:25)s mouth and below his eyes. Upon\nexamination of the dog(cid:25)'s mouth, the upper molars were completely encased in a hard grayish-white material that\nwas about the size of a marble, which were causing the lumps that are apparent from the outside. The gum line\nabove all the upper teeth was reddened. The front teeth have a grayish-brown hard material that is adhered to at\nleast 90% of the surface of each tooth. There was a creamy white discharge at the gum line of the upper incisors.\nThe upper canines have a grayish-brown hard material adhered to at least 75% of the surface.\n***An adult female blue and gold Yorkshire Terrier, identification number 0A01600159, had dental problems. The\nupper teeth had a buildup of yellowish-gray hard material adhering to the teeth. The gum line was reddened and\nthere was a whitish creamy discharge above all the upper teeth.\nDental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, lead to the development of other health problems, and can\naffect the well-being of the animal.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m. on September 17, 2014, to obtain\naccurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation\nmust be provided to the inspector upon request.
