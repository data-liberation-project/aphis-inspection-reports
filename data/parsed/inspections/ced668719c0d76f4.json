Evaluation of the goats\nshowed at least three that require hoof care and veterinary treatment. One predominantly grey black goat has an\nelongated, thickened claw on its left rear hoof. This goat spent most of its time lying down and when it did stand and\nwalk, it was noted that the affected hoof was placed on the ground in an abnormal position to avoid pressure on the\nlong claw. In addition, it was noted spending excessive time licking at its hooves. One predominantly white goat was\nnoted with a long, curved claw on its right rear hoof. The long claw curved upwards toward the sky when the goat\nwas standing. One white and brown goat was noted lying down most of the time and the left front foot appeared\nswollen/enlarged over the top surface just above and between the claws. The interdigital area and area just above\nthe claws was filled with a black crusty material. The skin of this area appeared involved as well. Trimming of\nhooves must be done as often as necessary to prevent abnormal growth, discomfort, lameness and infection.\nAbnormalities such as swelling, discharge and lameness require the animal to be evaluated by a veterinarian for\ndiagnosis and treatment. These three goats shall be evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment and all\ngoats shall be supplied with routine preventative hoof care."
