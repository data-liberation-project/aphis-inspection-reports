Approximately 2 to 3 days beforehand, the keeper noticed the left eye was tearing up and the lower\neyelid had swollen up noticeably. The keeper commented that perhaps Cesar had gotten dirt in his eye. It was decided by\nfacility staff to monitor the progression and possibly flush the eye with a hose if the condition did not improve. On the day\nof inspection, the globe appeared sunken, and the iris and pupil could not be visualized. At this time, the attending\nveterinarian had yet to be contacted concerning Cesar\u2019s eye. Furthermore, Cesar has a history of arthritis. He appeared\nhunched over and moved stiffly when approached by one of the facility managers. Currently, he is receiving supplements\nfor his joints but not any pain medication.\nThe facility must maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,\ndiagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
