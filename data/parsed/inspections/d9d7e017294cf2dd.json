      "narrative": "Within the sheltered housing facility, the inspector recorded an air temperature of approximately 41.1 degrees\nFahrenheit using the Kestrel device next to an enclosure containing an adult female Rottweiler (ID \"Y3\") and 4\npuppies that are approximately 4 weeks old. The puppies are huddled together in the corner of the enclosure that is\npart of the exterior wall of the facility. There is one puppy that is lying next to the wall in the back of the enclosure\nthat is shivering slightly and hunched over. Within the sheltered facility there is ice forming on an enclosure\ncontaining 2 adult dogs. The ice is present on the wire portion of the enclosure below the nozzle of the automatic\nwatering system. The licensee stated that the floor of the building was icy due to washing the floor recently and it\nnot being insulated from the freezing temperatures. There is a heater mounted in the central area of the facility but\nthe licensee stated it had not been connected to a gas line yet. There is a smaller heater located on the east end of\nthe facility that is providing adequate heat for a specific enclosure, however, it is not enough to provide sufficient\nheat for the rest of the facility. There are 19 adults and 4 puppies in the affected area. According to the National\nWeather Service the outdoor temperature was approximately 16 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill of -2 degrees\nduring the inspection at the facility (approximately 10:30 am). Information provided by the National Weather Service\nstates the temperature has not been over 30 degrees Fahrenheit within the last 24 hours. Low temperatures make it\ndifficult for animals to control their body temperature and could lead to other health issues, especially in young\nanimals. The sheltered part of the housing facility must be sufficiently heated to protect the dogs from temperature\nextremes. The ambient temperature in sheltered housing facilities must not fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit for\nmore than 4 consecutive hours.\nTo be corrected by: November 17, 2014 by 5:00 PM.\nExit interview conducted with licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
