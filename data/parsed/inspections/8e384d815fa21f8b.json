The gap represents an area through which an adult lion potentially could extend a forelimb\nand reach a person walking next to the enclosure. Enclosures must be maintained to protect the animals from\ninjury and contain the animals.\nCorrect by: August 30\nA goat kid was observed to put its head through a gap in the enclosure gate fence, and was unable to withdraw the\nhead due to the angle of its growing horns. The facility representative removed the animal from the gate, and\nplaced a temporary barrier of a rock to avoid repeated occurrence. Should the animal become stuck overnight, it\nwould not be able to access food, water, or shelter, and could be subject to bulling from other animals, resulting in\npain or distress. Enclosures must be maintained to protect the animals from injury and contain them.\nCorrect by: August 30\nThe fence between two tiger enclosures had a thin dead tree leaning against the top, and a section approximately 3\nfeet in width by 2 feet in depth was slightly compressed. Tigers not co-housed and of unknown compatibility may\nexhibit athletic territorial or dominance behaviors that can weaken the structural integrity of fencing separating them,\nand unplanned comingling could result in injury to animals. The second tiger enclosure had small branches growing\nthrough the enclosure wall near a section of fence at the top of a wall next to the pond that was attached to two\nconsecutive vertical fence posts by one wire encircling each one, with a loose top rail. Branches growing through\nfences may eventually weaken the strength of the fence. Similarly, the strength and agility of adult tigers may be\nsufficient to overcome the strength of this section of fence, resulting in lack of containment. Enclosures must be\nmaintained to protect animals from injury and contain them.\nCorrection date: September 14."
