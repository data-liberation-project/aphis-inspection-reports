She was seen by the veterinarian in October of 2020 for her skin issues, they\nbelieved her to be pregnant so only treated her with Bravecto for four months and then nothing since. She has two sores,\none on each of her front legs on the outside of each on the lower joint. Both sores appear pink in color and wet in\nappearance and are approximately the size of a dime. Her tail is almost completely hairless and is also pink with areas\nthat are slightly darker in color. Both ears near where they connect to her head are missing hair but the right ear is worse.\nSnowball has poor dental health. The surface of the upper right canine tooth is almost completely covered in dark brown\nmaterial. The check teeth in the upper right are completely covered as well as having a grey material along the gum line.\nHer upper left front teeth and canine are almost completely covered in dark brown material. The upper cheek teeth are\ncompletely covered in the dark brown material with a whitish grey material between two teeth. The gum on the left upper\nside is reddened and receding away from the teeth.\nSkin conditions could lead to pain and discomfort and can lead to other issues. Teeth issues that are not properly taken\ncare of can lead to pain, stress, illness and other disease. Each licensee must follow an appropriate program of veterinary\ncare for dogs that includes preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy skin and teeth. This dog must be evaluated\nby a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan.\nTo Be correct by: 5-11-2021"
