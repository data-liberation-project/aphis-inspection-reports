An\namputation of the front left leg was performed. During this inspection it was observed that Lightfoot\u2019s surgery has\nhealed well and Lightfoot\u2019s mobility was good.\nThe enclosure for the fox led to a serious injury in the animal. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and in\ngood repair to protect the animals from injury. A routine review of the enclosure must occur to identify potential\nareas of injury and measures taken to correct these.\nCorrect from this day forward."
