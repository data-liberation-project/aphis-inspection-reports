This happened after daily\ncleaning by an experienced handler when the licesnee was not at the facility. Upon the licesnee's return he found\nthe guillotine door to the enclosure to be partially open and off of its track. Great efforts were made by the licensee\nto locate and return the animal. The cat was found deceased three days after escape. The USDA was notified of\nboth the escape and death of this animal when it occurred. This is an isolated event and has not occurred since.\nHousing facilities, including doors and locking mechanisms, must be structurally sound and maintained in good\nrepair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nThe enclosure does not currently house any animals. This item has been corrected.\n**Several of the wooden boards in the bobcat enclosure are moderately splintered from the cat sharpening his\nclaws against the board. The animal's diet is also fed on these boards.\nSplinters from the wood could potentially injure the animal if he were to step or rest on the surface. Splintered wood\nis also not easily sanitizable. As the diet is fed on this surface, pathogens from feed could potentially also transfer to\nthe wood and cause illness in the animal.\nSurfaces of the enclosure must be replaced or maintained in good repair to protect the animal from illness and\ninjury.\nCorrect by 10/21/2015\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Licensee."
