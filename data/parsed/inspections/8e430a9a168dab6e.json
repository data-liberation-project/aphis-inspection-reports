      "narrative": "***An adult male coatimundi, Cody, was observed to be limping on his right rear leg. This animal was non-weight\nbearing during the inspection on February 20, 2018 and was cited for this problem on the inspection report. This\nanimal still has not been evaluated or treated by a veterinarian. Lameness can be caused by a variety of problems\nincluding infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the health and\nwell-being of the animal.\n***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, still has hair loss with red and inflamed skin on the knuckles of all four feet.\nThis animal was cited for this problem on the inspection report dated February 20, 2018. Since the last inspection\nthe alopecia and skin appears to not be improving. A facility representative stated that he had noticed the animal\u2019s\ncondition not improving and continues to itch at his feet. The fox also had excessively long nails that needed to be\ntrimmed.\n***An intact adult male tricolor goat, Thor, that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS\ninspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing on this limb. The\nmost recent veterinary exam occurred on May 27, 2017. The attending veterinarian recommended in his\ndocumentation that 1) more diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2)\nif the facility representatives do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the\nanimal. Currently, this animal is off exhibit but still has not received proper veterinary care for the further diagnostic\nworkup and treatment of his lameness. To date, the licensee has not followed the veterinary recommendations.\nThis goat was seen by the attending veterinarian on April 13, 2018 and was euthanized.\n***One brown and black, adult, female sheep, Goldberry, was observed to be excessively thin, with protruding hip\nbones, spine, and ribs on February 6, 2018 and was cited for this problem on the inspection report. Since the last\ninspection, it appears that her condition is not improving with the change of diet that was recommended by the\nattending veterinarian. The bones of her spine, hips, and each rib were easily seen by both APHIS inspectors. She\nhad a rough, unthrifty hair coat with multiple patches of hair loss along her back and right and left sides. Also, she\nnow has some lameness seen in her right front forelimb. Poor body condition can be an indication of health issues,\nincluding parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, and systemic disease. Lameness can be caused by a variety of\nproblems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the\nhealth and well-being of the animal.\nThis sheep was seen by the attending veterinarian on April 13, 2018 and was euthanized.\n***One black and white baby sheep, which was approximately 2 months old, was having trouble walking and\nstanding. The facility representative claims the baby sheep was stepped on by the adult sheep when he went into\nthe enclosure at the time of inspection. The sheep was removed from the enclosure and placed into a private\nenclosure in the barn. The sheep was circling, stumbling, and had trouble getting up and standing. It was advised by\nthe APHIS inspectors to have this sheep seen by a veterinarian and evaluated that day.\nThis sheep was brought to the attending veterinarian on April 10, 2018 by the facility representative and the animal\nwas euthanized that day due to having suffered a possible spinal injury.\n***The facility representative is using two antibiotics Liquamycin LA-200 and Penicillin off-label and without\nconsulting the attending veterinarian before use. A licensee cannot treat any animal without consulting their\nattending veterinarian first to get the proper medication, dosage, and treatment plan for the animal. Using drugs that\nare not first approved by the attending veterinarian can yield unanticipated reactions when used off labeled and at\nan incorrect dose.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals\nat the facility. The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plans for the problems cited above. From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all\nanimals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the\nprogram of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries."

This animal was seen by the attending veterinarian about 7 days\nago and was given Terramycin to treat an eye infection. The facility representative claims the mass above the eye\nwas not present during the attending veterinarian's evaluation and he believes the condition is getting worse.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and\nthe increase risk of development of serious medical conditions.
