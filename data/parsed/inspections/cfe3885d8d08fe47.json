The superintendent\nreported it had been about three weeks since the area was cleaned. Additionally, the superintendent also stated\nthat the animals are sometimes restricted to the pen during inclement weather, but the area of clean space in the\npen is not large enough to hold all 180 goats. This means some animal would be forced to stand or lay in feces. The\npen must be cleaned and maintained on a more frequent basis to ensure the animals can remain clean and to\nreduce disease hazards. Multiple parasitic diseases are more easily spread through unsanitary conditions.\nFurthermore, accumulation of feces in the environment promotes bacterial and fungal growth in the foot. The\nlicensee must ensure that all excreta is removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent\ncontamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors. Correct by ensuring that all animals\nareas are cleaned as often as necessary. Correct by 2/14/2015.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Superintendent.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMchenry Kerry, Veterinary Medical Officer"
