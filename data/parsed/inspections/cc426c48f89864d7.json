The base of the horn had a wound approximately 1 inch long and insects were observed landing on the wound.\nThere was dark discharge around the edges of the wound and on the fur below the left eye. The animal appeared to be\nbright and alert and was in normal body condition. The eland arrived at the auction on 02/02/22. The attending\nveterinarian stated that she was not aware of this animal\u2019s injury, but when shown pictures of the injury she believed the\nanimal did not need to be treated right away. The consignor of the animal stated that this injury was old and had\npreviously been treated.\nInjuries including broken horns may cause pain or discomfort, and may become infected or infested with pests. Daily\nobservation of animals is important for identifying injuries, illness, or problems. Direct and frequent communication with\nthe attending veterinarian regarding new or ongoing issues is important so that the veterinarian can assess the animal\nand decide of care is required.\nCorrect by 2/4/22 by ensuring that daily observation is completed for all regulated animals, and that issues are\ncommunicated to the attending veterinarian promptly so that animals can receive assessment and care."
