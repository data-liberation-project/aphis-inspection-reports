The guidelines allow for carbon dioxide\neuthanasia of laboratory rodents (which include guinea pigs) when the flow of carbon dioxide provides a\ndisplacement rate of 10-30% of chamber volume/min. This is best achieved by the use of flow meter to ensure an\naccurate flow rate of carbon dioxide gas is being delivered to the chamber at the recommended displacement rate\n(10-30% chamber volume/min).\nThe method currently employed by the facility lacks a flow meter and method for accurately determining the\nchamber displacement rate. The output dial in current use by the facility utilizes regulator pressure readings (psi)\nwhich do not provide accurate flow rates for carbon dioxide into the chamber.\nCarbon dioxide exposure using a gradual fill method with chamber displacement rates from 10-30% is less likely to\nproduce pain and distress prior to onset of unconsciousness than higher or lower rates. Methods of euthanasia\nused must be in accordance with AVMA species guidelines and in accordance with 9 CFR part 1, unless a deviation\nhas been previously justified in writing and approved by the IACUC.\nA flow meter must be installed, SOPs updated with required flow meter settings, and retraining of employees who\nperform euthanasia shall be documented.\nCorrect by 05-15-2017"
