The amendment that was approved does not describe this process or which animals would receive\nthe dexamethasone. The designated member that approved this amendment believed that dexamethasone was being\nadded for every vole undergoing the procedure. Additionally, the route of administration for the dexamethasone in the\nprotocol does not match the standard operating procedure (SOP) that the lab uses for post-operative care. This SOP is\nnot mentioned in the protocol.\nA complete description of the use of the animals is necessary in a protocol to ensure that all research staff and IACUC\nmembers are aware of the details regarding the study activities being conducted on the animals and the parameters in\nplace to assure the health and comfort of the animals. In addition, the IACUC members need a complete description to\nunderstand the proposed use of the animals in order to approve the protocol and to assure compliance with regulatory\nrequirements.
