He stated during this inspection that he noticed the dog had a wound on its right hind leg and her left eye\nwas swollen shut. The licenee did not contact the attending veterinarian but did begin administering injectable\npenicillin to the dog once per day. He stated that the dog was initially \"pretty down\" but was able to eat and drink.\nToday the dog's left eye is opaque with redness in the globe. There is also a dark 1 mm circle at 6 o'clock on the\ncornea which appears to be a puncture would that has begun to heal. The licensee is not providing any treatment\nto the dog's eye other than injectable penicillin. This dog also has a 4 cm circular open wound on the right thigh\narea immediately behind its right knee. This wound is open, but is clean and has no active drainage.\n*** This dog requires veterinary attention and must be examined by a licensed veterinarian to determine appropriate\ntreatment for this dog. Even though the current PVC for this facility does address common eye and skin problems\nand treatment for these conditions, it does mention traumatic events such as a dog fight. Failure to provide\nappropriate, prompt treatment recommended by a licensed veterinarian for this dog can result in un-needed pain\nand suffering in the animal. Documentation of diagnosis, treatment, and plan must be maintained for examination\nby APHIS officials.\nCorrect by having this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by 5/15/14."
