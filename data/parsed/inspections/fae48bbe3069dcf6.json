The attending veterinarian was immediately notified and the animal was appropriately treated.\nDocumentation indicates the wound was assessed one week later and noted to be healing well.\nDuring today's inspection the area of the old wound appeared to be inflamed and obviously pink. Facility personnel\nstated that the wound never completely healed in spite of multiple therapy attempts and the veterinarian was\nnotified of delayed healing. Documentation was provided by the facility indicating various treatments were\nperformed by personnel. However, the attending veterinarian stated that she was unaware there had been any\nproblem with wound healing and she had last examined the wound approximately one year ago.\nFacility personnel also stated that the same animal was intermittently lame on the left front leg lasting one day in\nduration with each episode. The tiger had a toe surgically removed from the left front foot many years ago. The\nattending veterinarian stated she was unaware of any recent and/or recurring lameness issues with this animal.\nInformation regarding problems of animal health must be communicated to the veterinarian in an accurate and\ntimely fashion. A mechanism of direct communication must be established to keep the attending veterinarian\ninformed of the physical condition of the animals and allow adequate oversight of veterinary care.\nCorrect by: The appropriate information was provided to the veterinarian prior to the end of this inspection and\nveterinary guidance was given to the facility."
