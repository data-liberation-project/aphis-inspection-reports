The\nanimals could push behind the panel and topple it, possibly becoming injured in the process.\nThe enclosures should be free of hazardous items in order to protect the animals from injury.\nThis is a repeat citation, originally cited on 12/4/15, with a correction date of 12/20/15.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
