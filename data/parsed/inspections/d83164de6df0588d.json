The wounds\nwere located on the lower part of both forelimbs and the right rear limb. The wounds were open, irregularly shaped\nareas with hair loss that were superficial, and varied in size with the largest about 2 cm in diameter. The skin was\nmoderately reddened with no drainage. Both licensees stated that they had not noticed or treated the wounds prior\nto the inspectors identifying the issue.\nLack of adequate veterinary care can cause pain and discomfort, and can lead to other veterinary care issues. The\nlicensee must identify, prevent, diagnose and treat injury and disease. A licensed veterinarian must evaluate this\nanimal for an accurate diagnosis, and to develop a treatment plan. Documentation regarding diagnosis, treatment\nplan, treatments given, and the resolution of the problem must be maintained and made available to inspectors\nupon request.\nThe inspection and exit briefing were conducted with licensees, ACI Bartels, VMO Cole and IDALS.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
