Deviation from the IACUC approved monitoring\npractices and increasing the duration of the experimental session constituted significant changes to ongoing activities that\ndid not undergo IACUC review and approval. Animal use activities must be conducted in accordance with the IACUC\napproved proposal and any changes to ongoing activities involving animals must undergo IACUC review and approval\nprior to implementation.\nThis incident was voluntarily reported to USDA and corrective measures had been implemented at the time of inspection."
