The booth employee attendant sat a few feet behind the table and was handling large parrots for beak trims\nwith a dremel tool, wing trims and other procedures. This required the attendant's full time attention and led to very\nloud vocalizations by the birds. The sugar gliders had no pouches in their enclosure; there was simply a small clear\nplastic feeding dish. The gliders were all trying to pile into this enclosure to hide/get away to a quiet area. The use of\npouches or some other dark nest type structure is normal for gliders as they sleep during the daytime. Several bird\nspecies are natural predators and the loud noises can be distressful. In addition, the use of a dremel tool so close\nto the mammals may aerosolize flora that may lead to problems in non-bird species. Handling of all animals shall be\ndone as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress or\nunnecessary discomfort. Correct today."
