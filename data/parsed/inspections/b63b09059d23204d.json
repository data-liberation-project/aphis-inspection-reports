The hair loss was approximately 2 cm in diameter surrounding the nose and above the\nmouth. The were several scabs on the bridge of the nose. There were 8 adults and 4 young in this enclosure. There\nwas no indication that the facility had initiated treatment required by the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). When\nanimals are identified as needing care the facility must either initiate care as outlined by the PVC or obtained care\nby a veterinarian. This animal requires examination by a veterinarian to prevent a worsening of the condition and to\nprevent health risks to other guinea pigs housed in the same enclosure. Additionally, the licensee must provide\ndocumentation of such examination and treatment to APHIS officials upon request. Correct by September 14, 2017."
