      "narrative": "The licensee refused an inspection and was verbally harrassing.\nOn March 26, 2018 at about 10:06 am Mr. Dukes returned my call from a few minutes earlier. I called ahead\nbecause there is a note in ACIS indicating that inspectors should call a few minutes ahead to give Mr. Dukes time to\nput his guard dogs up. When I answered his call he immediately started yelling at me \u201chow dare you call me, you\u2019re\nnot coming on my property\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m dropping my license so you don\u2019t need to come here\u201d. He ranted in a loud,\nangry voice and used offensive language. His tone was very hostile and repeated several times \u201cyou\u2019re never\ncoming on my property again\u201d and hung up.\nIn order to verify that he understood this was a refusal, I called Mr. Dukes back. He repeated again \u201cyou and\nUSDA are not allowed on my property\u201d and several versions of the same sentiment all in an angry, hostile tone. In\nhis ranting it sounded like he was accusing me of talking about him to other people, and when I indicated to him that\nI didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, he then mentioned \u201cyour neighbors\u201d and \u201cthat vet\u201d followed by telling me he\nhas a lawyer and threatened me saying \u201cI\u2019m going after you too\u201d .\nI interrupted Mr. Dukes in the middle of another string of hostile and aggressive ranting and asked if I understood\ncorrectly that he was refusing an inspection. He said he didn\u2019t care, that he was dropping us. I told him that his\nlicense was still active and he replied that it runs out in May and he isn\u2019t renewing. At this point I just said \u201cokay,\nthank you\u201d and he hung up on me.\nThere has been a prior interference citation on 8/30/2016 with hostility toward the inspector, an attempted\ninspection on 11/16/2017, and now a hostile refusal. Additionally, a report from an attending veterinarian terminating\ntheir relationship with the licensee about a year ago, in combination with this lack of access to inspect, creates\nconcern for the welfare of the animals at this facility."
