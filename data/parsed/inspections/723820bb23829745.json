The deer also has areas of patchy hair loss throughout its body. A\nfacility representative stated they started noticing the abnormal condition a couple months ago. The facility\nrepresentative also stated the deer has had normal stools and is eating normally. However, a veterinarian has not\nbeen consulted and an appropriate treatment plan has not been administered.\nBody condition that shows lost weight to the point that the backbone or ribs are visible is a sign of potential health\nproblems. Poor body condition could be an indication the deer is not receiving adequate nutrition or it could be\ninternal problems. This can affect the ability of the deer to gain or maintain its body weight. Abnormal hair loss can\nalso be an indication of a health problem. The deer must be examined by a veterinarian and appropriate diagnosis\nand treatment administered. Documentation must be maintained on all problems, diagnosis and treatments. The\nlicensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nExit briefing conducted with the licensee."
