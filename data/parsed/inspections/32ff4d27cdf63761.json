No one at the facility had noted this condition\nnor had a veterinarian been contacted. Joint swelling and limping are signs of potentially painful conditions (eg.\narthritis, injury, infection) and need to be identified in a timely manner so that appropriate diagnosis can be made\nand treatment can be prescribed by the attending veterinarian.\nThe Operations Manager contacted the veterinary office during the inspection and treatment was prescribed by\ntelephone. The attending veterinarian (AV) is scheduled to come for a routine health check on all the camels on\n6/10/2014. This camel should be examined by the AV and a diagnosis of this condition should be documented. A\nplan for addressing this condition should by documented with any treatment prescribed and directions for\nre-evaluation if the condition does not improve. All records for the diagnosis, treatment, and plan for this animal\nmust be available for review during the next inspection by the APHIS VMO.\nThe exhibitor shall establish and maintain a written program of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate\nmethods for prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and injuries for all animals.\nCorrected during this inspection.\nAccompanied on the inspection by the licensee and the Operations Manager. Exit interview conducted on site with\nthe Operations Manager."
