The day before the goat was kept outside\nof its stall for approximately 1-2 hours while staff cleaned the inside of the enclosure. During this time, the goat did not\nhave access to any shelter. The temperature was approximately 32 degrees Fahrenheit and the facility representative\nreported to me that there was a sleety rain during that time also. The goat was found to be laying in a corner of its\nenclosure and was struggling. The facility representative reported to me that the goat was hypothermic. The goat was\ntreated per the attending veterinarians instructions and stabilized for a short while. However, the next day the goat started\nseizuring and it was decided to euthanize the goat. I asked the facility representative if the goat had not been kept outside\nfor approximately 1-2 hours if she felt the goat would have had those veterinary care issues and ended up having to be\neuthanized and she reported to me that it is unlikely that the goat would have had those issues and been euthanized had\nit not been kept outside during that time.\nKeeping animals outside in cold wet weather and not allowing them access to shelter can cause veterinary care issues\nlike what happened in this case. Animals must be provided shelter to protect them from the elements of the weather. If\nanimals are to be locked out of their stalls/shelter during the cleaning process, the cleaning process should be done as\nexpeditiously as possible to minimize any distress to the animals. They should be monitored closely to make sure they\naren't suffering any ill effects. During weather events, they can also be provided alternative shelter to prevent them from\nnot being able to access shelter at all times.\nCorrect starting on 8/19/24."
