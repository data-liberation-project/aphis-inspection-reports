      "narrative": "-There was an approximately four year old female blue merle Pomeranian that was observed with fecal material in\nher fur under her tail. On closer observation, there was an approximately 1 1/2 inch diameter region of hair loss\nunderneath the dog\u2019s tail. The fur surrounding the area of hair loss was matted with hard dry looking fecal material\nin it. The fecal material was next to the dog\u2019s skin. There were also some mats of fur with fecal material in it located\nfurther below the area of hair loss. There was a large matted ball of hair noted on the top of the dog\u2019s back near the\nbase of the tail. According to the licensee, one of his helpers had told him that a dog had been identified with matted\nfur under the tail a couple of days prior to the inspection and some of the matted hair and fecal material had been\nremoved at that time. However, the licensee had not seen the dog himself and had not been aware of the dog\u2019s\ncurrent condition. Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure\nthis dog is groomed and establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs to maintain a program of adequate\nveterinary care. To be corrected by: March 7, 2020\n-There was a blue unlabeled container that the licensee stated contained Vick\u2019s and had been used on a litter of\npuppies. There were no directions for use from a veterinarian on how to use the product on dogs and no labeled\nexpiration date. Unlabeled medications and with no instructions for use in dogs increase the risk of improper use\nand could harm the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a program that ensures medications are\nlabeled correctly, not used past their labeled expiration date and have directions for their use dogs. The licensee\ncorrected this non-compliant item by throwing the container in the garbage during the inspection.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."

Also, in one enclosure housing dogs, there was flooring\nin the outdoor portion of the sheltered building that had panels which had become separated from each other in\nfront of the access door. According to the licensee, it appeared that a zip tie had come undone that would help hold\nthe panels together. There was now an approximately 6 inch region where the floors had separated and one panel\nof the flooring was slightly raised in comparison to the adjacent panel. There was also a self-feeder that was broken\nand split along its side.
