At the time of the 8/10/22 inspection, the USDA officials asked the licensee multiple\ntimes if a member of the public had been bitten during any of the sloth encounters. He told the inspectors that \u201cnothing\nhappened here\u201d and that he did not get any complaint or report of someone being bitten. His answer each time that this\nquestion was asked was \u201cNo\u201d he did not know of any bites during any encounter. The licensee also asked his employees\npresent at the time of inspection, and they agreed that no member of the public had been bitten during an encounter.\nUSDA officials subsequently received documentation from the Suffolk County Dept of Health following the inspection that\nthey were notified that a member of the public was bitten and/or scratched by a sloth on 7/24/22 during an encounter at\nthe Licensee\u2019s facility and the person required immediate medical care by a medical professional. As a result of the\nincident, the health department issued an order of \u201cAnimal Confinement\u201d for a sloth named \u201cEdward\u201d on 7/24/22 and the\norder states: \u201cIt has been reported that on 7/24/22 your sloth was involved in an alleged biting/scratching incident. NY\nState Public Health Law requires a 30 day confinement of the animal for Rabies observation\u2026\u2026\u2026If your animal has\nneurological symptoms, or is not acting normal, it shall be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian and the Department\nmust be notified of the findings. The animal must be confined until 8/23/22.\u201d A copy of the order was signed by the\nlicensee on 7/28/22 which was thirteen days prior to the 8/10/22 inspection.\n(2) At the time of the inspection on 8/10/22, the USDA officials asked the Licensee to describe how the public feeds the\nsloths during the encounters and he stated that the public uses tongs to hold the food fed to the sloths. The USDA\nofficials observed the public feeding of the sloths with the food held by tongs at the time of the inspection, but pictures\nposted on the Licensee\u2019s social media page the weekend immediately following the inspection show barehanded feeding\nof the sloths by two children and one adult who was not the Licensee.\nPer this Section, a licensee shall not interfere with any APHIS official in the course of carrying out their duties. The\nprovision of false information to inspectors at the time of an inspection interferes with the ability of the APHIS officials to\ncarry out their duties and is considered to be a form of interference. Correct from this date 10/3/22 forward."
