      "narrative": "** On October 17, 2015 at approximately 1:00 pm a giraffe had gotten its head caught in a gate separating two\npaddocks. The staff allowed the animal to try and free itself without intervention for 45 - 60 minutes. At this time a\npark guest had spooked the animal causing it distress and at that point the attending veterinarian decided to sedate\nthe animal. After the animal was sedated the staff proceeded to support the animal using a rope to harness its rear\nend and neck. At this point the animal started to go down prompting the veterinarian to reverse the sedative. In the\nmeantime the facility used a battery operated reciprocating saw to free the animal and the animal went down in\nsternal position. The facility reversed the sedative two more additional times because the animal was unable to\nstand. Over the course of the next 2 to 2.5 hours the animal attempted to stand but was unable to. At approximately\n5:00 pm the animals condition started to deteriorate. The attending veterinarian decided at about 5:30 to euthanize\nthe animal. The gate was immediately removed after the animal was freed. The gate that the animal had trapped its\nhead in was not designed appropriately for this species and could not prevent the animals from injuring themselves.\nThe enclosure must be constructed and designed to protect the animals from injury. The facility corrected the\nproblem by removing the gate immediately after the animal was freed."

Further\ndown the walkway within the barrier fence, approximately 30 feet away, there was a public attendant not paying\nattention to the guest. Another public attendant at the goat feeding and petting station was very attentive and\nproperly monitoring her area being very aware of the animals and the public. It was stated that they should be\nmonitoring their areas as the latter demonstrated and that this was more of an employee issue. The giraffe feeding\nstation attendant was not monitoring the area as instructed. This was corrected when the Director instructed the\nemployee to move closer to the station once it was addressed by the inspector.\nThe Director refused to sign the inspection report as instructed by their Corporate office. The report was left with the\nDirector.\nThis was a focused inspection of the giraffe incident.\nThe inspection was conducted with the Director and Attending Veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted with\nthe Director."
