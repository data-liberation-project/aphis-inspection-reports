This morning one\npig with ear tag #6935 was found to have fresh scratches around the upper back, neck, head, and both ears. The\nmajority of the injuries were on the left ear where the skin was red in color, inflamed, and blood was present. The\nattending veterinarian was notified about these injuries in the morning before the inspection and began applying\nneo-predef topical ointment to the wounds.\nAnimals that are housed in the same primary enclosure with other incompatible animals are at risk for injury and\nstress from fighting. In some cases more dominant animals will limit access of the incompatible animals in the\nenclosure to necessary resources such as food, water, etc. All animal housing systems should attempt to minimize\naggression and competition especially at mixing. The facility must ensure that animals housed in the same primary\nenclosure are compatible.\nAfter the inspection, the facility was in the process of moving the injured pig to a separate enclosure, addressing the\nissue cited above.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
