There was a mark on the fur on the inside lower leg indicating a possible wound. The mark could not be\nobserved well due to the cub's movement. Facility staff confirmed that the cub had been checked the last two days\nand was not observed to be limping nor injured in any way. The limping and non-weight bearing walking observed\nduring the inspection is an indicator of pain and injury to the cub. The cub needs to be examined by the attending\nveterinarian to properly identify the injury and determine a treatment plan. The treatment plan should be followed as\ndirected.\nCorrect by: July 28, 2015"
