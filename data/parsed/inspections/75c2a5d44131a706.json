      "narrative": "There was one male miniature pig (#773, DOB 20 FEB 2017) housed in an enclosure with an excessive amount of\nwaste water and excreta on his floor and bedding. The pig could not lay down without coming in contact with his\nown fecal material. The light colored bedding shavings, which turn dark-gold when wet, were completely saturated\nwith liquid. There was a fecal-contaminated puddle covering more than 1/4 of the enclosure floor space. The facility\nrepresentative stated they normally clean the enclosures every morning but had not cleaned by the time of\ninspection (early afternoon) due to a busy schedule. Waste water and excreta that is not removed or drained\nproperly from enclosures poses a health risk for animals. Pig #773 was under the care and monitoring of the\nAttending Veterinarian due to a very thin body condition. This made the need for a clean and dry enclosure even\nmore important for this animal's health and comfort. The facility must ensure that excreta and waste water is\nremoved from all animal enclosures as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards. This non-compliant item\nwas corrected at the time of inspection.\nThe inspection was conducted on 11 and 14 August 2017 and an exit interview was conducted with facility\npersonnel."
