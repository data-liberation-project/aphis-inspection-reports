An additional inspection report will be delivered with any other issues\nidentified during this inspection.\nA blue and white budgie in the walk-through aviary had a health issue that was not identified by the licensee. Upon\ninspection, the budgie was observed by itself, not interacting with other birds, with fluffed up feathers, partially closed\neyes, rapid breathing, and trembling its body back and forth on the perching surface of a low shelter area, about 2 feet off\nthe ground. When it was approached, the bird did not fly away but instead walked further away down the perch continuing\nwith the same behavior of staying fluffed up, breathing rapidly, and trembling back and forth. When the inspector pointed\nthe bird out to the licensee, the licensee stated that the bird was breathing similarly to another bird in the aviary. However,\nthe second bird was active, interacting with other birds, had its eyes fully open, was not puffed up nor trembling. The\nlicensee did not appear to recognize that this specific bird was exhibiting signs of not feeling well. The inspector asked the\nlicensee to collect the bird so it could be further examined. Upon collecting the bird, the right wing appeared to be injured,\nwith at least one or more wing feathers missing and dried blood located from mid wing down to the tips of the primary\nfeathers. Failure to identify such conditions and to communicate findings with the veterinarian, delays treatment and can\ncause undue animal pain and distress. A more rigorous method of daily observation must be implemented to properly\nassess the animals' health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required\nfor timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. The currently affected bird needs to be seen by a veterinarian for an\nappropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.\nCorrect by: 11/18/2024\nThis inspection was conducted with the licensee. The exit briefing was conducted on November 15, 2024, with the\nlicensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nShoshana Tanenbaum, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
