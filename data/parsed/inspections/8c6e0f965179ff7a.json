  "narrative": "Four sheep and three goats were being held in a temporary enclosure for the facilities annual Halloween event. \nThe sheep and goats had no shelter from the sun or inclement weather.  Temperatures have been in the 90\u2019s\nrecently and the sheep had full or almost full coats of wool.  This combination could easily lead to overheating in the\nsheep.   Lack of shelter from wind and rain can also be stressful and cause health problems.\nThe facility representative explained they had shelter but a recent storm had blown it down.  They were given the\nopportunity to provide some type of shelter by the end of the day on Oct 6th and asked to email a photo as\nconfirmation.  Confirmation was never received.\nSome type of shelter from sun and inclement weather needs to be provided in the temporary enclosure or the\nanimals need to be moved back to their permanent enclosure.\nTo be corrected by:  Oct 13, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.",
