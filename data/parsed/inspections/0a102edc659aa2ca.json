Upon discovery, the guinea pig was\ntaken to the veterinarian immediately. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and\nappropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to\nthe inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nThis was corrected during the inspection.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Brittany Light, ACI and a facility representative."
