      "narrative": "During this inspection the inspectors reviewed animal use and animal medical records for the veterinary teaching\ncattle currently housed at the dairy farm. Review of the records and conversations with facility employees show that\ndaily observations of animals to assess their health and well-being are being conducted with problems being\nidentified and noted but that these issues are not being conveyed to the veterinarian in a timely manner to allow for\nappropriate and timely treatment of the cattle. Cow 488 was noted in the records to be lame on her right rear leg on\n9/1/15. The medical record shows that the cow was not evaluated until 9/28/15 at which time she was treated for an\nabscess in the right hind medial claw. Cow 769 was noted in the records to have a swelling on the 3rd eyelid. No\nmedical evaluation or treatment records could be found. Cow 5090 was noted to be limping on her left rear leg on\n11/3/15. She was evaluated and treated for horizontal hoof cracks on 11/6/15 with a note by the veterinarian that\nthe facility needs (cid:28)to retrim her in 6 wks(cid:29). No record of retrimming or reevaluation was identified. Several cows were\nnoted with longer than normal claws today. The facility representative stated that there is no protocol for regular foot\ntrimming and that the claws are trimmed when needed.\nThe facility must ensure that all problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian and the appropriate clinical veterinarian responsible under the facility(cid:25)'s program of veterinary care\n(instituted 9/17/15) to ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure provision of\nadequate veterinary care. There must be daily observation of all animals and there must be a mechanism of direct\nand frequent communication of daily observations of animal health and well-being issues to the attending\nveterinarian."
