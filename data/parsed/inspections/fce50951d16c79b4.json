The dogs were both observed with moderate loose stools in their respective primary\nenclosures. The stool was dark in color and varied from semi-solid to an unformed thick liquid consistency. Both dogs\nwere observed with fecal material in the hair just underneath the tail around the area of the anus. The dogs appeared to\nbe bright, alert, and a normal healthy weight. APHIS personnel inquired with the facility representative if he had observed\nthis condition and he stated that it has been occurring for approximately 3 days but he was not sure which dog in the\nenclosure was actually having loose stools. He stated that he has not contacted the facility\u2019s AV nor provided any of the\ntreatment options listed in the program of veterinary care.\nAdditionally, 3 adult French Bulldogs were observed with dirty and possibly infected ears. One adult female French\nBulldog (Microchip # 990000006532667) was observed with mild brown debris in both ears with moderate thickening of\nthe skin on the flap of both ears indicating the condition has been occurring for a prolonged period of time. One adult\nfemale French Bulldog (Microchip # 990000010699322 ) was observed with mild brown/yellow debris on the outer surface\nof the right ear. The ear had mild redness and scabbing on the outside of the ear canal. One adult female French Bulldog\n(Microchip # 990000009451510) was observed with moderate brown debris in both ears with mild thickening of the skin\non the flap of the ears. Both ears were also observed with mild redness and scabbing lesions on the outside of the ear\ncanal. The dogs did not exhibit any signs of head shaking, scratching, or pain when examining the ears. The facility\nrepresentative states he was not aware of any issues with the ears of the dogs.\nFailure to provide adequate veterinary care and treat conditions such as diarrhea and ear infections can cause\nunnecessary distress, pain, transmission to the other dogs, and negatively affect the animal\u2019s health and well-being. The\nlicensee must have these animal\u2019s evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to properly diagnose the medical conditions and\ndevelop an appropriate plan for treatment. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at\nall times by providing the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nCorrect by 19 January 2026"
