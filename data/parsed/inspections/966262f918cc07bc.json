Her right eye was hazy on\nthe surface and the white part had some redness to it. Her left eye had some discharge on the surface and around the\neyelids. I called the AV who said this dog should likely be getting eye ointment. Also, this dog was sensitive to the mouth\nand wouldn\u2019t allow dental observation. The one tooth I could see was the right upper canine tooth (bigger front tooth) and\nit was plaque covered and loose to the touch.
