A facility representative stated the rabbit cages are occasionally flamed as well when they get extra dirty, but\nthis is not performed to every rabbit enclosure at least once every 30 days, it is just on an as needed basis. Primary\nenclosures that are not sanitized properly and frequently may accumulate dust, fecal and urine waste products, and\nbacterial/viral agents which may contribute to health issues in rabbits such as gastrointestinal and respiratory illness. All\nprimary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days in one of the following manners as\nprescribed by 3.56(b)(3): washing with hot water (180F) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by\nwashing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant and rinse, or by cleaning\nall soiled surfaces with live steam or flame. Correct by March 21, 2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
