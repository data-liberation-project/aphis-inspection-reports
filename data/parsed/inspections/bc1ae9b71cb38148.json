A second modification added an\nadditional adjuvant injection for a group of rabbits, stating that \"The same methods for injection will be used. The\nmaterial to be injected will be the same as the initial boost injections; DNA plasmid with adjuvant.\" The adjuvant was\nnot identified in the modification. The investigator was contacted and stated that a different adjuvant was used for\ninjections subsequent to the initial Freund's Comlete adjuvant.\nIt is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that animal activities are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. In\norder to perform this function, a complete description of activities using animals must be included in protocols prior\nto IACUC approval.
