Expired medications (Furosemide injectible with expiration date of 2/2014 and Sodium Bicarbonate\ninjectible with expiration date of 4/2014) were observed ready for use in the emergency crash cart and were not\nlabeled as expired or segregated from in date drugs. Use of outdated drugs in an emergency situation could lead to\nan unexpected negative outcome and could harm the animal. The facility shall ensure there are adequate\nprocedures in place to manage the medicine inventory, including the crash cart medications, and avoid the potential\nuse of expired medications in an emergency situation.\nThe two vials of outdated injectible medication were corrected during the inspection by labeling as \"expired\" and\nremoving from the crash cart. A program of adequate drug inventory control that includes the crash cart is to be in\nplace by 5-23-14.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with IACUC Chair."
