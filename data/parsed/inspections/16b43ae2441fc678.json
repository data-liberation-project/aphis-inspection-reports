The mats are down to the skin and numerous in quantity on each dog. While there is no skin damage, the\nmats closeness to the skin cause a tightness/pulling that can cause dicomfort to the regulated animal. There is one dog\nnamed 'Reddy' a male poodle that was partially shaved on his back several weeks prior, however there are remaining\nmats on the back of the thighs/back end of the dog that had not been removed.\nThere were five dogs with moderately long nails ('Reddy', M, red Poodle; 'Hobie', M, tri-color Corgie; 'Kisha', F, brn/blk\nYorkie; 'Mara', F, white Bishon and 'Sandy', F, brn/why Shitzu). Each of these dogs had long nails that caused their toes\nto twist to the side, or not lie in a normal position when standing on a flat surface. The nails were approximately 1 to 1.5\ninches in length and had not been trimmed in several weeks.\nHaircoats on dogs with long or curly hair that are not brushed or trimmmed regularly can become matted to a degree that\ncan cause unnecessary pain or discomfort. The mats as they grow larger and tighten on the skin can cause skin issues or\nsores if adequate grooming is not done. Nails that are not trimmed regularly can become a hazard to the regulated animal\ncausing injury to themselves by getting the nails caught on fencing or objects within thier primary enclosure or in their\noutdoor run area. Possible injuries could also occur to that animal by twisting of the toes due to the foot not lying flat on\nfloor surfaces or could cause possible injury to puppies or other dogs they are housed with if they are stepped on or\nscratched while in play activities.\nThe licensee must provide regular grooming for the regulated animals in order to prevent and control matted haricoats\nand over grown long nails that distort the normal posture of the feet when stnading on a flat surface, or can be of risk of\ninjury to the dog or its kennel mates/puppies. There must be methods utilized to prevent or control veterinary care issues\nincluding matted haricoats and long nails.\nTo be corrected by: June 26, 2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nn"
