Three more\nhamsters, alive and in good condition, were also found trapped; the last one occurring although adjustments were made\nto increase clearance beneath the wheel. The placement of this enrichment item within the enclosure did not allow\nsufficient freedom of movement for the animals thus resulting in animal entrapment and discomfort as well as the death of\none hamster.
