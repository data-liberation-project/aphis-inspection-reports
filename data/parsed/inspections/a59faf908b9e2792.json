      "narrative": "This dealer has knowingly purchased from at least three individuals that require to be licensed under the Animal\nWelfare Act. On 11/19/2015, APHIS officials collected all records from this facility to perform a records review and\ninspection. During a review of the exemption certificates provided by the Licensee, it is apparent that 3 individuals\nfalsely signed exemption certificates. Based upon the records, these individuals have more than 4 breeding female\non their premise and require a current, valid and unsuspended license to sell puppies to the Licensee.\nThe first individual signed an exemption form 8 times from 3/9/2015-11/9/2015. The individual sold a total number\nof 10 litters to the Licensee during this time; 7 of these litters all born within a 6 month period. The litter breeds and\ndate of birth are as follows: 2-husky puppies whelped 1/12, 2-huskey puppies whelped 1/13, 9-huskey puppies\nwhelped 1/19, 6-lab/australian shepherd cross puppies whelped 4/18, 5-lab/german shepherd cross puppies\nwhelped 4/18, 4-huskey puppies whelped 7/18, 6-husky puppies whelped 7/27, 1-huskey puppy whelped on 7/27\n(this puppy does not have an assigned number on the certificate that correlates with the previous litter with the\nsame whelp date indicating it is from a separate litter), 6-huskey puppies whelped 9/14 and 10 Beagle/Bulldog cross\npuppies with an unrecorded/illegible birthdate)\nThe second individual signed an exemption form 5 times from 2/23/2015-10/12/2015. The individual sold a total of 7\nlitters to the Licensee during this time; all of the litters sold were born within an 8 month period. The litter breeds and\ndate of birth are as follows: 5-huskey puppies whelped 12/28/2014, 2-beagle/bulldog cross puppies whelped\n12/28/2014, 3-huskey puppies whelped 3/29/2015, 4-huskey puppies whelped 5/9, 3-huskey/beagle cross puppies\nwhelped on 5/9, 4-huskey puppies whelped 6/3 and 6-huskey puppies whelped 8/8)\nThe third individual signed an exemption form 6 times from 3/2/2015- an unknown date in September of 2015. The\nsold date is missing on the exemption form for this sale. The individual sold a total of 7 litters to the Licensee during\nthis time; all of these litters sold were born within a 6 month period. The litter breeds and date of birth are as\nfollows: 5-yorkie/bichon cross puppies whelped 1/3, 4-yorkie/bichon cross puppies whelped 1/3, 1-yorkie/bichon\ncross puppies whelped 1/13 (this puppy does not have an assigned number on the certificate that correlates with\nthe previous litter with the same whelp date indicating it is from a separate litter), 4-yorkie/bichon cross puppies\nwhelped 3/2, 2-yorkie bichon cross puppies whelped 5/18, 7-yorkie/bichon cross puppies whelped 7/1 and 3-lab\npuppies whelped 7/12).\nThrough the Licensee'(cid:25)s own record keeping, APHIS officials were able to establish that more litters were\npurchased from each individual than 4 females would be able to birth during these periods. Based upon the puppies\ndates of birth, amount of litters birthed within a short periods of time and normal gestation periods for dogs, it is\nobvious that all three of these facilities have more than 4 breeding females on their premise. The records obtained\nfrom the Licensee clearly establishes that they knowingly acquired puppies from unlicensed sources that clearly\nrequire a USDA license but do not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license, which makes it impossible for\nAPHIS to regulate those animals and undermines a working relationship between the licensee and APHIS officials.\nThis working relationship is essential in ensuring the wellbeing of the animals under the Animal Welfare Act.\nWhen APHIS Officials informed the Licensee of their findings, the Licensee stated that they had a changeover of\noffice personnel and that the employee that left was very good at keeping track of the amount of litters purchased\nfrom each unlicensed breeder. The Licensee stated that they will be configuring their system to allow them to more\naccurately identify how many litters they have purchased from unlicensed sources and be able to more closely\nmonitor the time frame for which they are purchasing them. The Licensee must not acquire puppies from any\nunlicensed sources that require a current, valid and unsuspended license unless they are truly exempt from USDA\nregulations and oversight. Correct from this time forward.\nThis was a records review only.\nAll records for review were collected on 11/19/2015.\nRecords were reviewed between 11/19/2015-1/21/2016.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative and Animal Care Inspector Shannon Sebera on 1/21/2016."
