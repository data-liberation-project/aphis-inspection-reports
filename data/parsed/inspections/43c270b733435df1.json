Housing facilities must\nbe equipped with disposal facilities and drainage systems that are constructed and operated so that animal waste\nand water are rapidly eliminated and animals stay dry. Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and\npest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All drains must be properly constructed, installed, and\nmaintained.
