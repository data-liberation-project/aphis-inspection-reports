      "narrative": "While observing the animals in the 40 acre Watani Grasslands exhibit using binoculars, both inspectors noticed an\nadult oryx to be lame on its front right leg. The oryx was not bearing weight on the leg while standing still and was\npartially weight bearing while walking but appeared in obvious discomfort. The oryx was first noted as lame in the\nkeeper notes on Mar. 3, 2016. The Mar. 7 keeper notes stated that a visual exam by the vet was being requested.\nThe vet notes for that date gave a treatment plan of monitoring the lameness and the animal and sedation if not\nbetter. On Mar. 18 attempts to sedate the animal were unsuccessful and the vet recommended the staff move the\noryx herd into a small yard and monitor. The staff was unable to move the herd into the smaller yard. Keeper notes\nfor Mar. 22 still note a severe limp. Keeper notes for Mar. 24 state the previously improving limp was back to a\nsevere limp after the animal slid while running from a truck on the road in the exhibit. The Mar. 28 vet record states\nthat the keepers also reported that some of the other oryx in the herd boss her around making her run more. The\nvet again recommended that the herd be moved into the small yard to limit running and to monitor. No specific\ndiagnosis has been made or treatment plan implemented. No pain medications have been administered. The oryx\nremains on public display in the Watani Grasslands exhibit where she is prone to further injury and harassment by\nthe other animals. The use of appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries is a key component of providing\nadequate veterinary care. The facility shall ensure that the appropriate methods to diagnose and treat the oryx are\ninstituted. Correct by Apr. 7, 2016."
