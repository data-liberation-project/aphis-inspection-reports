I knocked on the door and no one answered. I honked the horn several times. I called\nboth numbers and left a message. As I was getting ready to leave at 4:30, the licensee's wife arrived. She stated\nthat she was not familiar nor comfortable showing me the kennel and records and that the licensee would be late\narriving home. She also stated that they wanted to cancel their license. I informed her that the licensee needed to\nmail his license to the office with a written statement of their desire to cancel the license and until that time, they\nwould be subject to inspections."
