The surgeon had received adequate pre-surgery guidance\nregarding the protocol details but disregarded that guidance and conducted the off-protocol biopsies. The animals\nexperienced no increased pain or distress from the unapproved biopsy procedures based on observations by the\nAttending Veterinarian. Conducting procedures without IACUC approval can result in increased harm or death to the\nanimal and does not afford the IACUC the required regulatory oversight of animal use activities. The regulations state that\nthe IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications in or withhold approval of proposed significant changes\nregarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities. Prior to this inspection, the IACUC took appropriate corrective\nactions including removing the surgeon from the protocol during the investigation, requiring appropriate protocol\namendments, and increased supervision of the surgeon should they be returned to conducting surgery on this protocol."

Not ensuring that primary\nenclosures adequately protect the animals can result in injury or death to the animals contained therein. The regulations\nstate that primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the nonhuman primates from\ninjury. The IACUC investigated the incident and appropriate corrective actions were taken prior to this inspection including\nchanging the type of hammocks and enrichment items in the enclosures and increasing frequency of enclosure and\nenrichment item checks.
