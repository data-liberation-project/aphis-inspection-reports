All nail heads and screw heads sticking out need to either be removed or nailed in/screwed in so they are no\nlonger sticking out. The shelter with the gap between the side wall and top of the shelter needs to either be replaced or\nthe existing shelter needs to be fixed so that gap is no longer there.\nNote: All nail heads and screw heads sticking out were either removed or nailed in/screwed in during inspection.
