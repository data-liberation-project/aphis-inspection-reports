The subcutaneous injections of antigen and adjuvant are\nperformed based upon a schedule provided by the client. There was no documentation available to indicate that the\nschedule, which included several modifications, had been reviewed or approved by the IACUC or facility\nveterinarian. The facility IACUC chair stated that the modifications were not discussed by the IACUC because he\nhad determined that the client injection Schedule was within the guidelines of the approved \"Core Rabbit Freunds\"\nprotocol. The printed Schedule directions did not include route and site for each of the injections and the volume per\ninjection site was directed to be 0.5ml per site which is twice the 0.25ml maximum volume per site directed by the\napproved protocol. When antigen was provided by the client, facility staff recognized that the schedule directions\nwould not fit the protocol with respect to Total Volume of injection per animal (3ml maximum). Facility staff corrected\nthe Total Volume in discussion with the client before the injections were made. This change was not reported to a\nfaclilty Veterinarian or the IACUC because the change brought the Total Volume within the guidelines of the\napproved protocol and staff did not realize that the volume per site was not within guidelines in the protocol. There\nis flexibility in the protocol regarding route of administration and concentration of the solution, and this flexibility was\napplied by the staff to correct the Total Volume. The volume of solution per site is stated in the protocol to be a\nmaximum of 0.25 ml/site. The resulting volume of injection per site (after the correction for Total Volume) was\ndirected to be 0.75ml per site for the injections performed 6 December 2016 instead of the 0.25ml per site maximum\nIndicated In the approved protocol. Based review of the documentation and discussion with faclilty personnel, the\nchanges from the IACUC approved protocol in this case are considered significant. Proposed significant changes in\nongoing activities must be reviewed by the IACUC to assure that the changes do not adversely affect the welfare of\nthe animals. Correct by having the IACUC review all changes to approved protocols and maintain documentation of\nthis review for future inspections.
