Especially while walking straight toward\nthe fence or pacing along the fence, she would suddenly stop moving forward, throw her nose straight into the air, and\nabruptly change her direction of movement. The behavior was seen frequently between periods of play, scratching,\nforaging for apples, and moving around the enclosure, and occurred as often as 3 directional changes in 20 seconds\nwhen observed. The behavior was more pronounced during warmer weather and when there were many visitors around.\nThe abnormal directional change was observed both away from the fence and along the fence, even when there were no\nvisitors with apples in the area. Space did not appear to be a factor as she is housed in a large outdoor enclosure with\nplenty of space to roam, elevation changes, climbing structures and a waterfall/pond. The facility representative was\naware of this abnormal behavior, but no changes have been made to decrease the signs of stress that the bear is\nshowing. Additionally, the attending veterinarian had not been notified of the abnormal behaviors of the animal and\nveterinary care has not been provided to evaluate the bear\u2019s physical and mental health.\nDaily observation of all animals shall be made to assess their health and well-being and promptly identify injuries,\ndisease, and other medical conditions. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and\naccurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nUntreated injuries, infections, and other conditions can be painful and cause suffering to the animal, and frequent\ncommunications with the attending veterinarian are required to allow for the veterinarian to advise licensees on needed\ntreatments for health concerns, which helps to mitigate the effects of adverse health conditions. Correct by ensuring that\nthis female yearling bear, and any other bears showing abnormal behaviors, are evaluated by a veterinarian and that\ntreatments and care instructions are followed as prescribed.\n***Correct by 6pm Eastern time on Friday 7/18/25."
