This does not adequately secure the enclosure to\nprevent animals from escaping when someone enters the enclosure.\nFailure to secure enclosures can result in animal escape which can lead to injury and/or lack of access to food and water.\nHousing facilities for birds must employ security measures that contain all the birds securely such as safety doors,\nentry/exit doors to the primary enclosure that are double door, or other systems designed to prevent escape of the birds.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
