Three adult female California sea lions\nrequire 32.49 x 3 = 97.47 square feet of dry resting space in their primary enclosure, so the trailer lacks 42.64 square feet\nof dry resting space.\nThe inspector arrived at the exhibition at 11:13am and the facility representative stated that the animals had been inside\nthe trailer since 8am while they vacuumed the pools. The three adult female California sea lions had been kept in a space\nthat does not meet the minimum requirements for dry resting space for at least three hours. The sea lions must have\naccess to the show pools and main deck at all times in order to meet primary enclosure space requirements.\nAdequate dry resting space is important to allow animals to rest and make normal physical, postural, and social\nadjustments when out of the water. The facility must house animals in primary enclosures that provide at least the\nminimum amount of dry resting space for the animals within the enclosure as required by the Animal Welfare Act.\nTo be corrected from this day forward."
