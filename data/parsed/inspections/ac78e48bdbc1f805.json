Both eyes had a pale discharge and the the right eye's surface was pale in\ncolor. The crusted material and discharge are signs of eye problems. Eye problems can be painful for dogs and\nsometimes can be spread to other dogs. This dog must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for treatment and\nthe recommended treatment must be followed.\nA female Shih Tzu (ID #2) had a large clump of firm and matted hair underneath her tail. Hair mats can pull on the\nhair causing pain and can cause skin infection under areas of matted hair. Ensure that dogs' hair coats are\nmaintained in a manner to prevent clumping of hair. This dog's hair must be groomed and if the skin underneath has\nany problems the attending veterinarian must evaluate it and the treatment recommended must be followed.\nCorrect by 3/13/17\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the animal caretaker."
