The center part of\neye was blueish and hazy. Closer examination revealed some reddish crusty material in the hair around the right eye The\nwhite of the eye is mildly reddened. There was excessive discharge from eye causing the hair around the eye to be wet. I\nasked the licensee when the last time the eye was treat. The licensee stated, that their veterinary tech. treated the eye\ntwo to four weeks ago. The licensee stated, the Attending Veterinarian saw this dog and had documentation. However,\nthere was no documentation provided upon request. The licensee mentioned, this dog eye gets infected every time she\ncycles because of her hormones. Conditions of the eyes can be due to infections, allergies, injury, irritation, or other\nmedical conditions that could be painful.\nDue to the ongoing condition of the right eye, the licensee must have this dog evaluated by a veterinarian for veterinary\ncare and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals always receive adequate veterinary care.\nTo be corrected by 19-June-2023."
