Fecal material was built up inside the wheel\ncovering most of the running surface and up the sides. Some large chucks of fecal material were stuck to outer\nedges of wheel. Fecal material build up on items in the enclosure can pose risks to the health of the animals and\nlead to pest problems. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent\ncontamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. All enclosures and items within\nneed to be cleaned appropriately and/or replaced to prevent fecal material buildup. Correct by 1/9/2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative."
