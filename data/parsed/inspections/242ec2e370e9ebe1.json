A review of IACUC approved protocol 15-U-030 found\nsince the start of Fiscal Year 2023, 4 rabbits underwent multiple major operative procedures including procedures to\nreplace equipment. The given justification for performing multiple major operative procedures to replace equipment was to\ndecrease the total number of animals undergoing procedures while potentially causing additional stress on individual\nanimals. This justification is not adequate as it does not provide scientific reasons for performing multiple major operative\nprocedures. Animals that undergo multiple major operative procedures and are allowed to recover are subjected to\nincreased stress, pain, and discomfort. No animal will be used in more than one major operative procedure from which it\nis allowed to recover unless justified for scientific reasons by the principal investigator in writing, required as routine\nveterinary procedure or to protect the health or well-being of the animal as determined by the attending veterinarian; or in\nother special circumstances as determined by the Administrator on an individual basis. Correct by not allowing any animal\nto undergo more than one major operative procedure from which the animal recovers, unless justified for scientific\nreasons by the principal investigator, required for a routine veterinary procedure or to protect the health or well-being of\nthe animal, or by receiving approval from the USDA APHIS Administrator.
