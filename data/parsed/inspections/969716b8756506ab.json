In EB3348, a radio had been pulled off the shelf and at least one\nof the two cynomologous monkeys in the enclosure had been playing with the power cord. In W2442 an enclosure\nwith three cynomologous monkeys was close enough to a plastic feed storage tote that at least one of the monkeys\nwas found to have been chewing on the plastic liner bag. Enclosures placed so that animals can gain access to\nstored items in rooms could have adverse effects on animals.\nCorrection: The enclosure racks were moved immediately by staff during inspection so that the animals could no\nlonger access stored items. To protect the safety and health of animals, the facility must ensure that animals do not\nhave access to stored items in the rooms.\nInspection of animals and animal facilities was conducted on 6/27/2016 and records review and exit interview was\nconducted on 6/28/2016 with facility representatives."
