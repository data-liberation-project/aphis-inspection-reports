In the walk through park, there is no barrier at the\ngiraffe exhibit and members of the public are allowed to feed and touch them. There is no barrier in the petting farm\narea where the public feeds and contacts the animals. There are also no public barriers in the kangaroo walkabout.\nAnimal Care was made aware of a camel biting a child who then needed medical attention. The facility verified that\nthe incident did happen. The incident happened on a wagon ride and the camel reached over the primary fencing\ngrabbing the childs arm with the feed bucket. The facility has addressed this incident by placing a 6' wide area of\nlarge jagged rocks under the primary enclosure fence to prevent the public from approaching the camels and the\ncamels from approaching the public.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the\npublic, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure\nthe safety of animals and the public.\nVehicle windows can serve as public barriers. However, by keeping the windows of the vehicle completely down\nthe barrier between the public and animal is removed. The lack of barriers needs to be corrected to protect the\nhealth and safety of the animals and to ensure the safety of the public.\nTo be corrected by July 8, 2015."
