The\nright ear was drooping and had a black discoloration of the fur. A bloody lesion about one inch in diameter was\ndirectly below the right ear and a smaller bloody lesion was above the ear. The dog would not allow the inspectors\nto touch the ear. The licensee stated that the dog had been bitten by another dog through the fence several days\nearlier. The licensee had been spraying some type of medication on the ear, but there did not appear to be\nimprovement and the licensee had not consulted a veterinarian about the problem. Medical conditions that are not\ntreated or that are treated improperly can be painful and can worsen with time. The licensee must have this dog\nexamined by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment and must provide documentation to the inspector\nupon request.\n****An adult female Miniature Pinscher (m/c# OAO-156-7005) was limping on its right hind leg and would frequently\nhold that leg in the air when walking. An adult female Golden Retriever (m/c# OAO-224-6973) was limping on its\nleft front leg. She was reluctant to put that foot on the ground when standing and would hold it in the air when\nwalking. The licensee was not aware that these dogs were limping and had not sought veterinary care. Untreated\ninjuries and medical conditions can be painful and can worsen with time. The licensee must have these dogs\nexamined by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment and must provide documentation to the inspector\nupon request.\n****An adult male Poodle (m/c# 077-836-067) had long twisted hair over most of its body with matted hair over the\nback and on the chest. The matted hair extended all the way to the skin and was causing skin to be visible on the\nback and chest. Matted hair can result in skin and/or eye problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair\u2019s\nability to provide protection from the heat or cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from this animal and\nmust establish an effective program of haircoat maintenance."
