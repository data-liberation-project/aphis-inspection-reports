      "narrative": "Michelle, a female bulldog, has excessive watery discharge from both eyes. There is some greenish discharge attached\nto the hair around both eyes and the skin around the eyes is inflamed. The whites of both eyes are reddened and the\nlower eyelid of left eye rolls in slightly with some of the hair rubbing on the cornea. There are round areas on both eyes\nwhere the cornea is opaque. There is no record of treatment or veterinary care for this dog.\nMabel, a female bulldog, has excessive amount of accumulation of mucous around both eyes. Skin around the eyes is\nwet from excessive tearing and is red. There is a crusty greenish material in the hair in the this area. The third eye glands\non both eyes area enlarged and dark red. The centers of the corneas are opaque. Mabel was seen by a veterinarian for\n\u201cCherry Eye\u201d December 6, 2021, and her medical record shows she was treated with neomycin and polymyxin on March\n25, 2022 and with \u201cGenteal Tears\u201d on April 5, 2022. The facility representative said they are currently using the Genteal\nTears to treat Mabel. There is no indication that Mabel has been seen by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment of\nher current condition.\nAbnormal discharges and reddening in the eyes and surrounding structures are signs of conditions that can be painful\nand could lead to permanent damage to the cornea, and in some cases, loss of site in the eye.\nEach dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Both dogs must\nbe seen by a veterinarian for evaluation and treatment. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary\ncare at all times.\nTo be corrected by: July 1, 2022\nThe bottle \u201cGenteal Tears\u201d being currently used to treat Mabel\u2019s eyes, is expired in May 2022.\nExpired medications cannot be considered effective, should not be used for treatment of medical conditions and should\nbe disposed of in an appropriate manner.\nTo be corrected by: From this day forward all medical products used for dogs must be current.\nThe refrigerator used to store vaccines and some medications was 62 degrees Fahrenheit according to the inspector's\nKestrel. The refrigerator contained 5 doses of vaccine that, per label directions, need to be stored between 35 and 45\ndegrees Fahrenheit. There was also a bottle of Bactracillin G antibiotic that needs to be stored between 36-46 degrees\nFahrenheit according to it\u2019s label. The facility representative confirmed that the antibiotic is used to treat their dogs.\nMedications and vaccines need to be stored at the temperatures indicated on the labels and packaging or they cannot be\nconsidered effective in preventing or treating diseases. In the case of vaccines, this leaves the dogs unprotected from\nsome of their most serious, contagious, and deadly diseases.\nVaccines and medications used in dogs must be properly stored. This includes maintaining them at the proper\ntemperature indicated on the label. The licensee must provide proper storage conditions for all vaccines and medications\nused on their dogs and should consult their veterinarian concerning proper disposition of vaccine and medications in their\nprocession that have been stored improperly.\nTo be corrected by: From this day forward all medical products must be properly stored."
