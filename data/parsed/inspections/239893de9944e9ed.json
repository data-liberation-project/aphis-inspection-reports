Since part of the metal stake is inside the enclosure, the leopards\ncould move the rod from placement. This is extremely dangerous if the stake becomes loose and dislodges. The\nweight of the metal door could easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an animal. There is no\ncounterweight or secondary mechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force. Repair or replace the\nguillotine door to secure the door from sliding down.

According to the licensee, the hole was used as a place for a feeding tube to enter\ninto the enclosure, but the tube was removed after putting tigers inside this enclosure. Sharp points or jagged\nedges could cause injury and pain to an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to break off and be eaten.
