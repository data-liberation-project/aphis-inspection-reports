There were also plastic containers on the ground \npossibly dropped by staff or crows.  \n* Adjacent to the back fence area of the large holding pasture, there is large piles of trash and debris, from machinery, old \nvehicles, old wood, etc. This area creates a breeding ground for rodents and other pests to breed and thrive.  \n* The barn area used for storing metal containers of various feed for the animals including dog food, hoofstock food and \nbird food was excessively cluttered with old food bags, trash and debris. The cluttered nature of the area promotes \nbreeding and living ground for pests and does not protect the food supplies from contamination. There was evidence of \nrodent dropping on the wooden crates adjacent to the food containers.  \n* The area behind the public demonstration pavilion housing the serval and lynx has a table that is cluttered with trash and \ndebris that needs to be cleaned.  \nPremises, including buildings and grounds shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to \nfacilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Trash should be placed in designated receptacles \nand accumulations must be cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. \nCorrect by 11 September 2024. \n3.131(d) \n   \nSanitation. \nThere is a large amount of large rodent fecal pellets around the hoofstock feed storage room on furniture tops off the floor \nand on loose wooden planks and haphazardly tossed empty feed bags piled on the floor around the feed bins. Vermin \nharm animal welfare by transmitting disease and parasites to vulnerable zoo animals. A safe and effective program for the \ncontrol of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. \nTo be corrected by 11 September 2024. \n3.132 \n   \nEmployees. \nBased on the number of noncompliant items in this report, the facility does not have enough adequately trained \nemployees to maintain professionally acceptable levels of husbandry care at the facility. Additional employees should be \nhired, or possible number of animals reduced to ensure animal welfare standards are maintained for overall health and\n\nwellbeing of the 300 plus animals cared for at the park.  \nCorrect by 02 October 2024. \n3.153(a)(1)(i) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \n3.153 (a)(1)(i) \u2013 Primary enclosures (avian) \u2013 general requirements - Have no sharp points or edges that could injure the \nbirds Noncritical \nThe wire mesh located next to the barrier fence for covering water spigot in the waterfowl pond is in disrepair. There are \nsections of the wire mesh that is lifting creating sharp points and edges which could cause injury to the birds. This section \nof mesh must be kept in good repair for the safety of the birds.  \nCorrect by 11 September 2024. \n3.154 \n   \nEnvironment enhancement to promote psychological well-being. \n3.154 Avian Enrichment \nThe facility does not have an environmental enhancement plan in place to promote the overall psychological well-being of \nthe birds at the facility. Exhibitors must develop, document and follow a species appropriate plan for the environmental \nenhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the birds as well as noting the emu housed with the wallabies. \nThis emu must be identified in the plan as a special consideration as it is not housed with any other emus. This plan must \nbe approved by the attending veterinarian as well as made available for future inspections.  \nCorrect by 11 September 2024. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nANDREA D AMBROSIO, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOR n",
