The goat pen directly\nadjacent to the barn has a large hole in the wood panel on the fence gate. The hole is approximately 6-7\" long and 5\" tall\nwith jagged wood edges. The sheep pen behind the animal care office building has a top fence board next to the gate\nwhich has cracked and splintered and is no longer connected to the supporting wood post. In the elk pasture, the large\nblack plastic feed pan has several cracks and a hole about 4\" in diameter at one end. There is also an section of mesh\nfencing under the boardwalk with a hole large enough for a limb, face, or antler to get caught in. Enclosures with cracks,\nholes, or sharp edges can lead to animal entrapment and injury. Correct by 5 August 2022 by ensuring that all housing\nfacilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them."
