When the licensee handled her it was seen a pale discharge was under her eyelids.\n-Female in 92B: her lower incisors were excessively long and her hair coat was unkempt and appeared to be in a\ngeneralized poor condition.\n-Female in 44C: (eartag A41 SIRS); her left eye was swollen and sealed shut. It had discharge under the eyelids when\nhandled by the licensee.\n-Female in 137C: had discharge and hair loss in her urogenital region. She was unkempt and appeared to be in a general\npoor condition.\nImproving daily observations will help animal health problems such as these to get promptly treated. Continue to improve\nthe routine of daily observations so that animal health problems can be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in an\naccurate and timely manner."
