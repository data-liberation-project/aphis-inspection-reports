This\nwas something that the facility reports that it wasn't aware of prior to inspection. The crusted area looks like a scab\nand could be due to numerous causes. A close up evaluation of this area is needed by the facility and attending\nveterinarian and the attending veterinarian's prescribed treatment plan must be followed.\nA wolf \"Tatonka\" was seen to have an open wound on the area over her right triceps with a scabbed wound by her\nright elbow behind the open wound. The licensee said that in the past couple weeks she was bit by another wolf\nand that they were putting topical Vitaderm on it. The attending veterinarian's last documented visit to the facility\nwas to prescribe fly medication for wolves and evaluate some pigs on 8/2/17. The facility did not have written\ninstructions from the veterinarian to apply Vitaderm or topical medications. During inspection, the topical Vitaderm\non hand was expired and didn't appear to have been used. Another topical product the facility said they use on the\nwound was also expired and a third topical spray was shown to us that the licensee said is applied to the wound (no\nexpiration date was found on the spray). The facility must have the attending veterinarian evaluate Tatonka's\nwounds and follow the veterinarian's prescribed treatment plan and ensure expired medications are not used and\nare properly disposed of.\nUntreated veterinary care problems in animals can cause them prolonged discomfort and if not treated conditions\ncould worsen. Ensure that animals with veterinary care problems are seen by the veterinarian and treated as\nprescribed.\nCorrect by 9/1/17"
