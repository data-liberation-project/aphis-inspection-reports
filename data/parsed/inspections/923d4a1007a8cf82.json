Dolly had a thick mat of hair along her back that\nwas about 6 inches long and 4 inches wide. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and\nmoisture. It can foster skin infections and affect the animal's mobility. Matted hair does not maintain the same\ninsulating qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective\nprogram for coat maintenance for the health and well- being of the dog.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMcgruder William, Animal Care Inspector"
