The veterinarian informed the inspector the licensee brought their written PVC into the office, stating they\nonly needed a veterinarian of record, and the business manager stamped the PVC with the veterinarian\u2019s signature. While\nthe licensee has brought animals to the veterinarian\u2019s office for treatment, the veterinarian stated he does not consider\nhimself as the facility\u2019s attending veterinarian.\nOther veterinarians employed by the licensee were contacted by the inspector. While their names appeared on the written\nprogram of veterinary care, none of them are identified as the attending veterinarian for the facility.\nEmploying an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements provides a measure of quality assurance and helps\nsustain satisfactory oversight and communication by the vet with the facility.

In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the\nformal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of\nthe facility.\nCorrect by April 16, 2025."

The licensee did not reach out to\ntheir attending veterinarian or any other veterinarian. The licensee stated she was following a plan she believed would be\napproved by their veterinarian. The licensee provided oxygen and oral antibiotics they had on-hand at the facility. This\ngroundhog died the following morning (August 2024, according to the licensee\u2019s records). Upon the inspector speaking\nwith the veterinarians provided by the licensee, none of the veterinarians had any record of communication with the\nlicensee on this issue. Nor did they have any pre-approved plan appropriate for this medical condition and animal.\n- The licensee received one groundhog on July 24, 2024, per the records provided by the facility during this inspection.\nThe licensee stated they were informed this groundhog survived a dog attack incident prior to intake. The licensee\ninformed the inspector they did not have this animal immediately seen by a veterinarian, providing supportive care only\nupon intake. The licensee stated they took the groundhog to a veterinarian days later, administering medication at their\nfacility, as directed by the veterinarian after the vet visit. Upon the inspector contacting the veterinarian that examined this\ngroundhog, the veterinarian stated they had not received any information on this animal or seen this animal until January\n2, 2025. Per the medical records provided by the veterinarian, the physical exam assessment detailed concerns to rule\nout an old neck fracture causing lasting damage and functional impairment, and potential chronic pain from injury.\nAccording to the licensee\u2019s records, this groundhog died on February 6, 2025 \u201cfrom injuries from dog at intake\u201d.\nFailure to communicate with the attending veterinarian to relay pertinent information regarding an animal\u2019s condition can\nlead to prolonged suffering, discomfort, or deterioration of the animal\u2019s health, and subsequently death. The facility shall\nensure that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian such that timely and\naccurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by April 9, 2025."
