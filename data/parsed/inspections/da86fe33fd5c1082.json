The sores are approximately the size of a quarter in diameter with hair loss,\nulceration, redness, and inflammation, where the inflammation and hair loss extend just below the ulcerated areas as well.\nWhen sitting upright in a normal sitting position, while bearing weight on her hocks, she constantly shifts back and forth\nbetween the two back limbs in discomfort. The cage she is housed in is made of metal with no other substrates between\nthe animal and the metal. Daily observations serve as a key function in assessing the health and well-being of the\nanimals. As such, when conditions go unnoticed, it contributes to worsening of said condition and further discomfort and\nstress for that animal. The facility must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include daily\nobservations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Furthermore, if daily observations are performed by\nsomeone other than the attending veterinarian, a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian.\nCorrect by: 2 pm on September 1, 2021"
