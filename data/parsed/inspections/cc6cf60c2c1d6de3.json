He stated that he was aware that both bison were grazing in the yard and that he saw them wander up the\ndriveway to the road. He stated that he got into his truck and followed them down the road to where he could use voice\ncommands to turn them around and follow them home. He stated that the bison did not encounter any people or vehicles,\nreturned home uninjured, and that they were on the road for less than 10 minutes total.\nAllowing animals to wander freely around the property where they can get to the road does not protect them from harm or\ninjury. Running loose down the road puts them at risk of being injured by an automobile. Additionally, large animals such\nas bison, can cause damage to property and vehicles can become injured when spooked attempting to be caught.\nCorrect starting on 4/20/23.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
