The wool over her hind\nquarters contained mats of varying sizes.\nMatted hair coats can cause discomfort for the animals and lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. The\nlicensee must remove the mats and ensure that all animals have their hair coats routinely maintained in order to\nprevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases associated with excessive matting. Additionally, the facility must\nensure that the recently sheared animal receives adequate protection from the elements to prevent any discomfort\nfrom cold temperatures.\n***Four alpacas (one brown, one tan, and two white) have overgrown hooves. The two white alpacas and the brown\nalpaca had toes that were curling in a sideways direction, due to lack of adequate hoof trimming.\nFailure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful to the animals or\ncause injuries. As part of the facility\u2019s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all\nanimals receive appropriate hoof care in a timely manner.\n***A white, adult, wether, named \u201cMurphy,\u201d was observed to be in poor body condition, with protruding hip bones,\nspine, and ribs. The bones of his spine, hips, and each rib were easily felt by both APHIS inspectors upon palpation.\nPoor body condition can be an indication of health issues, including parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, and\nsystemic disease.

The bottom of the wire fencing was not\ntethered down, and it was curling upwards into the Highland steer enclosure, creating gaps underneath the fencing,\nwhere the animal could injure himself. There were numerous portions of the wire fencing that had broken, exposing\nsharp metal points that could injure the animal.\n***Along the far fence line of the Highland steer enclosure (the fence line opposite the gate), the soil was eroding,\ncreating a gap underneath the wire fencing. The soil was very loose, and fell out from under the inspector\u2019s feet as\nshe approached. APHIS inspector measured the gap with her tape measure to be ten inches in height. Along that\nsame portion of fencing, additional metal wiring had been attached to the fencing. This metal wiring was in disrepair,\nas it leaned into the enclosure so the top of the wiring was parallel to the ground. Other portions of the wiring were\nlying on the ground, and metal points were pointing into the enclosure. There was a second gap along this far fence\nline that was seven inches in height. Surrounding this gap, the metal wiring had numerous sharp points pointing into\nthe enclosure.\n***In the Highland steer enclosure, there was a gap beneath the metal fencing along the side of the enclosure that\nwas opposite the fence line shared with the alpaca, llama, and sheep enclosure. The gap was several feet long, and\nmeasured to be as high as nine inches. Additionally, this portion of the fence was unstable. The metal structural\npole did not provide adequate support to the fencing, allowing the fencing to be easily movable by APHIS\npersonnel.\nAll enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to\nprotect the animals from injury.
