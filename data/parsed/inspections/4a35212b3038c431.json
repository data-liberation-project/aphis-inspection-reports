The hairless area was approximately 1.5 centimeters\nin diameter, located on the top of the paw, above the second digit. The visible skin was pink/red in color, becoming\nred and inflamed towards the center of the hairless area. In the center of the reddened skin, the skin was dry and a\nscab had formed.\nDuring the same walk-through, APHIS inspectors discovered a circular area of hairloss on the left forelimb of a 7\nyear old male beagle, ID #1688A. The hairless area, approximately 1cm in diameter, was on the top of the paw,\nabove the 2nd digit. The skin beneath the hairless area was reddish in color.\nThese particular conditions had not been documented by facility staff.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and\nthe increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily\nobservations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and\nappropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nAfter the inspection, the facility provided veterinary care for the beagles, addressing the issues cited above.\nThis inspection was conducted from December 5-7 with facility representatives and the exit interview was\nconducted on December 7 with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSismour Naomi, Veterinary Medical Officer"
