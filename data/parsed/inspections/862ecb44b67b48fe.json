Some children were feeding by putting their hands through the\nfence with feed in them while others were allowing the animals to eat out of the cups provided by the facility. The children\nwere able to pet the animal if it remained close to the fence. There are no physical barriers around the blackbuck, deer,\nllama or Egyptian geese/crowned crane exhibits. The facility relies on having an attendant in the park monitoring while the\npublic is present so there are no permanent physical barriers around the blackbuck, deer, llama or Egyptian\ngeese/crowned crane exhibits. At no time during these interactions was there an attendant or facility staff member present\nmonitoring the public interactions with the animals.\nDuring public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals\nand the public.\nThe absence of barriers between the public and animals, whether physical or attendants, does not minimize the risk of\nharm to the animals or public. A barrier shall be provided to protect both animals and the public from harm.\nCorrect by May 31, 2024."
