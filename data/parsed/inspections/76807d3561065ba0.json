      "narrative": "An approximately 5 year old brown and black female goat named Moon was seen alone, away from the rest of the\nherd. The goat appeared lethargic standing with a hunched back, her head down and droopy eyes. She was\nbreathing rapidly and was often seen open mouth breathing. There was a moderate amount of thick sticky green\ndischarge in both nostrils and she occasionally coughed. The membranes lining the goat\u2019s eyes were pale, almost\nwhite in color. The goat was also seen grinding her teeth from time to time and a firm mass half an inch in diameter\nwas felt under her neck. The licensee had not identified the current condition affecting this goat, therefore had not\ncontacted the veterinarian for guidance on care. The licensee did explain that approximately a month ago, she\nnoticed swelling at the goat\u2019s neck and treated her with a de-wormer suspecting a parasitic infection.\nFailure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress in animals\nwith such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to\nassess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for\ntimely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. During the inspection, the licensee contacted the attending\nveterinarian and received guidance on care for this goat.\nTo be corrected by 1/10/2020"
