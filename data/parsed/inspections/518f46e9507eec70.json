      "narrative": "Facility personnel did not perform adequate daily observations of a 12 year old, buckskin mare, ID #05, used on a\nteaching protocol, by failing to observe and report the worsening condition of the animal\u2019s left eye to the\nveterinarian.\nDuring an inspection on June 6, APHIS inspectors observed a mare with a small injury to the lower left eyelid. The\ntissue surrounding the eye was swollen and the eye was tearing continuously. Inspectors observed the mare for\napproximately 15 minutes, during which time she predominantly held the eyelid partially or fully closed. The mare\nwas able to open the eyelid, and inspectors observed that the eye was cloudy. The clinical veterinarian verbally\ninformed APHIS inspectors that she observed the swollen eye on Friday, June 1, when the mare arrived. Daily\nobservations had already been performed by facility staff before the inspectors arrived. The veterinarian stated that\nthe eye appeared to have worsened since she had initially seen it, but facility staff had not notified her of the horse\u2019s\ncondition. After the inspection, a veterinarian examined the mare and initiated treatment for the eye.\nAdequate daily observation of all animals is critical to ensure that conditions that can adversely affect health and\nwell-being are recognized and conveyed to a facility veterinarian in a timely manner so that appropriate methods\ncan be employed to ensure proper care.\nEach research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily\nobservations of all animals to assess their health and well-being; provided, however, that daily observation of\nanimals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and provided further, that a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of\nanimal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nThis inspection was conducted from June 5-7 with facility representatives and the exit interview was conducted on\nJune 8 with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
