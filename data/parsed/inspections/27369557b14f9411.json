      "narrative": "The facility is not following their IACUC-approved protocol 2202-39802A.\nSpecifically, the protocol states a specified surgical procedure should take approximately 1-3 hours and two rhesus\nmacaques underwent surgeries on February 6 and 7, 2025 that lasted approximately 7.5 hours each.\nThe protocol states that buprenorphine will be dosed at 0.01 mg/kg for surgeries lasting less than 6 hours and 0.02 mg/kg\nfor surgeries expected to last longer than 6 hours. Meloxicam will be given postoperatively every 24 hours for 3 days after\nsurgery. The animal who underwent surgery on February 6, 2025, received 0.01 mg/kg of buprenorphine perioperatively,\ninstead of 0.02 mg/kg. That animal received meloxicam postoperatively on day 2 approximately 26.5 hours after their\nmeloxicam on postoperative day 1.\nThe protocol states that immediately following the procedure, the patient will be monitored continuously (with behavior\nrecorded approximately every 15 minutes) until they are perching and no longer ataxic. Following this, the patient will be\nchecked on approximately every 15 to 30 minutes for the next hour. The records for the animal anesthetized on February\n6, 2025, state that the animal was extubated at 1815 hours, blinking at 1815-1830 hours, and sitting up at 1910 hours.\nThere are further records documented after 1710 hours that follow the protocol\u2019s instructions for monitoring. However,\nthere is no indication that the animal was monitored continuously between 1830 and 1910 hours.\nThe IACUC\u2019s policy on surgery and postoperative care of USDA species states that a surgical record must be kept\ndocumenting the procedure that was performed, identity of the surgeon(s)/assistant(s), and a summary of the procedure\nincluding any complications or deviations from the approved procedure. No surgical summary was recorded for either\nanimal.\nAdditionally, the implant cleaning protocol is not being followed for several of the rhesus macaques with cranial implants.\nThe protocol states that the implants will be cleaned daily for animals undergoing behavioral training and once weekly for\nanimals not currently on a training protocol. The cleaning protocol specifies that hair must be removed from the scalp\nsurrounding the implant using electric scissors. Cleaning was not performed on five days between January 27, 2025 and\nMay 1, 2025, as directed by the protocol. Additionally, hair was not being clipped as directed in the protocol as noted in\nveterinary records on January 21, 2025.\nThis activity constitutes a significant deviation from the approved activities in the protocol. Making significant changes to\nprotocols without IACUC review and approval deprives the IACUC of the opportunity to provide oversight of animal\nactivities and compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, failing to complete surgical, anesthetic, analgesic, and\ncleaning procedures as described in the protocol could result in suffering or death in the affected animals.\nPrincipal investigators are to follow the IACUC-approved protocols, and any proposed changes shall be reviewed and\napproved by the IACUC prior to implementation. Those carrying out procedures in an IACUC-approved protocol must be\nfully trained and adhere to what is approved by the IACUC, unless prior modifications are requested and approved.\nCorrect by May 7, 2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nGWENDALYN MAGINNIS, Nonhuman Primate Field Specialist n"
