      "narrative": "*One adult male Bobcat was in very poor body condition at the time of inspection. This bobcat was co-housed with\nanother bobcat that appeared in good body condition. Despite the length of the animal\u2019s hair, the individual vertebrae\nwere easily visible, the ribs and shoulder were readily apparent, and there was a severe abdominal tuck. The licensee\nstated that both Bobcat are fed only every other day and that they had been fed the day prior. He further stated that he\nhad observed the Bobcat\u2019s poor condition and had dewormed it the day prior with Panacur, but that the attending\nveterinarian had not examined the animal. Additionally, while the licensee stated that the Attending Veterinarian had\nprovided information regarding the dose of Panacur, he was unsure if he was supposed to repeat the dose and/or provide\nthat dose for multiple days. Poor body condition can indicate a lack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate\nother underlying disease processes. Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the\nattending veterinarian can lead to worsening of the condition, prolonged unnecessary suffering, and possibly starvation\nand death.\n*Young skunks, 6-8 weeks old, are having their scent glands removed by the licensee without general anesthesia. The\nattending veterinarian has provided instructions for the licensee and an assistant to restrain the animals, \u201cfan\u201d 0.5 ml of\nlocal anesthetic around the gland region, wait approximately three minutes then evert the gland and \u201cpull it free\u201d using\nforceps. There is no guidance provided for post-procedural monitoring of these animals. This is a major surgical\nprocedure which produces permanent impairment of physical and physiological function, as defined by the Animal\nWelfare Act Regulations and Standards, with a high risk for complications such as rectal prolapse. Licensee stated he\nobserves rectal prolapse in many of his adult skunks. He stated sometimes the prolapses resolve on their own, and\nsometimes he must push them back in with his finger. With this major surgical procedure being performed on conscious\nanimals with the ability to move and squirm, the risk for complications is inherently increased. The attending veterinarian\n(AV) has stated to a member of this inspection team that he is a mixed animal practitioner (dogs, cats, farm animals) and\nis not an exotic veterinarian. Additionally stating the procedure is analogous to anal gland expression in dogs. The AV\nstated he has only seen the procedure performed by the Licensee, that the licensee taught him how to preform this\nprocedure, and that he has not consulted with any other knowledgeable veterinarian experienced in performing the\nprocedure. The procedure as described by the attending veterinarian and being performed by the licensee is not\nadequate veterinary care and can lead to unnecessary pain and distress. Licensee shall establish and maintain a\nprogram of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat the\nanimals on hand.

      "narrative": "Thirty-five animals were identified during the inspection that required veterinary care. These animals were not identified\nby the license prior to inspection and/or were identified prior to inspection, but their issues were not communicated to the\nattending veterinarian.\n- One white colored red fox was identified as being in very poor body condition. This fox co-housed with another white\ncolored red fox in an enclosure with two green cards with the number \u201c8\u201d on them. The hips, pelvis, ribs and shoulder for\nthis fox were easily visible. It had poor hair coat and a pronounced abdominal tuck. There was no food or water was\npresent in the enclosure when first identified by inspectors. When water was provided both fox in the enclosure drank, the\nseverely underweight fox drank for a prolonged time (approximately 3 minutes) stopping only briefly when interrupted or\nwhen it went to look in the food bowl. When asked the licensee stated that this was \u201cold\u201d, approximately 10 years old, and\nthat some of the fox (like this one) just drink a lot. He agreed the animal was underweight but had not communicated that\nor his observation of increased thirst to the attending veterinarian prior to inspection. Poor body condition can indicate a\nlack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. Particularly when combined\nwith increased thirst, this may indicate underlying medical issues and is important information to communicate to the\nattending veterinarian so that the fox may be properly examined, a diagnosis can be made, and a treatment plan can be\nprescribed. Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can\nlead to, prolonged unnecessary suffering, worsening of the condition and possibly starvation and death.\n- One adult mink present in an enclosure on the left side row within the mink building had patchy hair loss over the\nmajority of its body. There were numerous scabs of varying sizes, and the underlying skin was red suggesting that the\nanimal was itchy and likely self-inflicting these wounds. The hair loss was worst around the base of the head and neck\narea. The licensee stated that he hadn\u2019t seen hair loss in this mink before, but that occasionally they will scratch due to\nfleas. He agreed that he would have the veterinarian look at this animal.\n- One Skunk present in the last enclosure on the left side row of the mink / ferret building had severely overgrown\ntoenails. The nails were thickened and so long that they were curling outwards and twisting the toes into abnormal\npositions. This skunk appeared slower than the others and reluctant to walk. When observed trying to groom its face, the\nanimal appeared to have difficult and stopped quickly again appearing uncomfortable. Excessively long nails can cause\nabnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures causing discomfort to the animals. Prolonged\nseverely overgrown nails can lead to chronic musculoskeletal abnormalities and may be painful. In addition to this skunk,\nat least 15-20 other animals (skunk, artic fox, and red fox) also had overgrown nails that needed to be trimmed for their\nhealth and comfort.\n- One adult skunk present in enclosure R2C1 had a white to blue opaque discoloration covering the entire corneal surface\nof the right eye. Additionally, this skunk had a similar area on a portion of the surface of the left eye. The licensee stated\nthat he had not noticed it before but that it was an older female skunk and possibly a cataract. There was no discharge,\nhowever, the opacity was on the surface of the eye rather than within the eye itself (as occurs with cataracts). Ocular\nconditions are often painful, and this type of corneal discoloration can occur from many causes including infectious,\ntraumatic, or inherited.\n- Five of the Six alpaca had an excessive amount of coat / fiber present. The two black and one white alpaca had long\nmatted cords of fiber dangling from their body past their knees. The others had more tightly matted fiber over their trunk\nand back. The amount of fiber present precluded visualizing the topline of all but one of these animals. That alpaca was\nexcessively thin with a very prominent spine. Body condition could not be assessed in the others because of the amount\nof fiber present. The licensee stated that he only shears the alpaca in the fall. Excessive fiber in alpaca can lead to\ndiscomfort and overheating in the hot summer months. Additionally, matting or cording of the fiber reduces its ability to\nkeep water off the alpaca and properly insulate in the cold winter months.\n- One brown alpaca had lower incisor teeth that were long enough that they were protruding out above the upper lip. This\nanimal had enough fur present, that inspectors could not visually assess the alpaca\u2019s weight / body condition. Proper\nocclusion of incisors is necessary for grazing.\n- One juvenile fallow deer had approximately 10-12 black raised roughly circular rough dark colored wart-like growths on\nboth sides of its face. These ranged from approximately \u00bd to 2 cm and were primarily around the eyes and mouth. When\npointed out to the licensee, he stated he thought they were just flies. Skin growths can be caused by a variety of agents\nincluding several which may be contagious to other animals (such as when caused by viruses).\n- One standard color raccoon housed alone (and with no offspring present) had hair loss on its rump and entire tail. The\nhair that was present was short appearing nearly even with the skin. The licensee stated that this animal was \u201cmolting\u201d\nand \u201csometimes they do that\u201d, however, the hair appeared either chewed or broken off. Hair with this type of extremely\nshort appearance (not due to shearing / shaving) can occur for many reasons and may be self-inflicted such as self-\nbarbering due to severe psychological distress, breaking hairs from scratching, or hormonal causes. Communication with\nthe attending veterinarian and the use of appropriate diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the underlying cause\nand prevent worsening and unnecessary suffering.\n- One grey colored Mink had hair loss on the tip of its tail. And area approximately 1 cm long was nearly hairless. The\nlicensee stated that he had not observed the hair loss in his animal, but that sometimes Mink pull or chew their fur out.\nHair loss in animals can be caused by several problems such as nutritional deficiencies or traumatic injury. When self-\ninduced, hair loss can indicate behavioral stress, neurological dysfunction, or other problems.\nFailure to adequately observe animals daily and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal health and behavior to the\nattending veterinarian (AV) in a timely manner, prevents the provision of adequate veterinary care and can lead to\nworsening of the condition for individuals and/or failure to prevent disease in other animals. Correct by ensuring that the\nanimals and conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animal can be properly\nexamined, diagnosed, and treated. Additionally, ensure that animal\u2019s daily observation of animals is adequate to identify\nthose with signs of abnormal health and behavior and that there is direct and frequent communication of those\nobservations to the attending veterinarian."

The largest hole is large enough that an inspector was able to reach her entire hand up through the floor of the\nenclosure. This is easily large enough for the fox to pass entire legs and/or their head through and there are sharp points\nfrom broken wires around the entire hole. This hole is currently large enough that there is a significant risk of animal\nescape. Additionally, there are other areas of broken wires protruding up into the enclosure in front of the feeder where\nthe animal would need to stand to feed and sharp edges resulting from rust on the feeder itself. The licensee stated that\nhe was aware these older enclosures in the back of the property were not in good condition, however, he just hasn\u2019t had\ntime to move the fox to another enclosure. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound in kept in good repair to\nprevent injury and to contain the animals.\n*Sharp points remain on multiple fox, skunk, mink, and ferret enclosures where holes have been cut to accommodate\nfeeders and access doors. Many areas the wire floors have broken wires protruding into the enclosure. Although the\nlicensee has addressed several areas of sharp points documented on the last inspection report, at least 40% of\nenclosures continue to have sharp points resulting from broken wires, holes, rusted feeders, etc.\n*The Sika deer enclosure has large gaps along the bottom with broken and tangled wire. One of the posts is loose and a\nwhole section of fence is slanted on the back side of the enclosure. One of the posts is broken, the top portion hanging\ninto the enclosure. Many areas of the fence are crumpled, some with repair attempts made, but remain loose, posing an\ninjury threat to the deer as well as allowing access for other animals, like coyotes or dogs, to enter the enclosure.\n*A created opening in one Arctic fox enclosure wall is being aggressively chewed on by the fox, causing an expansion of\nthe opening, creating sharp edges which could break teeth or cause other injuries.\n*A large tree limb has fallen on top of a few of the fox enclosures crushing the enclosure tops down into the animal space.\nThe weight of the limb has impacted the structural integrity of the enclosure from underneath.\n*The animals have access to these areas of disrepair and can easily be severely injured and/or entangled.

These arctic foxes are now adjacent to enclosures housing and/or within visual,\nauditory, and olfactory proximity of red fox which are natural predators to them. There are no barriers or hides from these\nstressors. The animals have no way to reduce their stress levels. This is showing through the abnormal behaviors\ndisplayed.\nMost of these arctic foxes in these open enclosures are displaying significant signs of stress, expressed as abnormal\nbehaviors for the species. Signs include frantic pacing or jumping back and forth in the enclosure and over cage mates,\nfreezing in a standing position on the side mesh trying to get as far away from the inspectors, staying curled in a tight ball\nwhile growling continuously, and/or excessively pawing at the water for extended periods of time.\nRed foxes, while being a semi social species, need to have the ability to avoid conflict with cage mates either through\nspace, visual barriers or varying elevated areas.

Despite the length of the animal\u2019s hair, the individual vertebrae \nwere easily visible, the ribs and shoulder were readily apparent, and there was a severe abdominal tuck.  The licensee \nstated that both Bobcat are fed only every other day and that they had been fed the day prior.  He further stated that he \nhad observed the Bobcat\u2019s poor condition and had dewormed it the day prior with Panacur, but that the attending \nveterinarian had not examined the animal.  Additionally, while the licensee stated that the Attending Veterinarian had \nprovided information regarding the dose of Panacur, he was unsure if he was supposed to repeat the dose and/or provide \nthat dose for multiple days.  Poor body condition can indicate a lack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate \nother underlying disease processes.  Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the \nattending veterinarian can lead to worsening of the condition, prolonged unnecessary suffering, and possibly starvation \nand death. \n \n*Young skunks, 6-8 weeks old, are having their scent glands removed by the licensee without general anesthesia.  The \nattending veterinarian has provided instructions for the licensee and an assistant to restrain the animals, \u201cfan\u201d 0.5 ml of \nlocal anesthetic around the gland region, wait approximately three minutes then evert the gland and \u201cpull it free\u201d using \nforceps.  There is no guidance provided for post-procedural monitoring of these animals. This is a major surgical \nprocedure which produces permanent impairment of physical and physiological function, as defined by the Animal \nWelfare Act Regulations and Standards, with a high risk for complications such as rectal prolapse.  Licensee stated he\n\nobserves rectal prolapse in many of his adult skunks.  He stated sometimes the prolapses resolve on their own, and \nsometimes he must push them back in with his finger.  With this major surgical procedure being performed on conscious \nanimals with the ability to move and squirm, the risk for complications is inherently increased.  The attending veterinarian \n(AV) has stated to a member of this inspection team that he is a mixed animal practitioner (dogs, cats, farm animals) and \nis not an exotic veterinarian.  Additionally stating the procedure is analogous to anal gland expression in dogs.  The AV \nstated he has only seen the procedure performed by the Licensee, that the licensee taught him how to preform this \nprocedure, and that he has not consulted with any other knowledgeable veterinarian experienced in performing the \nprocedure.  The procedure as described by the attending veterinarian and being performed by the licensee is not \nadequate veterinary care and can lead to unnecessary pain and distress.  Licensee shall establish and maintain a \nprogram of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat the \nanimals on hand.  Additionally correct by ensuring that there is adequate guidance to personnel involved with handling, \nimmobilization, anesthesia, and analgesia (in accordance with section 2.40(b)(4).  And further that adequate pre-\nprocedural and post-procedural care in accordance with established medical and nursing procedures in accordance with \nsection 2.40(b)(5). \nRemains Uncorrected \n2.40(b)(3)  Direct Repeat\n   \nAttending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors). \nThirty-five animals were identified during the inspection that required veterinary care.  These animals were not identified \nby the license prior to inspection and/or were identified prior to inspection, but their issues were not communicated to the \nattending veterinarian. \n \n- One white colored red fox was identified as being in very poor body condition.  This fox co-housed with another white\n\ncolored red fox in an enclosure with two green cards with the number \u201c8\u201d on them.  The hips, pelvis, ribs and shoulder for \nthis fox were easily visible.  It had poor hair coat and a pronounced abdominal tuck.  There was no food or water was \npresent in the enclosure when first identified by inspectors.  When water was provided both fox in the enclosure drank, the \nseverely underweight fox drank for a prolonged time (approximately 3 minutes) stopping only briefly when interrupted or \nwhen it went to look in the food bowl.  When asked the licensee stated that this was \u201cold\u201d, approximately 10 years old, and \nthat some of the fox (like this one) just drink a lot.  He agreed the animal was underweight but had not communicated that \nor his observation of increased thirst to the attending veterinarian prior to inspection.  Poor body condition can indicate a \nlack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes.  Particularly when combined \nwith increased thirst, this may indicate underlying medical issues and is important information to communicate to the \nattending veterinarian so that the fox may be properly examined, a diagnosis can be made, and a treatment plan can be \nprescribed.  Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can \nlead to, prolonged unnecessary suffering, worsening of the condition and possibly starvation and death. \n \n- One adult mink present in an enclosure on the left side row within the mink building had patchy hair loss over the \nmajority of its body.  There were numerous scabs of varying sizes, and the underlying skin was red suggesting that the \nanimal was itchy and likely self-inflicting these wounds.  The hair loss was worst around the base of the head and neck \narea.  The licensee stated that he hadn\u2019t seen hair loss in this mink before, but that occasionally they will scratch due to \nfleas.  He agreed that he would have the veterinarian look at this animal. \n \n- One Skunk present in the last enclosure on the left side row of the mink / ferret building had severely overgrown \ntoenails.  The nails were thickened and so long that they were curling outwards and twisting the toes into abnormal\n\npositions.  This skunk appeared slower than the others and reluctant to walk.  When observed trying to groom its face, the \nanimal appeared to have difficult and stopped quickly again appearing uncomfortable.  Excessively long nails can cause \nabnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures causing discomfort to the animals.  Prolonged \nseverely overgrown nails can lead to chronic musculoskeletal abnormalities and may be painful.  In addition to this skunk, \nat least 15-20 other animals (skunk, artic fox, and red fox) also had overgrown nails that needed to be trimmed for their \nhealth and comfort. \n \n- One adult skunk present in enclosure R2C1 had a white to blue opaque discoloration covering the entire corneal surface \nof the right eye.  Additionally, this skunk had a similar area on a portion of the surface of the left eye.  The licensee stated \nthat he had not noticed it before but that it was an older female skunk and possibly a cataract.  There was no discharge, \nhowever, the opacity was on the surface of the eye rather than within the eye itself (as occurs with cataracts).  Ocular \nconditions are often painful, and this type of corneal discoloration can occur from many causes including infectious, \ntraumatic, or inherited. \n \n- Five of the Six alpaca had an excessive amount of coat / fiber present.  The two black and one white alpaca had long \nmatted cords of fiber dangling from their body past their knees.  The others had more tightly matted fiber over their trunk \nand back.  The amount of fiber present precluded visualizing the topline of all but one of these animals.  That alpaca was \nexcessively thin with a very prominent spine.  Body condition could not be assessed in the others because of the amount \nof fiber present.  The licensee stated that he only shears the alpaca in the fall.  Excessive fiber in alpaca can lead to \ndiscomfort and overheating in the hot summer months.  Additionally, matting or cording of the fiber reduces its ability to \nkeep water off the alpaca and properly insulate in the cold winter months.\n\n- One brown alpaca had lower incisor teeth that were long enough that they were protruding out above the upper lip.  This \nanimal had enough fur present, that inspectors could not visually assess the alpaca\u2019s weight / body condition.  Proper \nocclusion of incisors is necessary for grazing. \n \n- One juvenile fallow deer had approximately 10-12 black raised roughly circular rough dark colored wart-like growths on \nboth sides of its face.  These ranged from approximately \u00bd to 2 cm and were primarily around the eyes and mouth.  When \npointed out to the licensee, he stated he thought they were just flies.  Skin growths can be caused by a variety of agents \nincluding several which may be contagious to other animals (such as when caused by viruses). \n \n- One standard color raccoon housed alone (and with no offspring present) had hair loss on its rump and entire tail.  The \nhair that was present was short appearing nearly even with the skin.  The licensee stated that this animal was \u201cmolting\u201d \nand \u201csometimes they do that\u201d, however, the hair appeared either chewed or broken off.  Hair with this type of extremely \nshort appearance (not due to shearing / shaving) can occur for many reasons and may be self-inflicted such as self-\nbarbering due to severe psychological distress, breaking hairs from scratching, or hormonal causes.  Communication with \nthe attending veterinarian and the use of appropriate diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the underlying cause \nand prevent worsening and unnecessary suffering. \n \n- One grey colored Mink had hair loss on the tip of its tail.  And area approximately 1 cm long was nearly hairless.  The \nlicensee stated that he had not observed the hair loss in his animal, but that sometimes Mink pull or chew their fur out.  \nHair loss in animals can be caused by several problems such as nutritional deficiencies or traumatic injury.  When self-\n\ninduced, hair loss can indicate behavioral stress, neurological dysfunction, or other problems. \nFailure to adequately observe animals daily and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal health and behavior to the \nattending veterinarian (AV) in a timely manner, prevents the provision of adequate veterinary care and can lead to \nworsening of the condition for individuals and/or failure to prevent disease in other animals.   Correct by ensuring that the \nanimals and conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animal can be properly \nexamined, diagnosed, and treated.  Additionally, ensure that animal\u2019s daily observation of animals is adequate to identify \nthose with signs of abnormal health and behavior and that there is direct and frequent communication of those \nobservations to the attending veterinarian. \n2.75(b)(1)  Repeat\n   \nRecords: Dealers and exhibitors. \nThis facility currently has no record of animals on hand, no records of acquisition, and incomplete records of disposition of \nanimals.  The facility is still not tracking offspring born at the facility.  The licensee stated that he does not record births \nuntil the animals are separated from their mothers for sale (and then only tracks through sales receipts).  The licensee \nacknowledged that records of animal deaths or euthanasia are not recorded.  The licensee stated that many of the \nanimals he maintains (including fox, raccoon, skunk, and mink) frequently give birth to more offspring than they \nsuccessfully wean, but that these deaths are not recorded.  When asked how many animals are currently on hand at the \nfacility, the licensee was not sure of the exact number and was not able to provide any record of animals on hand.  He \nstated that there had been no changes since the prior APHIS inspection and that the numbers should be the same. \n \nFailure to maintain disposition records such as records of the described pre-weaning deaths prevents the licensee, \nattending veterinarian, and APHIS Officials from evaluating mortality to determine possible causes and/or compliance with \nthe AWA.  Failure to maintain complete and accurate records of acquisition, disposition, and record of animals on hand\n\nprevents APHIS officials from tracing animal movement and from completely assessing other are aspects of compliance \nwith the AWA.  Correct by ensuring that the facility maintains complete and accurate records of all animals on hand, all \nanimal acquisitions (including the total offspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control) and \nanimal dispositions (including those which die, are euthanized, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of). These records \nmust include all information required by this section, must be maintained in an accurate and timely manner, and must be \nmade available for inspection by APHIS Officials. \n2.126(a)(4)  Critical\n   \nAccess and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries. \nFour raccoons were not made available for inspection by APHIS Officials.  On the previous inspection 4 juvenile raccoons \nwere being held by the licensee housed in primary enclosures that did not meet requirements for adequate space so that \nthey could be bottle reared.  When asked where these animals were currently being housed, the licensee stated that he \nhad moved them to his daughter\u2019s residence and that she was assisting him by bottle rearing them until they were ready \nfor sale.   When inspectors asked to go to that location to inspect the housing facilities, animals, food, etc. the licensee \nstated that his daughter was at work and that he did not have access to that property.  He stated that he could have the \nanimals brought to his property to show them to inspectors the following day, but reiterated that he was unable to provide \naccess to the animals at that time.  Failure to allow access to all locations at which animals are housed prevents \ninspectors from assessing the animals, primary enclosures, and care provided to those animals in order to ensure \ncompliance with the Animal Welfare Act.   Correct by 9/2/2022 by ensuring that APHIS Officials are able to enter all \nlocations that animals are housed or otherwise being held during business hours. \n2.134(a) \n   \nContingency planning.\n\nThe facility does not have a contingency plan.  Instructions and APHIS form 7093 were provided at the last inspection.  At \ninspection today, the form remained blank and no other contingency document has been developed.  In the event of \nemergency animals may suffer due to the lack of preparedness.  Licensee must develop, document, and follow an \nappropriate plan to provide for the humane care of their animals in the event of emergency or disaster. \nCorrect by:  September 15, 2022 \n3.125(a)  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, general. \nMany enclosures remain in need of repair: \n*The wire mesh floor in one red fox enclosure on the far side of the property is in severe disrepair with large holes in the \nwire.  The largest hole is large enough that an inspector was able to reach her entire hand up through the floor of the \nenclosure.  This is easily large enough for the fox to pass entire legs and/or their head through and there are sharp points \nfrom broken wires around the entire hole.  This hole is currently large enough that there is a significant risk of animal \nescape.  Additionally, there are other areas of broken wires protruding up into the enclosure in front of the feeder where \nthe animal would need to stand to feed and sharp edges resulting from rust on the feeder itself.  The licensee stated that \nhe was aware these older enclosures in the back of the property were not in good condition, however, he just hasn\u2019t had \ntime to move the fox to another enclosure.  Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound in kept in good repair to \nprevent injury and to contain the animals. \n \n*Sharp points remain on multiple fox, skunk, mink, and ferret enclosures where holes have been cut to accommodate \nfeeders and access doors. Many areas the wire floors have broken wires protruding into the enclosure. Although the \nlicensee has addressed several areas of sharp points documented on the last inspection report, at least 40% of \nenclosures continue to have sharp points resulting from broken wires, holes, rusted feeders, etc.\n\n*The Sika deer enclosure has large gaps along the bottom with broken and tangled wire.  One of the posts is loose and a \nwhole section of fence is slanted on the back side of the enclosure.  One of the posts is broken, the top portion hanging \ninto the enclosure.  Many areas of the fence are crumpled, some with repair attempts made, but remain loose, posing an \ninjury threat to the deer as well as allowing access for other animals, like coyotes or dogs, to enter the enclosure. \n \n*A created opening in one Arctic fox enclosure wall is being aggressively chewed on by the fox, causing an expansion of \nthe opening, creating sharp edges which could break teeth or cause other injuries. \n \n*A large tree limb has fallen on top of a few of the fox enclosures crushing the enclosure tops down into the animal space. \nThe weight of the limb has impacted the structural integrity of the enclosure from underneath. \n \n*The animals have access to these areas of disrepair and can easily be severely injured and/or entangled.  The tree limb \nmay fall further crushing the animals and below.  Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be \nmaintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them. \nRemains Uncorrected \n3.127(b)  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nThirty-six Arctic fox and four Red fox remain in enclosures without shelter.  The enclosures are made of approximately 1-\ninch square wire.  There is a piece of tin siding placed on top of the enclosures and a moderate sized rectangle of solid \nmaterial on the west side of the individual pens, but the animals are not protected from blowing wind, rain, and snow.  \nWithout adequate protection the animals are prone to exposure stress and disease hazards.  Shelter shall be provided for\n\nall animals kept outdoors to afford protection and prevent discomfort. \nRemains uncorrected \n3.127(c) \n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nAt the gate to enter the Sika deer enclosure and around the grain feeders in the pen, are large areas of mud.  Recent rain \nhas accumulated in these low areas creating the mud bogs.  Standing in the mud compromises the integrity of the deers\u2019 \nfeet making them more prone to infection and abscess.  A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess \nwater. \nCorrect by:  September 21, 2022 \n3.127(d)  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, outdoor. \nThere remains no perimeter fence around the outside housing facilities.  Animals and unauthorized persons can easily \naccess the animals and may cause stress, injury, release, or even death to the regulated animals.  All outdoor housing \nfacilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. \nRemains Uncorrected \n3.128  Direct Repeat\n   \nSpace requirements. \nThirty- six arctic foxes and four red foxes are housed in wire mesh enclosures up off the ground with 2-3 animals per \nenclosure. There are no hide boxes for these animals to protect them from the elements and no visual barriers from \nanything around them. \n \nMany of the juvenile arctic foxes were moved to an enclosure with no box so they would not rub their fur off in the box,\n\naccording to the licensee. Normal postural and social adjustments for this species is to live in dens which provide cover \nand the ability to evade predators. These arctic foxes are now adjacent to enclosures housing and/or within visual, \nauditory, and olfactory proximity of red fox which are natural predators to them.  There are no barriers or hides from these \nstressors. The animals have no way to reduce their stress levels.  This is showing through the abnormal behaviors \ndisplayed. \n \nMost of these arctic foxes in these open enclosures are displaying significant signs of stress, expressed as abnormal \nbehaviors for the species. Signs include frantic pacing or jumping back and forth in the enclosure and over cage mates, \nfreezing in a standing position on the side mesh trying to get as far away from the inspectors, staying curled in a tight ball \nwhile growling continuously, and/or excessively pawing at the water for extended periods of time. \n \nRed foxes, while being a semi social species, need to have the ability to avoid conflict with cage mates either through \nspace, visual barriers or varying elevated areas. The red foxes in these open enclosures are also showing signs of stress.  \nOne fox was biting repeatedly at the wire mesh which can potentially injure the animal\u2019s mouth and teeth. Another red fox \nwas scratching at the base of the wire mesh repeatedly. Several other red foxes were observed jumping back and forth \nrepeatedly in the enclosure, often jumping over a cage mate with no avoidance possible. \n \nBeing subjected to prolonged stress, captive animals with no way to navigate their enclosure or engage in social \nadjustments like hiding, will cause suffering if not alleviated. \n3.129(a)  Direct\n   \nFeeding.\n\n*The approximately 8 year old male bobcat is extremely underweight. The vertebrae on the back are easily visible along \nwith prominent hips and a concave tuck at the abdomen. Currently the licensee states he feeds the two bobcat every \nother day a total of 1 frozen thawed muskrat (wild-caught origin) and 4 pieces of chicken in various sizes and amounts.  \nThis diet amount is not sufficient quantity or nutrition to enable this animal to maintain a healthy weight or add additional \nweight leading into the fall and winter months.  Additionally, feeding wild-caught prey without conducting regular parasite \ntesting, presents a risk to the health of the Bobcat.  All animals must be fed once a day unless otherwise dictated by \nhibernation, veterinary treatment, normal fasts or other professionally accepted practices.  This animal is being fasted 3-4 \ndays a week, only offered food every other day. Given the extremely poor body condition of this animal, fasting every \nother day is not appropriate and is not adequate feeding. \n \n*The majority of the fox, skunk, raccoon, mink, and ferret exhibited signs of diarrhea and or loose stool underneath the \nenclosures.  Stools appeared watery and/ or with mucus.  The licensee is currently feeding a mix of dog and cat food as \nthe base diet to these species.  When asked the licensee stated that the animals have loose stool because he feeds a \nhigh fat diet.  All diets fed to animals must be of appropriate nutritive value to maintain animals in good health.  Prolonged \ndiarrhea can lead to dehydration and unnecessary discomfort. \n \n*Failure to provide adequate feed can result in poor body condition and unnecessary suffering.  Ensure that all animals \nare provided appropriate diet of sufficient nutritive value and quantity for optimal animal health and welfare.  Additionally, \nsince the current diets are associated with concerns in animal health, the attending veterinarian must be contacted and \nprovide guidance and appropriate feeding plans for these animals. \nCorrect By: Sept 1, 2022\n\n3.129(b)  Repeat\n   \nFeeding. \n*A few of the food receptacles still have moldy food at the base of the food receptacle.  Plastic coffee containers are \nrecycled and used as food receptacles in many enclosures.  These feed receptacles are entirely contained within wire that \nhas 1-inch holes.  The only larger holes are where animals access the feed and where feed is added from the outside of \nthe enclosure.  The design prevents removal of the feed container to remove old feed and or adequately clean feeders.  \nThe licensee stated that he typically waits until feed is empty to refill in order to prevent molding.  He also stated that he \ncleans them by spraying feed out with the hose then letting it air dry before re-filling.   Because of the awkward design of \nthese containers, the food can get stuck down in the rim at the base of the feeder making it difficult for the animals to get \nto, leaving the food to cake and mold. A few feeders have been contaminated with feces that must be removed. All \nfeeders must be kept in good repair to facilitate cleaning and must be kept clean to minimize contamination of the food \nsupply. \n \n*A few of the plastic containers are heavily chewed and worn and need to be replaced. There are plastic pieces \nunderneath a few enclosures and there is a concern of chewed plastic pieces becoming an ingestion hazard. \n3.130  Direct Repeat\n   \nWatering. \n*The inspection process began mid-afternoon at 2pm eastern time. The licensee stated he waters the animals daily in the \nafternoon or evening. At the start of the inspection, approximately 85% of the water receptacles were dry.  Several foxes \nand raccoon were observed pawing at the empty water receptacle in their enclosure. At the request of the inspectors, the \nlicensee began to give water to sections of animals at a time during the inspection walk through process.  Multiple animal \nspecies including the red fox, arctic fox, raccoon, striped and spotted skunks, and mink would then drink and consume\n\nwater for prolonged periods of time.  At least 40-50 animals were observed drinking water excessively.  Several fox, \nskunk, and raccoon drank for nearly 2 minutes continuously, or paused briefly when startled by a person\u2019s presence, only \nto return to drink again as soon as it felt comfortable to do so. The licensee stated that animals frequently immediately \n\u201cdig\u201d all the water out of their water receptacles and also that some animals \u201cjust drink more\u201d.  The eagerness and length \nof time spent consuming water indicates that the animals were very thirsty and that only offering water once daily is not \nsufficient. The facility must provide water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. \n \n*Additionally, multiple water receptacles are still dirty with grime, debris, and/or a white flakey film that is not being \ncleaned out prior to fresh water being offered. Dirty water receptacles contaminate water and may lead to animal illness. \nWater receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to provide water that is free from contamination. \n3.131(a)  Repeat\n   \nSanitation. \n*There is still a large accumulation of feces and fecal piles under the red fox, arctic fox, raccoon, mink, and skunk \nenclosures. Some of the fecal piles underneath the enclosures are several inches high and some run along the support \nbeams of the enclosure. This accumulation is contributing to strong ammonia and fecal odor around the area. \n \n*There are feces all around the edges of the bobcat enclosure on the ground. The licensee hoses the feces out of the \nprimary enclosure but then leaves it in the rocks directly adjacent to the concrete slab. These feces must be removed as \noften as necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors around the animal areas. \n \n*The large raccoon enclosure with the red nest box has a large pile of feces left on the top of the box. This enclosure \nneeds to be cleaned more frequently to remove this waste and keep the animals from becoming soiled.\n\nCorrect by ensuring that feces are removed from primary enclosures an as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of \nexcreta, contamination of animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. \n \nPreviously identified NCI\u2019s section 3.131 (c) and 3.132 documented on the last inspection report remain uncorrected but \nthe correction date has not passed. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nKERRY MCHENRY, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER \nANDREA D AMBROSIO, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOR n",
