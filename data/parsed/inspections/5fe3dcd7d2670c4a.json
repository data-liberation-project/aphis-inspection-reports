      "narrative": "The USDA reviewed the facility's records for the 5-year-old whale, Havok, during the time he was on 24-hour watch.\nDuring the eight hours prior to his death, the staff members conducting the overnight watch documented multiple\nobservations of abnormal behavior and did not alert the Attending Veterinarian. The frequency of these abnormal\nbehaviors markedly increased during this time compared to what had been observed previously.\nFrom 0000-2150 on the day prior to Havok\u2019s death, about 40 instances of a combination of \u201clogging,\u201d shaking of pectoral\nflippers, \u201cventral up\u201d and rolling behaviors were noted at the facility in various time intervals. Comparatively, during\nHavok\u2019s last eight hours 2151-0550, the facility's records noted at least 40 instances of 360 rolling, with one instance of\nfour rolling behaviors noted at 0049 hours and five rolling behaviors noted at 0146 hours. Other abnormal behaviors\nnoted to increase in frequency were at least 15 instances of \"ventral up\u201d (most of note was the instance of ventral up for\n15 seconds at 0101 hours), 3 instances of \"gaspy\" respirations beginning at 0413 hours, and 7 instances of water seen\ncoming from his blowhole beginning at 0416 hours. There were also 10 instances of \"active bleeding\u201d from Havok's\nrostrum recorded during the two hours prior to his death.\nThis increased frequency of abnormal behaviors constitutes a problem; can indicate rapid deterioration of the animal\u2019s\nhealth and may result in prolonged distress. Although staff members were recording their observations of Havok\u2019s\nbehaviors, the veterinarian was not contacted during this eight-hour timeframe until Havok\u2019s death at 0550 hours.\nThe facility failed to provide adequate veterinary care by not using appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and\ntreat diseases during Havok\u2019 s last eight hours.\nCorrect from this date 10/15/21 forward."

Facility\nrecords indicated that the five-year-old whale named Havok had been receiving treatment for over two weeks for an\nocular condition that resulted in compromised vision. On 6/20/21, the gates between the three interconnecting pools were\nopen allowing the eight whales access to all pools. A visitor dropped a foreign object in the main pool, which according to\nfacility employees, is not unexpected when there are a lot of visitors present at the exhibits.\nAccording to facility employees, in response to the foreign object, they closed the gate to the holding pool. The facility\nstationed other whales, but not Havok. A facility employee attempted to retrieve the object with a net. Per the facility,\nHavok was startled by the net in the main pool and then swam towards the holding pool after the gate was shut. Although\nthe facility has applied dark hatch markings on the clear acrylic gate, Havok swam straight into the gate. According to\nfacility records, Havok was \u201cshut on main (pool), rammed gate to holding pool, re-opened rostrum wounds and new\nwound on upper left mandible.\u201d Results of the veterinarians' examination noted trauma sustained when he hit the gate\nincluded the presence of lacerations on the maxillary palate and the pre-existing wound on his rostrum re-opened and\nexpanded.\nHandling of all animals shall be done in a manner that does not cause physical harm. Foreign objects falling into exhibits\nfrom members of the public is an anticipated occurrence. The handling of the whales during the response to the foreign\nobject falling into the pool was not done as carefully as possible to ensure the safety of all the animals, including Havok\nwho had known vision impairment, a history of swimming into habitat walls, and a disposition for being \u201cspooked,\u201d per his\nbehavioral records and previous facility\u2019s medical records.\nCorrect from this date 10/15/21 forward."
