      "narrative": "On 6/30/17 it was discovered that two bats had died after being mistakenly left in a transport enclosure the week\nbefore, after a routine health check. The facility had already self-reported this incident to USDA, and corrective\nmeasures have already been taken to help prevent a recurrence.\nWhile reviewing the meeting minutes of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) regarding the bat\nincident, it was discovered that a ten year old Rhesus macaque monkey, with ID # 38380 was treated for a serious\ntoe injury on 2/8/17 after escaping from his primary enclosure. Staff reports that during a routine room cleaning\nprocedure, the two banks of enclosures in the room were left in close proximity to each other, so that another\nmacaque was able to reach across and unlatch # 38380's door. This latch would have normally been out of reach to\nthe animals. # 38380 then climbed on top of the enclosure of another macaque, which severely bit the escaped\nanimal's toe. # 38380 received prompt appropriate veterinary care, and the toe was amputated. Steps have been\ntaken to retrain employees to prevent a recurrence. # 38380 has fully recovered from the incident and ambulates\nnormally.\nFailure to ensure appropriate handling of animals can result in pain and distress, injury, and/or death. Handling of all\nanimals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that protects the animals from harm.\nThe facility must continue to ensure that steps are taken and standard operating procedures are developed and\nfollowed in order to minimize the risk of handling incidents such as these.\nThis was a focused inspection on bats on study at the facility, and one Rhesus macaque monkey.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nInspection occurred on 8/1/17 (Smith & Schnell) and 8/4/17 (continuation of inspection and exit interview - Smith).\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
