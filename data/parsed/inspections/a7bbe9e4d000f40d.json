The log sheet does not\nspecifically address daily observation of the animals; however, facility policy dictates that animals are to be\nobserved daily. Inspectors noted that there was no documentation present that addressed any veterinary care\nissues for this room, nor was there any documentation that the attending veterinarian had been contacted regarding\nan injured or ill rabbit. During an IACUC inspection on the 7 May 2014, a rabbit in the aforementioned room was\nfound to have a (cid:24)skin infection(cid:25) on the left side of the thorax. The attending veterinarian noted that the lesions\nappeared (cid:24)deep and penetrated through the dermis.(cid:25) He also noted that the skin appeared (cid:24)thickened and very\nhard(cid:25), which could indicate chronicity. The animal was subsequently euthanized due to a poor prognosis. All\nanimals must be observed daily and any veterinary care issues must be timely and accurately relayed to the\nattending veterinarian. The facility must insure that a program is place to insure that all injured animals receive\nprompt and adequate veterinary care.\n*****\nTo be corrected from this point forward.\nThis inspection focused on records review.
