The elephant (Ellie) that was outside the barn did notice the dog, which caused her to become\nalarmed and/or agitated. Ellie vocalized this alarm which then spread through the barn, resulting in the elephants in the\nbarn to react by vocalizing as well. Over the next several minutes the elephants continued to exhibit their excitement or\nalarm by vocalizing.\nAll facilities with elephants and other like wild animals are required to have and maintain a perimeter fence. The perimeter\nfence is necessary to both keep out unauthorized persons and animals from entering the facility but to also act as a\nsecondary fence to keep facility animals within the facility. The failure of the perimeter fence to keep unauthorized\npersons or animals from entering the facility can result in injury or death to the animals in the facility.\nThe licensee is required to have a perimeter fence that is well maintained and structurally sound and that prevents the\nentrance of unauthorized persons and animals.\nTo be corrected by November 20, 2023.
