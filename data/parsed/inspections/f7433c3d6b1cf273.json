They reported they were planning to go in that morning and look for it about the time we\narrived. The facility representative reported that the adult wolf had been last seen running along the back of the enclosure\nfence during afternoon feeding on Friday, 10/18. On Saturday, 10/19, and Sunday, 10/20, the facility representatives did\nnot observe the wolf during their daily observation checks. On Saturday, 10/19, the licensee determined Monday, 10/21,\nwould be safer to enter the wolf enclosure to look closer for the wolf as the enclosure doesn't have a lockout for the\nremaining wolf and they would need a staff member to assist watching the remaining wolf while another person looked.\nOn Monday morning, 10/21, the female wolf again was not seen and they still planned to look for it. During the inspection,\nthe facility representatives reported they entered the enclosure, observing dens and checking the enclosure fence. They\nreported they didn't find the wolf and also walked the entire enclosure fence and did not find any areas that indicated it got\nout. We also observed around the entire enclosure and did not find any areas that would indicate escape. However, the\nsecond wolf was unable to be located. The facility representatives noted that there was an area in the center of the\nenclosure that could not be observed thoroughly without proper equipment or clearing some of the brush. At the time of\nthe exit interview the licensee stated that 3 facility representatives were currently working on removing brush and looking\nfor the second wolf.\nThe lack of ability to confirm an animal's status with a daily observation of the animal doesn't guarantee if the animal is in\ngood condition. Correct by ensuring enclosures are equipped with the ability to observe animals and/or coordinate with\nemployees in a timely fashion to confirm that animals are in good health.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nSCOTT WELCH, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n"
