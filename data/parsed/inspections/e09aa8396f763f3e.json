      "narrative": "During the inspection, the following animals were identified in need of veterinary care:\n- A large cinnamon colored male hedgehog named Nepal, housed with a female in enclosure A6, was found with\nlesions behind both ears. The largest lesion behind the right ear was approximately 1 inch long extending towards\nthe neck. The lesion was reddened, bloody and moist with crusty dried blood along the edges. A small laceration\ncould be seen in the area closest to the ear. A smaller circular lesion approximately 0.5 inches in diameter could\nalso be seen behind the left ear. The lesion was reddened, bloody and moist. Upon closer examination, a large\namount of brown crusty material could be seen inside both the left and the right ear.\n- A grey and white female mini pig located in the barn, obtained on a breeding loan, was seen limping on her right\nhind leg. She had difficulty pivoting and seemed hesitant bearing weight on the right hind leg when turning. The pig\nwould consistently lift her right hind leg up, shifting her weight to her other limbs, when standing.\nThe conditions affecting these animals were not identified by the licensee, therefore the veterinarian had not been\ncontacted and care had not yet been provided. Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment\nand causes undue pain and distress in animals with conditions such as these listed here. The licensee must ensure\nthat daily observation of all animals occur in order to assess their health and well-being. Timely communication with\nthe attending veterinarian must occur to provide proper diagnosis and medical attention.\nTo be corrected by 11/15/19"

The bush baby enclosure did contain 2 Fleece pouches, a heating pad and straw for warmth.\nHowever, without an enclosed shelter, there is insufficient protection against the wind and the heat dissipates easily.\nAn IR gun revealed the temperature within the enclosure to be 37\u00b0 F at the time of inspection. Adequate shelter is\nnecessary to provide comfort and protection to the bush babies. A more substantial shelter providing better\nprotection from the wind and the cold should be provided. The outdoor housing for the bush babies must provide\nadequate shelter from the elements at all times including protection from the sun, rain, wind and any weather\nconditions that may occur.
