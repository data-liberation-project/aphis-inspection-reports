The owner was caring for the animals with no issues until, due to a\nfamily emergency, she was not able to provide daily care starting in January 2017. Another family member was\nasked to help care for the animals and was not reliable/trained in the day to day tasks of caring for the animals. The\nowner was not available to supervise frequently enough to ensure all daily animal care tasks were accomplished.\nThe owner noticed the issue and started a daily task checkoff list. Even with the list, items would be noted checked\noff but not 100% completed when the owner followed behind the caretaker. In order to ensure an acceptable level of\nhusbandry practices, to include temperature monitoring, feeding and watering, a sufficient number of adequately\ntrained employees shall be utilized under a knowledgeable, experienced supervisor. The situation has been\ncorrected prior to this inspection with the owner resuming daily care of the animals.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner."
