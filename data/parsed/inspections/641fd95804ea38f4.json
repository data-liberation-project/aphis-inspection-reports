The staff notified the attending veterinarian and the attending veterinarian performed a brief physical\nexamination, but could not determine the cause for the symptoms. The primate was kept under observation for the\nremainder of the day, until closing.

When the veterinarian arrived soon after on\nthat morning, she agreed that Paco was still \u201coff\u201d and sat down on the floor with the monkey in her lap. During this time,\nno further diagnostics were performed, nor were any medications or medical palliative care administered. Paco died in\nthe attending veterinarian\u2019s lap three hours later.
