In July 2019 after routine duties, an employee left the enclosure door open,\nfailing to ensure that the animals were safely contained. One flying squirrel escaped the enclosure, and was outside\nthe enclosure for an unknown duration of time. The animal was found during routine cleaning of the environment\nand replaced in its enclosure. The licensee stated that the animal appeared to be behaving normally at that time,\nbut was found dead the following day.\nEmployees that are involved in the care of animals must be adequately trained in order to maintain professionally\naccepted husbandry standards. Acceptable husbandry standards include handling and enclosure use that results in\nthe safe containment of the animals. In this instance, an inadequately trained employee failed to secure the animal's\nenclosure, which led to the escape of a flying squirrel. While outside of the enclosure, the animal did not have\nreliable access to food and water, and may have been subjected to additional exposures or stressors that were\nhazardous to its health. The animal passed away within 24 hours of being recovered.\nEmployees must be trained to ensure that the husbandry practices maintained at this facility are professionally\nacceptable, including the safe containment of animals within their enclosures.\nTo be corrected by October 21st, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted on site with the licensee."
