      "narrative": "***On May 10, 2015 the facility noted that a young male juvenile lion, Thor, was displaying inappropriate mentation\nand had limited mobility. According to the facility, the Attending Veterinarian was consulted regarding the condition\nof the juvenile and examined the animal on May 10, 2015 and June 19, 2015. The veterinarian assessed the animal\nvisually and produced a differential diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome. As of July 14, 2015 the veterinarian\nscheduled for additional diagnostics to include blood-work and a MRI. The facility management was unable to\nproduce records regarding the veterinary treatment plan for this animal. The records that were able to be produced\nindicated the date of the initial visual assessment by the veterinarian, the differential diagnosis of Dandy Walker\nsyndrome, and a plan for future diagnostics. Between the time when the facility first noted issues with the animal\nand the date of the inspection, the veterinarian had not taken any diagnostic samples from the animal to support a\ndiagnosis. Limited records were able to be produced regarding the care of the animals at Living Treasures Animal\nPark. During the inspection on July 14, 2015 the juvenile lion was housed in the back holding area of the enclosure\nand remained in a resting position refusing to rise after being prompted with food. The facility offered a video\nrecording as a representation of the juvenile(cid:25)s movement. In this recording the animal appeared to be stiff on all four\nlimbs and reluctant to move, even for short distances. On July 15, 2015 the juvenile was in the main enclosure with\nhis mother, the animal remained in a laying position and there were no apparent signs of injury during our\nobservation. The facility representatives indicated that the juvenile was still very stiff in his movements, but had\nshowed interest in playing with his mother immediately after his release into the main enclosure. He had a\nroughened hair coat that had a moderate amount of mud along his back and on all four legs consistent with the\nanimal(cid:25)'s movement around or through the mud within the enclosure. The documented diet for this animal includes\n7lbs. of mixed red meat and poultry and to be supplemented with Platinum Performance: Exotic Wellness and\nPerformance Formula. During conversation with the facility management, they stated this animal refuses to eat the\nbones within the meat fed. This current feeding program provides very little calcium and other nutrients for the\ngrowing animal. Upon inspection of the supplement there was a white film on the surface and the supplement was\nheavily caked providing clear evidence that the supplement was not being consistently used. After speaking with the\nveterinarian regarding the care of this animal, her initial assessment of the inappropriate mentation was made on\nMay 4, 2015. In the record for that date she suspected neurologic disease, she recommended deworming and\nantihistamine therapy. She completed a second visual assessment on June 19, 2015, when she noted weight loss\nand recommended tranquilization for a hands on physical exam and further diagnostics. On the second visual\nassessment, the veterinarian'(cid:25)s differential diagnoses were Dandy-Walker syndrome, vestibular disease or\nincomplete fusion of cervical vertebra. According to the attending veterinarian, a dietary cause was not explored\nbecause the adults were receiving the same diet and showed no signs of illness. The failure to understand that\nyoung, growing large carnivores may have additional nutritional needs show a clear lack of adequate training and\nveterinary care. Metabolic Bone Disease is a common disease of young big cats. This disease stems from\ninadequate levels of calcium in the diet. During early development the animal will need an increased level of\ncalcium in the diet to allow for bone growth. At the time of the inspection there was no evidence that the diet has the\nproper nutritive values to maintain the animal in good health. The deficiency of adequate nutrition may have caused\nthis animal severe animal welfare concerns. The length in time to get diagnostic information about the lion(cid:25)'s\ncondition and the lack of attention to investigate the nutritional value of the lion(cid:25)'s diet illustrate that appropriate\nmethods were not taken to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by, (1) providing a fully nutritious and\nwholesome diet, (2) having an experienced and knowledgeable veterinarian examine, diagnostic, and treat the lion,\n(3) have a written treatment plan available for inspection. Correct by 6 p.m.7/17/15. At the time of exit interview, the\nfacility has started putting calcium supplements in the food, but has not developed a treatment program for the\nanimal. Thor was transported to another U.S.D.A licensed facility on 7/17/15.\n***A female Timber Wolf was observed to have irritated areas on the external margins of both of her ears.\nApproximately one inch along the edges and back of the ears is both thickened, crusted over and had several spots\nwhere blood is apparent. The affected areas are missing hair and the underlying skin is black to grey in color. These\nchanges are commonly associated with chronic injury to the skin. The problem was exacerbated by the flies which\nwere noted to be on the affected areas causing the wolf to shake her head and rub her ears on the rocks and\nvegetation within the enclosure. The facility representative indicated that the areas were being treated using\nfly-spray to decrease irritation and prevent future rubbing and scratching of the area. However; during the\ninspection, the facility was not able to produce any documentation to support a proper diagnosis or treatment has\nbeen made by the attending veterinarian. After discussion with the attending veterinarian, it was determined that\napproximately one month prior to inspection the facility had been consulted to treat the Timber Wolves for a heavy\nmite infestation. This infestation had become recurrent in warmer weathers and the veterinarian had documented\nthe need for multiple treatments. Correct by 7/17/15 by 6 p.m.\n***An adult female Patas monkey was noted to be non-weight bearing on the front left limb. The left shoulder and\narm had moderate muscle loss. The facility indicated that the animal had been treated by a veterinarian and\ndiagnosed with an elbow injury. The animal was put into a cast and prescribed pain management at the time of\ninjury. After the cast was removed no further pain management was provided. A veterinarian has not been\nconsulted for further assessment or treatment of this animal'(cid:25)s condition and no documentation was provided to\nsupport any form of diagnosis or treatment. After discussion with the Attending Veterinarian, it was determined that\nthe animal was under the care and custody of the veterinarian at the time of the arm injury. The animal was being\ntreated at the veterinary clinic for heavy fenbendazole resistant parasite infestation. During restraint of the animal for\ntreatment, the arm was fractured. During the Attending Veterinarian visit on July 15, 2015 further deworming of the\nanimal and suggested enrichment based physical therapy to increase the functionality of the arm. Correct by having\nthe animal evaluated by a knowledgeable, licensed veterinarian, developing a long-term treatment plan, and\nmonitoring the animal(cid:25)'s development over time. Correct by 7/17/15 by 6 p.m.\n***An adult llama in the camelid enclosure was observed to have a white opacity in the left eye. When asked, the\nfacility representative had not noticed the issue or started any treatment with the eye. The opacity in the eye of the\nllama could cause unnecessary discomfort, blindness or a secondary infection. This abnormality could be\nsecondary to an underlying condition with the eye or secondary age related change. After the Attending\nVeterinarian examined the animal it was determined that the injury was an old corneal scar. She determined no\ntreatment was needed at this time and the prognosis of the animal was good. Correct by documenting the\nveterinarian(cid:25)s evaluation of the abnormality. Correct by 7/17/15.\n***An adult male Aoudad was noted to have a subcutaneous mass over his left shoulder. The mass did not appear\nto cause the animal immediate discomfort and did not appear to be impacting or limiting his mobility. When asked,\nthe facility representative indicated that the mass was caused by an old injury that had been previously discussed\nwith the veterinarian. Records were not provided for the facility documenting that the issue had been addressed by\nthe veterinarian. After discussion with the Attending Veterinarian the injury was confirmed. The veterinarian\nindicated that the injury had abscessed and had ruptured prior to her observation. The injury may have\nre-abscessed, leading to the mass appearance on the animal'(cid:25)s side. After a second examination by the Attending\nVeterinarian on July 15, 2015 it was determined that the wound had re-abscessed and encapsulated. The mass\nwould have to be removed to properly heal the injury. The mass on the adult Aoudad could be a sign of secondary\ninfection or other disease which could lead to pain or distress for the animal. This mass should be evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian and a treatment plan created to ensure the animal(cid:25)s well-being. Correct by 7/20/15.\nThe veterinary care items described here have significant impact to animal welfare and may lead to secondary\ndisease or worsening of the original condition. A licensed and knowledgeable veterinarian must be consulted to\nevaluate, diagnose, and treat the current veterinary care issues. It is the facilities responsibility to ensure that\ndocumentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment is maintained and made available for review by APHIS\nofficials. The veterinary care items described here have significant impact to animal welfare and may lead to\nsecondary disease or worsening of the original condition. A licensed and knowledgeable veterinarian must be\nconsulted to evaluate, diagnose, and treat the current veterinary care issues."

The animal was under full care\nand custody of the Attending Veterinarian at the time of the incident. This incident happened at the Attending\nVeterinarian'(cid:25)s clinic. The animal was deemed to be an inappropriate anesthetic candidate due to age and poor\nhealth condition at the time of the diagnosis and initiation of treatment. During the restraint of the animal by the\nAttending Veterinarian and her staff the animal'(cid:25)s arm was fractured. The veterinarian placed the animal(cid:25)'s arm in a\nsling and gave it initial pain management. The animal had a parasitic infection and was treated.

The birds and nest create conditions in which disease could be promoted or\nspread amongst the animals. The birds and nests were in several enclosures in which they could behaviorally affect\nthe animals. Several animals thought the facility have a prey drive as a part of their normal behaviors and may be\nover stimulated by the presence of the birds.

  "narrative": "2.40(b)(2)           DIRECT\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\n***On May 10, 2015 the facility noted that a young male juvenile lion, Thor, was displaying inappropriate mentation\nand had limited mobility.  According to the facility, the Attending Veterinarian was consulted regarding the condition\nof the juvenile and examined the animal on May 10, 2015 and June 19, 2015. The veterinarian assessed the animal\nvisually and produced a differential diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome.  As of July 14, 2015 the veterinarian\nscheduled for additional diagnostics to include blood-work and a MRI. The facility management was unable to\nproduce records regarding the veterinary treatment plan for this animal. The records that were able to be produced\nindicated the date of the initial visual assessment by the veterinarian, the differential diagnosis of Dandy Walker\nsyndrome, and a plan for future diagnostics. Between the time when the facility first noted issues with the animal\nand the date of the inspection, the veterinarian had not taken any diagnostic samples from the animal to support a\ndiagnosis. Limited records were able to be produced regarding the care of the animals at Living Treasures Animal\nPark. During the inspection on July 14, 2015 the juvenile lion was housed in the back holding area of the enclosure\nand remained in a resting position refusing to rise after being prompted with food. The facility offered a video\nrecording as a representation of the juvenile(cid:25)s movement. In this recording the animal appeared to be stiff on all four\nlimbs and reluctant to move, even for short distances. On July 15, 2015 the juvenile was in the main enclosure with\nhis mother, the animal remained in a laying position and there were no apparent signs of injury during our\nobservation. The facility representatives indicated that the juvenile was still very stiff in his movements, but had\nshowed interest in playing with his mother immediately after his release into the main enclosure. He had a\nroughened hair coat that had a moderate amount of mud along his back and on all four legs consistent with the\nanimal(cid:25)'s movement around or through the mud within the enclosure. The documented diet for this animal includes\n7lbs. of mixed red meat and poultry and to be supplemented with Platinum Performance: Exotic Wellness and\nPerformance Formula. During conversation with the facility management, they stated this animal refuses to eat the\nbones within the meat fed. This current feeding program provides very little calcium and other nutrients for the\ngrowing animal. Upon inspection of the supplement there was a white film on the surface and the supplement was\nheavily caked providing clear evidence that the supplement was not being consistently used. After speaking with the\nveterinarian regarding the care of this animal, her initial assessment of the inappropriate mentation was made on\nMay 4, 2015. In the record for that date she suspected neurologic disease, she recommended deworming and\nantihistamine therapy. She completed a second visual assessment on June 19, 2015, when she noted weight loss\nand recommended tranquilization for a hands on physical exam and further diagnostics. On the second visual\n\nassessment, the veterinarian'(cid:25)s differential diagnoses were Dandy-Walker syndrome, vestibular disease or\nincomplete fusion of cervical vertebra. According to the attending veterinarian, a dietary cause was not explored\nbecause the adults were receiving the same diet and showed no signs of illness. The failure to understand that\nyoung, growing large carnivores may have additional nutritional needs show a clear lack of adequate training and\nveterinary care. Metabolic Bone Disease is a common disease of young big cats. This disease stems from\ninadequate levels of calcium in the diet.  During early development the animal will need an increased level of\ncalcium in the diet to allow for bone growth. At the time of the inspection there was no evidence that the diet has the\nproper nutritive values to maintain the animal in good health. The deficiency of adequate nutrition may have caused\nthis animal severe animal welfare concerns. The length in time to get diagnostic information about the lion(cid:25)'s\ncondition and the lack of attention to investigate the nutritional value of the lion(cid:25)'s diet illustrate that appropriate\nmethods were not taken to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by, (1) providing a fully nutritious and\nwholesome diet, (2) having an experienced and knowledgeable veterinarian examine, diagnostic, and treat the lion,\n(3) have a written treatment plan available for inspection. Correct by 6 p.m.7/17/15.  At the time of exit interview, the\nfacility has started putting calcium supplements in the food, but has not developed a treatment program for the\nanimal. Thor was transported to another U.S.D.A licensed facility on 7/17/15.\n***A female Timber Wolf was observed to have irritated areas on the external margins of both of her ears.\nApproximately one inch along the edges and back of the ears is both thickened, crusted over and had several spots\nwhere blood is apparent. The affected areas are missing hair and the underlying skin is black to grey in color. These\nchanges are commonly associated with chronic injury to the skin. The problem was exacerbated by the flies which\nwere noted to be on the affected areas causing the wolf to shake her head and rub her ears on the rocks and\nvegetation within the enclosure. The facility representative indicated that the areas were being treated using\nfly-spray to decrease irritation and prevent future rubbing and scratching of the area.  However; during the\ninspection, the facility was not able to produce any documentation to support a proper diagnosis or treatment has\nbeen made by the attending veterinarian. After discussion with the attending veterinarian, it was determined that\napproximately one month prior to inspection the facility had been consulted to treat the Timber Wolves for a heavy\nmite infestation. This infestation had become recurrent in warmer weathers and the veterinarian had documented\nthe need for multiple treatments. Correct by 7/17/15 by 6 p.m.\n***An adult female Patas monkey was noted to be non-weight bearing on the front left limb. The left shoulder and\narm had moderate muscle loss.  The facility indicated that the animal had been treated by a veterinarian and\ndiagnosed with an elbow injury. The animal was put into a cast and prescribed pain management at the time of\ninjury. After the cast was removed no further pain management was provided. A veterinarian has not been\nconsulted for further assessment or treatment of this animal'(cid:25)s condition and no documentation was provided to\nsupport any form of diagnosis or treatment. After discussion with the Attending Veterinarian, it was determined that\nthe animal was under the care and custody of the veterinarian at the time of the arm injury. The animal was being\ntreated at the veterinary clinic for heavy fenbendazole resistant parasite infestation. During restraint of the animal for\ntreatment, the arm was fractured. During the Attending Veterinarian visit on July 15, 2015 further deworming of the\nanimal and suggested enrichment based physical therapy to increase the functionality of the arm. Correct by having\nthe animal evaluated by a knowledgeable, licensed veterinarian, developing a long-term treatment plan, and\nmonitoring the animal(cid:25)'s development over time. Correct by 7/17/15 by 6 p.m.\n\n***An adult llama in the camelid enclosure was observed to have a white opacity in the left eye. When asked, the\nfacility representative had not noticed the issue or started any treatment with the eye.  The opacity in the eye of the\nllama could cause unnecessary discomfort, blindness or a secondary infection. This abnormality could be\nsecondary to an underlying condition with the eye or secondary age related change.  After the Attending\nVeterinarian examined the animal it was determined that the injury was an old corneal scar. She determined no\ntreatment was needed at this time and the prognosis of the animal was good. Correct by documenting the\nveterinarian(cid:25)s evaluation of the abnormality. Correct by 7/17/15.\n***An adult male Aoudad was noted to have a subcutaneous mass over his left shoulder.  The mass did not appear\nto cause the animal immediate discomfort and did not appear to be impacting or limiting his mobility. When asked,\nthe facility representative indicated that the mass was caused by an old injury that had been previously discussed\nwith the veterinarian. Records were not provided for the facility documenting that the issue had been addressed by\nthe veterinarian. After discussion with the Attending Veterinarian the injury was confirmed. The veterinarian\nindicated that the injury had abscessed and had ruptured prior to her observation. The injury may have\nre-abscessed, leading to the mass appearance on the animal'(cid:25)s side. After a second examination by the Attending\nVeterinarian on July 15, 2015 it was determined that the wound had re-abscessed and encapsulated. The mass\nwould have to be removed to properly heal the injury. The mass on the adult Aoudad could be a sign of secondary\ninfection or other disease which could lead to pain or distress for the animal. This mass should be evaluated by a\nlicensed veterinarian and a treatment plan created to ensure the animal(cid:25)s well-being. Correct by 7/20/15. \nThe veterinary care items described here have significant impact to animal welfare and may lead to secondary\ndisease or worsening of the original condition. A licensed and knowledgeable veterinarian must be consulted to\nevaluate, diagnose, and treat the current veterinary care issues.   It is the facilities responsibility to ensure that\ndocumentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment is maintained and made available for review by APHIS\nofficials. The veterinary care items described here have significant impact to animal welfare and may lead to\nsecondary disease or worsening of the original condition. A licensed and knowledgeable veterinarian must be\nconsulted to evaluate, diagnose, and treat the current veterinary care issues. \n2.40(b)(3)\nATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).\nOn the inspection conducted on July 14, 2015, inspectors identified a llama with an eye abnormality (listed in\n2.40(b)(2) above).  When the issue was brought to the attention of the facility representatives, they stated that they\nhad not previously identified or treated this animal for any eye issues.  Inspectors were able to speak to the\nattending veterinarian about this issue on July 15, 2015.  The veterinarian confirmed that she had not been\ncontacted by the facility about the llamas(cid:25) eye issues and that she was not aware of any treatment that could have\nbeen provided for the animal.   Observation must be performed on a daily basis to identify and assess all health\nissues with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to a veterinarian so as to provide frequent and\ntimely information on any and all health issues identified during daily observations. By not identifying and reporting\n\nthe abnormal signs displayed by the llama, the animal remained untreated, which could have caused the animal\nunnecessary pain and discomfort. Correct by contacting a veterinarian about the llama(cid:25)s condition. Furthermore,\nensure all animals are adequately observed daily basis to ensure that all health issues have been properly identified\nand reported to a veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner. Correct by 7/17/15.\n2.75(b)(1)\nRECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.\nThe facility failed to keep adequate records of acquisition and disposition of the animals. There were several\nanimals that have been transferred to other facilities or that have died or been euthanized after care of the\nveterinarian, that were unaccounted for on the acquisition and disposition records. Records are important for\ntraceability of the animals to ensure the safety, health and well-being of the animals. Each dealer or exhibitor shall\nfully and correctly disclose information for animals owned, held or otherwise acquired, held in possession of or\ncontrol of, or which is transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by the exhibitor. The records shall\ninclude any offspring born of any animal while in the possession or control. Correct by ensuring that all animals on\nthe premise are properly documented and accounted for, any new additions to the facility are documented at the\ntime of acquisition, all animals sold or given away are documented with all appropriate information and that all\nappropriate mortality records are maintained. Correct by: 7/20/15.\n2.131(b)(1)\nHANDLING OF ANIMALS.\nOn March 9, 2015 during an examination and treatment of the Adult Female Patas Monkey, Sera, for a parasitic\ninfection (whipworm, roundworm and baylisascaris) the animal'(cid:25)s arm was fractured. The animal was under full care\nand custody of the Attending Veterinarian at the time of the incident. This incident happened at the Attending\nVeterinarian'(cid:25)s clinic. The animal was deemed to be an inappropriate anesthetic candidate due to age and poor\nhealth condition at the time of the diagnosis and initiation of treatment. During the restraint of the animal by the\nAttending Veterinarian and her staff the animal'(cid:25)s arm was fractured. The veterinarian placed the animal(cid:25)'s arm in a\nsling and gave it initial pain management.  The animal had a parasitic infection and was treated. Her condition was\nstabilized before returning to the facility. The animal received no further pain management and there were no\nrecords of the rehabilitation plan or any further assessments by the Attending Veterinarian. At the time of the\ninspection the animal continued to have very limited use of the arm and there was a moderate atrophy of the muscle\nin the arm and shoulder. Inappropriate handling of the animal has caused harm and unnecessary pain and distress.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Correct by 7/17/15.\n2.131(d)(2)\nHANDLING OF ANIMALS.\nThe facility has a number of enclosures which promote direct interaction between guests and the animals on exhibit,\n\nsuch as feeding and petting. APHIS inspectors observed multiple times on July 13th and 14th where there were\nnone or an insufficient number of staff present to supervise human-animal interactions. On inspection, customers\nwere seen interacting with animals with limited to no supervision by staff. For the safety of the guests as well as the\nanimals a responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times\nduring periods of public contact.  With the number of enclosures and the current park flow, there must be a sufficient\nnumber of employees within an adequate distance to ensure the safety of the guests and animals. Correct by\n8/17/15.\n3.56(b)\nSANITATION. \nAccording to facility representatives, the two outdoor primary enclosures housing a total of 16 rabbits were (cid:28)washed\ndaily with soap and water(cid:29). Facility representatives confirmed that a disinfectant was not being used in the rabbit\nenclosures. Furthermore, the rabbit shelter housing 14 rabbits has significant chew damage around the edges of the\nstructure. Surfaces that have significant chew damage cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and should be\nrepaired or replaced to facilitate adequate sanitation. Failure to properly clean and sanitize the primary enclosures\ncan allow bacteria to proliferate and therefore poses a disease risk to the animals contained therein.  Correct by\nsanitizing the primary enclosure in accordance with the methods allowed in 3.56(b)(3) and maintain surfaces to\nallow for adequate sanitization.  Correct by 7/20/2015.\n3.58(a)\nCLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION. \nTwo adult rabbits are housed with multiple guinea fowl in an outdoor primary enclosure together. According to\nfacility representatives, the rabbits were placed in the guinea fowl enclosure to separate the larger rabbits from the\nsmaller rabbits. Rabbits are a prey species and can become easily stressed when housed with other species.\nGuinea fowl can be territorial and may peck/injury the rabbits. On inspection, the rabbits did not appear stressed by\nthe guinea fowl and no harmful interactions between the two species were seen. Rabbits must not be housed in the\nsame primary enclosure with another species. Correct by 7/17/15, these animals have been separated at the time of\nexit.\n3.75(c)(1)(1)\nHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. \nThe black metal container holding the water bottle for the indoor section of the spider monkey and ring tailed lemur\nenclosure has excessive rust.  Both primates can come into direct contact with the rusty container.  Surfaces with\nan excessive amount of rust can affect the structural strength and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of\nthe enclosures. Correct this by ensuring that all rusted surfaces in direct contact with the non-human primates are\nresurfaced, repaired, or replaced and that all surfaces are constructed and maintained in a manner that allows them\nto be readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 7/21/15, the container holding the water bottle has been replaced at\n\nthe time of exit.\n3.77(c)\nSHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES. \nThe sheltered enclosure containing the Ring-Tailed Lemur and Spider Monkey had no working light in the indoor\nsection of the enclosure. The light bulb had recently stop working according to staff.  This area had a build-up of\nfeces in the corner of the enclosure as well as buildup on the walls of the enclosure. The lack of lighting in this\nenclosure creates conditions that make cleaning the enclosure difficult. The inspectors had to use their flashlights to\nvisually inspect the area. The lack of light prevents the animals and facility to be properly inspected. Correct by\nensuring the sheltered part of the enclosure must be lighted well enough to permit routine inspection, cleaning and\nobservation of the non-human primates. Correct by 7/18/15.\n3.80(a)(2)(1)\nPRIMARY ENCLOSURES.  \nThe enclosure with two adult Patas monkeys had several exposed metal nails from a deteriorating wood ladder. The\nedges of the nails appear sharp. No cuts or injuries were observed on the animals. Sharp points or jagged edges\ncould cause injury and pain to an animal. Exposed nails are also more likely to break off and be eaten. All housing\nfacilities must have no sharp points or edges to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 7/18/2015, the nails were\nremoved from the enclosure at the time of the exit.\n3.81\nENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.\nThe facility failed to provide an adequate plan for environmental enhancement to promote the psychological\nwell-being of the non-human primates. The current environmental enhancement plan does not considered species\nspecific differences. Non-human primates can have drastically different enrichment needs among species. An\nenrichment program without accounting for specific species needs is inadequate. Without adequate enrichment,\nnon-human primates will display negative behaviors. These may lead to destructive actions and activities that may\ncause harm or injury to the individual animal or animals which are co-housed. The environmental enrichment plan\nshall include specific provisions to address the social needs of non-human primates. The plan shall also include\nenvironmental enrichment and shall consider species differences. The plan should also take into consideration the\ninstructions of the attending veterinarian. Correct by 7/18/15.\n3.84(a)\nCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL. \nAll of the enclosures with non-human primates (Ring Tailed Lemurs, Spider monkey, Patas monkeys, and\nMarmoset monkeys) have wooden perches and surfaces that are not impervious to water and have a build-up of\n\nbrown to black debris. The indoor section of the enclosure with the spider monkey and ring tailed lemur has a corner\nwith an excessive amount of feces and brown debris adhered to the walls. Additionally, there are worn areas from\nchewing from previous animals and general use.  The chewed and damaged wood does not allow the surface to be\nreadily cleaned or sanitized. The feces and organic material in the enclosures can function as a suitable\nenvironment for bacteria to grow and can serve as an opportunity of infection for the animals in the enclosure. \nProper cleaning removes all sources that promote bacteria growth. Correct by cleaning all areas of the enclosures\nas often as necessary to prevent accumulation of organic material and other excreta. Additionally, remove or\nreplace worn surfaces that cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized.  Correct by 7/30/15.\n3.84(b)(3)\nCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL. \nAll hard surfaces of the primary enclosure to include the wire mesh, floors, walls, fixtures and food/water\nreceptacles for the non-human primates are not currently being properly cleaned and sanitized in accordance with\naccepted husbandry practices.  At today(cid:25)'s inspection, the facility representatives confirmed that they are not\ncurrently using a detergent solution in conjunction with a disinfectant or any other approved cleaning and\nsanitization method.  Improper cleaning and sanitization does not effectively kill bacteria and fungal growth and\nexposes the animals to potential disease hazards.  The facility must use approved methods to clean and sanitize all\nsolid surfaces within all enclosures housing non-human primates.  These methods include the following; live stream\npressure, washing with hot water (at least 180 degrees) and soap or detergent, use of an appropriate detergent and\ndisinfectant solutions, or by using a combination detergent/disinfectant product that accomplishes the same\npurpose.  All organic material and mineral deposit build up must be removed, followed by proper sanitization and a\nclean water rinse.  Correct by: 7/30/15\n3.84(d)\nCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL. \nThroughout the facility there were several enclosures that had one or more bird nests in the ceiling or roof of\nnon-human primate enclosures. The bird nests were hanging through the mesh wires into the enclosures and often\nthe birds were present in or around the enclosure. The birds and nest create conditions in which disease could be\npromoted or spread amongst the animals. The birds and nests in the enclosures could also behaviorally affect and\nstress of the animals. Furthermore, throughout the facility there were an excessive amount of flies. The enclosures\nwith the Patas monkeys were noticed to have dozens of flies around the bottom of the enclosure where there was\nfood present from public feeding. Flies are known to transmit disease and promote insanitary conditions. Currently,\nthe facility uses fly traps, but it is not effective controlling the fly infestation at this facility. The facility shall have a\nsafe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, avian and mammalian pests. Correct by 7/22/15.\n3.125(a)\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.\n\nSeveral enclosures throughout the facility had building issues that could potentially lead to injury of the animals. \n***The enclosures of the alpacas, llamas, camels, sheep, goats and bulls had damaged aluminum or tin siding that\nhad sharp edges. The corners of the tin roof of the camelid enclosure were not damaged, however sharp edges\nwere present. These edges could cause a significant cut or other injury to the animals.\n*** The primary enclosure fence for the Watusi and Brahma bulls had been damaged by the animals. The sharp and\npointed edges of the fence were curled out toward the animal enclosure. These edges created a potential hazard for\nthe animals in that enclosure. Furthermore, the curling fence created a gap between the ground and bottom of the\nfence that the animals may get their head or leg caught in.\n***The Patagonian Cavy enclosure used a fine mesh wire to contain the animals. At the corners of the enclosure as\nwell as in areas in which multiple sections of the mesh wire were jointed together the wire had curled toward the\nenclosure and several sharp edges of the wire was exposed. New mulch had been added to the enclosure;\nhowever, the cavies dug around the fence line and re-exposed multiple sections of the mesh wiring. The loose wire\nmesh could easily get caught around a leg and cause severe injury and distress to an animal.\n***The young African crested porcupine had several exposed screws in the doors of the enclosure. A repair had\nbeen made to the outside of the doors of the enclosure which left the sharp points of multiple screws exposed that\npointed inside the enclosure. There was also a single screw that was protruding from the flooring of the enclosure\napproximately 1.5 inches. The sharp side of the screw was contained within the wood. The animal was observed\nchewing on the area around the exposed screws. No injuries were seen on the animal.\n***The peccary enclosure had several areas of exposed large gauge mesh wire on the ground. The facility placed\nthe wire to keep the animals from digging under the fencing. The mesh wire sections that were exposed were raised\nin several areas creating conditions that could not only lacerate the animals but could entrap or injure limbs. \nThe damaged areas of these enclosures provide sharp edges in which could cause injury to exposed animals.\nThese injuries could cause superficial or deep wounds. The facility must be constructed of such material to protect\nthe animals from injury. Correct by 7/24/15. The cavy wire mesh has been removed from the enclosure. The screws\nfrom the young African crested porcupine enclosure have been removed.\n3.127(b)\nFACILITIES, OUTDOOR. \nThe enclosure housing the several camelids failed to provide adequate protection from inclement weather observed\non 7/13/2015. During the inspection the animals in this enclosure were huddled under the barn in an attempt to\nescape the heavy rains. The space provided under the roof was not large enough to provide enough shelter and or\nprotection from the rain for all of the animals within the enclosure. The animals exposed to the inclement weather\nwere seen making several attempts to find shelter in the limited available space. Several of the animals were\nobserved laying in areas that were wet or area where they were directly being rained on. Exposure to inclement\nweather increases the risk of respiratory illness or several other illnesses that can directly affect the animal'(cid:25)s health\nand well-being. The limited space during inclement weather also causes discomfort for the animals. An adequate\namount of natural or artificial shelter must be provided for all animals at all times while being housed in outdoor\n\nenclosures. Correct by 7/30/15.\n3.129(a)           DIRECT\nFEEDING.    \nThor, a juvenile lion approximately 1 year of age, is documented to be receiving 7 lbs. of meat with a platinum\nperformance supplement on a daily basis.  The facility representatives stated that the meat is a mixture of poultry\nwith the bone and red meat.  The facility is currently using a food program that provides a variety of frozen meats on\na weekly basis.  These meats were observed in the food preparation area in several freezers and in a bucket setting\nout to thaw. A predominate amount of the chicken was observed to be packaged without the bone present in the\nmeat.  A smaller portion of the chicken appeared to be packaged with the bone present in the meat.  The platinum\nperformance supplement was also located in the food preparation area.  Once the supplement was opened, there\nwas a white mold like substance present over the top layer of the contents.  The facility representative used a\nplastic scoop to mix up the supplement. At that time it was apparent that the supplement had hardened in the\ncontainer.  Based on the white mold like substance and the hardening of the supplement, it is apparent that this\nproduct has not been used recently or in a consistent manner. Improper dietary practices can be detrimental to the\nanimal(cid:25)'s health and well-being.  In some cases, animals can start to show clear signs and symptoms of metabolic\ndiseases directly related to the lack of wholesome, palatable and nutritive value of their diet. This facility must have\nan appropriate dietary program for all species of animals within the facility to ensure all animals are maintained in\ngood health.  The diet shall be prepared with consideration of the age, species, condition, size and type of the\nanimals.  Once appropriate diets are established for each species, all portions of the diet must be followed and\nre-evaluated as needed to ensure that all animals are maintained with good body condition and in good health. The\nfacility is currently using a large plastic bucket without a lid for the daily thawing of meat.  Thawing meat in an\nuncontrolled environment without proper cooling promotes unhealthy and potentially dangerous bacteria growth. \nProfessionally accepted practices for thawing meat includes a stage of refrigeration to slowly and safely thaw the\nfrozen meat prior to feeding.  This facility must use appropriate methods to safely thaw frozen meat. Correct by\n7/17/15 for giving an adequate supplement and using appropriate methods to thaw meat; correct by 7/22/15 for\ndeveloping an appropriate dietary program for all animals.\n3.130\nWATERING.  \n***The only water receptacle for the dingo enclosure was observed to have dead insects floating on the top of the\nwater.  Upon further examination, there appeared to be a moderate to heavy accumulation of green algae growth at\nthe bottom of the water receptacle.  \n***The only water source for seven fallow deer had a moderate accumulation of green algae growth adhered to\none-third of the receptacle.    \n***The bear enclosure, housing 2 juvenile and 2 adults, was observed to have one pipe hanging from the top of the\nenclosure that provides a constant stream of potable water into the enclosure.  This pipe is located directly over the\n\nmiddle of a large pool and is the only fresh water source for this enclosure. The water in the pool was brown and\nhad several leaves and debris in the water. The facility representatives confirmed that the pool collects the water at\nthe bottom is not drained and cleaned every day on a consistent basis, but is drained several times a week.  The\nbears must get into the pool and drink directly from the water coming down from the pipe to drink fresh water on a\ncontinuous basis.\nAll animals must be provided potable water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals.  The\nfrequency at which water is provided must take in consideration the age, species, condition, size and type of animal.\n In addition, all water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary at all times. Correct by 7/17/15.\n3.131(d)\nSANITATION.   \nThroughout the wolf and hoof stock enclosures there were several enclosures that had one or more bird nests in the\nceiling or roof.
