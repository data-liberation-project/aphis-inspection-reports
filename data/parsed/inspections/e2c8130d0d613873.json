Because this dog kept\nescaping his enclosures, the building, and the premises, he was placed in a more secure indoor enclosure at night,\nbut tethered during the day. He has also been off tether when people were around to supervise him.\nBecause temporary tethering is prohibited for use as a primary enclosure unless approval is obtained from APHIS,\nthis approval should be obtained, or use a different primary enclosure for daytime.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representative.\nTo be corrected by 1-30-15."
