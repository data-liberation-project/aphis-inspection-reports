      "narrative": "-An adult female Maltese (0A02492440) was observed with matting of her fur from approximately the midpoint of the\nback towards her tail and down her back legs. This area of hair appeared to have patchy hair loss as well. On\ncloser observation there were live fleas observed on the dog and some of the skin appeared red and scaly.\n-An adult female Maltese (037890890) had thin hair and red skin lesion on her rear legs. There were sections of\nskin along both rear legs of the dog below her knees, that appeared inflamed, bright red and moist. The fur in this\nregion of the skin lesions also appeared wet. A live flea was observed on the dog.\n-An adult male Dachshund (0A02093065) had a dental condition and hair loss. The the dog had a build up of\nyellowish brown to dark brown material on its teeth. This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the\ncheek teeth and extended into the gumline. The gums were reddened along some of these teeth. There was a\nhorizontal line of greyish white material noted in the area of the gum tissue above some of the upper cheek teeth on\nboth sides of the mouth. This dog also had hair loss around the base of the tail extending down the back of the\ndog's legs and tail. A few small to pinpoint sized scab-like and red circular lesions were observed on the exposed\nskin which also appeared flakey.\n-An adult male Schnauzer (0A02624979) had matting of his hair coat located generally across his entire body. The\nmats varied in size. Some of the mats were tightly adhered to the skin. The hair also appeared thinner with the\ndog's skin easily visible on the animal's chest and legs.\nThe red skin lesions, scab-like lesions and scaly skin can indicate an infection or other veterinary medical condition\nthat could cause discomfort. Matting in dogs can increase the risk of skin sores and can cause discomfort. The\nabnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This can be\npainful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal.\nThe licensee was not aware of the dog's with the skin lesions or the dog with the dental condition. No treatment was\ncurrently being given to these dogs for their skin conditions. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian regarding\nthe conditions of adult female Maltese dogs (0A02492440) and (037890890) and must have the male Dachshund\n(0A02093065) examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and\nappropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must ensure male Schnauzer (0A02624979)\nis groomed and must establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs. The licensee must develop and\nestablish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the\nfacility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by:\nNovember 1, 2017"

      "narrative": "-An adult large breed dog was housed in an outdoor enclosure without any bedding material provided inside the\nshelter unit. According to the licensee, there was no bedding material in the shelter unit overnight. According to the\nNational Weather Service the high temperature in the area for the past 24 hours from the time of inspection was\nrecorded at 57 degrees Fahrenheit and the low temperature was recorded at 38 degrees Fahrenheit. The cold\ntemperature and lack of bedding increase the risk of negative health impacts on the dog. When the temperatures\ndrop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit all the animals must be provided with bedding. When the temperature drops\nbelow 35 degrees Fahrenheit all the animals must be provided with more bedding, enough so that the animals can\nburrow down into the bedding to stay warm. The licensee was verbally instructed to provide bedding to the shelter\nof the affected dog as required by this regulation from this point forward on October 25, 2017."
