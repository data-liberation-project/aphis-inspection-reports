The area of hair loss was approximately 1 inch in diameter.\n-In the 5th pen, stack 2A, there was a red male adult guinea pig housed with 2 other guinea pigs with chronic thickening of\nthe skin of the right ear with some patches of thickening on the left ear.\n-In the 5th pen, stack 8B, there was a red and white adult guinea pig housed with 4 other guinea pigs with hair loss and\nreddened skin on the bridge of the nose approximately 1/2 inch in diameter.\nIn five of the pens and beneath one rack, there were 4 skeletons, 1 carcass, and 1 partial disintegrated carcass with hair\nand some skin remaining.\nThe licensee reported that he had not observed any of these conditions prior to the inspection and none of the animals\nwere currently being treated. He also admitted to not cleaning the pens in over 2 months.\nFailure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of\ncare provided to animals and can prolong animal health problems and add suffering. All animals must be observed daily\nto assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending\nveterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.\nThe three animals with veterinary conditions identified above require examination by a veterinarian to prevent worsening\nof the conditions. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such examination and treatment to APHIS\nofficials upon request. Remains uncorrected."
