I then called the\nowner and left a voicemail message. While I was waiting at the facility another individual arrived and told me that\nthe person I was looking for was no longer at this address. I left the facility and waited at a public location for the\nremainder of the 30 minutes. Later in the day I was contacted by the owner; she told me that they had closed down\nthe business, moved, and were no longer conducting regulated activity. I provided her with the contact information\nfor the Fort Collins office so she could move forward with cancelling her registration."
