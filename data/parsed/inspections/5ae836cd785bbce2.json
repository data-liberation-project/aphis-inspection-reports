      "narrative": "The following animals are in need of veterinary care and have not yet been seen by a veterinarian for a diagnosis\nand treatment recommendations:\n*One white alpaca named Lorelei was noted to be very thin on the previous inspection. She has more hair during\nthis inspection but is still visibly thin. The spinal vertebrae protrude with no muscle covering. The hip bones are\nprotruding and very visible. Upon palpation no muscle or fat was present between the ribs and the skin. A second\ntan male alpaca \u201cJax\u201d is also thin based on appearance alone. The spinal vertebrae are prominent and the ribs\nappear to have minimal covering over the bones. The facility states they have been deworming regularly because of\nparasitism problems. Other alpaca and llamas have died of parasites over the last year. The owner stated his vet is\nobtaining a new deworming medication for the alpacas and llamas.\n*One brown approximately six month old dairy cow named Clementine appears very thin. The ribs are readily visible\nwith no fat or muscle covering. The vertebrae and hip bones are more prominent than typical of dairy cattle.\n*One adult male black sheep was noted limping while walking and then lowered himself to the ground resting both\nfront legs down onto the elbows to graze. This position is indicative of the sheep taking pressure off his painful feet.\nHe remained in this position rather than standing. The owner reports they have been treating for hoof rot with\nCoppertox but the vet has not seen this animal.\n*One young grey goat acquired last week is isolated from the other animals due to coughing. The animal has\naccumulated yellow tan discharge at both nostrils and a small amount of watery discharge from the eyes. The\nowner has been treating with a one time injection of penicillin and additional injections of LA 200. The bottle is not\nlabeled for use in goats. The owner reports the dosage being administered was obtained online.\nA veterinarian needs to see these animals to determine an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan to ensure their\nhealth and prevent painful conditions and suffering. The facility shall have the five animals listed seen by a\nveterinarian to ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries."
