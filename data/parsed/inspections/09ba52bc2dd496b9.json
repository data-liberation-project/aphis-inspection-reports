The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel\npoles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest\nupon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep\nroots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is\napproximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. There is now an 8 foot high tensile wire barrier fence approximately\n20 feet from the front of the enclosure.\nThe enclosure currently houses a five (5) year old male lion and a four (4) year old female lion with limited mobility.\nThe enclosure is only 12 feet in height which is inadequate to contain a lion. Primary enclosures must be\nconstructed in a manner that will ensure containment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and\nbehavioral characteristics of exotic cats, the height of the enclosure must be extended at least 4 feet in height or\nthe top of the enclosure modified with an appropriate overhang to minimize the potential of an animal escape.\nNOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014.\n***Llama Enclosure:There is a large gap along the front, bottom edge of the primary fence.\n***Deer Enclosure: At the rounded corner of the enclosure there is a large gap at the base of the fence.\nThese gaps in fencing appear to be the result of run-off from water draining downhill. The primary fencing of the\nenclosure (across from the camel enclosure) is bowed and bent downward at the top of the fence.\n***Camel Enclosure: The section of board fencing has several boards missing leaving gaps wide enough to a camel\nto stick its head through.There are also broken boards that have sharp edges. Additionally, two wooden posts that\nsupport a section of chain link fencing (across from potbelly pigs) are leaning inward.\nThe structural strength of the fencing is compromised. Primary fencing in disrepair allow for the entry of unwanted\nanimals and the escape and potential injury of the animals contained within the enclosure. All fencing must be\nrepaired or modifications made to the fence to ensure the integrity of the fencing is adequate for the species\ncontained within to prevent escape, public contact and injury."

Within\nthe enclosure there is a single tire swing and a water trough for the bears to use. The current space and structures\nwithin the enclosure provide little stimulation for bears who typically enjoy climbing, foraging, and being active in\nwater. The enclosure needs to be of an adequate size to allow the bears to make all normal postural adjustments\nand adequate water features for the bear to engage in species typical exercise and thermoregulation. Additional\nspace and elevated structures for climbing and resting; substrates to encourage digging; and an appropriate water\nfeature should be added to the enclosure to allow the animals to demonstrate species typical behavior and to\nimprove their psychological well-being.\nNOTE: Progress has been made on the construction of the new bear enclosure. Upon completion the bear\nenclosure will provide additional space and structures to encourage species typical behavior.\nTiger Enclosure:\n***The three (3) tigers are housed in a 30\u2019 x 40\u2019 x 10\u2019 closed top enclosure with a dirt and gravel and a single\nelevated structure. No water feature is available for swim-like activity. No changes have been to the enclosure\nsince the last inspection that would increase the size of the enclosure or that would allow the tigers to demonstrate\nmore species typical behavior. Tigers often engage in running, climbing, jumping, and water play. Tigers should be\nhoused in an enclosure with adequate space and structures that allows them to engage in natural behaviors. The\ncurrent enclosure must be modified or husbandry practices adjusted in a manner that will allow the tigers to jump,\nclimb, run and engage in water activities to improve their level of activity and to prevent abnormal behavior patterns.\nNOTE: Work on the construction of the new enclosure has not progressed since the last inspection due other high\npriority projects.\n***The elevated platform within the enclosure still only provides enough surface area for 2 of the 3 tigers to rest.\nTigers typically use elevated surfaces for jumping, resting, and to observe their surroundings. There should be\nenough elevated surfaces available within the enclosure for each animal to rest at the same time and to allow\nexercise in the form of jumping an climbing. An additional elevated surface or an extension of the current platform\nmust be constructed that would allow for all tigers to have the opportunity to demonstrate normal species typical\nbehaviors.\nNOTE: Materials to modify the current resting platform have been bought."
