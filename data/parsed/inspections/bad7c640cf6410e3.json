(4)\n***There were at least nine outdoor enclosures housing adult dogs (Cocker Spaniels, Poodles and Yorkshire\nTerriers) with shelters that did not contain adequate bedding. Some of the dogs were group housed and two dogs\nwere individually housed. According to the National Weather Service, the air temperature for the area at the time of\ninspection (approximately 10:30am) was 18 degrees F. There was only a small amount of bedding material inside\nthe shelters. Some of the shelters had a thin layer of bedding that was fairly evenly distributed on the floor with\nparts of the floor easily seen. A couple of the shelters had portions of the floor exposed with only a small amount of\nbedding pushed up along the inside walls of the shelter. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing a sufficient\nsource to keep them warm increases the risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. Shelters in outdoor\nfacilities for dogs must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 [deg]F (10\n[deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower. To be\ncorrected by: immediately on February 2, 2015 and from this point forward.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee,\nAdditional Inspectors\nHeine William, Animal Care Inspector"
