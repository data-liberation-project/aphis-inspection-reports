According to staff, the instrument used to\nmeasure the temperature inside the cage wash was not functional, and maintenance was having difficulty in finding\nthe correct part to fix the cage wash; however, the cage wash was still being used as the primary means to sanitize\nthe rabbit's enclosure. In the cage wash records, the last temperature test strip used was marked on April 29th\n2014. When questioned about the reason temperature test strips had not been used since, the staff said it was\nbecause the cage wash would not consistently reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit. A detergent called Steris CIP 200 (a\nclear fluid in white container) was also being used in the sanitation process, but no disinfectant was used for the\nprimary enclosure. By not having a cage wash that can reliably reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit or not using a\ndisinfectant, the rabbit primary enclosure cannot be appropriately sanitized. Proper sanitization is vital in removing\nharmful pathogens that can serve as an opportunity of infection for the animals in the enclosure. Proper sanitization\nremoves all sources that promote pathogen presence and growth. The rabbit(cid:25) primary enclosure must be sanitized\nat least every 30 days by either hot water (180 degrees Fahrenheit) with a detergent or using a detergent followed\nby a disinfectant.\nCorrect by: 7/3/2014\nThe inspection was conducted with a facility representative and the exit interview was conducted with the IO,\nDirector and Associate Director ORI, Associate Director DLAR, clinical veterinarians, ORI and DLAR staff.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBrunkhorst Susanne, Veterinary Medical Officer"
