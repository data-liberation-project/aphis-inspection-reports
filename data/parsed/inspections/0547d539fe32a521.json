All 4 corgi puppies are approximately the same size\nand a single puppy was measured at 17\u201d, requiring 3.67sqft of floor space per puppy. When housed together, all four\ncorgi puppies need a minimum floor space of 14.69sqft. In another enclosure measuring 30.5\u201d x 30\u201d (6.35sqft), the facility\nis housing 3 weaned 12 week old beagle puppies together. All 3 beagle puppies are approximately the same size and a\nsingle puppy was measured at 15\u201d, requiring 3.06sqft of floor space per puppy. When housed together, all 3 beagle\npuppies need a minimum floor space of 9.18sqft. When dogs are overcrowded, they can\u2019t make normal postural\nadjustments and may fight for resources. All dogs, including weaned puppies, must be provided a minimum amount of\nfloor space in their primary enclosure that can be calculated by measuring the dog from the tip of its nose to the base of\nits tail and then adding 6\u201d. The resulting number should be multiplied by itself to get minimum floor space in square inches\nand divided by 144 to get minimum floor space in square feet. When housing multiple dogs together, the enclosure needs\nto be the sum of all minimum floor space calculations for each dog. Correct by 7/25/25."
