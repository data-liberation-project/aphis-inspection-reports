The matted hair had to be moved by hand to be able to observe their\neyes and ears. Ash had a large mat under his chin that extended from one side of his jaw to the other. When the mat was\npushed down, a large skin lesion (about 3\u201d by 2\u201d) was revealed. The skin was reddened and moist. There were 3 yellow,\ncrusted areas that had hair and bedding stuck to them. The licensee was unaware of the skin lesion and the dog was not\nreceiving treatment. Matted hair can result in skin problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair\u2019s ability to\nprovide protection from the heat or cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these animals, consult her\nveterinarian about diagnosis and treatment of the skin lesions, and must establish an effective program of haircoat\nmaintenance. Medical records must be maintained and available for inspection. The licensee must ensure that all animals\nreceive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nThe inspection and an initial exit interview were conducted with the licensee on 6/27/2024. A final exit interview was\nconducted on 6/28/2024 when the inspection report was delivered.\nn"
