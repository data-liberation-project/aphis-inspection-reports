The grey fox in the adjacent enclosure chewed\noff approximately 12 cm of the distal tail of the ringtail. He was also missing the 3rd and 4th digit claws of his left\nfront paw, along with a partial thickness laceration on the medial aspect of the 3rd digit. The damaged portion of the\ntail was amputated and he is currently recovering in the medical building.\nEnclosures for all animals must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in order to\nprotect the animals from injury.\nThe staff has now sealed the gap between the metal wall and the wall of the building of the enclosure, ensuring the\nanimals housed in either enclosure cannot have access to each other. The facility should continue to monitor all\nenclosures to ensure that they adequately contain the animals housed within. A system of timely identification,\nmaintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of all animals.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
