He also has hair loss and scab-like lesions on the left hip area. This animal\nalso has a thin body condition. The male coati became ill in December 2013. The staff found him outside in his\nenclosure not acting normally. He was evaluated by the attending veterinarian on 5 December 2013 for this problem\nand was given fluids and antibiotics for suspected frostbite.The facility has kept the coati in an enclosure in the\noffice building since that time where they have been trying to strenghten his rear legs and encourage him to eat.\nThey believe the right leg has started to improve. The zoo director states that the coati doesn't consistently well.\nThey know that there is one type of dog food he will eat readily but they ran out of that food about 1.5 weeks ago\nand have not gotten more. The Director states that they talked to the attending veterinarian a week after the initial\nevaluation and they continue to give him occasional verbal updates. The attending veterinarian has not revaluated\nthis coati since the initial visit in December. Regular veterinary evaluation and care, including when medical\nproblems do not resolve, are essential for the health and well-being of the animals. The facility must have this\nanimal examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on 5 April 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must\ndocument the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request."

      "narrative": "During the last year the facility has added two new young white-tailed deer to the deer enclosure. These two young\ndeer are very outgoing and seek out attention at the enclosure fence. They were observed during the inspection to\ncome to the fence and try to reach and nibble anything accessable to them. There are no addtional public barriers\nor sufficient distance to keep the public from having contact with these deer. The Zoo Director states that he knows\nthat the public often tries to feed them through the fence. He states that he always comes out when he sees this\nhappen but he is not at the zoo or available during all public hours. Sufficient public barriers provide sufficient\ndistance between the public and the animals to ensure safety to both. In this case the young deer are seeking out\nattention from the public which puts them at risk of ingesting things that could cause them harm. The facility must\nensure sufficient distance and/or barriers are in place so as to protect both the viewing public and the animals. To\nbe corrected 3 June 2014."
