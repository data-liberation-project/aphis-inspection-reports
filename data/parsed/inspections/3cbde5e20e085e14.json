The officer who arrived on scene in\nresponse to the call observed that the gate was open towards the inside of the enclosure wide enough for a person to\nwalk through when he arrived.\nIt is unknown exactly how the gate came to be open on March 10, 2022, but the thin rusty wire was not strong or secure\nenough to keep the gate securely closed. The opening of the gate allowed the camel to escape its enclosure.
