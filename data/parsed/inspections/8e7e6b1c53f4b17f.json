      "narrative": "In the \"Reefer\" housing units, there were two dogs that had severe dental conditions that had not been addressed\nby a licensed veterinarian.\n***There was a male brown, long-haired Dachshund (#089*514*076) which had generalized reddened, receded and\nswollen gums. Some teeth were missing on both the upper and lower jaws. On the left side of the dog's mouth,\nmajority of upper and lower canine teeth were covered by a hard yellowish-brown to gray substance. The lower\ncheek teeth were covered in yellow greyish-black material. In the front of the mouth, the upper teeth were covered\nby brownish gray film that extended from gum line to at least halfway down the tooth. Between those teeth, there\nwas a lump (approximately the size of a small chick pea) protruding from the gum line. The bottom front teeth had\nsome brownish-black staining primarily at the gum line. On the right side of the dog's mouth, there was a buildup of\ngray and brownish-yellow colored hardened material on the upper and lower cheek teeth. This abnormal build-up of\nmaterial covered the majority of the bottom teeth and extended into the gum line as well as completely wrapped\naround the upper cheek teeth.\n***There was a male Yorkshire Terrier (#0A106D7B62) with wet fur surrounding his mouth, with what appears to be\nsaliva, covering the top of the nose to the bottom of the jaw. The dog's breath had a foul odor when his mouth was\nopened. Within the dog's mouth, the inside of the cheeks were swollen and had a generalized grayish-black\ndiscoloration. On the right side of the dog'(cid:25)s mouth, the upper cheek teeth were extensively covered by grayish-tan\ncolored material that extended from the gum line to the point of the teeth. In the front of the mouth, the upper teeth\nwere covered in a black material at the gum line and covered in a grayish-tan material on the body of the teeth.\nThere was some gray liquid (film) on the incisors (front teeth). The canine teeth appeared to be worn down.\nHowever, the teeth on the bottom jaw were unable to be clearly seen during inspection. On the left side of the\nmouth, the upper cheek teeth were wrapped completely with a grayish-tan material that extended from bottom of the\ntooth to just below the receded gum line.\nChronic dental conditions could lead to more severe disease such as gingivitis and/or periodontal disease. These\nconditions could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health\nof the animal. The licensee must have these animals'(cid:25) mouths and teeth examined by a licensed veterinarian in\norder to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate dental treatment plan is developed and\nfollowed. The licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program\nof veterinary care for the animals in the facility.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: 17 October 2014\nSeveral dogs throughout the premises had excessively long nails.\n***In the \"Castle\", there was a female gray Weimaraner and female Golden Retriever with long nails.\n***In the \"Shed\" enclosure, there was a female Basset Hound (#086*377*592) with long nails affecting the normal\nconformation of her front paws. Excessive long nails can interfere with a dog'(cid:25)s normal gait or conformation thus\naffecting the animals' health and overall well-being. The licensee must ensure that animals' nails are trimmed and\nare following an appropriate nail trimming program.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: 24 October 2014\n*Note: Dachshund (#043*002*598), Siberian Husky (#086*378*592), Maltese (#016*830*359), and white Poodle\n(#033*834*317), and black Poodle (#0A01616791) included on the report under section 2.40 (b)(2) for the\ninspection conducted on 4 December 2013 were examined by a licensed veterinarian on 5 December 2013.\nThis inspection was conducted on 14 October 2014 with licensee(s). Exit interview was conducted on 15 October\n2014 with licensee. A second exit interview was conducted via telephone with licensee on 28 October 2104.\nAdditional Inspectors\nProctor Chad, Animal Care Inspector"
