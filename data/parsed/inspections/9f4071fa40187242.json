There are areas of rust along the bottom of the chain link enclosure. The sliding metal door\nbetween the two sides of the enclosure has pitted, flaking rust along its bottom edge. The wooden resting platform on the\nleft side of the enclosure has an approximately 2 inch by 3 inch area on its surface which has been gouged out, and the\nunderlying wood has an irregular surface. Animal-contact surfaces in primate enclosures must be maintained so that they\ncan be readily cleaned and sanitized, to prevent the accumulation of organic material or harmful bacteria. Correct by\n6/1/22 by ensuring that surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates can be readily cleaned and sanitized, or are replaced\nwhen worn or soiled.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Assistant Animal Care Supervisor.\nEnd Section"
