It would\nhave been very easy for the animals to have contact with the poison if a mouse dropped the pellets when running\nacross the cages, or if the dogs jumped up and bumped the top causing the contents to fall into the primary\nenclosure. The rat poison was removed during the inspection. In the Whelping building there is an accumulation of\nold food, mouse droppings, dirt and debris under the wash down areas.\nThe accumulation of clutter on top of the primary enclosures can be a possible health hazard if any of the items\nwere to fall into the enclosures and the animals were able to chew on or ingest any of the medicines, poisons or\ncleaning supplies. The lack of cleaning under the washdown areas where there is an accumulation of dirt and debris\nprovides an area where vermin can inhabit or be drawn to, and this area can house potential health hazards for the\nregulated animals.\nThe licensee needs to remove the clutter from on top of the primary enclosures and put them on a shelf or\nsomewhere else where they can be kept away from contact with the animals. The floor space under the washdowns\nmust be kept clean and free of dirt and debris.\nTo be corrected by: May 31, 2015\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee"
