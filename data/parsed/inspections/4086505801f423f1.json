Rabbits were to be conditioned to a mechanical restraint\ndevice designed for nose-only inhalation exposure prior to the actual inhalation exposure portion of the study.\nDuring conditioning exercises, 4 rabbits either died or required euthanasia as a result of their struggle to reposition\nthemselves or through blocking of their airways due to improper positioning while restrained in the nose-only\ninhalation devices. The search for alternatives to painful and distressful procedures provided to the IACUC in the\nreview of the protocol only addressed the infectious agent portion of the study and the PI specifically stated: \"(cid:28)The\nonly procedure that produces pain, discomfort, or distress is the disease sequelae itself(cid:29).\". This procedure clearly\ncaused distress and pain to these rabbits but no alternatives to the procedure appear to have been considered by\nthe PI.\nThe IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause\nmore than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and has provided a written narrative description of\nthe methods and sources, e. g., the Animal Welfare Information Center, used to determine that alternatives were not\navailable.\nTo be corrected on all active and newly submitted protocols involving animal activities and not later than the next\nscheduled IACUC meeting."

Four na\u00efve animals were exposed.\n**Telemeter surgeries were conducted by a person who was not listed on the IACUC approved protocol, 14-020. It\nwas determined after 5 animals had undergone the surgery that this person was appropriately trained and qualified\nbut had not been listed by the PI on the protocol.\n** A rabbit protocol, 12-086, required that all personnel involved in the conditioning of the rabbits to the nose-only\ninhalation exposure tubes be \"at least SSDB 2, 1 (under supervision) or will be trained by authorized personnel prior\nto performing procedures.\" At least two technicians involved in the rabbit conditioning procedures do not have any\ndocumentation in their training files or in the SSDB system that they were trained or qualified to perform these\nprocedures and should not have done so without supervision by personnel who were qualified. During two separate\nconditioning exercises on 8/19/2012 and 8/20/2012, one of these technicians conducted these procedures by\nthemselves.\nThe SSDB is the system used to track the training and qualifications of all personnel. The IACUC can access this\nsystem to check to see if personnel listed on an animal use protocol are qualified to conduct the procedures for\nwhich they are listed. However, at least one protocol reviewed during the inspection, 12-086, lists no names of any\npersonnel only the statement: \"All personnel performing procedure will be at least SSDB 2, 1 (under supervision) or\nwill be trained by authorized personnel prior to performing procedures.\" Based on conversations with the Training\nSpecialist and Veterinary staff, there is a pool of technical staff from which researchers can select personnel to\nconduct procedures for their approved protocols. The IACUC reviewers may not actually ever know which\npersonnel the PI chooses to conduct these procedures. One of the nonhuman primates involved in a study\nescaped from its primary enclosure due to personnel not properly securing the enclosure. The animal remained\ncontained in the room and was recaptured but illustrates the type of risk posed by not having enough adequately\ntrained personnel to prevent such errors.\nIt is imperative that the IACUC is able to access the training and qualifications for all personnel conducting\nprocedures involving animals to ensure the humane care and use of these animals and to promote the safety and\neffectiveness of the procedures being conducted.\nTo be corrected on all active and newly submitted protocols involving animals in conjunction with a full review of the\nSSDB system or equivalent but no later than the next scheduled IACUC meeting."

When anesthetized for blood collection, a technician\nnoticed swelling of the left hind limb on NHP 92147. Upon veterinary examination, it was determinated that NHP\n92147 had a compound fracture of the left lower leg and facial trauma. This animal was provided veterinary care\nand was eventually euthanized due to a poor response to treatment. This animal was assumed to have been placed\nback in the wrong pen on Thursday, August 9, 2012. The main cause of the trauma to NHP 92147 was because it\nwas released back into the wrong pen.\n**On August 22, 2013, a male Rhesus Macaque (RQ9327), was obtained from his cage and a procedure was\nperformed on him. The study technician misread the animal identification number on the catheter jacket. The\nanimal that was supposed to have the procedure was RQ9427. RQ9327 was euthanized as a result of the\nprocedure and corrective actions were implemented.\nThe facility has since begun implementing additional identification methods for nonhuman primates and other\nspecies and provided training to personnel.\n********\nRecords were reviewed for all rabbits which had undergone conditioning and mechanical restraint in a nose-only\ninhalation exposure tube under IACUC approved protocol 12-086. Four rabbits experienced distress and/or injuries\nassociated with this conditioning exercise:\n**On August 20, 2012, one rabbit (Study ID A3001) had no hind limb function upon removal from the tube after 40\nminutes. Veterinary evaluation and radiographs were performed and it was determined that the animal should be\nhumanely euthanized.\n**On August 21, 2012, one rabbit (Study ID A7003) was removed after only 3 minutes from the tube during a\nconditioning session and was found to have impaired hind limb function. Veterinary evaluation and radiographs\nwere performed, a spinal fracture was diagnosed, and the animal was euthanized.\n**On August 27, 2012, technicians had to remove one rabbit (Study ID A6003) from the tube after only 7 minutes\ninto the conditioning session. The rabbit was found to be bleeding from the mouth and ear and was not breathing.\nPathology confirmed that the rabbit died from asphyxiation.\n**On August 28, 2012, another rabbit (Study ID A4004) had to be removed from the tube after 11 minutes since it\nwas not noted to be breathing. The rabbit was resuscitated by chest compressions and returned to its cage but was\nnoted to have impaired hind limb function. Veterinary evaluation was performed and it was determined the rabbit\nhad a spinal fracture so was euthanized.\nConditioning of rabbits in these nose-only inhalation exposure tubes did not continue after 8/28/2012 and, according\nto facility personnel, no adverse events occurred during the study portion of this protocol where rabbits were placed\nin these tubes. There were no rabbits present at LRRI from January 2013 until May 2014.\n********\nThe number of animals injured in these research and husbandry procedures could have been minimized or\ncompletely avoided with appropriate handling and training of personnel.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correction should include continuing to\nimplement training of personnel in handling of animals and improving identification methods for all animals on an\nongoing basis as new studies and new animal models are introduced.\nTo be corrected from this time forward."
