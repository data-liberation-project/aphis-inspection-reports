Both of these\nbehaviors are consistent with excessive heat exposure or stress.\nWhen climatic conditions present a threat to an animal(cid:25)s health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken\nto alleviate the impact of those conditions. A method for adequately cooling the enclosures for the 2 camels and 1\nreindeer needs to be implemented whenever temperatures are causing these animals excessive discomfort. If\nadequate cooling cannot be provided in their current housing then these animals need to be moved to housing that\ncan provide more comfortable temperatures for the animals.\nTo be completed immediately.\nInspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
