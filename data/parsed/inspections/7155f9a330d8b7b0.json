      "narrative": "Eight Primates (50Y,GM2,47A,96C,72X,51S,40T,78U) were noted to have significant hair loss at the time of\ninspection 29 October 2015. The underlying skin in these areas was pigmented, typical for the species but several\nalso had redness of the skin. There was no crusting of the skin or obvious signs of scratching and the animals were\nnot observed hair plucking during inspection. The manager speculated about the causes of this hair loss including:\nthat it was due to over-grooming for one and likely hormonal for another. She indicated, that in the case of 78U, that\nthe near complete hair loss had been present for years. Below is a summary of the records reviewed in October\nand January:\n78U -The manager stated that the primate had a long history of diarrhea but was not currently receiving any\ntreatment for the hair loss. Veterinary records indicated that the animal had been evaluated for diarrhea multiple\ntimes but the hairloss was not assessed other than as a Hair Coat Score (HCS) which was Moderate General\nalopecia (3) on 6/2/15 and Bald (5) on 10/6/15. This animal was examined 5 November 2015 and had blood drawn\nfor CBC and blood chemistries. No treatment was outlined pending blood results. The results were recorded 10\nNovember 2015 and indicated hypoalbuminemia with no anemia. The animal was placed on albumin and iron\nsupplementation with a plan to recheck the blood in 1 to 2 months. There was no documentation at the facility\nregarding the hair loss and no record of the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding this animals hair loss.\n40T - The record showed no workup for hairloss. In the past year, the animal had a wound on the left thigh\n(4/28/15), gave birth (5/29/15), and had a Physical Examination (PE) (10/20/15). On the PE, the animal was noted\nto be Overweight (4) with Severe Generalized alopecia (4) but no treatment plan was noted for either observation.\nNo further entries were in the record as of 25 January 2016 (this inspection).\n51S - The record showed no workup for hairloss. The most recent PE (9/22/15) showed a Body Condition Score\n(BCS) of 3.5/5 (despite the facility using a four point scale instead of five as indicated). The HCS was noted as Mild\nPatchy alopecia (2) No treatment plan was noted. No further entries were in the record as of 25 January 2016 (this\ninspection).\n72X - The record showed no workup for hairloss. In the past year, the animal had a wound (4/16/15), gave birth\n(6/15/15), had a wound treated on the ventral back (7/15/15), and had a PE (10/20/15). On the PE, the animal was\nnoted to be hypoalbuminemic with Severe Generalized alopecia (4) and diarrhea but no treatment plan was noted\nfor the decreased albumin or the hairloss. The animal was on observation for diarrhea and on 2 November 2015\nwas found to be dehydrated with a BCS of 5 and a HCS of 4. Blood was drawn for CBC and Serum Chemistries and\nthe animal was placed on Tylosin and LRS (fluids). The results of testing revealed hypoalbuminemia with anemia\nand the animal was positive for Aeromonas. Tylan treatment was continued and the animal was returned to the\ncolony15 December 2015. No mention of the alopecia diagnosis or treatment plan was made in the record.\nNone of the four animals detailed on the October 2015 inspection had received a diagnosis or treatment plan\nspecifically for hairloss as of this inspection (25 January 2015) as noted above. The facility did develop an \"Alopecia\nWorkup of Non-human Primates\" plan with workup sheet to be used when examining animals with hairloss. The\nscoring system was updated and a chart posted in the examination rooms. This plan is in place for all future\nexaminations.\nAs indicated by the manager's comments, hair loss in primates can result from multiple causes. Evaluation by a\nveterinarian is necessary to determine the most likely cause and develop an appropriate diagnostic and treatment\nplan. Failure to address abnormal conditions can result in worsening of the condition and unnecessary suffering.\nAll licensees must ensure that observations of abnormal conditions are reported to the attending veterinarian in a\ntimely manner and that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease when\nidentified. Correct by having all animals with hair loss examined by a licensed veterinarian who will develop\nrecommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Additionally the licensee shall maintain record of this examination,\nthe veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations, and any treatments for future evaluation by APHIS Officials upon request.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the Director of Research Animal Resources."
