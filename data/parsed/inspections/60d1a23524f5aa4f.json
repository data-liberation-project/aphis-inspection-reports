That evening, a different animal care employee entered \u201cThe Cottage\u201d building to find\nthese two capuchins loose inside the structure. The employee was able to lure the capuchins outside into the runway and\nlock them out of the building. During the time that they were out of their primary enclosure, they had access to various\ninappropriate materials. According to the facility, the capuchins had unrolled rolls of toilet paper and accessed the shower.\nAPHIS officials also found a chewed spray can of material that smelled like insecticide or insect repellant.\nImproper handling of animals during cleaning and shifting can result in escape and/or injury. Handling of all animals shall\nbe done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive\ncooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected from this day (May 10, 2024) forward."
