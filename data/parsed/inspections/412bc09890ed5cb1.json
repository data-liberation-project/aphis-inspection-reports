On 10/24/2013 she was noted as having\nlameness (trouble rising and moving around the enclosure). On both occasions, an employee from the facility\ncontacted the attending veterinarian (AV) via telephone to obtain an assessment and treatment recommendations.\nRecords obtained from the facility indicate the otter was started on 1-1200 mg Fish oil tablet daily on 9/28/2013 for\nthe poor hair coat condition. On 10/24/2013 she was started on Meloxicam and 1 glucosamine daily for presumed\narthritic condition. Currently, Meloxicam is labeled for use only in dogs. At the time of inspection, the facility could\nnot supply any prescriptions or directions on medication usage from the AV nor was the usage detailed in the\nprogram of veterinary care. Additionally, the facility has not documented medication administration since 10/26/14.\nDirections from the AV on medication usage should be documented and maintained by the facility to ensure proper\nadministration of the medication. Currently accepted veterinary standards for the extra-label drug usage (using\nMeloxicam in the river otter), states the veterinarian has recently seen and is personally acquainted with the keeping\nand care of the animal by virtue of examination of the animal, and/or by medically appropriate and timely visits to\nthe premises where the animal is kept.\nTo date, the AV has not done a physical examination of the river otter or completed any diagnostic testing for any of\nthe noted conditions. Eye discharge can be signs of ocular, infectious or systemic disease. Depending on the\ncause, these conditions can be both progressive and painful. Lameness is an indicator of disease and often pain. It\ncan result from numerous causes including both infectious and non-infectious. Diagnostic testing, including physical\nexamination from a veterinarian, is necessary to properly determine the cause and best course of treatment to\nalleviate discomfort.\nThe licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on July 11, 2014, to obtain accurate\ndiagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be\nprovided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic\ntests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with\nthe dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the\nmedication is administered to the animals.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and\nthe need for follow-up and any further veterinary care"

Both the employee and the AV stated to the APHIS VMO that the employee did not receive training from\nthe AV prior to anesthetizing the otter. The employee did state she had received training during a wildlife safe\ncapture and immobilization certification class. The program of veterinary care did not outline any guidance on\nanesthesia in any regulated animal.\nAdequate guidance and training, from the facility's AV, is needed to ensure the proper usage of anesthetic\nmedications, proper monitoring during anesthesia and what to do in an emergency situation (i.e. adverse reactions\nto anesthesia or while under anesthesia). Without proper training, the facility can not ensure the safety and well\nbeing of the animal while under anesthesia.
