      "narrative": "* Both eyes for a black, female, Poodle born on 12/10/16, (not identified, but identified as PO27 on APHIS form\n7005), were depressed into their orbital cavities. Very little of the whites of both eyes were visible. Both eyes had\ndischarge and the hair was wet around the eyes. The dog was not very responsive to hand movement in close\nproximity to the eyes. This condition of the eyes the animal could have been born with or could be other medical\nconditions. Both eyes can be painful and cause discomfort to the animal.\n- This dog was favoring its front left leg when walking or was limping. While standing in normal position the animal\nwould hold the left leg off the floor. The lower leg (ulna and radius bones) were hyper-extended below the elbow\njoint. This leg injury can be result of various medical conditions. This leg injury can be painful and cause discomfort\nto the animal.\nThe licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan for the eyes and the front left leg. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and\nprovided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care\nat all times.\nTo be corrected by, 11-September-2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI) on\n7-September-2017.\nThis inspection will be sent by both regular and certified mail.\nUSPS Tracking#: 9590940227566351142141."
