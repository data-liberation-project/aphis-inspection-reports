The next morning one of the swift foxes was\nobserved running in the bison enclosure adjacent to the swift fox enclosure. The other swift fox escaped and has not been\nrecovered. The foxes had dug a hole from their outdoor enclosure under the dig barrier into the bison enclosure. The\nfacility set a trap and captured the male swift fox overnight. He was placed inside the swift fox indoor enclosure, but the\nfox escaped through the window that night and also escaped his outdoor enclosure. The facility has had swift foxes in this\nenclosure for many years with no escapes. Unlike the swift foxes in the past, these were wild caught and had only been in\nthis enclosure for three months. Despite placing traps, they have not been able to capture either swift fox. They were\nspotted on trail cams on property up until August 31, 2025. They have not been observed since, but the facility continues\nto place traps when weather permits. Animal escapes can be detrimental to their well-being. This can result in no access\nto water, food, and possible injury and death. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as\nappropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to\nprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The facility corrected this on July 30, 2025, by not putting any\nswift foxes back into the enclosure.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
