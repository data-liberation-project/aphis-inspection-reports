The licensee stated that a car had backfired in the parking lot, which is close to the bear\nenclosure. The car backfiring triggered a flock of peacocks to disperse and some landed in the bears enclosures.\nThis occurrence agitated (cid:28)\"Sugar(cid:29)\" and she began charging the electric fence. The licensee was concerned that the\nbear would hurt someone and asked one of his employee(cid:25)s experienced with firearms to shoot the bear. The\nemployee that shot \"(cid:28)Sugar\"(cid:29) fired a second shot to ensure she was dead. Unfortunately, the bullet ricocheted and\nended up mortally wounding \"(cid:28)Spice\"(cid:29), the male black bear. An additional gunshot was fired at \"(cid:28)Spice(cid:29)\" to end his\nsuffering.\nThe Program of Veterinary Care does not describe the use of gunshot by the licensee in cases of emergency. In the\nabsence of guidance from the veterinarian there is a greater chance of collateral damage or undue suffering of the\nanimals if the proper firearms, proper projectile caliber or correct anatomical site is not used. In order to provide\nadequate veterinary care, the licensee must consult with the veterinarian. The veterinarian must update the program\nof veterinary care to reflect detailed euthanasia guidance in emergency situations.\nCorrect Immediately"

The public would come into the\nholding area in groups while \"(cid:28)Honey\"(cid:29) was nursing on a bottle. Up to 5 people were trying to interact with the bear\nby petting her at one time. During a 10 minute period 38 people interacted with (cid:28)\"Honey\"(cid:29). This is excessive public\nhandling.

Additionally, a\nphoto taken when (cid:28)Honey(cid:29) was a neonate shows 4 young children petting, feeding and handling her. The risk of the\nneonatal bear aspirating the formula was great while being fed by inexperienced members of the general public.
