Licensee was feeding timothy and alfalfa hay along with\npelleted feed.\nThe treatment for masses is not addressed in the written program of veterinary care and there is no record that the facility\nhad identified these two animals prior to today's inspection. A failure to conduct adequate daily observations with direct\ncommunication with the attending veterinarian, can result in delay of care provided to animals and prolong animal health\nproblems.
