      "narrative": "A 6-year-old adult neutered male California sea lion (\u201cJester\u201d) had a history of recurrent medical problems affecting his\neyes. On November 14th, 2019, Jester was examined by the attending veterinarian and the presence of a large corneal\nulcer was noted on the surface of his left eye, and trainers noted that the animal was \u201cnot eating as regularly as before\u201d.\nOn February 11th, 2020 his left eye was noted to be worsening (\u201ccorneal ulcer subjectively seems deeper\u201d), and he\ncontinued to receive treatment by the attending veterinarian. He underwent surgery on his left eye on March 5th, 2020 at\nwhich time it was noted that lesion was a \u201cdesmetocoele\u201d (very deep eye ulcer). At the time of surgery, his right eye also\nhad a bluish grey lesion on its surface which was not ulcerated. Jester died under anesthesia.\nWater quality records from the pool where Jester was housed consistently had total chlorine levels of 2.2 parts per million\n(PPM) and free chlorine levels ranging from 0.1 PPM to 0.95 PPM in the month before his death. Free chlorine exceeded\n0.5 PPM every day, often multiple times each day, from February 8th, 2020 to February 25th, 2020. The highest free\nchlorine measured during this timeframe was 0.95 PPM free chlorine on February 18th, 2020.\nFacility management stated that the general aim for water on this system is to maintain free chlorine in the 0.3 to 0.5 PPM\nrange in order to kill coliforms (bacteria). Facility records indicate that this target was lowered to the \u201c0.2 range\u201d on\nFebruary 26th because Jester was being prepared for surgery and they wanted to \u201cfix anything and everything\u201d leading up\nto the surgery. Facility management stated, \u201cthere is no question that chlorine is irritating to the eyes.\u201d From February\n26th to March 5th the free chlorine was often in the 0.2-0.3 PPM range, while total chlorine remained around 2.2 PPM.\nThe consulting ophthalmologist confirmed that many of the other animals at the facility have eye problems. The attending\nveterinarian confirmed that 4 out of 5 sea lions on this water system have ocular issues, all of whom are under 10-years-\nold. Jester had been living at the facility since 2015, and he did not have any eye lesions when he arrived at the facility.\nA USDA marine mammal specialist visited the facility on August 27th, 2019 and the specialist told facility management\nthat the chlorine was too high and needed to be reduced to better support animal health. At that time, facility management\nindicated that their chlorine levels were maintained at less than 1 PPM total chlorine.\nSince June 2020, records from this water quality system show that total chlorine was often more than 1.5 PPM, and was\nregularly above 1.8 PPM. Records show that free chlorine often regularly exceeded 0.5 PPM.\nChlorine may contribute to the development and worsening of eye disease in captive sea lions. Chlorine and its\nbyproducts are extremely irritating to eyes and mucus membranes, yet captive sea lions depend on pools of water in their\nenclosure to maintain normal body temperature and to exercise normal behaviors. Ulcers, infections, and inflammation on\nthe surface of the eye are extremely painful and may cause vision loss, and may affect an animal\u2019s willingness or ability to\neat, swim, ambulate, or rest comfortably. Animals with ulcerated eyes are especially vulnerable to the pain and irritation\ncaused by exposure to chlorinated water.
