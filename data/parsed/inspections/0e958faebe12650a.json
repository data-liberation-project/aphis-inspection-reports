The current physical barrier is only\napproximately two feet away from the enclosure and is less than three feet tall. It is not solid and has spaces\nbetween the bars large enough for kids to reach through. An adult person standing outside the barrier is able to\nreach across and touch the enclosure. The monkeys could grab the person's hand leading to possible injury to\nboth. Public exhibits housing nonhuman primates must have a barrier between the primary enclosure and the public\nat any time the public is present that restricts physical contact between the public and the nonhuman primates.\nCorrect by 10/7/18.\nThis inspection was conducted with one facility representative.\nThis exit interview was conducted with undersigned facility representative."
