One (1) was found dead and the other two were in respiratory distress and expired after unsuccessful\nattempts to revive them. The following day, August 3, 2016, five (5) additional African Green Monkeys on the study\nwere found dead during the morning health check. Four (4) African Green Monkeys on the study remain and have\nnot demonstrated any signs of illness or distress.\nPost-procedural monitoring was conducted per SOP during normal work hours, however no additional monitoring of\nthe remaining nine (9) non-human primates on the study was conducted overnight. Due to the recent deaths of the\nnon-human primates on study, more frequent monitoring may have allowed for more immediate intervention to\nprevent the deaths of the remaining animals on the study. Procedures must be established and implemented to\nensure adequate monitoring of study animals following an adverse event. Correct by December 30, 2016.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director / IACUC Chair.\nThis is an electronic copy of the Microsoft Word report dated 29 November 2016."
