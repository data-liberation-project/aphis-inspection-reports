Without consulting the veterinarian or following the facility\u2019s standard\nprocedure for treating lameness (prescribed by the veterinarian), an Animal Health Technician (AHT) treated this\nanimal with an unapproved antibiotic off-label.\nOn February 14, 2019, despite veterinary instructions to keep the Dorset and Romanov ewes separate during\nlambing, the sheep operations staff comingled the groups. On February 26, 2019, 20 to 30% of Romanov ewes\nwere markedly thin due to competition for food. As a result of their body condition, 2 required euthanasia.\nOn January 31, 2019, the veterinarian ordered an immediate ration change for a group of Romanov ewes in poor\nbody condition. On February 5, 2019, the sheep manager still had not implemented the ration change with no\nexplanation. On February 26, 2019 the AV documents the condition of the Romanov ewes continues to deteriorate\nand the AV euthanized 2 ewes on March 4th, 2019.\nOn January 22, 2019, one ewe was identified as being dehydrated and had difficulty rising. On January 23rd, the\nveterinarian give strict instructions to the AHT to separate this animal in order to facilitate increased access to food\nand water. On January 24th, despite the veterinarian\u2019s instructions, it was reported the ewe had not been\nseparated. The ewe was euthanized on January 24 for poor prognosis due to dehydration and persistent\nrecumbency.\nThe above incidents demonstrate repeated failures to follow AV instructions. The facility personnel\u2019s decision not to\nfollow the AV's instructions reduces the veterinarian's ability to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and\nmay have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in the sheep operation unit. The facility shall assure that\nthe attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to\noversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.\nAt the time of the exit interview, the employee issues have been addressed. And a comprehensive review of\nexisting sheep care operating procedures/protocols as well as a review of sheep care & handling procedures has\nbeen implemented.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nTygart Michael, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
