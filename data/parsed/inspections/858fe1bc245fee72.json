      "narrative": "* There was an adult, female, brown and white Shih Tzu (\"Sugar\" #035-794-634) who was not placing any weight\non her hind left leg as she moved around her enclosure. The top of her left hind paw had a swollen, red-purple\nlesion which was approximately one inch in diameter and had very little hair on it. The licensee stated she had not\nnoticed that the dog was limping on that leg. \"Sugar\" also had a thick, yellow-green discharge partially covering\nboth eye globes and appeared to be squinting slightly in the left eye. The licensee stated she was treating the eyes,\nbut upon inspection, it was discovered that the medication she was using expired in August 2011. Limping\ncombined with the swollen lesion indicates that the dog's foot is likely painful and could be infected. Using an eye\nmedication which expired three years ago could be ineffective and may even be harmful to the dog's eye.\n* There was an adult, male Shih Tzu (\"Bam Bam\" #477-90A-7436) who was barking/coughing repeatedly during the\ninspection. The dog's bark/cough sounded more like a muffled honk. The licensee stated she had not heard the\nstrange sound prior to the inspection. A strange coughing/barking sound could indicate the dog may have a\nmedical condition which could be contagious to the other dogs in the kennel.\nThe licensee must have \"Sugar\" and \"Bam Bam\" examined by a licensed veterinarian by 15 August 2014 in order to\nobtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times."
