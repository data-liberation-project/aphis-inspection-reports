A\nmoderate amount of pinkish-red discharge was seen going from the lesion down the left leg and behind the tail.\n- A brown fallow deer in the drive thru section was seen with an abnormal right eye. Most of the eye was made up of an\namorphous cloudy whitish-blue film.\nThe facility had not identified the conditions affecting these two animals, therefore had not contacted the veterinarian for\nguidance on care. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in animals\nwith such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented to properly assess\ntheir health and well-being.
