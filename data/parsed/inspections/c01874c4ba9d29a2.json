Two of the animals died while under\ntreatment: #27373 arrested while in surgery to treat the infection and could not be resuscitated. #28356 was\neuthanized while in surgery for treatment for the infection when the extent of the infection was determined to be too\ngreat to continue. The third, #28469, had all of the implants removed to allow for healing. This animal is currently\ndoing well.\nThe IACUC must ensure that all personnel involved with animal work are properly trained and experienced in all\naspects of the proposed animal work. It must also evaluate all proposed activities for safety and appropriateness of\nall components of the activities.\nCorrection: This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by engaging a Subject Matter Expert for an external\nreview on this study and related SOPs in the program. Changes to both were made and implemented. Monitoring\nfor efficacy of the changes is ongoing."
