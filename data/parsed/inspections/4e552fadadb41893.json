When clumps were broken these were discolored grey to white\nand released particles consistent with improper drying. Additionally there was an excessive accumulations of bird\nfeces on the surface of these grass clippings. Grass clippings fed in this manner are not appropriate feed material\nand pose a risk to the health of the animals. In addition to the grain, the facility is feeding baked goods as treats,\nthese items with excessive sugar are also not appropriate to feed to the deer as they can potentially cause irritations\nin the gut.\n*** The facility has been in the process of transitioning to a primary diet of dog food for the bears. Due to illness of\nthe primary animal caretaker and lack of dog food, the facility brought out buckets of restaurant left over food\n(donuts, muffins, pasta, breads, fries, and cooked meat products) to feed. These types of food are poor nutritive\nvalue while containing excessive calories that contributes to the bear\u2019s excessive weight. Obesity poses a\nsignificant risk to the health of animals, therefore due to the current body condition of these animals, it is imperative\nthat a diet that is nutritious and of appropriate quantity is fed.\n*** At the time of the inspection, raw chicken for the bobcat was being thawed in the food barn in a plastic pan on\nthe floor. There was a heater on the chicken to assist with the thawing process. The facility states that due to lack of\ninsulation the frozen chicken will not thaw in the refrigerator. The current method of thawing food in the winter does\nnot protect the meat from thawing in an uneven manner. Thawing in this type of uncontrolled manner increases the\nchances of food spoilage and food borne illness. The manner of thawing food in the winter needs to be addressed\nto maintain the nutritive value of the food and to assure the health of the animals.\n*** The facility needs to create a diet plan for all species that meets the specific nutritive needs of the species. This\nplan should detail specific daily diet amounts to maintain a healthy body condition of the animals. The plan should\nbe assessed by the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by: Feb 23, 2018"
