The facility representative stated that it was not like that yesterday and that there had been\nsome compatibility issue with the two young Akitas in the next enclosure. They had not seen any compatibility\nissues for sure with the Rottweilers, yet do not know of any other reason that this dog would be injured.

The facility representative stated that their\nstool has been this way for a long time, that this situation had been discussed with the attending veterinarian some\ntime in the past and that the dogs are dewormed on a regular basis. Loose stools can be an indication of a\ngastrointestinal problem, stress or discomfort. Left unattended any of these issues could worsen the health of the\nanimal.\nThe licensee understands that the Rottweiler identified as Natasha must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by\nCOB July 17, 2014 and follow any treatment plans.
