One was not using its leg\nand was diagnosed by the attending veterinarian to have a leg fracture. The two other animals had limbs which\nwere mildly swollen with abrasions. The attending veterinarian determined the injuries probably occurred because\nthe legs had been caught in the enclosure floors.\nThese guinea pigs, and a majority of the guinea pigs at the facility, are group housed in bin enclosures. The bins\nare made of a hard plastic like material with a mesh floor resembling a waffle. The holes are about one centimeter\nsquare. In the corners of the enclosures, where the guinea pigs like to congregate, the holes are estimated to be\ntwice as long. The guinea pigs feet and legs easily fit through these holes in the enclosure flooring. This inspector\nsaw many guinea pigs with their feet poking through the floor holes during the inspection.\nThe facility reports illness and injury to guinea pigs legs at an average rate of 0.008% of the population yearly, or\nroughly 20 animals per year. Modifications have been made to some of the enclosure floors by making the holes\nslightly larger and rounder, especially in the enclosure corners, in an effort to reduce entrapment and make it easier\nfor the guinea pigs to remove their legs. To date, sufficient data has not been accumulated to determine if these\nenclosure modifications have affected leg injury incidence. Leg fractures and leg injuries are painful and constitute\nserious animal welfare impacts. Primary enclosure floors must be constructed such that the animals(cid:25) feet and legs\nare protected from injury.\nCorrect by: December 3, 2014\nInspection conducted September 2 - 3, 2014\nExit briefing conducted with the Scientific Director, IACUC Chair, and other facility personnel."
