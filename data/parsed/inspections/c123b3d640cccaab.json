In two of the goats, at\nleast one nodule has become irritated, inflamed and/or infected. A light tan goat with ear tag 531 has an approximately\none inch round swelling protruding above the skin over the right side near the shoulder. The swelling has several smaller\nred irritated areas on it and there is a thick white material oozing from the swelling at the lower edge of the swelling. The\nmale white Savannah goat with ear tag 347 has a half inch darkly pigmented slightly firm swelling protruding above the\nskin over the right side near the shoulder. There is tan dried material attached to the haircoat around the swelling. The\nfacility representative states that the attending veterinarian has not been notified of these swellings and no treatment is\ncurrently being provided. The IACUC approved research protocol states that \u2018if any animal develops an ulceration and/or\ninfection at the injection site, the vet will be asked to treat the lesion\u2019.\n*One New Zealand white rabbit (RBT733) has hairloss in patches across its face encompassing the nose and both sides\nof the face beside the nose and under the eyes. There are no visible wounds. The facility representative states that the\nattending veterinarian has not been notified about the hairloss and no treatment is being provided.\nIn addition, five Savannah goats did not receive appropriate veterinary care:\nRecords reviewed show that one female Savannah goat (ear tag 2338) died on July 11, 2023. The goat arrived at the\nfacility on 6/29/23 and broke one horn near the base of the horn (near head) while she was butting her head when being\nmoved into the chute for her vaccinations. She apparently \u2018never did well\u2019 and died on July 11, 2023. The facility\nrepresentative states that the attending veterinarian was not notified of the broken horn or the fact that she was not feeling\nwell. Broken horns are painful and breaks near the base of the horn can be serious.\nDuring the facility inspection on 7/25/23 six Savannah goats were in the quarantine pen in the lower barn. These goats\nwere born on December 1, 2022 and arrived at the facility on 6/29/23. The four seven month old male goats were banded\nupon their arrival by facility staff. No anesthetics or pain control medication were administered. The program of veterinary\ncare and the goat care SOP do not address castration methods/procedures for the goats. Castration of goats older than a\nfew weeks is considered a painful procedure.\nAdequate veterinary care including the use of appropriate methods to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries is\nnecessary to ensure the health and well-being of the animals and to ensure that the animals do not experience\nunnecessary pain.\nThe facility shall ensure the availability of adequate veterinary care to include the use of appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries and the availability of emergency care. In addition, correct by having the\nthree animals currently in need of veterinary care (goats 531 and 347 and rabbit RBT733) evaluated by a veterinarian.\nCorrect by 7/29/23."
