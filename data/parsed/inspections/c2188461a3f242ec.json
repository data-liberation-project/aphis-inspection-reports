      "narrative": "In the meeting minutes for the IACUC meeting held on April 23, 2019, the \"attending veterinarian report\" section\nmentions that an \"unexpected event\" occurred involving bats. The attending veterinarian explained to the APHIS\ninspector what happened to the bats. The bats were members of a breeding colony maintained by the facility. To\nprovide environmental enrichment for the animals, shade cloth is hung on the walls of the room that houses the\nbreeding colony. For the health and well-being of the bats, the shade cloth is taken down on a routine schedule to\nbe cleaned and sanitized. During this incident, after being taken down and folded, the shade cloth was taken to the\ncage wash room and left overnight to be washed the next day. When the shade cloth was unfolded the next\nmorning to be cleaned, three perished bats were found inside the cloth. The bats are presumed to have perished\ndue to being trapped in the folded shade cloth. Facility staff immediately reported the incident to the attending\nveterinarian.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThe attending veterinarian investigated the incident. As a result, the facility developed new procedures and\nretrained husbandry staff to ensure no bats are trapped in the shade cloth when it is taken down for the necessary\ncleaning and sanitation. No more bats have been harmed during subsequent shade cloth cleanings.\nThis item has been corrected by the registrant.\nThis inspection focused on records and was conducted with facility personnel on January 28 - 29, 2020. The exit\ninterview was conducted with facility personnel on January 30, 2020."
