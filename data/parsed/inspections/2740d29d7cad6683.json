The shelter had wooden pieces with sharp points sticking up off\nthe top of the roof. Another shelter in a wolf enclosure had caved into the ground. The wolves had dug tunnels\nunderneath the shelter which caused the shelter to fall into the tunnel. The shelter was crooked and the roof of the\nshelter had become displaced causing there to be an opening at the top and potentially exposing the inside of the\nshelter to the elements of the weather. Sharp points on the top of the shelter could cause injury to the animals that\nare walking across or laying on the top of the shelter. The roof of the shelter becoming displaced doesn't\nadequately protect the animals within the shelter from the elements of the weather. The shelters must be\nmaintained to protect the animals from injury and from the elements of the weather.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd of report."
