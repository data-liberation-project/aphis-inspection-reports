      "narrative": "In August 2017 the facility self-reported the following incident to the USDA. On June 1, 2017 an adult male\ncynomolgus macaque died unexpectedly during transport to necropsy after the conclusion of a MRI and PET scan\nprocedure. The IACUC self-identified that there was non-compliance with the facility\u2019s IACUC policies and a failure\nto follow the protocol. The animal was under anesthesia during the procedure and there were gaps in physiological\nmonitoring (i.e. Sp02, PR, RR, EtCO2, body temperature and BP) based on the records, which should have\noccurred every 15 minutes. For example, there were no entries on anesthetic monitoring recorded between 3:47 am\nand 4:26 am (39 minutes); there were no entries for temperature or EtCO2 from 3:47 am to 8:20 am (4 hours, 33\nminutes); and there was a lack of physiologic monitoring recorded between 7:00 am to 8:20 am (80 minutes). Also,\nthe animal experienced ongoing complications such as hypothermia, hypotension, wet lung sounds and fluid in the\nendotracheal tube during the anesthetic procedure. The first documented rectal temperature near the start of the\nprocedure at 3:47 am was recorded as 95.7 degrees F. Although a Bair Hugger had been placed on the animal\naround 4:25am, the next recorded temperature continued to be decreased at 94.8 degrees F at 8:20 am. Although\nthe animal\u2019s temperature began to slowly increase after this time, the animal\u2019s recorded SpO2 dropped to 85% at\n9:25 am (ranging 81%-91% from 9:25 am to 11:05 am) while previously being recorded mostly in the mid to upper\n90\u2019s. Wet lung sounds and removal of some fluid from the endotracheal tube were first documented by the\nlaboratory veterinary technician at 8:00 am. A veterinarian was contacted by phone by the PI approximately 6 hours\ninto the approximately 8 hour procedure, at which time the veterinarian\u2019s suggestions were followed. Although\ninterventional steps were taken, including assistance from the Division of Comparative Medicine's (DCM) veterinary\ntechnicians, and the laboratory staff felt the animal was stable, the animal\u2019s Sp02 values continued to be low and\nthe animal died before the planned euthanasia. The IACUC also determined that the on-call veterinary staff should\nhave been contacted prior to when a veterinarian had been called given the ongoing complications noted\nthroughout the procedure.\nBy monitoring and recording physiologic parameters during anesthetic procedures at regular intervals, and as\naccording to the protocol and facility\u2019s policies, changes in those parameters may be identified and addressed\nsooner. This can decrease possible negative effects on the health and well-being of the animal.\nThe research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to\nOLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Corrective\nactions taken include, but are not limited to, retraining of the PI and laboratory staff, requiring use of DCM\u2019s\nanesthesia monitoring record and a period of increased monitoring of the laboratory\u2019s physiological records. This\nitem has been corrected by the facility. The facility must ensure that it maintains programs of adequate veterinary\ncare that include guidance to principal investigators and other personnel involved in the care and use of animals\nregarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia at all times.\nThe inspection was conducted on August 23-25, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on August 25, 2017 with\nfacility representatives."
