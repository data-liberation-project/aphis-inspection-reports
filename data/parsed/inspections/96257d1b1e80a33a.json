Escape protocols were enacted, and staff\nwas secured in safe rooms and reported their safety status to the proper authorities. There was a total of seven chimps\nthat exited their containment during the incident. All chimpanzees were safely recovered via sedation or enticement into\ntheir bedrooms without further sedation. The escape was determined by a breach in the skylight wire mesh panel in their\nbedroom area that had not been secured appropriately. The sliding wire mesh panel can be locked or bolted shut below\nthe skylight cover and the mesh panels serve to secure the opening. Since the incident, it was determined that\nmaintenance staff did not place these bolts to protect the skylight cover from chimpanzee access. On Friday December\n3rd, all skylight locking points were assessed and ensured their security.\nAnimals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Gaining outside\naccess could result in animal or human injury. Housing facilities for non human primates shall be structurally sound and\nmaintained to protect and contain the animals securely."

      "narrative": "A 46 year old male chimpanzee, Midge, arrived to the facility in May 2019 and was introduced to a group of 12\nchimpanzees over a total of 4 days between August 27 and September 9 2019. Midge responded well in his group until\nAugust 2021 where animal care staff reported that he showed signs of diminished mobility. Veterinary staff determined it\nwas in his best interest to be temporarily single housed.\nOn August 16th, veterinary staff recommended that Midge continued to be single housed due to suspected aggression\nfrom his group mates. While single housed, he was treated for his medical conditions and began to show clinical\nimprovement; however, he continued to be singly housed.\nIn October, the behavior team initiated the discussion of re-introducing Midge to his social group. The decision was not\nunanimously supported by his animal care team due to aggression and compatibility concerns from his previous\ngroupmates. The behavior team made the final decision on re-introducing him to his former social group rather than\nputting him into a new location or remaining singly housed.\nThe reintroduction took place over a 4 week span (October 18 \u2013 November 17th). Initially, the re introduction took place\nwithout complications. Around November 12th, Midge began to show weakness and other signs of illness. The facility\nteams began discussion of a contingency plan for Midge if necessary. On November 18th, there was aggressive\ninteraction directed at Midge from another groupmate that resulted in trauma. The next day, Midge succumbed to his\ninjuries and was found deceased in his enclosure.\nSince this incident, the facility has been reviewing and revamping social introduction SOPs and evaluating the criteria for\nseparation of social groups. Compatibility of nonhuman primates must be determined in accordance with generally\naccepted professional practices and observations under the direction of the attending veterinarian and be done so in a\nmanner that does not cause harm or discomfort to the animals. In the future, decisions for social dynamics must be under\nthe approval of the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by: This day forward"
