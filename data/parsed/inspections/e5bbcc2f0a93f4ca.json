      "narrative": "A 4-year-old white-tailed deer buck named Rusty was found to be toe-touching lame on its left front leg. He was reluctant\nto get up or walk and when encouraged to do so, was slow to move and had a severe limp on the left front leg with visible\nswelling in the foot. He was isolating himself and seeking shelter under a low hanging tree branch within the pasture.\nAccording to the facility representative, Rusty had been injured in a fight with a 5-year old buck on September 9th. The\nfacility representative was carrying out food and water to him regularly and monitoring his recovery progress. However,\nRusty had not received any care from a veterinarian at the time of the inspection. (Note- Prior to the exit interview, the\nfacility representative contacted his attending veterinarian about Rusty and was following the AV's treatment plan until an\nexam can be conducted.)\nA brown doe fawn was observed to have abnormal amounts of loose brown fecal matter under her tail and anal region\nand was in thin body condition. According to the facility representative, this fawn has had diarrhea for a few weeks and\nhas always been on the thin side even though it is drinking from its mother. This fawn had not received any veterinary\ncare prior to the inspection.\nProviding prompt and adequate veterinary care to diagnose and treat any injuries and illnesses is necessary to prevent\nunnecessary pain and suffering. Additionally, there must be a plan for providing veterinary care for emergencies,\nweekends, and holidays. Correct by ensuring Rusty and the fawn are examined and diagnosed by a veterinarian and that\nthe treatment plan is followed according to their instructions.\nExpired drugs and medications including 1 bottle of enrofloxacin and 2 bottles of atipamezole were present during the\ninspection. The enrofloxacin had been used to treat an antler infection in a white-tailed deer buck a few weeks prior to the\ninspection. Expired medications may not be safe or effective and are not an appropriate method for the treatment or\nprevention of animal health issues. The facility must ensure that methods of treatment, including the medications\nmaintained for use in AWA-regulated animals, are appropriate. Correct by ensuring that all medications maintained for\nuse in regulated animals are appropriate methods for the treatment, control, or prevention of disease.\n***Correct by 5pm, Friday 9/27/24."
