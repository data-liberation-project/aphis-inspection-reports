The lack of\nwind/weather breaks on the doors can cause drafts and decrease the ability for the dogs to regulate their body\ntemperatures during the cold/wet season. This can be a source of possible health issues and discomfort if left\nunmanaged.\nThe licensee needs to provide alternative shade source within the run area that is large enough for the dogs to sit,\nstand and turn around in to protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Proper wind/weather breaks must be added\nto all dog houses for the dogs housed outside.\nTo be corrected by: November 30, 2015\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee."
