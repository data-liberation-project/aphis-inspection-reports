      "narrative": "There were 3 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of\nVeterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian.\nIn pen 22, there was a tricolor newborn guinea pig housed with 13 other guinea pigs. The newborn was lethargic\nand minimally responsive with sunken eyes that were crusted shut and the hair around the eye was wet with a clear\ndischarge. The animal was observed to be sitting in one position and not moving and exhibited limited reaction to\nbeing handled or when approached by other guinea pigs in the pen. In addition, the animal appeared to be\nbreathing with increased respiratory rate and effort.\nIn pen 56, there was a tricolor weanling with an eye abnormality. The right eye had a white cloudy film covering the\nmajority of the surface of the eye.\nIn pen 8, there was a white and gray newborn with an eye abnormality. The left eye was swollen and crusted shut.\nThe hair around the eye was wet with a clear discharge.\nAlso, there was a dead newborn embedded in the bedding of the enclosure in pen 12.\nThe licensee had not contacted the attending veterinarian regarding these guinea pigs and was not administering\nany treatments.\nNewborns that are lethargic and depressed with respiratory issues can rapidly worsen if not evaluated and treated.\nEye abnormalities can affect the vision, can be indicative of disease or injury, can be painful, and affect the overall\nhealth and well-being of the animal. Failure to identify and treat health conditions can lead to worsening of the\ncondition including death.\nThe licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an\nappropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.\nCorrect by: February 4, 2020"

However, the facility is performing its own euthanasia by blunt force trauma. This method does not\nmeet the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act which requires euthanasia to be performed by a method that\nproduces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or distress, or a method that\nutilizes anesthesia produced by an agent that causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death. They\nwere unsure of how many guinea pigs were euthanized this way but said it may have been as many as five animals\nin the last 6 months. The attending veterinarian was contacted and was not comfortable with the way the facility\nwas performing euthanasia and stated that the facility should be contacting him if animals need to be euthanized.\nFailure to utilize a method of euthanasia consistent with the attending veterinarian\u2019s guidance and according to the\nrequirements of the Animal Welfare Act is likely to result in unnecessary pain and suffering to the animals.\nThe facility must utilize a method of euthanasia approved by their attending veterinarian and that complies with the\nrequirements of the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect from this day forward"
