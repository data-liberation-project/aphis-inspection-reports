Pool water access points at Seal Cove that could allow ground water to flow into the pool were identified as a\nrisk for the introduction of pathogens at the time of the last inspection. At the time of this inspection one had been covered\nby a protective structure, and a second was addressed during the inspection by installing cover, but a third entry point\nremains unaddressed. Additionally, trees overhanging a water tower which could allow debris to enter the system were\ndiscussed at the last inspection, but the situation had not been adequately addressed at the time of this inspection\n(although branches were trimmed during this inspection, and a plan was made to remove the trees in the near future).\nThe coliform bacteria count for a primary enclosure pool should not exceed 1,000. Coliform counts as high as those\ndocumented recently in the pinniped pools are unhealthy for marine mammals. The facility must maintain water quality\nwhich is not detrimental to the health and the well-being of the animals, and must ensure that appropriate and effective\ncorrective and preventive actions are taken when high coliform counts, or other water quality concerns are detected.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nLAURIE GAGE, BIG CAT SPECIALIST\nGustavo Soberano, Assistant DirectorEnd Section"
