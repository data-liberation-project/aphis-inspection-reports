The facility currently has 2 donkey\u2019s roaming\npasture 14 and 1 donkey in pasture 11 to watch over the herds.\nThe doe incurred lacerations to her tail, and a small puncture to her caudal abdominal region. The goat received\ntimely veterinary care and is doing well.\nThe facility representative stated that the thick brush in their pastures was due to the large amount of rainfall during\nspring 2019. After the attack, on June 11, 2019, farm personnel cleared approximately 75 feet of brush on each side\nof each pasture, for approximately 150 feet of total clearance, allowing for better visibility of these areas to prevent\npredation. The facility is continuing to clear the surrounding pastures as well as taking additional safety/\nprecautionary measures for the safety of their herd.\nA system should be in place to ensure outdoor housing facilities are maintained in a manner that protects the\nanimals from injury.\nTo be corrected from this day,6/28/2019, forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
