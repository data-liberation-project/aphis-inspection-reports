The protocol did not address the\npotential issues with erythema in the animals. No monitoring system or plan for alleviation of any erythema effects if noted\nwas included in the protocol.\nA complete description of the use of the animals is necessary in a protocol to ensure that all research staff and IACUC\nmembers are aware of the details regarding the study activities being conducted on the animals and the parameters in\nplace to assure the health and comfort of the animals. In addition, the IACUC members need a complete description to\nunderstand the proposed use of the animals in order to approve the protocol and to assure compliance with regulatory\nrequirements.\nThe studies referenced in the above protocols have all been completed.
