For testing, two rabbits or guinea pigs will be used per antigen, but\nthe number of antigens tested in a given time period is not identified, while for commercial quantities the number of\nanimals depends on the quantity of antiserum requested by the company (market -driven). The protocols (1C & 8)\nhave similar rationale, starting with 1 sheep or goat for testing, and as many as needed to produce antibodies for\ncommercial projects. The approximate total number of animals is not identified in the protocols.\nThe IACUC should ensure that a proposal to conduct activities involving animals includes the appropriate\ninformation prior to approving the proposal. The approximate number of animals the study proposes to use during a\nspecific time period is important for the IACUC to assess and approve. Additionally, any significant changes (such\nas the total number of animals used) to activities should have IACUC approval prior to implementation.\nIACUC oversight is intended to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.

The protocol specified the minimum size of the animal and the blood collection schedule (volume\nevery two weeks), but did not ensure that the blood collection protocols do not exceed the industry standard of\n7-10% of species specific total blood volume every two weeks.\nFor example, the IACUC protocol requires rabbits weigh 2.5 Kgs at the initiation of the protocol, and production\nbleeds are 20 mls and up to two bleeds in two weeks can be performed if the condition and health of the animal\nallow. Rabbits have a mean blood volume of 62 mls/Kg, so total blood volume for a 2.5 Kg rabbit is 155 mls and 20\nmls is 13% of total blood volume.\nThe IACUC Goat protocol requires goats weigh 35 Kg at the initiation of the study and calls for 500 ml production\nbleeds typically every two weeks and up to two bleeds in two weeks can be performed if the condition and health of\nthe animal allow. Goats have a mean blood volume of 70 mls/Kg, so a 35 Kg goat would have a total blood volume\nof 2,450 mls and 500 mls is 20% of total blood volume.\nThe IACUC protocol does not define what steps are taken to determine that the health and condition of the animal\nare sufficient for weekly bleeds, such as monitoring packed cell volume or weight. The facility maintains records of\nanimal blood collection, but no record of animal weights, therefore the amount of blood drawn from an individual\nanimals may exceed what is safe and adversely affect their health and well-being.\nA complete description of activities using animals must be included in protocols prior to IACUC approval. The facility\nshould ensure that all protocols contain complete descriptions of animal use in order to assess how the procedures\nwill affect the animals health."
