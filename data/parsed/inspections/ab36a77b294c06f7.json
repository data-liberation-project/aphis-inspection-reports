      "narrative": "1.There is a male Japanese Chin type dog approximately 10 years of age named 'Ki Jack' that does not have official\nidentification. The dog has an accumulation of greenish-colored mucus covering both eyes. Not having clear vision\ncan cause discomfort and affect the health and well being of the dog. The presence of eye discharge can be a sign\nof injury, infection or other potentially painful veterinary medical conditions. The potential for injury exists if the dog\nis not able to see clearly.\nThe dog was also observed having matted hair on his abdomen. The matted hair area is approximately 1 inch wide\nand 4 inches long. Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal. In addition, matting can foster skin\ninfections and can hinder the animal's ability to move of defecate normally. The licensee needs to remove the\nmatted fur on the dog. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must establish and follow a\nprogram of regular coat maintenance for all of the dogs to prevent the development of excessive matting.\nOn the dog's nose there is a crusty appearance of scabbing caused by numerous fly bites. Fly bites to the nose can\nlead to open sores which can cause further disease risks or infection for the dog. Left untreated it could delay the\nhealing process affecting the health and well being for the dog. Fly bites need to receive veterinary care to prevent\nfurther fly biting and then the nose can start to heal.\n2. There is a tan colored male cocker spaniel named ' Poo Bear' with no official identification. The dog has an open\nwound on the back of its neck. The wound is approximately 3.5 inches in length and 1.5 inches wide. There is dried\nblood on the wound and around the edges in the fur coat. The cause of this injury is unknown. The open wound can\nbe painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health and well being of the\ndog.\nAround the dog's nose there is a sore caused by fly bites that is open and areas where the wound is starting to\nappear dried and crusty. Pieces of fur are stuck to the moist portions of the wound. Fly bites to the nose can lead to\nopen sores which can cause further disease risks or infection for the dog. Left untreated it could delay the healing\nprocess affecting the health and well being for the dog. Fly bites need to receive veterinary care to prevent further\nfly biting and then the nose can start to heal.\n3. There is a male golden retriever named 'Henry James' with an open wound approximately 3 inches in diameter\non top of its left ear. The wound appears moist with a bright red and pink color. There is a hairless area outlining the\nwound. The licensee believes a pickup camper shell that blew into the enclosure during a storm struck the dog\ncausing the wound. The open wound can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection\nwhich affects the health and well being of the dog.\n*The licensee must have the above animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plan. The outcome of these consultations must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request.\nTo be corrected by: August 29, 2014."
