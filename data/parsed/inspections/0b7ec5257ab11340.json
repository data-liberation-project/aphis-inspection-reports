Facility representative stated the\ninjury started as a small injury on the lower leg and after it healed when the animal put weight on it the bone protruded\nthrough. Veterinary care was not provided after bone was seen. Attempts were made to place the cavy in a travel carrier,\nbut facility was not able to do so and the Attending veterinarian was not contacted. The attending veterinarian came 6\nmonths after the first injury was seen and performed a walkthrough the facility on March 9, 2023. The attending\nveterinarian recommended that the facility take the Patagonian Cavy to the local veterinarian hospital for diagnostics and\npossible surgery. The cavy was euthanized at the veterinary hospital. The facility also elected to transfer their Patagonian\nCavy population to another licensed facility to better care for their animals. Injuries and any abnormalities seen must be\nreported to the Attending veterinarian as soon as they are noticed. Daily observation of all animals and direct and frequent\ncommunication with the attending veterinarian is required so that care can be provided in a timely matter. Corrected at the\ntime of inspection."
