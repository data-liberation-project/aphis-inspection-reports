In the first enclosure on\nthe left of the building, there was a pregnant, dark brown and white smooth hair guinea pig with an abnormal left\neye. The surface of the eye was uniformly cloudy throughout with a whitish-gray circular band in the center. The\nanimal was not squinting nor was discharge observed.\nThe abnormal conditions of the eye described above can result from a variety of causes including trauma and\ndisease. When left untreated eye problems are often significantly painful and can progress quickly resulting in\nunnecessary suffering, and possibly impairment of vision or even loss of the eye due to rupture. Correct by having\nthe affected animal listed above examined by a licensed a veterinarian to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment of\nthis conditions as well as to ensure that spread of the condition to other animals is prevented if infectious in nature.\nThe licensee shall maintain documentation of this examination and all veterinary recommendations for review by\nAPHIS Officials.\nThe seven animals that were previously cited on the last inspection were not examined by a licensed veterinarian\nnor received a diagnosis or treatment plan. Instead, these animals along with 13 other guinea pigs were sold to\nanother licensee. Failure to have the previous animals examined and diagnosed could result in the spread of an\ninfectious disease or condition in the remaining colony.\nRemains uncorrected."
