There is no attendant supervising at the time of inspection to prevent inappropriate contact\nbetween the public and the animal. Zabu experiences these stressors every day the facility is open to the public (eight\nhours, six days per week and six hours, one day per week).\nMaintaining animals under conditions that foster distress for prolonged periods of time is detrimental to their health and\nwell-being and can cause physical and behavioral problems.
