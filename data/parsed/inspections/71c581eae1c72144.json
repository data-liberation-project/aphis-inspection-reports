The\nlicensee must remove the feces from the enclosures every day and as often as necessary to prevent the excessive\nbuildup of feces in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.\nTo be corrected by: From this day forward\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
