There is hair loss along the underside of said foot\nwith old scarring, and hair thinning along the top side. The animal is slow to move at times, but otherwise appears to be in\ngood condition. After speaking with the caretakers, it was noted that all the animals were fed and checked earlier in the\nmorning. Another set of daily observations were to begin later in the afternoon. The first caretaker did not notice the\nlump/bleeding when he picked it up to check it earlier in the morning. Failure to notice injuries and/or medical issues, can\nlead to unnecessary discomfort, negatively impact the overall well-being of the animal, and even death.
