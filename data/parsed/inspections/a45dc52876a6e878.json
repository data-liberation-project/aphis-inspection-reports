The licensee did not know when this began, and said\nthey have treated something similar in the dog in the past.\nEye injuries and/or diseases can be painful, and deteriorate quickly if left untreated. The licensee must have the\ndog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, and follow the treatment plan prescribed by the veterinarian.\nTO BE CORRECTED: A facility representative contacted the veterinarian and scheduled an appointment before the\ninspection concluded.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and ACI Bartels."
