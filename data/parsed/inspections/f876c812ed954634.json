The dog was freed from the flooring by a facility representative approximately 2 minutes later. When the inspector\nexamined the toes, the dog pulled back from the inspector's touch likely due to tenderness. The toes were slightly\nreddened with a small 2mm abrasion with deeper reddened tissue on one of toes. The dog had a mild limp and was\nbearing some weight on that foot. The flooring was plastic coated diamond tenderfoot flooring with 1/2\" by 3/4\" openings.\nCleaning staff had left this building approximately 11am and the inspector identified the toes caught at 12:36pm. Another\nfacility representative stated that this does happen about two times a year.\nThe dog's toes being trapped in the flooring lead to distress of the animal and a soft tissue abrasion with limping. Primary\nenclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects\nthe dogs' and cats' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' and cats'\nfeet to pass through any openings in the floor.\nTo be corrected by: 23-October-2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
