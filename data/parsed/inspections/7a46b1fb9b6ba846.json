      "narrative": "Whelping Building - West Room\nThere are seven enclosures (A,C,D,E,G,I,J) along the west wall with each having floor space measuring\napproximately 48\u201d x 48\u201d (16 square ft).\nEnclosure A contains 5 spaniels with one measuring 25\u201d from nose to base of tail. The minimum floor space\nrequired for one dog of this size is 6.7 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not\nmeet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.\nEnclosure C contains 4 spaniels with one measuring 24\u201d from nose to base of tail. The minimum floor space\nrequired for one dog of this size is 6.3 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not\nmeet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.\nEnclosure D contains 4 spaniels with one measuring 26\u201d from nose to base of tail. The minimum floor space\nrequired for one dog of this size is 7.1 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not\nmeet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.\nEnclosure G contains 9 spaniels with one measuring 24\u201d from nose to base of tail. The minimum floor space\nrequired for one dog of this size is 6.3 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not\nmeet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.\nEnclosure I contains 6 spaniels with one measuring 25\u201d. The minimum floor space required for one dog of this size\nis approximately 6.7 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not meet USDA\nminimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.\nEnclosure J contains 6 spaniels with one measuring 23\u201d. The minimum floor space required for one dog of this size\nis approximately 5.8 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not meet USDA\nminimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.\nWhelping Building \u2013 East Room\nThere are 4 enclosures (5,6,8,9) along the east wall with floor space measurements of approximately 48\u201d x 80\u201d\n(26.7 square ft).\nEnclosure 5 contains 4 spaniels of approximate same size, with one measuring 27\u201d from tail base to nose. The\nminimum floor space required for one dog of this size is approximately 7.6 square ft. The floor space of the\nenclosure does not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in\nthe enclosure.\nEnclosures 6 and 8 each contain 4 spaniels of approximate same size as the one measured from enclosure 5. The\nminimum floor space required for one dog of this size is approximately 7.6 square ft. The floor spaces of these\nenclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in\nthe enclosures.\nEnclosure 9 contains 4 spaniels of approximate same size with one measuring 27\u201d from tail base to nose. The\nminimum floor space required for one dog of this size is approximately 8 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure\ndoes not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the\nenclosure.\nNursery Building -\nNursery Building Room 1 \u2013 There are 6 open top enclosures located on the north wall containing a total of 27 dogs\nat the time of inspection. Twelve of the dogs are spaniels and appear to be of the same age and size. The open top\nenclosures allow dogs to freely jump from enclosure to enclosure and this was observed multiple times during the\ninspection. The enclosures measure approximately 36\u201d x 36\u201d in floor length and width. The calculated floor space\nfor these enclosures is approximately 9 square feet. One of the spaniels from the first kennel on the NW side\nmeasured approx. 28\u201d from nose tip to base of tail. A dog this size requires approximately 8 square feet of floor\nspace to meet USDA requirements. The floor space of these enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space\nrequirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosures. Additionally, three 24\u201d x 36\u201d wire\nenclosures located in the southeast corner of the room were observed to be overcapacity.\nNursery Building Room 2 - There are 5 open top enclosures located on the north wall containing a total of 28 dogs\nat the time of inspection. These enclosures measure approximately 36\u201d x 48\u201d in floor length and width. The\ncalculated floor space for these enclosures is approximately 12 square feet each. The open top enclosures in room\n2 also allow dogs to freely jump from enclosure to enclosure and this was observed multiple times during the\ninspection. Twelve of the dogs observed in the enclosures were spaniels of approximate age and size as the\nspaniel measured in Room 1. A dog this size requires approximately 8 square feet of floor space to meet USDA\nrequirements. The floor space of these enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number\nand size of dogs currently housed in the enclosures.\nNursery Building Room 4 (South Room) \u2013 Along the south wall of the room there are four enclosures with floor\nspace of each enclosure measuring approximately 36\u201d x 60\u201d. Each enclosure currently houses 3 adult spaniels.\nOne of the enclosures also contains a Scottish Terrier. Additionally, there is one enclosure located in the southeast\ncorner with floor space of approximately 36\u201d x 96\u201d that contains 4 adult spaniels. The floor space of these five\nenclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in\nthe enclosures. Additionally, there are two enclosures located along the north wall of the room that also appear\novercapacity.\nNursery Building \u2013 Northeast Room - There are three stacked wire enclosures along the north side of the room that\neach have a floor space measuring 24\u201d x 24\u201d (4 square ft). The top enclosure contains two Scottish Terrier puppies\nand the middle enclosure contains four Scottish Terrier puppies. Tail base to nose measurement of one of the\npuppies is 19\u201d. Each puppy this size requires a minimum floor space of 2.5 square feet to meet current USDA\nrequirements. The floor space of the enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number\nand size of dogs currently housed in the enclosures.\nNursery Building \u2013 Northeast Room - There are six enclosures located on the top row of banked enclosures on the\nwest wall of the room. The top left enclosure floor space measures 24\u201d x 24\u201d (4 square ft) and contains three\npuppies. One puppy measures 20\u201d from nose to tail base and requires approximately 4.7 square of space to meet\nUSDA requirements. The enclosure immediately to the right measures 24\u201d x 24\u201d and contains four puppies. One\nof the puppies measures 18\u201d. A puppy this size requires 4 square ft of floor space to meet USDA requirements. The\ntop right enclosure floor space measures 24\u201d x 24\u201d and contains 5 puppies. The floor space of the three enclosures\ndo not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the\nenclosures.\nInadequate enclosure space can cause undue stress to dogs occupying the enclosures. Overcrowding may lead to\nfighting, increased competition for food, inadequate food intake, inability to make normal postural adjustments, and\nincreased susceptibility to disease and disease spread. Each dog housed in a primary enclosure (including weaned\npuppies) must be provided a minimum amount of floor space, calculated as follows: Find the mathematical square\nof the sum of the length of the dog in inches (measured from the tip of the nose to base of tail, plus six inches) then\ndivide the product by 144. This is the required floor space per dog in square feet.\nThe facility needs to formulate a corrective action plan and schedule for reducing stocking density in all enclosures\nthat do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs being housed. The plan and\nschedule should be submitted to the USDA no later than 7 days from the date of receipt of this report."
