Some of the feces had started to form a moving mass that looked like maggots. The excreta and\nfood wastes were attracting flies. The accumulation of feces increases the risk of disease by attracting pests and\nproviding an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must ensure that excreta and food waste are\nremoved from primary enclosures daily and from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an\nexcessive accumulation of feces and food waste in order to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors."
