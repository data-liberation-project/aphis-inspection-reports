Personnel working with marmosets must be trained on marmoset behavior and how to appropriately\nhandle the animals in an escape situation.\nCorrection: The Standard Operating Procedure for \"Marmoset Husbandry and Maintenance\" was revised and all\npersonnel involved in marmoset care were trained on the new procedures. Training emphasized keeping calm and\ncontacting the supervisor for assistance in the safe return of an escaped marmoset.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives."
