Record review and veterinary\nstaff confirmed that either Bupenorphine had not yet been used or that appropriate dosages and frequency of\nadministration were used when Bupenorphine was given under these protocols. IACUC review and approval of\nprotocols containing analgesics should include accurate dosages, frequency of use and duration to provide safe and\ntherapeutic use of pain relieving drugs in the animals.\nCorrect by: April 13, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC manager and a clinical veterinarian.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBoone Bonnie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
