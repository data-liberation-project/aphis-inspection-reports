      "narrative": "Two rabbits underwent implant surgery under protocol 6629 on July 30, 2015. The next day, the surgical wounds\nwere noted to have dehisced. One animal (1507) was euthanized as a result of the adverse event. The other animal\nunderwent an unscheduled surgery to repair the wound. It was subsequently determined that in the original\nprocedures the surgeon did not close the wounds in multiple layers as required by the protocol. Surgical technique\nerror, unrelated to training, was identified as the primary cause of the adverse event. Documentation review showed\nthat the incident was reported to the IACUC, identified as a serious non-compliance by the IACUC and appropriately\nmanaged by the IACUC and the facility prior to this inspection.\nProtocol 5795 requires weighing animals at least twice weekly during specific water restriction activities. One animal\n(RQ9229) was water restricted on July 11-14, 2016. On July 17, 2016 the animal was noted to have behavior\nchanges. This animal was weighed on July 11 and July 17. No definitive diagnosis was determined as a cause for\nthe behavior changes. However, weights during water restricted activities as a tool to monitor hydration status were\nnot performed according to the protocol schedule.\nDeviation from approved requirements and procedures can result in unnecessary animal pain, suffering and\ndistress. The IACUC must continue to review ongoing activities as often as necessary to ensure compliance with\nprotocols. Correct by: Immediate.\nThe inspection was conducted over a two day period 09/12/16 and 9/13/16 with CCM and RCS staff. The exit\ninterview was conducted with the IACUC chair, CCM director, AV, clinical veterinarians and RCS."
