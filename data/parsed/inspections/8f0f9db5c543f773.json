The facility plans to re-home the dog, but in the meantime no treatment \nis being provided to help this dog return to a normal body weight.  \nDogs who are severely underweight may suffer from hunger, stress, discomfort resting on hard surfaces, difficulty \nmaintaining body temperature, and poor absorption of vitamins.  \nCorrect by providing adequate veterinary care to ensure proper nutrition and body weight for all dogs, including the timely \nidentification of dogs loosing body weight, prompt communication with the AV, and follow-up with the attending \nveterinarian when dogs do not improve after treatments or interventions. \n2.33(b)(3)  Direct\n   \nAttending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.\n\nMultiple dogs were identified with medical issues that had not been identified by the facility prior to the inspection: \n***In Building 3, an adult white and brown pointer mix (\u201cAnnie\u201d) is sneezing. The facility representative stated that they \nhad not observed the dog\u2019s respiratory problem prior to the inspection.  \n***An 11-year-old neutered male Weimaraner (\u201cAtrox\u201d, microchip #985112005669633) was observed to have a pink, \nhairless, approximately 1-inch diameter skin lesion on the right front leg, near the wrist (carpus). The skin lesion was not \nobserved prior to the inspection per medical records and the facility representative. \n***An 11-year-old Golden Retriever (\"Amanda\", microchip #985112004242013) was observed to have a significant \namount of dark, black material accumulated in both ears and to shake her head.   The medical record does not contain \nany record regarding this condition. \n*** A 12-year-old Golden Retriever (\"Rio\", microchip #956000005266129), was observed to have a dark, malodorous \nmaterial accumulated on both ears with soft, fluctuant swelling of the left ear and hard, misshapen right ear and exhibiting \nhead-shaking.  Per the medical record, this dog had a swelling in ear on 04/01/2021 and \"ear hematoma right ear w/ \nmoderate debris\" on 04/12/21.  Per the facility represented, the hematoma was removed by the AV. On 08/25/22, an \nevaluation by the AV found yeast and cocci and minimal smell.  Zymox drops were prescribed for 10 days, then white \nvinegar/water solution 1-2 times weekly, and to keep watch.  At the time of inspection, then facility representative stated \nthat the dog had a previous ear issue, got better and was not on treatment. \n \nDaily observation of animals for health or behavior problems is essential for the prompt identification and treatment of \nthese problems. Animals who have problems that are not promptly identified by the facility and conveyed to the attending \nveterinarian may suffer from discomfort, pain, stress, and even death.\n\nCorrect by 9/30/22 by ensuring that daily observations are conducted of all animals, and that abnormalities are reported \npromptly to the Attending Veterinarian. \n2.35(b) \n   \nRecordkeeping requirements. \nThe facility has incomplete records of dog acquisition and disposition.  \n109 dogs are listed on the facility\u2019s inventory, while only 97 dogs are present on the property. Some dogs who have died \nor been euthanized in the last year have not been marked off the inventory. A few dogs do not have any ID number \nrecorded on the inventory. \nThere is paperwork for a dog named \u201cBella\u201d in the medical records, but it is unclear where the dog originated from or if it is \nstill on the property. The records show the dog coming from a Humane Society, but the name of an individual is also listed \non the record as well. This dog is not listed on the facility\u2019s inventory.  \nComplete and accurate records of dogs acquired, born on site, sold, transferred, or died is important for locating lost or \nstolen dogs and tracing dogs in the event of a disease outbreak. Correct by 10/30/22 by maintaining complete and \naccurate records that disclose all of the information required in the Animal Welfare Act. \n2.38(l)(1) \n   \nMiscellaneous. \nThe facility's written contingency plan has not been updated since 2013, and contains the names and contact information \nfor personnel who longer work at the facility. The contingency plan also fails to address who in the chain of command is \nresponsible for fulfilling specific tasks, and does not address feeding of dogs in \"protracted severe weather\" events. \nContingency plans must outline specific tasks to be carried out during the events or scenarios identified in the plan, so \nthat personnel can prepare and train for these tasks. Correct by 10/30/22 by ensuring that the contingency plan for the \nfacility contains all of the elements required under the Animal Welfare Act.\n\n2.38(l)(3) \n   \nMiscellaneous. \nThe facility has not documented any training of staff or personnel on the contents of the contingency plan. Training of \npersonnel is essential for execution of the plan in the event of emergencies. Correct by 10/30/22 by documenting training \nfor all employees and key personnel on the contents of the contingency plan. \n3.1(a)  Repeat\n   \nHousing facilities, general. \nNumerous areas of the facility are in a state of disrepair: \n***There are 8 broken or non-functional guillotine doors in dog kennels housing dogs in Building 1. There is one broken \nguillotine door in a dog kennel housing a dog in the \u201cRetirement building\u201d. These guillotine doors are used to separate the \nindoor and outdoor sections of each dog kennel. Broken doors can injure the animals, and can make it difficult to maintain \nadequate temperatures within the building during periods of inclement weather. \n***In Building 3, the outdoor portion of a kennel has a chain link gate that is being held closed with a broken, rusted clip \nand chain. This kennel contains 1 adult yellow lab and 1 adult chocolate lab; both dogs are very energetic and were seen \njumping on the gate. Gates that are not held closed securely may break open, permitting animals to escape which can \nresult in injury.  \n***In the two outdoor exercise pens at the front of the property, there are areas of chain link fencing that are not in good \nrepair. The pen on the left side (as seen from the road in front of the property), which contained an adult female \nRottweiler, has approximately 4-foot tall chain link fencing in which a top bar section of fence has become disconnected \nfrom support posts. The same issue is also present in a section of the fence of the exercise yard between Building 1 and \nthe road. \nFacilities that are not maintained in good repair can cause injuries to the animals, animal escapes, or may permit entry of\n\nunauthorized animals.  \nCorrect by maintaining facilities in good repair so that they are structurally sound, protect the animals from injury, contain \nthe animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. \n3.1(c)(2) \n   \nHousing facilities, general. \nNumerous hard plastic dog platforms/beds within the kennels appear to be severely damaged due to chewing, resulting in \nsharp areas, irregular surfaces and holes. Dogs may cut their paws on sharp surfaces,  Surfaces that are irregular cannot \nbe thoroughly cleaned and sanitized, resulting in accumulation of organic matter or germs. Correct by 10/20/22 by \nmaintaining all surfaces on a regular basis and by replacing surfaces when they are worn or soiled. \n3.1(f) \n   \nHousing facilities, general. \nTwo long, rectangular, tapered floor drains in the front of Building 1 had a large amount of standing water with debris was \npresent in the drain.  The entire drains were affected, with up to approximately 2 inches of water was present throughout \nthe length of each drain. Facility staff stated that these drains had been backed up since the weekend. Drains that do not \nwork properly can cause odors and attract pests. Correct by 10/1/22 by maintaining drains properly, so that waste and \nwastewater is rapidly eliminated from the facility. \n3.6(a)(2)(ix) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nMany outdoor areas of sheltered (indoor/outdoor) kennels have concrete floors that are cracked. In Building One, on the \nside of the building closest to the road, every outdoor run had a cracked floor of various widths. Two of these cracks were \nalso associated with chipping of the concrete such that the underlying non-sealed rock aggregate was exposed. In \nBuilding 3, on the right side, every outdoor run had a cracked floor. Cracks in the floor and unsealed areas resulting from\n\nthem may harbor organic material, parasites or germs that can be harmful to the dogs, and can be difficult or impossible \nto clean and sanitize. Correct by 11/01/22 by maintaining surfaces, including floors, that can be properly cleaned and \nsanitized. \n3.12  Direct\n   \nEmployees \nThis facility does not have enough employees to maintain the minimum level of care required by the Animal Welfare Act. \nThere were numerous deficiencies identified involving animal husbandry, daily observation of animals, provision of vet \ncare, recordkeeping, and facility maintenance. Dogs were identified with serious medical problems that were not identified \nor not communicated to the AV. According to the kennel manager, there are 3 employees who clean the kennels; one \nemployee who performs facility maintenance on 3 aging buildings in addition to doing some hands-on animal care; and \nthe kennel manager herself. The kennel manager is responsible for the daily care of over 90 dogs (many of whom are \ngeriatric), including administering medications, identifying health problems, maintaining medical records, taking dogs to \nthe vet, grooming and bathing dogs, feeding, and conducting and documenting research projects. She also serves as the \nIACUC Chair. \nFacilities without adequate staffing cause animals to suffer from lack of care, poor management, and exposure to \ninadequately maintained facilities.  \nCorrect by 10/10/22 by employing enough personnel to carry out the level of husbandry and care required to ensure the \nwell-being of animals at the facility and achieve adequate functioning of the buildings, enclosures, and grounds. \n3.13(a)(3)  Direct\n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nThe written program of veterinary care does not include a schedule for sampling for internal, external, or blood parasites. \nReview of medical records showed fecal and heartworm testing is often performed at the time of a dog's annual physical\n\nexam, and numerous dogs have recently been found to test positive for hookworms and whipworms including: \n***Dealer (microchip #900215003196982), whipworms, 5/13/22 (treated, no follow up documented) \n***Peyton (microchip #981020039681862), hookworms, 5/26/22 (no treatment documented) \n***Atrox (microchip #985112005669633), hookworms and whipworms, 5/6/22 (treated, no follow up documented) \nThe written program of veterinary care must include a schedule for sampling and treatment for parasites and other pests \n(including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm) in accordance with a schedule approved by the AV, unless \notherwise required by a research protocol approved by the Committee at research facilities. Given the frequent \noccurrence of hookworms and whipworms in dogs at this facility, the presence of chronically thin dogs, the warm climate, \nand large dirt exercise yards the dogs are regularly placed in, it is essential to have an effective plan in place to prevent, \ndetect, and treat for parasites. Correct by 10/15/22 by documenting a program of veterinary care for dogs that includes all \nrequired elements under the Animal Welfare Act. \n3.13(b)(3) \n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nNumerous dogs receive medication on a daily basis for chronic medical conditions, but medical records do not contain \ndates that the medication is administered. An adult female Rottweiler (\u201cIsa\u201d) is given carprofen every day, but this is not \nrecorded in her medical record. Dogs are given a heartworm preventative medication each month, but this is not \nconsistently recorded in the dogs medical records. Medical records are important because they document treatments \ngiven and help prevent missed or duplicate treatments for a given animal. Correct by ensuring that future treatments are \ndocumented in the medical record for each dog including the date, dose, and type of medications given.  Correct by \n09/30/2022 \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\n\nAdditional Inspectors: \nDIANA CARE, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n",
