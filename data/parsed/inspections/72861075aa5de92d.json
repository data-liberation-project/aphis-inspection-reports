While the majority of matts are loose around the body, the matts covering their eyes need to be\ntrimmed to allow the animals to see properly and to avoid causing discomfort and agitation to their eyes and body .\nSherry's' eyes are red and raw in appearance with a clear watery discharge that appears to be from the hair being\npulled by the matts surrounding her eyes. She also has multiple 'gummy' type matts all over her legs, feet and head\nthat need to be trimmed.\nMatted hair can cause pain and discomfort if left to tighten due to lack of trimming. Dirt and debris can be caught up\nin the matts and provide a source of infection or irritation to the animal, especially if around the eyes, nose and\nmouth.\nThe licensee must keep all regulated animals hair coats trimmed and orderly as often as necessary to prevent matts\nfrom developing and to trim around the eyes if the hair or matts collect causing vision loss and/or irritation. The\nveterinarian needs to be contacted about the eye condition for the named Sherry.\nTo be corrected by: May 12, 2014 for Sherry\nMay 19, 2014 for Robert and Julie\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee."
