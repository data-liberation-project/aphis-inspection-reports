They were noted spinning around and\njumping about in their pen instead of calmly moving out of the pen. One adult male employee dressed in a brown T\nshirt was noted lifting his right leg completely off the ground and kicking one of the llamas repeatedly in the right\nside and ventral abdomen and yelling at it. Other llamas also received kicks to speed along their movement.\n*Also during observation of the moving of the llamas and alpacas for auction, one young boy in a blue and white\ncheckered woven shirt was noted carrying a white plastic guide pole. Randomly every now and then he was noted\njabbing a llama or alpaca through the enclosure bars with the pole. He and a couple of other boys then came up to\na llama in the aisle. He hit the llama on the head with the pole and then when the llama tried to run away he chased\nit hitting it on its back and rump with the pole.\nKicking, jabbing and hitting of animals results in behavioral stress, discomfort and possible injury to the animals. All\nanimals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.

On Friday one very young brown\nexotic bovine calf (#4038) was noted with rapid respiration. It tried to find some shade where the bars created\nstriped shadows. The calf(cid:25)'s respiratory rate was 122 breaths per minute in the early afternoon. The attending\nveterinarian was asked and also considered this rate above normal.
