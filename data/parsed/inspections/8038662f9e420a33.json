The pen was very muddy and the camels were caked with mud along\ntheir feet, legs and hocks. According to the licensee the animals have been housed in the pen for the past two\nweeks. This area of PA has received significant amounts of rain with rain expected in the forecast the next day. A\nshelter shall be provided for all animals housed outdoors to afford protection from the elements.\n*** The shelter area in the main park was housing a large watusi that had been aggressive earlier in the day and\nwas now being separated from the other park animals. This closed off the only shelter for inclement weather to any\nother park animals. There was a gap that allowed the pot bellied pigs to get into the shelter, but once in, there was\nno separation from a potentially aggressive watusi. Additional shelters should be available for the animals that\nchoose to use them to remain dry during inclement weather.\nCorrect by: June 25, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee via phone.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGladue Paula, Veterinary Medical Officer"
