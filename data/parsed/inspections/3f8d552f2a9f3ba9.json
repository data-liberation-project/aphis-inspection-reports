      "narrative": "During today's inspection, the inspectors monitored instructions being given to the public at the admittance kiosk\nand then monitored interactions of the public with the animals both on the employee driven tractor/trailer and with\nthe public driving their own vehicles through the drive thru portion of the park. Upon paying their admittance fees,\nthe public was instructed not to leave their vehicle. They were then given instructions verbally on how to feed the\ndifferent species including the instruction to feed the zebras only by dropping feed onto the ground. There were no\nsigns noted anywhere on the premises or on any handouts to advise the public how to interact with the animals. In\nthe drive thru part of the park, numerous instances were observed where there was more than a minimal risk of\nharm to the animals and/or to the public as a sufficient distance and/or barrier between the animal and the public\nwere not maintained:\n*The tractor/trailer with about 20 people on it stopped. Animals surrounded the trailer. Several elk pushed their\nupper body over a wooden gate at the back of the trailer and into the trailer itself. Several people at this end of the\ntrailer were noted jumping up and pushing further into the interior of the trailer as the elk pushed their heads and\nupper body into the trailer.\n*Private vehicles were noted with windows open and the people inside placing their arms and hands outside of the\nvehicle to hand feed and pet animals including bison, zebra, elk, deer and llamas. Occasionally a person would put\ntheir head outside the window to look at the animals more closely. No responsible, knowledgeable and readily\nidentifiable employee or attendant was present at the time.\n*Private vehicles were noted with windows completely open and the animals including llamas, bison, elk and deer\nplacing their entire head and necks into the window openings. No responsible, knowledgeable and readily\nidentifiable employee or attendant was present at the time.\n*A pickup truck holding two adults in the front seat had two additional teenagers sitting in beach type lounge chairs\nin the bed of the pickup truck. They were feeding animals from the bed of the pickup truck. Animals were\nsurrounding the bed of the truck.\nLack of sufficient barriers or distance between the animals and the public can lead to injury including potential bites\nor scratches to the public and injury to the animals. Animals may be injured in open windows especially those\nspecies with antlers/horns or by being fed something other than the feed being sold by the facility. During public\nexhibitions, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general viewing public or a responsible\nknowledgeable and readily identifiable attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact in\norder to assure the safety of animals and the public.
