A female marmoset being treated at the facility showed significant signs of decline on\nJanuary 13, 2014 but this information was not conveyed to the veterinarian until the following morning at 8:26 by\nemail. The veterinarian responded by email at 4:37 p.m. with questions and treatment advice. Daily observation\nrecords for January 14 stated that the animal had declined even further during the course of the day on the 14th, but\nthis information was not conveyed to the veterinarian until 5:03 that evening by email. There was no return email\nthat evening by the veterinarian. A staff member made an appointment for the animal on the 14th for January 15.\nThe animal died on the way to the clinic on the 15th. A gross necropsy revealed pancreatic nodules consistent with\npancreatic cancer.\nCommunication with the veterinarian should be timely and appropriate to the animal's circumstances. Email\ncorrespondence may not result in timely communication between parties, as evidenced by the email strings\nregarding the above animal. The facility should ensure that health issues are conveyed to the attending veterinarian\npromptly in order to facilitate the appropriate treatment of illness or injury and avoid unnecessary suffering by the\nanimals.\nThis non-compliant item was corrected by the facility immediately after the above incident.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative."
