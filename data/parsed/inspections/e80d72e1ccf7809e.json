These two dogs were marked as unsound\nfor breeding and needed to be further evaluated by a veterinarian.\nDuring today's inspection, it was revealed that #18 (Misty) was bred on April 7, 2016. The facility representative\nstated that they had received some medication from a veterinarian to treat a skin condition however; there was no\ndocumentation from a veterinarian to state that this dog was now sound for breeding. The disposition records\nrevealed that four Chihuahua puppies were sold on 12/17/2015. These puppies were traced back to #15 (Lexi). At\nthe time of inspection, Lexi had not seen a veterinarian for further evaluation. Health issues that are identified and\nleft untreated can worsen the condition. Breeding dogs that are determined to be unsound for breeding can lead to\nharmful conditions for the females and/or the puppies. The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian and assure that all of the regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.\nTo be corrected by May 30, 2016.\nThis inspection began at 1053.\nThe inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative and Bev Hicks, ACI.\nEnd of report."
