The hawk is typically fed late afternoon. Through conversation with\nthe facility representative and reviewing the limited information available on the written feeding log, it was determined that\nthe hawk has been observed daily but has not been eating regularly as is typical for him. The hawk had his normal fast\nday on 12/29/24 and then only ate part of his allotted food on 12/30/24 and 12/31/24. He did not eat any of the food\noffered on 1/1/25. It appears from the mice left in the enclosure that he did not eat on 1/2/25 either. The attending\nveterinarian has not been notified about the hawk's decreased appetite.\nIf abnormalities related to animal health, behavior and well-being are observed during daily observations, then the facility\nmust have a mechanism in place of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and\naccurate information on any problems is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. This is to allow the attending veterinarian\nto provide guidance regarding appropriate and adequate veterinary care.\nThe facility shall contact their veterinarian by Jan. 6, 2025 to communicate with him about the hawk's decreased appetite\nand follow any guidance given. Correct by Jan. 6, 2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the park manager.\nn"
