Close\ninspection of the dog's mouth revealed that there was a thick brownish colored material on the surface of the teeth\nencasing several cheek and canine teeth causing it to be difficult to visualize the normal shape of the teeth. Dental\nproblems can make it difficult for an animal to eat normally, can be painful or can lead to other systemic health\nproblems.\n***A female adult Shih Tzu (microchip # 096 362 521) had long fur around its eyes making it difficult for the\ninspectors to visualize the eyes. Close evaluation of the dog showed that the left eye was covered by matted fur.\nAfter the fur was pushed aside, it could be seen that the eye was dry and had crusty discharge. Irritated eyes can\nbe painful and lead to additional eye issues.\nThere is no written documentation to demonstrate that these dogs have received care regarding these health\nconcerns. Additionally, the facility's Program of Veterinary Care does not have a plan in place to address these\nhealth issues; therefore, an evaluation is needed by the attending veterinarian to provide adequate veterinary care\nto these dogs."
