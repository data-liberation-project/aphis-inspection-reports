This room had been hosed out earlier and the baboons were sprayed\nduring the cleaning of their enclosure. Not only was this stressful and uncomfortable to the infant baboons, it is also\na potential health risk. Young baboons are susceptible to hypothermia which can be life threatening if not caught in\ntime. This stress can also depress their immune systems which puts them at risk for disease. When water is used\nto clean the primary enclosure, whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, non-human primates must be\nremoved, unless the enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals will not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in\nthe process.\nCorrected during the inspection."
