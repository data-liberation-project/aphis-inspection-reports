Both the porcupines and the Red-Tailed Hawk were housed in chain-link enclosures while the shared wall\nbetween the two enclosures was modified with wire, vinyl slats, and corrugated plastic so as to prevent contact\nbetween the porcupines and the hawk. Additionally, there are vinyl slats on the wall of the enclosure facing the\naisle in front of the two enclosures and, for management purposes, the Red-Tailed Hawk is tethered within it\u2019s own\nenclosure.\nThe carcass was heavily predated upon when found during the facility\u2019s morning checks and while there were no\nopen gates to either enclosure and the shared wall was in good repair, it was determined at necropsy that the width\nof the head and chest of the porcupine were 38mm and 52mm, respectively. Further inspection of the enclosures\nrevealed that the gaps between the gates and the door jambs were approximately 50mm of both of the enclosures.\nThe most likely scenario is that the juvenile porcupine, already identified by the facility as smaller than previous\njuvenile porcupines housed in this enclosure, was able to exit the enclosure in the gap of the door jamb, travel down\nthe aisle, and then enter the enclosure of the adjacent Red-Tailed Hawk through a similar-sized door jamb, where it\nwas then attacked by the hawk.\nIn response to the incident, the facility reviewed all enclosures and identified no other animals or enclosures that\npresented a similar risk in which an animal would be able to escape through a door jamb. Also, any change in\ninhabitants of the enclosures will result in a similar review of animal size and door jamb width to ensure that new\nanimals introduced will also not be able to escape. Modified chain-link enclosures will no longer be used to house\npregnant porcupines. Instead, they and their young will be housed in enclosures with a maximum wire and door\ngap width of 1in (25.4mm).\nAll indoor and outdoor facilities need to be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and be constructed in such\na manner as to contain the animals. Failure to do so can result in injury or death to the animal.\nCorrect by continuing to ensure that all animals are housed in enclosures which are properly maintained and will\nprevent escape of the animal. Corrected by the time of inspection."
