These gaps were large enough that a\ngoat's horns or head could get stuck underneath and therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.\nA system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to ensure all animal facilities are structurally\nsound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.\nDate to be Corrected: August 17, 2017\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility's representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
