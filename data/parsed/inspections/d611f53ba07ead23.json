This device had been used routinely at the facility without any problems prior to this\nincident. The chain was about 9-12 inches long which enabled it to be pulled through the bars of the cage when the\nanimal was playing with the ball attached to it. Since the incident, all chains for enrichment devices have been\nshortened to no more than 6 inches or covered with PVC pipe. Upon observation of some primate cage racks, a\nfew cages had lengths of chain attached to the divider between cages to prevent the divider from sliding out too far.\nThese chains were about 9 inches long and when the divider was pushed in could be pulled into the cage and\npresent a similar injury risk to the primates. Although no incidents have occurred with these divider chains, they\nneed to be modified to prevent any further injury risks. Correct by March 25, 2014.\nThis was a focused inspection to address a complaint and covered Friedberg campus only.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representative."
