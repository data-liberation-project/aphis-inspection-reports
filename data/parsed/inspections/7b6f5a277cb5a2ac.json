Cougars and leopards fed 8 (cid:19) 15 lbs. of meat\na day are being fed well over 3% of their body weight. Animals receiving this much food should be in better body\ncondition than the cougar currently at the facility.

The PVC states (cid:28)when whole prey diet is not being utilized we feed a\ncommercially prepared zoo diet(cid:29). They do not explain when or why a whole prey diet might not be used nor do they\nidentify which prepared diet they use. There was no prepared diet on site at the time of this inspection.\nThe licensee is responsible for providing adequate veterinary care from a veterinarian experienced with the species\nwho can oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care. The current diet outlined in the PVC does not\nadequately address the age, species, or condition of the animals being fed at the facility. The poor body condition\nof the following animals confirms the inadequacy of the diets:\n1.A male cougar named Boudreaux.\n2.Boo-Boo a female lioness housed with Batman and one other female lion.\n3.A male tiger housed with 1 other tiger in the pen on the north side of the pen in which the tiger Samson is located.\n.\n4.Samson a male tiger.\nThe licensee needs to find a veterinarian experienced with the different species housed at the facility and get all\nanimals onto an adequate diet."

      "narrative": "(b) (2)\n***** According to clinical notes provided by the attending veterinarian, (cid:28)Batman(cid:29), an 11 year old male lion was\nanesthetized on Aug 10, 2014. According to the clinical notes his left eye was examined. This animal has had a\nproblem with his right eye since March of this year. I suspect the veterinarian meant to write (cid:28)right(cid:29) eye in her\nclinical notes. The notes indicate no abnormalities were identified with the affected eye. The AV flushed the eye,\napplied topical antibiotic ointment, and recommended monitoring for (cid:28)erythema and color to the discharge(cid:29). The\nclinical notes also indicate the AV suspects a clogged nasal lacrimal duct may be the cause for the squinty eye\nhowever she did not have equipment with her to check the nasal lacrimal duct during the anesthesia. Anesthesia in\nold, ill, large cats can be difficult and risky for the animals. Because of this difficulty the veterinarian should have\nbeen thoroughly prepared to evaluate all problems with this animal while it was anesthetized.\nThe clinical notes also state (cid:28)ataxic in rear(cid:29) however there is nothing in the notes or the laboratory tests to indicate\nhow or if the ataxia was evaluated.\nThe licensee is required to have an adequate program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. As of August 11th this animal continues to\nhave a squinty eye with the third eyelid protruding across half of the eye. This indicates some type of continued\nirritation with the eye and nothing has been done to evaluate the documented ataxia therefore appropriate methods\nto diagnose and treat diseases and injuries have not occurred.\nThe licensee needs to obtain adequate veterinary care for the resident animals.\nThis was a focused inspection to address the Direct, Repeat NCI regarding Adequate Veterinary Care cited on Aug\n5, 2014. This report also addresses the diet portion of the Program of Veterinary Care received from the attending\nveterinarian on Aug 14, 2014.\nThis inspection was conducted by APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE PERSONNEL and the Director on 8/11/14.\nThe exit interview was conducted by APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE PERSONNEL with the Vice President of the\nInc. on 8/18/14.\nEND OF REPORT.\nAdditional Inspectors\nDigesualdo Cynthia, Veterinary Medical Officer"
