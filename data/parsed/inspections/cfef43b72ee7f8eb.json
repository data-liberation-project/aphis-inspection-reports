According to\nthe protocol, pigs in this study are to undergo survival enteroscopic procedures creating areas of radiofrequency\nablation to the small bowel. The protocol allows repeated procedures using the same animals and allows the\nanimals to be assigned to a different protocol after the completion of this study. The protocol provides no description\nregarding the amount of energy being used to create the lesions or the size of the lesions being created. The\nprotocol also states that the animals may undergo multiple ablations by multiple physicians (three to five physicians\nexpected) during one session but provides no limits to the number of ablations per procedure or amount of time\nunder anesthesia. While the protocol states that ablation lesions generally heal within three to four weeks, the\nprotocol does not provide a minimum recovery time before either repeating the procedure or moving the animal to\nanother protocol.\nIt is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that animal activities are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. In\norder to perform this function, a complete description of activities using animals must be included in protocols prior\nto IACUC approval. The facility should ensure that all protocols contain complete descriptions of animal use.\nPrevious correction date: Correct by November 17, 2015 for the above protocols and new protocols from this time\nforward. Other current protocols with inadequate rationales for numbers should be corrected by November 17,\n2016.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative."
