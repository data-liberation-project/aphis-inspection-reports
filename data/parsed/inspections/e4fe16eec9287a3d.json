The nails were overgrown and starting to curl to the side\nOvergrown and matted hair coats may cause pain and discomfort to the animal as well as increase the chance of skin\nconditions to develop. Overgrown nails may also cause pain and discomfort as well as significantly change the gait of the\nanimal.\nThe program of veterinary care states that long haired dogs will be groomed once a month and clipped as necessary.\nThese dogs have not been groomed or clipped in several months. The licensee and facility representative are aware\nthese dogs are in need of a grooming but have not completed it yet. The licensee must follow their preventative care and\ntreatment plans to ensure healthy and un-matted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears,\nskin, and teeth.

The front toenails curled to the\nside and two toes on each front foot crossed over each other. The upper canine teeth are approximately 50% covered in a\nbrown organic material, all upper and lower cheek teeth are completely covered in brown organic material. There is hard,\nbrown/yellow organic material present between each upper incisor tooth. A white, creamy organic material is along the\ngum line of all upper cheek teeth and canine teeth.
