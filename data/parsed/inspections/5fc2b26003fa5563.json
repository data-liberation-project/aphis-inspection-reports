The drainage pipe has come apart from the collection tray and should be reattached in order for the\ndrainage system to work properly. Numerous flies and other insects are present on and around the build-up of\nwaste material. Failure to remove the waste from the collection tray and maintain the collection of waste can create\ndisease hazards and attract pests which can affect the health and well being of the dogs. The licensee must provide\nfor regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes, water, other fluids and wastes,\nin a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin\nand pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All drains must be properly constructed, installed, and\nmaintained.\nTo be corrected by: July 13, 2015."
