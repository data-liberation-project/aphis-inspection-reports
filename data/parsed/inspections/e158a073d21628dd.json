      "narrative": "An adult, female, dark yellow lab (no ID) was severely squinting and had moist discharge around both eyes. The\nlicensee and the inspector both attempted to open the eyelids to view the surface of the eyes but the dog(cid:25)'s eyelids\nwere squeezed tightly shut and they could not be opened.

The gums\nsurrounding the tooth were severely swollen and had retracted back from the surface of the tooth.\nOne adult, brown and white Papillon (Microchip #4624457A3A) was seen limping and holding up its left front foot.\nUpon examination, the bottom of the left foot was severely red and swollen between the pads with a small,\napproximately 0.5 cm, light tan/grey swelling in the middle of the red and swollen area. When placed back in the\nenclosure, the animal continued to hold up the left front foot and only rarely placed the foot on the ground.\nOne brown and black, adult, female Dachshund identified by (Microchip number # 0A01233357) is carrying its back\nright leg in an abnormal manner.

All animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an\naccurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,\nincluding the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the\ninspector upon request.
