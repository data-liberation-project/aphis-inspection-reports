I called Ms. Ball's primary\nphone number at 12:26 PM, and Ms. Ball's spouse answered the phone. He indicated he was present at the site,\nbut that I was too late, because he had to leave promptly for an appointment elsewhere. He indicated the licensee\nwould be available the following day. During our call, another phone was ringing in the background, at which time he\nindicated he had to go and he disconnected the phone call with me. The call was disconnected before I could ask\nany further questions about conducting the inspection on the day I drove to the facility."
