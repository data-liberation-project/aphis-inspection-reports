Only one attendant was present to keep traffic\nmoving and to ensure the public followed the drive through rules. Inspectors observed approximately seven people\ndriving through the park in a pick-up truck. Some of the individuals were riding in the bed of the truck. When the\ntruck got to the giraffe enclosure, one man was observed to stand up from the bed of the truck and used the giraffe\nfence to climb on the edge of the bed of the truck. Thus, allowing him to lean on the giraffe enclosure and take\npictures. People were observed feeding and then trying to pet the animals. The facility does have cameras\nobserving the giraffe enclosure. However, no readily identifiable attendant was present within a reasonable amount\nof time to correct the issue.\nThe facility provides a pelleted feed for customers to feed to the animals throughout their visit. During the drive\nthrough section, unidentified food items were observed thrown out a car window. The animals ate the unapproved\nfood.\nIn the walk through portion of The Farm, one Boer goat was observed to get its head stuck in the fence during\npublic feeding. Upon discovery, one USDA inspector had to walk to find assistance because no readily identifiable\nattendant was available. It took approximately 5-8 minutes until 2 facility staff arrived. It then took another\napproximately 5-8 minutes to get the animal freed.\nLack of an attendant during public contact may lead to human and/or animal stress and injury. A responsible,\nknowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public\ncontact.\nCorrect by: August 27, 2020"
