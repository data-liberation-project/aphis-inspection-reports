This sink is used for food preparation, cleaning out items\nfrom animal enclosures, hand washing, and even dumping the mop bucket. The very small size of the sink makes it\ndifficult to maintain in sanitary condition, and makes adequately cleaning large objects nearly impossible.\nUnsanitary conditions can be harmful to the animals. Adequate facilities should be provided in order to maintain\ncleanliness, which helps to ensure the well-being of the animals.\nTo be corrected by 7/20/15.\nA exit interview was conducted with the curator.\nThis was a focused inspection on the new / temporary site for the Randall Museum."
