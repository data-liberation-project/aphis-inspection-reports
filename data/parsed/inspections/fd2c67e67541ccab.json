When the animal was physically examined by the vet on the third day it was noted as\nweak and shaky. The concern is that the animal was showing signs of injury and was being chased when it\nventured out, and additional wounds could have been potentially avoided had the animal been separated sooner. In\naddition to following animal care manual guidance for introducing meerkats, an SOP should be developed and in\nplace when animals sustain injuries during introductions to help guide this process.\nCorrect by Sept 20, 2014\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection."
