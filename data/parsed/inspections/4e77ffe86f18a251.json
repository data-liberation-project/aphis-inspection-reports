The hare has not been recovered.\nA new SOP was then drafted to help prevent the escape of animals when caretakers entered and exited the enclosure by\nensuring animals aren\u2019t near the door and that caretakers have a clear line of sight to the whole area of the doorway when\nthe door is open.\nWhile the behavioral changes for caretakers should be helpful, the SOP did not include an additional physical barrier, and\nthe large enclosures still have a single door entry between the animal space and the large outside area within the\nperimeter fence. Enclosures must be constructed in a way that ensures that the animals are contained within. An extra\nbarrier between the animal space and the outside is an industry standard method to ensure containment.\nCorrect by initiating steps (state contract process) to increase security of the primary enclosure within 30 days, by May 22,\n2021.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.\nEnd Section"
