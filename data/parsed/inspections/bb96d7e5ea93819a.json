This threshold had broken and bent in toward the enclosure and\ncontained multiple sharp points. These points had small tufts of hair attached indicating that the animals were\nsnagging the threshold as they went between the indoor and outdoor. This broken threshold may cause injury to\nthe dogs and the area is difficult to appropriately clean and sanitize with the bent and broken metal. Primary\nenclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs from injury.\nCorrect by: 10- November 2016\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee."
