The second upper left incisor is broken and is a dark color of brown. The upper\ncheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are coated in a thick tan colored material. The boarder of the gum tissue of the\nteeth is moderately reddened. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to further health\nissues.\nFemale Boston #11 has an emaciated body condition. Inspection of the dog revealed that the backbone, ribs, and hip\nbones were visibly prominent and easily felt with little fat and muscle covering them. Emaciated body condition could\nindicate a serious underlying health issue.\nFemale Bulldog #39 has an abnormal condition of the left hind leg. The inspector observed the dog touching the tips of\nthe toes to the floor while walking and failing to bear any weight on the leg. Failure to bear weight on a leg could indicate\nan underlying health concern.\nFemale Samoyed #11 has an abnormal condition of the right eye and poor dental health. Physical inspection resulted in\na mild pain response from the dog when the area surrounding the eye was gently touched. The tissue surrounding the\nright eye is swollen and the white of the eye is reddened. An excessive amount of yellow drainage is located on the hair\nfrom the corner of the right eye and spreading down the face. The upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are\ncoated in a thick tan colored material. The boarder of the gum tissue of the teeth is moderately reddened. Poor eye and\ndental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to further health issues.\nFemale Husky #86 has an abnormal appearance to the right eye. The eye is protruding outwardly and the tissue\nsurrounding the eye is swollen and the white of the eye is reddened. The eye has an approximately dime sized white,\ncloudy material covering the surface. Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.\nDealers must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above\nmentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and to establish an effective\ntreatment plan.\nFemale Wheaton #147 has a matted hair coat. The matted hair was located on the chest, front legs, and hind legs. The\nmatts on the chest were thickened and tight. The legs are covered in layers of matted hair. Matted hair coats could\ncause pain and discomfort to the dog.\nThis dog must be groomed and all matted hair removed from the hair coat."
