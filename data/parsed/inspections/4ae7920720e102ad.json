It should be noted that on enclosure 19a a 4ft panel was added to increase the\nheight of this enclosure to 16ft, and some metal was put around a tree near the front. However a few trees near the\nfence along the sides were still too close and touching or leaning against the top of the fence. A 2ft kick-in was\nadded around the front of the enclosure #18, however there are still a few trees on the right and left side of the\nenclosure that are too close to the fence.\nThe facility needs to remove any trees that are too close to the primary enclosure fences. If the trees are not going\nto be removed, an adequate kick-in over the top of the tree and/or around it that prevents the animals from climbing\nthe tree to escape must be added or another method must be devised by the facility to effectively prevent the\nanimals from using these trees for the purpose of escape. Taking these preventative measures and maintaining the\nenclosure fence according to AWA regulations and standards should decrease the risk of escape by the regulated\nanimals that can climb and decrease the potential for safety risks to the animal and general public. While several\ntrees are identified during the inspection that need to be addressed in the above mentioned manner, it is ultimately\nup to the licensee to identify all trees or substrates that could qualify as being a possible point of escape by\nproviding a purchase point or climbing surface out of the enclosure."
