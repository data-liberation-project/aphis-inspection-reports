The other adult and two pups were treated, but died the next day. This strain of\nperomyscus is particularly sensitive to environmental changes.\nThe assigned caretaker failed to make health checks to assure all animals had food and water. Water bottles in this\nfacility were periodically leaking, so the staff was told to be particularly attentive to the water bottles.\nThe animal caretaker failed to provide adequate observation and care of the animals assigned to her and this\nresulted in distress and death of five animals.\nThe facility took multiple corrective actions by thoroughly investigating the incident, replacing the caretaker,\nretraining all staff in proper procedures for daily health checks, replacing the water bottles, and moving the animals\nto a possibly quieter room.\nThis item is found to be corrected at this inspection since no further incidents have occurred in the past year.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian and IACUC staff."
