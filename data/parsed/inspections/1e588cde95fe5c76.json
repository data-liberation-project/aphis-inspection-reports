      "narrative": "Six rhesus macaques assigned to a protocol had undergone more imaging procedures (MRI/PET) between July 2022 and\nDecember 2023 (MRI/PET) than were described in the approved IACUC protocol at the time. The approved protocol at\nthe time stated that at baseline animals undergo \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure, at least 2 weeks\nrecovery, baseline positron emission tomography imaging (PET) procedure\u201d. Following the experimental injection, the\napproved protocol described \u201cquarterly PET scans for the duration of the experimental time (1-2 years)\u201d. The approved\nprotocol did not describe post-injection MRI. IACUC issued a letter of reprimand at the January 2025 meeting.\nOver the last 3 years, more non-human primates were used for a viral vector study and MRI\u2019s than were approved on the\nprotocol. The approved viral vector protocol includes two separate experiments, with 12 animals in Experiment 1 and 10\nanimals for Experiment 2. Exceeding the protocol,16 animals were used in Experiment 1 and 12/16 received an MRI prior\nto viral vector injection and 6 animals were used in Experiment 2. While the protocol is approved for MRI in the context of\nviral vector work on Experiment 2, MRI was not approved in the viral vector efficacy testing in Experiment 1. IACUC\nissued a letter of counsel at the May 2025 meeting.\nDuring the week of January 20th, 2025, one rhesus macaque was administered a combined dose of cetuximab at 8mg/kg\nthat exceeded the approved dose in the protocol of 5 mg/kg in a week, divided and no less than 2 days apart. Cetuximab\nis a monoclonal antibody medication administered as a safety switch in the event of an adverse response (cytokine storm)\nto the genetically modified CAR T cells. According to the facility, there was no apparent animal welfare impact from\nadministration of the elevated dose, although the animal was subsequently euthanized due to complications from the CAR\nT cell therapy, which was anticipated in the protocol & IACUC sent a letter of acknowledgement at the March 2025\nmeeting.\nTen pigtail macaques received incorrect strain of influenza A virus From April of 2022 to March of 2024, which was\nsuspected by the research team after an early euthanasia of one animal under veterinary care at day 3 instead of 5 and\nsubsequent genotyping of the flu strains administered. The delay in reporting was attributed to the development of a new\nPCR assay to distinguish between the strains and probable human error was identified as the cause & IACUC sent a\nletter of acknowledgement in November 2024 meeting.\nAll the procedures to which animals are subjected must be included in a complete description of the proposed use of the\nanimals. It is essential that this information be included in the protocol submitted to the IACUC for review to ensure the\njudicious and humane use of the animals.\nCorrected at the time of inspection, 8 July 2025"

      "narrative": "At the June 2024 IACUC meeting, an adverse event (Incident #2) was reported to the committee from August 2023 in\nwhich, during an intracranial injection surgery on a non-human primate, there was a software malfunction that caused the\nrobotic arm holding the cannula to perform small uninstructed movements. The surgery was immediately suspended, the\nsurgery site was closed, and the animal was allowed to recover from anesthesia. During recovery the animal had a\nseizure that responded to diazepam, and as recovery progressed, it was noted that the animal did not have full function of\nthe left side of its body. Symptoms improved over the subsequent 2-3 weeks. The lab requested a 2nd surgery to\ncomplete the injections, at which time they were informed that they needed to submit an amendment to the protocol. An\namendment was submitted and was approved by the IACUC to add the option to perform a 2nd surgery if an unexpected\nevent such as an equipment failure precluded them from completing a planned surgery.\nDuring the review of this amendment, neither the specifics of the robot arm malfunction nor the animal\u2019s clinical condition\nwere reported to OAW, the AV, or the IACUC. The second surgery was performed approximately 3 weeks after the 1st\nsurgery, after the amendment was approved. While there was no malfunction of the robotic arm during that 2nd surgery,\nthe animal did not recover from anesthesia and was euthanized. Gross necropsy revealed an approximately 3cm\ndiameter blood clot at the brain stem, oriented to the right side, and hemorrhage along the base of the brain with\ncongested ventral cerebral vessels and submeningeal hemorrhage. The location of the hemorrhage suggested that it was\nlikely secondary to injections, but did not discriminate between the first surgery with the malfunctioning robotic arm or the\nsecond surgery. The Principal Investigator (PI) responded to the IACUC that it was assumed that it was the clinical vet's\nresponsibility, not the PI. The IACUC identified this as a programmatic gap that needs to be addressed. Under the Animal\nWelfare Act, the PI is responsible for the implementation of research involving animals, especially communicating\nunexpected adverse events that impact the welfare of animals used in their research.\nAnimal Welfare Act requires an effective mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of health and well-being of the animals is conveyed to the Attending Veterinarian.\nCorrect by 21 August 2025"
