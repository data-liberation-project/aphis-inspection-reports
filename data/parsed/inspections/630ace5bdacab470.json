I went to the location in Forest Lake, MN and knocked on the door of the main building. No one\nanswered. I went back to the car and honked on the horn. I tried to contact staff members at Wildlife Science\nCenter by calling three different phone numbers. I left messages and waited 30 minutes before leaving. I then went\nto the location in Stacy, MN. I drove up to the gate that leads to the back of the property. I didn't see anyone. I\ncalled a couple of the phone numbers again and was still unable to reach anyone. I then left.\nEnd of report."
