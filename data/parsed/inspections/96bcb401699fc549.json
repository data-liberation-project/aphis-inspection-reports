The applicant had not observed this\ncondition on the daily observations. There was no consultation with a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis and proper\ntreatment for this dog. Poor body condition can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical\ncondition. The quality of her milk can also be negatively affected by the poor body condition, which then may affect the\nhealth and well being of the puppies.\nFailure to conduct thorough daily observations can lead to delayed identification of animal issues and unnecessary animal\npain or discomfort. Brandy must be evaluated by a veterinarian to know with certainty the problem and the correct\ntreatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended treatment and delivered treatments must be available to\nAPHIS officials.\n*Prissy, (id# 603371373) a female Shih Tzu, was observed to be squinting in the right eye. The hair under the eye is\nmoist from discharge and there is an opaque area in both eye globes. The condition of the eye was not seen on daily\nobservations, thus not provided with diagnosis and treatment. There was no consultation with a veterinarian to establish a\ndiagnosis and proper treatment for this dog. Failure to conduct thorough daily observations can lead to delayed\nidentification of animal issues and unnecessary animal pain or discomfort. Eye injuries are painful and can quickly worsen\nif not treated properly. Squinting is a significant indicator of pain and the discharge indicates that the eye is irritated. This\ndog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the evaluation,\nrecommended treatment and delivered treatments must be available to APHIS officials.\n*Bernie, a male Shih Tzu (OAO2346259, DOB 6/21/2014) had a dark crusty discharge around and under his right eye.\nThere was an opaque spot on the eye globe. Observation of the teeth showed a large amount of dark hard material on\nmost of the teeth. The interior of the upper lip had sores in the area they contacted the teeth. The eye condition and\ndental condition were not observed thus not provided with diagnosis and treatment. There was no consultation with a\nveterinarian to establish a diagnosis and proper treatment for this dog. Failure to conduct thorough daily observations can\nlead to delayed identification of animal issues and unnecessary animal pain or discomfort. Eye injuries are painful and can\nquickly worsen if not treated properly. Squinting is a significant indicator of pain and the discharge indicates that the eye is\nirritated. Heavy buildup of plaque and tartar on the teeth with redness, and swelling of the mucous membranes can be\nsigns of dental problems and can cause infection, pain, and discomfort to the animal. Bernie must be evaluated by a\nveterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment. Documentation must be available to APHIS officials.\nDaily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being is essential to provide timely and accurate\ncommunication with a veterinarian of problems so diagnosis and treatment can be provided. The applicant must have an\neffective program of observing the dogs daily for any health problems and communicating with a veterinarian in a timely\nmanner.\nCorrection date: 28 February 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
