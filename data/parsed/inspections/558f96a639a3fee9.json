The protocols ask the principle investigator whether there will be\nany deviation from this guideline, and the principle investigator must check (cid:28)\"Yes\"(cid:29) or \"(cid:28)No\"(cid:29). On all but one of the\nprotocols which pertain to dogs currently on site, the box is checked (cid:28)\"No\"(cid:29), despite the fact that the following\nelements of this guideline were not being adhered to:\n1.) Single housing for medical and/or welfare reasons should be documented in the animal records. A review of\nanimal medical records showed that some dogs were housed singly without any medical or welfare reason having\nbeen documented in the records. Specifically, dogs 727, 728, and 729 were singly housed without a reason\ndocumented in their records.\n2.) Each dog should have access to at least one toy in their home enclosure. Whereas staff claimed that toys are\nnormally present except during cleaning, the enclosures in rooms 216 and 215 did not contain toys at the time of\ninspection.\n3.) Dogs housed singly must be within sight of other dogs. The design of the runs does not allow the dogs to see\nother dogs when housed individually.\nAny significant changes to the IACUC-approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC. The\ncurrent housing practices for the dogs differ significantly from what was approved by the IACUC. The housing and\nenrichment practices should be reviewed, any changes should be approved, and the protocol and actual practices\nshould be brought into alignment in order to safeguard the welfare of the animals under study.\nTo be corrected by 3/15/15.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representatives."
