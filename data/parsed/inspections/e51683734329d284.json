      "narrative": "The two reindeer cows, Bossy and Jingles, had excessively overgrown hooves due to a lack of routine hoof\ntrimming. The front dewclaws on Jingles were curling and making contact with the ground and her front toes were\nstarting to cross.\nExcessive hoof growth can lead to gait abnormalities which can cause a change in the toe joints and may contribute\nto osteoarthritis, especially in older animals such as these. The facility must adhere to the plan it created which\nstates that the reindeer\u2019s hooves will be trimmed twice a year. As part of the facility\u2019s program of preventative\nveterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.\nBossy is currently being treated by CSU for a bite from a brown recluse spider and her veterinarian visits every four\ndays for treatments. Her veterinarian should be consulted before hoof trimming is performed as it is important to not\ninterfere with her recovery.\nJingles must have her hooves trimmed by November 24, 2016.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative and VMO Dominique Engel."
