      "narrative": "(a) Structure\n***There were at least three enclosures in the sheltered portion of the facility which were in disrepair. The indoor\nportion of an enclosure housing an adult dog and ten of her approximately 4-day-old puppies had a back wall which\nwas broken. A large section of the plastic-like wall covering was missing next to the access door and the wood\nstructures underneath were exposed. Part of the wooden wall structure was also broken and an irregularly shaped\nhole was present in the wall. The hole was up to approximately 12 inches by 5 inches in size and a gap was\npresent between the wooden wall and the next wooden structure behind the wall. The broken wall was at the level\nof the dogs and the hole was only a few inches from the flooring of the enclosure. Also, an enclosure housing five\nweaned puppies had a section of the wire wall in disrepair below the outdoor wire access door. This section of the\nwall had wires that were bent, with some of the wires broken, and some sharp wire ends protruding into the\nenclosure where an animal could easily come in contact with them. Another outdoor portion of an enclosure\nhousing five weaned puppies had a section of wire wall in disrepair. An approximately 10 inch diameter hole was\npresent at the top of the side of the wire wall. Several wires were irregularly bent in this area and at least four of the\nseparated broken wires were long and protruding at various angles into the enclosure. At least one of these long\nwires was bent downward into the enclosure and the sharp end of it was at the level of the puppies. The broken,\nsharp wire ends, holes and the large gap in the wall increase the risk that the animals could become injured. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animal housing facilities are kept in good repair and that they protect the animals from\ninjury as well as contain the animals securely and restrict other animals from entering at all tiimes. TO BE\nCORRECTED BY: March 15, 2014.\n*Note: The female Doberman Pinscher (#075*056*265) which had been previously included on the report for the\ninspection conducted on February 19, 2013 under 2.40 (b)(2) had been addressed.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
