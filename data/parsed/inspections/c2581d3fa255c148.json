      "narrative": "Handling.\n1.In July 2016, two non-compatible non-human primates (NHPs) were accidentally placed into the same cage by\nfacility personnel. The monkeys fought and both underwent surgery to repair serious wounds. Both animals\nrequired multiple weeks of veterinary care but made full recoveries. Improper pairing of animals can lead to serious\ninjury to animals.\n2.During routine pen cleaning in December 2016, doors between two outdoor enclosures were left open at the\nsame time. A monkey had been inadvertently left in the outdoor pen while the rest of the group were locked in the\ninside portion of their enclosure. This monkey moved from its pen into the other pen through the open doors during\nthe cleaning process and was unnoticed by staff. When the monkeys were allowed access to their outdoor\nenclosures following completion of the cleaning, the unfamiliar monkey was injured by the residents of that\nenclosure. The injured monkey underwent surgery to repair the wounds and made a full recovery. Improper\nhandling of animals can lead to serious injury to animals.\nThe facility promptly acted to address both of these incidents by conducting investigations, reporting the incidents to\nOLAW, and immediately implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n3.In May 2016, a rabbit being removed from its enclosure struggled while being handled. The staff member noted\nthat the right rear leg was positioned at an unusual angle. The veterinary staff was promptly contacted and it was\ndetermined via radiography that the rabbit had sustained a fracture of the distal limb. The animal was humanely\neuthanized. Improper handling of animals can lead to serious injury to animals.\nThe facility promptly acted to address this incident by conducting an investigation and immediately implementing\nappropriate corrective actions to avoid similar incidents in the future.\nPer this section of the regulations, handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a\nmanner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nThese 3 items have been corrected.\nThis inspection was conducted on March 13-15, 2017. The exit interview was conducted on March 15, 2017, with\nfacility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGladue Paula, Veterinary Medical Officer"
