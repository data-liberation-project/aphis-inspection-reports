Upon entry of the spouse and child, the lemurs jumped on the child\u2019s head and shoulders. The child was\ninjured and had a scratch below one eye and another injury to the back of the head that bled. The local sheriff\u2019s office\nwas notified, who then investigated, and a report was filed. The child was taken to a hospital for treatment. Per the\nlicensee, he began allowing patrons into the enclosure beginning the previous weekend, but he accompanied them into\nthe enclosure at those encounters. Neither lemur had a leash on, nor were recall trained for any of these interactions. He\nallowed patrons to stand or sit in the enclosure with the lemurs jumping on their shoulders and/or heads. This direct\ncontact with the animals, in the current manner of public interaction, failed to protect the public from harm and is an\nindication that the animals are not trained and are not under direct control. Trained nonhuman primates may be allowed\nphysical contact with the public, but only if they are under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or\ntrainer at all times during the direct contact. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk\nof harm to the animal and to the public, so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.\nMUST BE CORRECTED BY: April 13, 2022"
