Water was restricted from the gerbils for\n51.5 hours and 52.5 hours respectively. None of the animals appeared to be negatively affected.\nProposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be\nsubject to further appropriate review and approval by officials of the research facility. Guidelines for the restriction of water\nmust be followed as outlined in the IACUC approved protocol.\nCorrection: Appropriate corrective action was taken that included termination of the responsible lab member and\nreminding all other lab personnel of the importance of conducting study procedures as indicated in the protocol.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
