Upon examination of the ears, there was a buildup of dark brown organic material present in\nboth ear canals. The facility representative was unaware of this dog\u2019s ear condition. Ears with a buildup of organic matter\nmay be a sign of illness and cause the dog discomfort and pain.\nFemale Cavalier King Charles Spaniel \u201cFlower\u201d MC#7E1-019-5950 had severe gum recession of upper incisors, canines\nand cheek teeth. The gap between the teeth roots was observed on all right upper cheek teeth and one upper left cheek\ntooth. There is a white-gray creamy organic material present along the gumline of the upper cheek teeth. There was not a\ntreatment plan in place for receding gumlines or tooth root exposure. There was not documentation written on any of the\nmedical records available during inspection describing the dental health of this dog. Poor dental health could cause pain\nand discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues.\nMale Cavalier King Charles Spaniel \u201cCruz\u201d MC# 7E1-007-1171 had a broken lower left incisor tooth exposing the pulp of\nthe tooth. The tooth is broken to the gumline and is dark brown in color. This dog had a dental cleaning at the facility in\nJuly 2023 with no additional medical notes recorded. The facility stated that dental notes are only made if an extraction\ntakes place. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues.\nFemale Cavalier King Charles Spaniel \u201cMelonia\u201d MC# 7E1-007-1163 had at least 3 mobile teeth and moderate to severe\ngum recession. One right upper incisor, one right upper cheek tooth and one left upper cheek tooth were all loose when\ntouched by the inspector. The gums above the upper right canine tooth are mildly inflamed and reddened in color. The\ngums on the left upper cheek teeth were moderately inflamed. Two lower cheek teeth are abnormal, both are brown in\ncolor and worn down to the gums with exposed tooth pulp. The gap between the teeth roots was observed on all right and\nleft upper cheek teeth with a grey creamy organic material present along the gum line and in between the tooth roots.\nWhen examined by APHIS inspectors, this dog did not react painful when palpated. This dog received a dental cleaning\nby the facility 2 days prior to inspection. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to\nfurther health issues.\nThe facility is required to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in the\nregulated animals. The facility must ensure each animal receives adequate veterinary care at all times. The facility must\nhave all four dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to access their health to develop an effective treatment plan.\nThese medical records must be available for APHIS inspection.\nSeveral medications were found to be expired or are improperly stores:\n*Bottle of GenOne Spray- expired 07/2022 and being used to currently treat three adult dogs- \u201cCoyote Bluff\u201d, \u201cPatsy\u201d and\n\u201cVesta\u201d\n*Two tubes of Neosporin- expired 6/2023 and 01/1995\n*Three boxes of \u201dSelf Cath\u201d Female Catheters- expired May 2010, November 2010 and August 2011\n*Esbiliac puppy milk replacer- expired 5/2023\n*Opened Esbiliac puppy milk replacer stored at room temperature, label states once opened to be refrigerated\n*Three boxes of 3 mL syringes- expired May 2021\n*Several surgical suture packages- expiration dates ranged from 1999-2016. Some suture packages were open.\nExpired medications do not ensure that the medications are effective at treating disease or illness and the health of the\nanimal may suffer. Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and\ninjuries. The facility must ensure all medications are not expired.\nThe facility has been verbally instructed by the Attending Veterinarian on how to complete dental cleanings and charting,\nbut the facility is not completing effective dental cleanings or following their dental procedure plan. Three dogs were found\nwith advanced dental disease including several loose teeth and moderate to severe gum recession and received a dental\ncleaning in the last two months by the facility. The written plan states to use extractors on excessively loose teeth for\nremoval and mild gum recession should be monitored. Any other concerns on teeth or teeth that need to be removed but\nare not loose will be addressed by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian stated they verbally instructed\nthe facility any additional loose teeth should be monitored for 2-4 weeks post dental and if still mobile have the\nveterinarian access the teeth. This communication and further veterinary care action has not been completed by the\nfacility. Additionally, there is no treatment plan for dogs with moderate to severe gum recession. The facility is having new\nemployees conduct these dental cleanings that may not be appropriately training by other senior staff, which may have\nled to ineffective dental cleanings and treatments of dental disease.\nFailure to properly complete an effective dental cleaning procedure and then monitor or treat advanced dental disease\nmay result in additional health problems in the dogs or cause discomfort or pain.\nThe facility must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat dental disease and follow their dental\ncleaning protocol at all times. The facility must take additional steps to ensure effective dental cleanings are being\nperformed and dental disease is being adequately treated."
