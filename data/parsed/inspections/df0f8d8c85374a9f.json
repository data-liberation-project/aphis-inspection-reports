One window on the left side of the\nanimal room has broken and missing glass. Another window on the same side has a missing window pane allowing\ncold air and wind to enter the animal room. Plastic was placed in missing and broken windows at time of this\ninspection.\nThe ambient temperature shall not fall below 60 degree F. , nor exceed 85 degree F. in rooms housing guinea pigs.\nGuinea pigs are very sensitive to drafts and changes in temperature. Animals may become ill if the temperature in\nnot closely monitored and kept between 60 - 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The licensee must ensure that the temperature\nis maintained at acceptable levels throughout the entire facility regardless of changing conditions outside. A reliable\nheater must be provided to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Correct by\nDecember 12, 2018."
