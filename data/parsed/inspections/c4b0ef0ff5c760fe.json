In a text message, the veterinarian was\ntold that the sloths were eating less and had loss some weight. At the time of inspection, the condition of the sloths was\nfound to be more significant than described. Both sloths were skinny in appearance with an overall tubular body shape\nhaving lost the species\u2019 characteristic round abdomen. The bony structures of the back were prominent beneath the fur.\nThey were very active (unusual for sloths) rapidly coming towards the door to interact with us expecting to be given treats,\nsweat potato and apples, as per usual during times of public interaction. Per a facility representative, for about a week,\nthe sloths have not been eating their regular diet and have only been willing to eat the treats given during public feeding.\nThe facility had documented significant weight loss of about 4 pounds for each Sloth. The records show a weight of 12.13\nlbs on 03/22/2023 and a more recent weight of 9 lbs on the week of 07/07/2024 for the male. Per the attending\nveterinarian, these important details were not communicated to her, and she did not gauge the full extent of the situation.\n- Communication between the facility and the veterinarian had not been sufficiently frequent for timely implementation of a\ntreatment plan for the sloths. A fecal sample was submitted to the veterinarian for analysis that revealed the presence of\ntapeworms on 07/09/2024. At the time of inspection, 3 days after receiving the results, no treatment plan had been\nimplemented with the facility waiting on the veterinarian\u2019s guidance. The facility reached out to the veterinarian via email\nand text message following inspection, but guidance still had not been received on a subsequent phone call, 7 days post\nresults, on 07/16/2024. Per the attending veterinarian, she did not initially realize they were waiting on her for a treatment\nplan. Still not understanding the full extent of the situation, she did not rush to answer but replied when she could.\nThe lack of direct, frequent, and accurate communication between the facility and attending veterinarian has led to a\ncontinued state of poor health for the animals that may negatively impact healing and may result in further complications.\nThe facility must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on\nproblems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The sloths need to be seen\nby a veterinarian in order to receive a complete evaluation and to establish an adequate treatment plan. Correct by\n07/19/2024."
