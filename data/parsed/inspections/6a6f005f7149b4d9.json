The zoo was not open to the public at that time. The facility has made several attempts to\nrecapture the animal, but have been unable to do so. Improper handling procedures (such as leaving gates open after\nsevere weather damaged the facility to an unknown extent) led to the escape of the eland, who has been sighted\nintermittently in the surrounding area over the last several weeks. Escaped animals can be subject to severe distress,\nphysical harm, and unnecessary discomfort. Handling of all animals must be done as carefully as possible and in a\nmanner that cannot lead to an animal escape, which can cause trauma, behavioral stress, and/or unnecessary\ndiscomfort.\nThe animal remains at large at the time of inspection and the facility is continuing efforts to recapture her safely. In\nresponse to this incident, facility representatives state that the gates will remain closed when the zoo is not open to the\npublic. To be corrected from April 28th forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
