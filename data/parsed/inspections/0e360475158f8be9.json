A review of the records revealed that for the last 6-9 months dosages of 27 of mg/kg\nKetamine and 0.6 mg/kg of Xylazine have been used on a majority of animals for imaging procedures that require\nimmobilization but do not require a surgical plane of anesthesia. The lower dosages of anesthetic were developed in\nconjunction with the clinical veterinarian, but the protocol was not amended and approved by the IACUC, as\nrequired for this significant change. Additionally, the newly approved version of this protocol (effective 3/24/16) still\ncontains only the higher dosage of these drugs for all procedures, despite the fact that this is not what is currently\nbeing used for the non-invasive procedures.\nMaking significant changes to animal use protocols without IACUC review and approval could be detrimental to the\nanimals, as the review process allows consideration of the best methods to minimize pain and distress.\nIf the lower dosage is to be used for some procedures, then the current protocol should be amended and approved\nprior to any additional animal use that does not adhere to the protocol, and the facility should ensure that all\npersonnel understands that significant changes to protocols cannot be made without IACUC approval."
