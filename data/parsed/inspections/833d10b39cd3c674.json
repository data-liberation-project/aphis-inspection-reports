No mouth discomfort was found during examination. Calculus/tartar buildup on teeth was found to be\npartially covering the gum line on the upper canine teeth and the right lower cheek tooth. No active bleeding nor\ndischarge from gums was observed in these areas during the inspector exam.\nAccumulation of large amounts of tartar or calculus on teeth may result in the development of gum disease,\ninfection and tooth loss. In turn, this may also further impact the well-being of an animal by causing chewing\ndiscomfort, inappetence and weight loss.\nTadpole needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian within fourteen days and an appropriate plan of\ntreatment established to address the observed dental tartar issues. Written documentation of veterinary evaluation\nand treatment also need to be available for review upon inspector request.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
