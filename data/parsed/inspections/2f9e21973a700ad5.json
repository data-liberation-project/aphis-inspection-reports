The procedure used carotid access, to track and deploy a surgical device in a\npre-measured ilio-femoral region.\nOn 5/28/14 animal 1576, underwent an IACUC approved procedure. Before the animal was euthanized, an\nadditional procedure (performed while the animal was anesthetized), which was not reviewed and approved by the\nIACUC, took place. The procedure used carotid access to place and pass a 14 Fr long sheath into the descending\naorta.\nThe facility stated that the additional procedures were used for practicing surgical techniques for upcoming studies.\nThe facility requires the principle investigator or study director to fill out a form requesting the additional procedure,\nbut the request is not reviewed and approved by the IACUC. The facility stated they are currently creating a process\nto include IACUC review and approval of all additional procedures.\nUnapproved activities or significant changes to ongoing activities could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and\nput the animal's welfare at risk. Proposed activities or significant changes to ongoing activities must be reviewed\nand approved by the IACUC to ensure the proper care and use of animals.\nTo be corrected by 7/18/14.\nInspection and exit briefing was conducted with a clinical veterinarian, a study director and quality assurance\nrepresentatives."
