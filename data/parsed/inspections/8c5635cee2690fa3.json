Two hours later the zebra had still not been attended to. The inspectors spoke with the\nauction representative and stated that something needed to be done to address the acute pain and suffering of the zebra\nand asked if she had called the Attending Veterinarian to see if any medications could be administered for pain if the\nzebra could not be immediately euthanized. This was done an hour later. Lack of accessibility to appropriate and timely\nemergency care led to additional pain, distress and suffering for this zebra.

Attendants were noted emptying water buckets by \ndumping the water into the enclosures which contributed to drainage issues. Drainage issues can lead to multiple \nproblems including contamination of feed/hay fed on the ground, contaminated haircoats/skin of the animals, odors, \nfly/pest issues and unstable slippery footing that can lead to slips/falls and injuries to the animals. A suitable method shall \nbe provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by April 30, 2022. \n3.131(c) \n   \nSanitation. \nHousekeeping regarding trash in enclosures needs to addressed. One bison (auction tag 4967) had twine wrapped \ninbetween its hooves and around the outside of the lower leg. An enclosure housing two water buffalo (auction tag 5098) \nhad stray pieces of sharp edged metal (the larger approximately 12 inches by 6 inches) on the ground inside their \nenclosure. Trash items inside animal enclosures can lead to injury of the animals. Grounds must be kept clean with all \ntrash placed in designated areas to protect the health of the animals. Correct by April 30, 2022. \n3.137(a)(6) \n   \nPrimary enclosures used to transport live animals. \nOne large wire African crested porcupine enclosure did not have handles (auction tag 122). The auction attendants were \nnoted carrying the enclosure from the outside exotic area into the auction ring by putting their fingers through the \nenclosure openings. Adequate handholds or other devices for lifting are necessary to allow the enclosure to be moved \nsafely without it being dropped or any injury to the animal or the attendants. Adequate handholds or other devices for\n\nlifting shall be provided to enable the enclosure to be lifted without tilting and to ensure that the person handling the \nenclosure will not be in contact with the animal. Correct by April 30, 2022. \n3.137(e) \n   \nPrimary enclosures used to transport live animals. \nThree African crested porcupine enclosures were not clearly marked on top and on one side with the words Live Animal \nor Wild Animal (auction tags 122-124). Accurate markings are necessary to ensure that everyone who comes near the \nenclosure has knowledge of what may be in the enclosure and how to properly orient it. Enclosures shall be clearly \nmarked on top and on one or more sides with the words Live Animal or Wild Animal in letters not less than 1 inch in height \nand with arrows or other markings to indicate the upright position. Correct by April 30, 2022. \n3.36(a) \n   \nPrimary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters. \nA guinea pig enclosure (auction tag 100) housing two young guinea pigs was not of sufficient structural strength and \nconstruction. The enclosure was a purple plastic storage tub with no top that was set on the floor just under a table. Along \nwith no top, it was also damaged with duct tape repairs. The lack of a top and structural strength means that the animals \ncould come to physical harm or escape if the tub were to be kicked or knocked over accidentally or if a member of the \npublic or their pet reached into the tub toward the animals. The primary enclosures used for guinea pigs shall be \nconstructed in such as manner that the structural strength of the enclosure shall be sufficient to contain the guinea pigs \nand withstand rigors of transportation and the auction process. Correct by April 30, 2022. \n3.36(a)(5) \n   \nPrimary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters. \nTwo guinea pig enclosures (auction tag 100 and 101 housing 2 and 5 guinea pigs respectively) had insufficient ventilation \nopenings. Both enclosures only had ventilation openings on one side (the top). Ventilation openings are required on\n\nmultiple sides in order to allow for cross ventilation and to allow continued ventilation if one side\u2019s openings are \naccidentally blocked. There must be ventilation openings located on two opposite walls (encompassing at least 16 percent \nof each total wall surface area) of the primary guinea pig enclosure or on all four walls (8 percent of each total wall surface \narea). Correct by April 30, 2022. \n \nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives on March 3-4, 2022. \nThe exit interview was conducted with the lead inspector and a facility representative on March 8, 2022. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nJeffrey Shepherd, SUPERVISORY ANIMAL CARE SPECIALISTEnd Section",
