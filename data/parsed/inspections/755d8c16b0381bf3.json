The modification also did not adequately describe post-operative care such that the IACUC could assure\nthat the post-operative care provided is in accordance with established veterinary medical practices . The\nmodification stated that the animals would be monitored until fully recovered and then daily but did include what the\nmonitoring would include or what provision would be made for any necessary post-operative pain control. In order to\napprove any proposed significant changes in ongoing activities the IACUC must ensure that all activities involving\nsurgery include appropriate provision for post-operative care and that procedures are performed using aseptic\ntechniques to ensure the well-being of the animals. The IACUC shall ensure that the principal investigator has\nincluded appropriate provision for post-operative care and aseptic technique in the protocol modification.
