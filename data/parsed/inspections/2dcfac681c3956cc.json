The report of the injury was confirmed by an FWC\ninvestigation. The licensee seemed to dispute that there was an injury. The facility described how these encounters\nare done: The monkey has a harness and leash and while visitors are seated at a table the monkey is allowed to go\nup and touch them and the visitors are instructed on how to touch and interact with the monkeys. When asked what\nhappens if a monkey becomes aggressive they stated that their animals are not at all aggressive but they can call\nthem back away from the visitors. When asked is there was anything in place that would prevent a monkey from\nscratching or biting a visitor, no explanation was provided.\nMacaque monkeys are known to be potential asymptomatic carriers of B virus, a virus that can potentially be fatal to\nhumans. It can be transmitted by bite or scratch. Recommendations for exposure to a macaque bite or scratch often\nincludes the use of antivirals which can sometimes have unpleasant side effects. The owner stated that she is\naware of this disease but disputes that it is a risk. They routinely use macaques in their encounter episodes. Other\ndiseases that might be of concern with such close contact with wild or exotic animal, such as rabies, could also\npotentially result in that animal being euthanized in order to test it.\nAnimals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the public with sufficient distance or barriers\nbetween the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.\nCorrect from this point forward."
