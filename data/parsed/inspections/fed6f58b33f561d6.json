On a black adult rabbit there was a raised, circular area of hair loss above the nose. The hairless area was\napproximately 2 cm in diameter. The visible skin was pink/red in color, becoming red and inflamed towards the\ncenter of the hairless area. There was a smaller area of hair loss on the forehead and the visible skin appeared pink\nin color.\nThis particular condition had not been documented by facility staff.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being\nare recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior\nmust be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate\ncare. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and\nthe increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily\nobservations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and\nappropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nDate to be Corrected: May 20, 2019"
