      "narrative": "Many animal enclosures were noted to be in need of maintenance. These include:\n***Damaged kick-ins (overhangs). Kick-ins are an important part of the enclosure fence that keep animals from\nclimbing out and escaping. All kick-ins must be maintained in good condition to ensure the animals can be securely\ncontained.\nCougar enclosure (contains 2 cougars) (cid:19)has an approximately 12'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is damaged and\ninstead of protruding into the enclosure, it is bent downwards or straight vertically (parallel to the fence). Also, in the\noverlook area, the kick-in is very flexible with no solid support. It is easily accessible to the public who can bend it\nover and damage it.\nCorrect by: 1/9/16\nSilver fox enclosure (contains 2 fox) (cid:19)has an approximately 15'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is bent over and part of it\nis no long connected to the support bars.\nCorrect by: 1/23/16\nBison/elk north pasture (contains 27 bison and 25 elk) has several areas of the north line of fence where the kick-in\nis damaged and bent downwards.\nCorrect by: 2/6/16\n***J hooks above ground in animal enclosures. The J hooks are used to secure the ground line that keeps the\nanimals from digging out. These hooks are protruding anywhere from 6(cid:29)\" to 12\"(cid:29) above the ground. An animal can\neasily be injured by these protrusions by catching or trapping a paw. All J hooks must be placed below the ground\nline or removed.\nThe cougar, coyote (contains 2 coyotes), and red fox (contains 2 fox) enclosure have many exposed J hooks.\nCorrect by: 11/7/15\n***Many ground lines (the chain link buried under the ground to keep animals from digging out) were exposed.\nExposure in these enclosures ranged from 2'(cid:25) to more than 15(cid:25)'. Injury could occur if an animal got a paw trapped or\ncaught in the ground line. All ground lines should be covered to prevent animal injury.\nThe lynx (1 lynx), bobcat (2 bobcats) and coyote (2 coyote) enclosures have exposed ground line.\nCorrect by: 12/31/15\n***The raccoon enclosure (contains 2 raccoons) has numerous sharp metal points on the wire used to make the\nenclosure. The sharp metal points are on all sides and the top of the enclosure. When testing the sharpness, the\ninspector could easily have broken her own skin by applying mild pressure to the point. Raccoons are climbers and\nwere observed climbing all over the metal on the enclosure. It would be very easy for one of the animals to be\ninjured by the metal points. All sharp metal points must be removed.\nCorrect by: 10/10/15\n***An enclosure containing 11 goats has a back fence that is in poor repair. It is very rusty and bent out of shape.\nThere is also a large hole that has been dug under this fence. This hole can easily allow entry of unwanted animals\nor trap a goat (either a foot or horn). The integrity of the fence is compromised by the bending and the rust and may\nnot safely contain the animals. The hole could allow entry of a predator or could cause injury to the goats. The\nenclosure must contain the animals safely and securely and protect them from predator entry.\nCorrect by: 3/5/16\n***The enclosure containing (cid:28)Big Mike(cid:29) the bison has a significantly bent area of fence and a gap between the gate\nand the fence. The structural integrity of the fence is compromised when it is bent and may not be able to prevent\nan animal from escaping. The gap is approximately 6\"(cid:29) wide at the bottom and gets wider at the top. This is an area\nwhere the bison could get a leg or horn trapped, or that an unwanted animal could enter. The enclosure needs to be\nfixed so that it safely and securely contains the animal.\nCorrect by: 11/28/15\n***The north pasture containing 27 bison and 25 elk has fencing in need of repair. Along an area of new fencing,\nthere is a large area (~40 feet long, and 3(cid:25) feet deep) of washout, creating a large gap between the ground and the\nfence. It would be possible for a small elk or calf to roll under the fence and escape. Along the north fence line,\nthere are least 2 areas where holes (big enough for a large raccoon or small coyote) have been dug under the\nfence. This allows entry of unwanted animals that could cause injury to the animals. The fencing needs to be fixed\nand maintained in a way that safely and securely contains the animals and keeps unwanted animals out. Also in the\nnorth pasture, there is a ~25'(cid:25) long section of chain link fence lying unused on the ground. Weeds have started\ngrowing through and around the chain link. This fencing is a hazard to the animals; they could get their legs or\nhorns/antlers hung in the fencing and injury themselves. The fencing needs to be removed from this area.\nCorrect by: 10/3/15\n***An enclosure containing one adult male black bear (TR) does not have a hot wire that is working. The bear was\nseen sniffing at the wire (or something right at the wire). He had no reaction, indicating that he did not receive any\nsort of shock from the wire. Also, in the badger enclosure, the hot wire entering the enclosure was not connected to\nthe wire running around the enclosure. The lack of hot wire can compromise the ability of the enclosure to maintain\nthe animals, allowing them to escape. A system in which the hot wire can be maintained and checked for function\nneeds to be established.\nCorrect by: 11/21/15\nExit interview conducted with facility representatives."
