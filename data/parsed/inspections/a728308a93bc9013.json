When the caretaker rinsed out the\nlarger trough and began filling it the cattle (4 domestic cows, 1 water buffalo) eagerly approached the trough and\nbegan to drink while it was being filled. Other cattle also began to approach the trough while we continued the\ninspection. The animals actions indicate they were very thirsty. The troughs are checked in the morning and filled\nat the end of the day. This inspection was conducted in the afternoon when the temperature was in the low 80's, the\ntroughs were already empty or nearly empty. While the pond is being repaired and the troughs are the main source\nof water, two troughs being filled once a day is not sufficient to provide enough water for all of the large hoof stock\n(30). Access to water, especially when the temperatures are high is essential for the animals health. Water must be\nprovided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.\nCorrected immediately.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Caretaker."
