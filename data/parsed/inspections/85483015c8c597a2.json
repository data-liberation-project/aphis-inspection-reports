The animal sustained a ruptured left lung due to overinflation and was euthanized.\nThe facility investigated this incident and found that the veterinary technician did not open the pop-off valve on the\nanesthetic machine, causing excessive pressure to build in the anesthetic system. The facility must ensure correct\nanesthesia practices are implemented and maintained. Not properly setting up the anesthetic machine during anesthesia\ncan lead to pain, suffering or death of the animal. In order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, the program\nof adequate veterinary care must provide appropriate guidance to personnel with regard to handling, immobilization,\nanesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia of the animals at the facility.\nCorrections had been instituted prior to the inspection in order to prevent recurrence.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nEnd Section"
