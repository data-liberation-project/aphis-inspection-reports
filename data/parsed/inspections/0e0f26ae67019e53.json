The public interaction with the otter started in early February and during\nthat first month there were two incidents where visitors received minor wounds from the otter. Since February there\nhave been two additional incidents where visitors received minor wound from the otter.\nDuring public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.\nSome of the ways this can be achieved are by a barrier between the public and the animal, a harness on the\nanimal, or training that requires the animal to respond immediately to commands.\nOtters can be aggressive and have strong teeth and a powerful bite. They have the potential to cause serious injury\nto a person.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
