      "narrative": "The licensee did not perform adequate daily observations on the 13-year-old female rabbit that was observed with\ndiarrhea and did not have the rabbit seen by their attending veterinarian or communicate all past medical issues. The\nrabbit had a large amount of fecal matter stuck to her butt which caused her to have an abnormal hop. Soft watery fecal\nmatter was observed in the center of the hard dried clumps of feces around her butt. When the dried feces was cleaned\noff, it exposed a large area of hair loss and the visible skin was red and inflamed with cloudy purulent discharge in some\nareas. Also, the rabbit was seen with an approximately 1.5 x 2.5 inch hairless area on the neck just behind the ears. The\nvisible skin was pink and there were scabs covering some healed wounds.\nThe licensee said she contacted her veterinarian about a month ago regarding this rabbit potentially having ear mites and\nbought an over-the-counter ear mite treatment. The attending veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and\nverified the licensee contacted her about ear mites and made a recommendation for treatment but had never seen this\nrabbit for the possible ear mite issue or for other medical issues. The licensee failed to contact their attending veterinarian\nto seek proper diagnosis and treatments. It is the responsibility of the licensee to contact the attending veterinarian so\nhe/she can provide adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.\nDaily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being are\nrecognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must be\nconveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. Failure to\nproperly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and the increase risk of\ndevelopment of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily observations of all animals to\nensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the\nattending veterinarian.\nDate to be Corrected: April 1, 2022"
