Approximately 40 members of the public were seen observing the five oriental small-clawed otters. A\nsign was posted for shows at 3pm and 7pm daily and the fair schedule shows two shows daily from 18-July to 21-July-\n2024. The inspector talked to a worker of the exhibit that stated they were not aware of licensing information and a call\nwould need to be made to the licensees. The inspector left the fairgrounds at 3:40pm. A phone call between the inspector\nand licensee was conducted on 19-July-2024 where the licensee stated they did not have a USDA license and they would\ncontinue to conduct regulated activity without a license.\nConducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that APHIS\nofficials can assess the care of the animals. The facility must obtain a license from the USDA to continue conducting\nregulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act. Continuing to conduct regulated activity without a license is a serious\nviolation of the Animal Welfare Act.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.\nn"
