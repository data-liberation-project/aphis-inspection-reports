      "narrative": "Two studies were conducted on an IACUC approved protocol from July 2018 - October 2018.\n1) The protocol describes humane endpoints for the animals on study, which include an upper limit for tumor size. If\nan endpoint is reached, the protocol states that the animal is to be removed from the study and humanely\neuthanized. One animal on study from July 2018 to August 2018 was identified with a tumor that exceeded the\nupper size limit described in the protocol. This animal was maintained on study and received a test compound after\nhaving reached this humane endpoint. Deviation from the IACUC approved endpoints can lead to compromised\nwelfare of the affected animal. Failure to remove this animal from study once the endpoint was reached constituted\na significant change without IACUC review or approval\n2) This protocol indicates that animal weights are to be monitored twice weekly while on study, with more frequent\nmonitoring instituted if weight loss is identified. On review of available health monitoring records, weights were\nroutinely monitored only once per week. 7 animals were identified to have weight loss while on study, and no\nincreased frequency of monitoring was instituted as required by the protocol. Deviation from the IACUC approved\nmonitoring compromises the ability of investigators to identify problems of animal health or welfare. Failure to\nmonitor these animals in accordance with the protocol constituted a significant change without IACUC review or\napproval.\nAny significant change in ongoing activities regarding the care and use of animals must be reviewed and approved\nby the IACUC prior to being instituted.\nCorrected at the time of inspection.\nThis inspection and initial exit interview was conducted on June 24th, 2019 with a facility representative. A final exit\ninterview was conducted with facility personnel on June 26th, 2019."
