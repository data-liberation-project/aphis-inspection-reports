The\nprincipal investigator's staff euthanized the animal to prevent any further suffering. However, the attending\nveterinarian was not notified of this incident for 5 days until Tuesday, October 3, 2017. When daily observation of\nanimals is performed by research staff, the attending veterinarian must be notified of issues regarding animal health\nin a timely fashion in order to assure that adequate and appropriate veterinary care is provided to the animals at the\nfacility at all times. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication shall be established and maintained to\nassure that timely and accurate information regarding animal health issues is conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian. To be corrected by: November 24, 2017."
