The ambient temperature in the interior of the building was 98.5 F at approximately 1330 hours.\nBoth primates were bright and alert, and neither appeared to be suffering any ill effects from the heat at this time.\nSheltered facilities must be able to maintain the interior temperature between 45 and 85 degrees F. Failure to\ncontrol temperature extremes can have a serious impact on the health and well being of enclosed animals. The\nfacility is correcting the current problem by moving both primates to outdoor enclosures until construction of the\nsheltered portion is completed."
