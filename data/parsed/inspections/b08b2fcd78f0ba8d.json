The animals were repeatedly\nasked to perform behaviors for which they were rewarded by having food tossed to them to catch.

      "narrative": "***Three seals and three sea lions were observed by APHIS personnel to have eye lesions or were identified as\nhaving chronic eye issues in their medical records. Medical records dating as far back as 2015 to present indicated\nthat veterinary treatment has been provided for numerous eye conditions, including squinting (which could be\nindicative of pain), corneal edema, inflammation, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, chronic corneal fibrosis, chronic\nkeratitis, aqueous flare, and corneal opacities.\nAPHIS personnel reviewed water quality records from the seal and sea lion pools from December 2016 to March\n2017. The institution\u2019s guidelines indicate that bromine ranges for pinnipeds should stay between the range of\n0.7-1.0 (unit of measurement not identified in institutional documents). On 1/7/17, 1/16/17, 1/31/17, 2/9/17, 3/3/17,\nand 3/24/17, spikes in bromine levels were noted in the primary seal lion pool, with levels as high as 1.84. These\nbromine spikes are outside of the institution\u2019s own guidelines and is likely contributing not only to eye discomfort but\nmay possibly cause harm to the animals\u2019 eyes. The protocol indicates that when bromine levels are below the\nacceptable range, the action required is to \u201cadjust bromine feeder.\u201d Once the bromine feeder has been adjusted,\nthere is no documentation of follow up testing performed that same day to determine that bromine levels had\nstabilized.\nThe protocol indicates that when bromine levels are above the institution\u2019s acceptable range, the instructions are to\n\u201cadd 25 oz sodium thiosulfate directly to the pool then retest.\u201d No documentation was provided showing that sodium\nthiosulfate was added to the pool when bromine levels were elevated. Additionally, the documentation provided\ndoes not show that follow up water testing was performed that same day to determine that bromine levels had\nstabilized.\nThe institution\u2019s acceptable range for bromine in the polar bear pools is between 1-1.5 (unit of measurement not\nidentified in institutional documents). The polar bear primary pool exceeded 1.5 on 1/15/17, 1/16/17, 1/17/17,\n2/16/17, 2/17/17, 2/18/17, 2/19/17, 3/20/17. The polar bear secondary pool exceeded 1.5 on 12/29/16, thirteen\ntimes in January 2017, and twice in March (on 3/13/17 and 3/20/17). Some of the bromine levels were as high as\n3.46. Additionally, bromine levels were not checked on January 2, as it was noted in the records that \u201cno Br packets\nleft, Br not tested.\u201d On January 3, bromine levels had exceeded acceptable limits.\nBromine spikes and brominated disinfection byproducts may lead to the development and exacerbation of eye\nproblems in marine animals. The sea lions and seals have a history of chronic, intermittent eye conditions that could\nin part be caused by the high levels of bromine and bromine byproducts found in their water. The institutions\nguidelines are not detailed enough for employees to adequately respond to fluctuating bromine levels.\nThe facility should, as a part of its program for water quality, consult with water quality specialists, revise their SOP\u2019s\nto include more detail and retrain staff on water quality procedures. Bromine levels need to be monitored closely\nand re-testing of the water needs to occur more frequently once high bromine levels are noted.\nThe facility must ensure that when water is chemically treated, the chemicals shall be added so as not to cause\nharm or discomfort to the marine animals.\nTo be corrected by: May 27, 2017"

Since this is the only soft area in the exhibit, it is a highly desirable area\nand can add to potential stress and frustration for the bear who cannot access the sand.\nAPHIS personnel observed the male brown bear engaging in an abnormal behavior pattern of pacing. APHIS\npersonnel observed this abnormal behavior for approximately ten minutes in the morning, during which time the\nbehavior did not stop, and then returned during the afternoon of the following day and observed the abnormal\npacing behavior again.

According to the curator of behavioral husbandry, she is aware of the male\nbear\u2019s abnormal behavior pattern and stated that the female also exhibits an abnormal behavior of head swinging.\nThis enclosure limits the bears\u2019 ability to perform species specific behaviors because it lacks adequate functional\nand structural elements, including adequate space, adequate opportunities to exhibit climbing behavior, and\nappropriate quantity of natural substrates. Pacing and head swinging in brown bears are abnormal behavior\npatterns and can indicate stress, frustration or an underlying medical condition.
