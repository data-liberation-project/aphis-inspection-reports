The guinea pigs were being transported in\nmultiple plastic shoebox type containers most of which were 13inx20inx4in high. These containers were not\nmanufactured for animal transport or housing. Someone had drilled a round hole about 1 cm in diameter\napproximately every 3 inches in one row just under the lid on each of the four sides of the enclosure. The lids had\nno holes. The number of ventilation openings were not sufficient to provide needed ventilation for the animals. This\nwas evidenced by condensation forming on the inside walls of a couple of the containers. When these wet\ncontainers were opened, a rush of warm wet air was released. Lack of adequate ventilation can lead to\ncondensation and heat buildup and over time lead to air quality issues that may affect the health and life of the\nanimals. The facility shall ensure that an adequate amount of ventilation openings are present (at least 8% of the\ntotal surface area of each wall if all four walls are ventilated) and that there are ventilation openings on both the\nupper and lower half of the enclosure. Correct from this day forward."

Taking into account about half an inch of shavings in the\nenclosures this leaves only about 3 1/2 inches of height for the guinea pigs. This does not provide enough height for\nthe guinea pigs to stand up and make normal postural adjustments.
