The licensee got it out and its right hind leg was found to wobble in\nmultiple directions at the hock joint, indicating it was likely broken. The appearance of the break was that it had happened\nsome time ago because no swelling was present and the chinchilla did not react when the lower portion of the leg was\ntouched. When asked, the licensee said he did not know what had happened to it or how long ago it happened and does\nnot remember when the note on the enclosure card of \"Leg\" was made about it. This chinchilla had not received any\ntreatment for this condition prior to inspection and likely went through unrelieved pain when the bone injury occurred and\nunderwent the healing process un-stabilized (untreated).\nEnsure that conditions such as injured/broken legs are promptly reported to the attending veterinarian so that treatment\ncan be administered right away.\n**Note**\nThis chinchilla was taken to a veterinarian by the licensee the same evening (11/3/2021)."

Her right eyeball's surface\nappeared to be drier and had an area of a brown scab-like material on the center of the eyeball with some veins on the\nsurface of the eye going to the center.

This animal's enclosure had not been marked for treatment prior to inspection.\nA chinchilla in 21C was seen to have wet fur under its chin and chest. The licensee held it and it was found that an area\nunder its left mandible was had a hard bump likely associated with the jawbone. This protrusion seen with the hair loss\nand slobbers observed could be a problem occurring in its mouth and causing discomfort and creating difficulty eating.\nWhile her body condition was found to be adequate, her mouth condition needs further evaluation by the attending\nveterinarian.\nFour chinchillas were found to have eye problems not on the treatment plan:\nChinchilla in 33D was found to have her right eye crusted shut, some mild hair loss and when handled by the licensee\nthere was some pale discharge that came out and the eyeball could not be easily visualized.\nA female grey (middle room, middle south row, 11 enclosures counting from the east end), cage card DOB 8-8-15; was\nfound to have a crusted left eye, mild pale discharge with some hair loss and reddened eyelids.\nA female grey (no cage card; front room, north row by the wall, 23rd enclosure from the middle door); was found to have a\ncrusted left eye, mild pale discharge, and the left eye could not be easily visualized."
