The crates, accounting for bedding, only provided about 4 in. of height. This height did not allow the\nolder prairie dogs to sit up in their normal position. Lack of adequate space prevents the animals from making\nnormal postural adjustments and may lead to distress. All primary enclosures used to transport live animals shall be\nlarge enough to ensure that each animal has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural\nadjustments. Correct from this inspection forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nThis inspection was conducted at the Espresso Exotic Animal Expo in Cowan, TN."
