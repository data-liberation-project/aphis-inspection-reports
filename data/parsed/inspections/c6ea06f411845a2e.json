The remaining chickens were\nunaffected. There were no other broken or compromised structures noted or suspected as a point of entry. Housing\nfacilities that fail to restrict other animals from entering may subject animals to predation or other welfare risks. Upon\nidentifying the space in the housing structure and prior to inspection, the facility sealed this space with a board that also\ncreates a higher barrier into the housing; no animals have since been affected.
