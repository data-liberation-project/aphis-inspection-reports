      "narrative": "During inspection the following personnel qualification issues were found:\n- On 5 May 2024 a lab self-reported an incident to the IACUC committee regarding a sheep on an IACUC approved\nactivity. On 27 April 2024 a miscommunication between the veterinarian and the veterinary technician resulted in a sheep\nbeing under-dosed pain medication prescribed by the veterinarian. Corrective action included retraining of staff that\nadminister pain medication on proper dosing and recording of medications.\n- On 27 September 2023 a lab self-reported an incident to the IACUC committee regarding a sheep on an IACUC\napproved activity involving a painful procedure where multimodal pain medication would be used to minimize pain.\nMedication doses were not given during post-operative recovery after transferring care of the animal from veterinary staff\nto laboratory staff. On 23 September 2023 one pain medication dose was not administered and on 23 September and 24\nSeptember 2023 an antibiotic was not administered. Without receiving the designated pain medication and antibiotic\nmedication there is a concern of the animal experiencing pain from the procedure. The animal was examined by a\nveterinarian after the incident was reported and appeared to be within normal limits, no signs of pain or distress were\nobserved. Corrective action included student personnel involved receiving additional training regarding the transfer of care\nfrom veterinary staff post-operatively to laboratory staff.\n- On 3 April 2023 a lab self-reported an incident to the IACUC committee involving 3 nonhuman primates on a IACUC\napproved activity that allowed fluid restriction to promote motivation for behavioral tasks. The amount of water obtained\nduring training sessions and in the primary enclosure is recorded by laboratory staff each day. The fluid logs indicated that\nthe minimum fluid allotment was not received by animal one on 4 dates, by animal two on 2 dates, and by animal three on\n1 date. In addition, the laboratory did not contact veterinary staff prior to initiating a new level of fluid restriction as\ndescribed in the protocol. Veterinary staff noted that animal one had a decreased appetite, which improved with\nunrestricted fluid and remaining on unrestricted fluid until cleared by veterinary staff. Animals two and three did not have\nany observed health issues. Corrective action included retraining staff to ensure the minimum amount of water is given\nevery day, filling out water intake logs and submitting to the IACUC for animals on water restriction.\n- On 10 March 2023 during IACUC review of animal facilities it was found that 6 hamsters used for an IACUC approved\nactivity on 10 February 2023 were anesthetized for a procedure using an expired anesthetic. Laboratory staff indicated on\nrecords that no unusual effects on the hamsters were noted, and they recovered from the procedure normally. Corrective\nand preventative measures included disposal and replacement of the expired anesthetic and implementing measures to\nensure that expired drugs are not used in the future.\nThe facility was unable to ensure that all personnel involved in the care, treatment and use of the above documented\nanimals were qualified to fulfill their responsibilities and be familiar with the procedures for these IACUC approved\nactivities, resulting in negative impact on the health and wellbeing of these animals. Develop a program of training and\ninstruction to all scientists and all personnel involved with research activities that ensures that all personnel and members\nof research teams are trained and qualified to perform their duties and to follow procedures in IACUC approved activities\nso that research animals receive proper care.\nAll the incidents documented above were investigated by the IACUC. Corrective measures had been implemented prior to\ninspection, to remain corrected from 10 September 2024 forward."

On 14 February 2024 a nonhuman primate escaped during a training session to the box chair. The\nnonhuman primate sustained a small contusion above the left eye during the recapture process. The nonhuman primate\nwas provided with adequate veterinary care for the contusion. Corrective action included retraining staff on box chair\nprocedures for smaller animals.\n- On 23 August 2023 a self-reported incident to the IACUC committee involving a nonhuman primate on a IACUC\napproved activity. On 14 August 2023 a nonhuman primate escaped their primary enclosure during a routine husbandry\nbank change. The staff member used a stool to transfer the nonhuman primate to a top bank. During the process, the\nnonhuman primate jumped from the jump box to the cage, then back into the jump box, catching the staff member off\nguard and causing the box to fall and the nonhuman primate to escape. During the escape the nonhuman primate\nclimbed on top of another enclosure, which allowed its digits to enter another animal\u2019s primary enclosure, resulting in a\ntoe injury which required subsequent amputation of the toe during treatment of the injury. Corrective actions included\nusing caging banks that allow for side-to-side jumping eliminating the need for a jump transfer box, training staff on the\nuse of lifts at the facility, and investing in additional equipment to allow for shifting without jump transfer boxes.\n- On 31 March 2023 a lab self-reported an incident to the IACUC committee involving a nonhuman primate on a IACUC\napproved activity. On 27 March 2023 a nonhuman primate escaped during the yoking process to move the nonhuman\nprimate into the box chair. While the nonhuman primate was loose in the lab area, a beaker was broken, and the\nnonhuman primate placed a piece of glass in its mouth resulting in two cuts within the mouth. Upon recapture the\nnonhuman primate was examined and provided adequate veterinary care. Corrective action included retraining staff on\nyoking and box chair operations, and preventing and handling animal escapes. All glassware was removed and replaced\nwith plastic in the lab areas.\nThe facility was unable to ensure that all personnel involved in the handling and use of the above document animals were\nable to handle animals in a manner to prevent physical harm.
