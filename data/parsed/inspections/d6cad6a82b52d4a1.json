There is a barrier approximately 4' in height in front of the enclosure,\nhowever both sides are open ended where the public could enter and have contact with the tiger and become\ninjured. To assure there is minimal risk of harm and safety to the public the barrier must assure the public cannot\nhave access to the enclosure.\nThe licensee stated there are guided tours at this facility, however members of the public especially larger groups\nof children could go around the open ended barrier having contact with a potential dangerous animal.
