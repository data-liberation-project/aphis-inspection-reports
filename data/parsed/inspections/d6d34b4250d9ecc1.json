She also stood with her head down at times and occasionally shifted weight off of her left front\nfoot and was seen to take a few steps without bearing any weight on her left front foot.

Altered gait may indicate pain which\ncan result from trauma, chronic skeletal problems and other medical problems.

The macaque was observed to pluck at the hair/skin in this area of his arm during the majority of\ntime during the inspection that he was observed while in the outdoor portion of his enclosure. The facility\nrepresentative believes that the plucking has improved since first cited in December 2015 but has no documentation\nto show this and document his progress other than the fact that he is now plucking one forearm rather than both.\nThis animal was evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) on 11 Dec 2015. At that time, the AV recommended\nproviding insects in a fleece pad to simulate social grooming. The facility representative reports that the animal did\nnot seem to enjoy this but did not report that information back to the AV for further instructions. Also at that meeting,\nthe AV suggested looking into finding the animal a new home or providing antianxiety medications. As of the time of\nthis inspection, the facility has not has not communicated with the AV about these options or about the ongoing\ncondition of the animal.\nDaily observation and direct, timely, and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the\nheath and care of the animals. Lack of communication of ongoing problems might result in a delay of treatment if\nseverity of the problem is not known by the veterinarian. The licensee must establish as part of the program of\nveterinary care a plan of daily observation and a mechanism of direct, timely and frequent communication so that\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian.\nCorrect by 4 March 2016"

The\nwritten environmental enrichment plan that has been approved by the (AV) does not include special considerations\nfor nonhuman primates that are showing signs of being in psychological distress. The facility has been offering a\nvariety of enrichment items but the items and the plan for their use are not specified in the current enrichment plan\nand the hair/skin plucking continues. Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that must be\naddressed when in captivity. Failure to do so can result in a variety of behavior problems including, but not limited\nto, hair/skin plucking.
