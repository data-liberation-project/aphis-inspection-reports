      "narrative": "Three animals are in need of evaluation by a veterinarian:\n*One 12-13 year old blind lame male pig is extremely thin with extensive muscle loss. The pig\u2019s ribs, spine and hip bones\nare prominent. The pig\u2019s skin appears dry with loss of elasticity suggesting possible dehydration. The facility owner stated\nthat the pig was seen about two months ago by their veterinarian for weight loss and said that he recommended\neuthanasia once he started to worsen. No medical workup was done at that time. The owner states he does look like he\nhas continued to lose more weight since that visit two weeks ago. Continued weight loss can be a sign of a serious\nmedical condition and needs to be medically evaluated.\n*Two growing capybara that lost their toes due to frostbite earlier this year were inspected. The wounds are closed/have\nhealed and the capybara are currently not on any medication. The facility owner reports they are eating well and getting\naround inside the gift shop and the small outdoor exercise area they have access to during the day. During the inspection\nit was noted that the capybara were reluctant/slow to put weight on their front limbs. When sitting they would often sit on\ntheir haunches with their front feet in the air in an apparent attempt to keep their weight off their front feet. The owner\nstated that they were not currently on any medications and that their vet stated that the animals needed to develop some\ncalluses. A conversation with the vet stated that she hasn\u2019t seen them for a couple of months/seen them ambulating. The\ncapybaras\u2019 current condition needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian regarding discomfort and possible pain especially\nwhen ambulating. This is especially critical as the capybara are still growing/gaining weight and that additional weight will\nneed to be distributed on all four limbs.\nAll animals with ongoing conditions must be regularly evaluated by a veterinarian especially as conditions\nchange/progress to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. The facility shall contact their veterinarian to have the\npig and the capybara examined and all conditions diagnosed and treated appropriately. Correct by 10/7/21."

      "narrative": "The facility contacted me in early March of 2021 to notify me that two young capybara had sustained major frostbite of the\ntoes of all four feet after a severe freeze/cold weather snap that occurred at the end of February 2021. The capybara were\ntreated by their attending veterinarian and the facility obtained additional treatment guidance from a veterinarian that\nworks with a Capybara Foundation. The capybara had been housed in a small unheated shed/barn with access to an\noutside pen at the time of incident. The capybara were moved into the gift shop building (heated). The combination of\nweather conditions and the lack of access to a heated shelter structure led to climatic conditions that presented a threat to\nthe capybara\u2019s health and well-being in the short term with frostbite and sloughing of the toes of all four feet and in the\nlong term due to the loss of their feet. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal\u2019s health or well-being,\nappropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal must never be subjected to\nany combination of temperature, humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal\u2019s health or well-being taking into\nconsideration such factors as the animal\u2019s age, species, breed, overall health and acclimation.
