The veterinarian evaluated these animals on September 9, 2021 and provided\ncontact information for a farrier to trim the hooves. The licensee told the inspectors at the last visit that the appointment\nwith the farrier was to occur at the time of the next veterinary visit, scheduled for September 23, 2021. As of the date of\ninspection, the hooves remain untrimmed and the veterinarian has not returned to re-evaluate the animals. Until the\nhooves are trimmed, the veterinarian's recommendation has not been followed. In addition, there is now a failure to\nprovide follow up veterinary care for the animals that were to be re-evaluated by the veterinarian on September 23: Two\nwhite-tailed deer and five addax that are thin, one female oryx with a mass on its chest, and one lame female ibex that still\ncarries her left foreleg forward.\nFailure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries, and lack of\nfollow-through for animals under veterinary care can worsen their condition and prolong their discomfort. The licensee\nneeds to follow the veterinarian's recommendations and must ensure that veterinary care is available for all the animals\nwhen needed, to include follow up and any further diagnostics and treatment recommended by the veterinarian for\nanimals that are under veterinary care."
