The licensee had identified the issue and\nwas either treating them but not per the program of veterinary care, choosing not to treat, without consulting the attending\nveterinarian, or the veterinarian had not been consulted when the rabbit did not improve after long ongoing treatment by\nthe licensee:\n\u2022 In Building 1, a brown rabbit\u2019s right eye was mostly closed with red crusty eyelids. The licensee explained that the rabbit\nat a young age developed issues with the eye and eventually lost it. The veterinarian was never consulted on treatment.\n\u2022 One gray and brown rabbit in Building 1 had its right rear leg splayed out. Another brown rabbit in Building 1 had both\nrear legs splayed out away from its body. The deformity affected the gait of both these rabbits and per the licensee they\nhad been that way since birth. These rabbits had not received treatment and the veterinarian was not consulted.\n\u2022 One tan and white rabbit in Building 1 had a severely affected right eye that was swollen and red, oozing yellow and\nwhite discharge down the rabbit\u2019s face forming crusts above its lip. The rabbit could not keep its right eye open and per\nthe licensee has been having issues with that eye since birth. The licensee has been treating the eye for the duration of\nthis rabbit\u2019s life without consulting the veterinarian.\n\u2022 Approximately 15 rabbits in Building 1 had varying degrees of hairlessness on their faces. The licensee explained the\nhair is most likely being pulled by the neighbor through the wires. The licensee did not institute preventative measures for\nthese rabbits as he did in other areas.\n\u2022 A lethargic, unkempt white rabbit with grey ears in enclosure 202 had significant cream colored discharge oozing from\nboth its eyes that had caused a hairless red area of skin along the path the discharge followed toward the nose. The\nlicensee has been treating this rabbit for approximately 1 year without consulting his attending veterinarian.\nSome rabbits were being treated with medication listed in the program of veterinary care, but the correct duration was not\nbeing followed. For example, instead of using a medication for 5 days, the licensee is using it as needed, and in some\ncases, for a year without contacting the attending veterinarian when the rabbit didn\u2019t improve. Medical care that is not\nbeing done per the veterinarian\u2019s instructions can result in inappropriate methods to diagnose and treat conditions such\nas those listed above. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to obtain a treatment plan for the animals\nnoted above, and then, moving forward, in cooperation with his attending veterinarian, the licensee must develop\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries."

One of the\nkits had live maggots wriggling inside it.\n\u2022 Approximately 60 rabbits un Building 1 were observed to have significantly overgrown nails, extending approximately 1\nto 2 inches away from the nail bed and some were curling inwards as well as sideways.\nBy not identifying and reporting the abnormal signs displayed by the rabbits listed above, those animals remained\nuntreated, which can cause the animals unnecessary pain and discomfort.

Once inside the facility, approximately a total of 10 more rabbits were seen during the inspection on the\nground outside of their enclosures. The rabbits escaped, per the licensee, by kicking their attached feeder off their\nenclosure, which then left a gap large enough for them to go through. The feeders are secured to the primary enclosures\nwith two metal wires. A portion of those two wires are angled and protruding approximately 1.5 inches into the primary\nenclosures at approximately eye level height at both sides of the feeder. Additionally, there were multiple gaps at the\nbottom of the walls of both outdoor facilities that also included the large doors that are located at both ends of the\nbuildings. These gaps allow the rabbits to escape the facility and then have access to the outdoors and parking area.\nRabbits that escape are at risk of injury, sickness or death. Protruding points within the enclosure can cause injuries,\nespecially to the eyes. Gaps in the walls and doors of the facility allow not only the rabbits to escape but also other\nanimals, including predators, to gain access to the caged rabbits. The licensee must ensure that the facilities be\nstructurally sound and maintained in good repair (without sharp points inside the primary enclosures), to protect the\nanimals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals."

The feces piled underneath the enclosures\nwas approximately 1 foot in height at its tallest. In some areas, it was very wet creating a liquid puddle of feces which\ncontained numerous maggots. A large pile of feces was located within 20 feet of enclosures housing rabbits in Building 2.\nNumerous flies were flying around the large storage pile of feces that was approximately 4 feet high at its highest point in\nthe center and about 10 feet in diameter.
