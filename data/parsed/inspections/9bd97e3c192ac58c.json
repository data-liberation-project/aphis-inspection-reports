Subsequent tests were not taken\nat 48 hour intervals, however the facility took steps to try to resolve the issue by changing out part of the water on each of\nthe days between August 2 and August 6, 2022. The facility failed to test the water during this time in order to ensure\nappropriate water quality conditions for the animals when the bacteria coliform count was >2419.6. On August 7, 2022,\nthe pool was dumped and the sample on August 9, 2022 was below 1000 MPN.\n\u2022 August 16, 2022, the records indicate the bacteria coliform count was 1986.3 due to a backflow valve being stuck\nclosed. The valve issue was corrected and the subsequent test was below 1000 MPN.\n\u2022 August 29, 2022, the records indicate the bacteria coliform count was >2419.6. The next test recorded was on\nSeptember 3, 2022, five days later, with a recorded result of >2419.7. The records do not indicate that subsequent tests\nwere taken at 48 hour intervals between these two high counts so the water quality conditions remained unknown.\nRecords indicate the ozone generator had malfunctioned and there were some system issues addressed, but no further\ntests were done until September 5, 2022. On that day, the reading was below 1000 MPN.\n\u2022 September 7, 2022, the records indicate the bacteria coliform count was 1732.9. The pool was drained on September 8,\n2022. The next test recorded in the records was not until September 13, 2022 and the recorded count was below\n1000MPN.\n\u2022 September 28, 2022, the records indicate the bacteria coliform count was 2419.6. A second reading was taken on\nSeptember 30, 2022 with a count of 16.8MPN. The records indicate another test was done on October 7, 2022 and the\nbacteria coliform count was still high at >2419.7. Another test was conducted on October 9, 2022 with a count of 1413.6.\nTo resolve the issue, the records indicate the O3 was bumped to 700. The subsequent test result on October 11, 2002\nwas under 1000MPN. The records indicate there may have been some issues with the probe and the system and that\nparts were ordered on October 15, 2022.\n\u2022 November 15, 2022, the records indicate the bacteria coliform count was >2419.6. The records indicate that the chlorine\nhad been turned off on November 8, 2022. The chlorine was turned back on after the high count. The records indicate\nanother test was done on November 17, 2022 where the bacteria coliform count was recorded as >2419.6. The records\nindicate \u201cOzone back up and running.\u201d The records indicate that additional maintenance efforts to the system were\nconducted with the count taken on November 20, 2022 being below 1000 MPN.\n\u2022 November 21, 2022, the records indicate the bacteria coliform count was >2419.6 and that the chlorine was turned up. A\nsubsequent test on November 23, 2022 indicate the count is below 1000 MPN.\nThe above scenarios describe high total coliform counts hat the facility has failed to address correctly and which do not\nensure adequate water quality conditions for the two resident harbor seals. When water quality is not adequate, there\ncould be adverse impacts to the animals health and well-being. The facility needs to ensure that steps are taken to keep\ntotal coliform counts at acceptable levels. When total coliform counts exceed 1,000 MPN per 100 ml of water, corrective\nmeasures must be taken ensure appropriate water quality. More frequent testing may also be warranted to ensure the\nmeasures taken were sufficient to correct the problem. The facility stated that parts have been ordered for the ozone\nsystem for the pool.
