      "narrative": "One adult, male Japanese macaque was observed to pluck at the hair/skin on the fronts of both legs during the\nmajority of time that he was observed during the inspection. He has a history of plucking hair and picking at the skin\nof his arms. The first mention of plucking of the hair and skin of the legs in the animal(cid:25)s observation log was noted\non 11 April 2016. The observation log for this animal lists plucking hair on his legs numerous times after that initial\nentry along with the ongoing arm hair plucking.\nThis animal was re-evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) on 5 April 2016 who at that time increased the\nanimal(cid:25)s dose of anti-anxiety medication. As noted above, the animal started plucking a new area on his body\nshortly after this change. While the arm plucking appears to have decreased in frequency, the leg plucking suggests\na progression of the overall problem. As of the time of this inspection, the facility has not communicated with the AV\ninformation regarding the animal(cid:25)s response to the new dose of medication and more importantly, the information\nthat the plucking has progressed to a new location.\nDaily observation and direct, timely, and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the\nheath and care of the animals. Lack of communication of ongoing problems might result in a delay of treatment if\nseverity of the problem is not known by the veterinarian. In this case, the AV has not been notified that the animal is\nplucking at a new area of skin and cannot therefore alter the enrichment plan and/or medical treatment plan to\naccommodate the progression of the skin plucking problem. The licensee must establish as part of the program of\nveterinary care a plan of daily observation and a mechanism of direct, timely and frequent communication so that\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the\nattending veterinarian."
