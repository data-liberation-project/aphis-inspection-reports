The skin of the inner surfaces of the ears appeared red. Both ears\nhad a musty odor. The dog shook its head multiple times over a 2-3 minute period. The licensee stated he had not\nnotice the dog's ears but he had taken it to a veterinarian 10 days before for ocular condition. The dog's ears\nindicate a disease process is present and a veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to this animal's current\ncondition. Delays in providing necessary veterinarian treatment can result in worsening conditions and can be a\nsource of pain and discomfort. It is the responsibility of the licensee to provide veterinarian care in order to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in a timely manner. Please have the dog evaluated by a\nveterinarian in order to address all health issues including any possible ear infections. If the attending veterinarian is\nunavailable, than it is the licensee's responsibility to contact another veterinarian. It is vital that all animals be\nproperly assessed and treated when injured or sick."

The\nbrown film, dirt, dust, and calcium residue can function as a suitable environment for bacteria to grow and can serve\nas an opportunity of infection for the dogs in the enclosure. It is especially important that whelping enclosures be\nclean since puppies have a weaker immune system and can easily develop illnesses. Proper cleaning removes all\nsources that promote bacteria growth. The primary enclosure must be free from all dirt and debris in order to\npromote a sanitary environment that removes all hazards to animal health.\nCorrected by: 2/16/2014\nThe inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee and his wife."
