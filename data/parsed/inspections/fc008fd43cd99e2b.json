      "narrative": "Daisy is a 20 month old tiger at the facility. APHIS inspectors first noticed that she was having balance issues in\nSeptember 2016. At that time inspectors were shown records that indicated that the attending veterinarian had\ndiagnosed otitis externa and otitis media on September 26, 2016. This diagnosis was done without immobilization\nor hands on examination of the tiger. The veterinarian had treated Daisy for a jaw abscess earlier in the summer of\n2016. He assumed the ataxia was due to infection traveling from the jaw and infecting her middle and outer ear.\nDaisy has been off and on combinations of antibiotics and steroids since that time. Daisy\u2019s condition was noted to\nbe much worse on an APHIS inspection on November 9, 2016. In response to the inspection report, Daisy was\nimmobilized for an examination and blood collection. Blood work was not remarkable and Daisy was again treated\nfor an inner ear infection. The attending veterinarian noted no obvious jaw or ear issues on the physical\nexamination done at this time. (This was relayed to Animal Care\u2019s big cat specialist in a phone conversation that\ntook place on March 29, 2017.) There can be other diagnoses which can be the cause of Daisy\u2019s symptoms,\ntoxoplasmosis being highly likely. This information has been shared with the attending veterinarian on at least two\noccasions. The latest time was a phone conversation between Animal Care\u2019s big cat specialist and the attending\nveterinarian for the facility on March 29, 2017. Despite this information, a toxoplasmosis titer has never been done\nfor Daisy and Daisy has never been treated with an antibiotic effective against toxoplasmosis at a high enough dose\nand for a long enough duration to be effective against the infection. Records reviewed on the inspection of April, 25,\n2017 showed that since the time of the inspection on March 20, 2017, no additional diagnostics have been done.\nDaisy has been on various doses of prednisone and prednisone in combination with Baytril. Daisy has been on\ndaily prednisone since the time of the inspection on April, 25, 2017. Today the CEO of the facility stated to APHIS\ninspectors that Daisy has had several bad days lately and that they have increased her prednisone dose. Daisy\nwas extremely reluctant to move. She was hiding in the back of her enclosure in a in a sternal position under her\nperch. It took seven minutes of coaxing in order to get her to move. Daisy then did move inside her shelter. With\nmore coaxing Daisy moved to her water receptacle located in the front of the outdoor portion of the enclosure. This\nis a distance of about 15 feet. Daisy appeared lethargic and slumped against the enclosure fence resting her head\non the water receptacle. Daisy appeared to be exhausted from the effort it took to reach the water receptacle and\nher head tilt was apparent while she was drinking. Her tail still demonstrates a corkscrew appearance. Her hair\ncoat appears dull and rough. Today Daisy was growling and wanted to stay at the back of her enclosure\nwithdrawing from inspectors. This is a contrast to inspections in the past where Daisy has had a more curious and\nsocial attitude towards the APHIS inspectors. No diagnostics have been done for Daisy since the time of the last\ninspection. The lack of a diagnosis and effective treatment is causing the continued suffering of the tiger. A\nknowledgeable, expert veterinarian who specializes in exotic medicine (with training in big cat medicine) must be\nconsulted. Results of this consultation must be documented and records must be available for APHIS review at the\ntime of the next inspection.\nThe white tiger known as Mohan is walking with a very stiff and hesitant gait today. When the enclosure was first\napproached Mohan was lying down. Mohan rose slowly and walked with a hitching and awkward gait. Mohan's\nstance was bowlegged in appearance and he walked very slowly for about 20 feet before immediately lying down\nagain. APHIS inspectors have discussed the condition of this tiger on previous inspections but Mohan appears\nmuch worse today. The CEO has stated on previous occasions that the attending veterinarian has evaluated\nMohan but that he has not wanted to treat him as he thinks that it is an old age condition and that pain medications\nwould lead to renal failure. Mohan has had no diagnostics done that would indicate that this could be a concern.\nMohan appears to be in extreme pain today. Mohan is suffering in his current condition and is in need of veterinary\nevaluation. Veterinary treatment recommendations must be documented and made available for APHIS inspectors."

Rodent feces was noted on shelves inside the warm room.  Rodents can be carriers of disease\nwhich may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas.  A more effective means of rodent control must be\n\nestablished for the facility.\n3.132           CRITICAL                    REPEAT\nEMPLOYEES. \nIt is evident that despite the reduction in animal numbers that there is a lack of adequately trained employees.  The\npersistence of multiple animal welfare act violations related to basic animal husbandry issues illustrates this point. \nThe facility relies on volunteer workers.  A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility and animal\nconditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering.  Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained\nworkers need to be added.\nAn exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the facility inspection with the CEO.  All non-compliant items\nwere discussed.  A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility CEO on 5-18-17.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBongard Carrie, Animal Care Inspector\nKingston Susan, Supervisory Compliance Specialist",
