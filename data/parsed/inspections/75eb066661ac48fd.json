When the licensees\nwere asked about the hair loss they said it was due to fleas. When asked about the recommendations from the\nattending veterinarian they explained their attending veterinarian had not examined the animals in about a year.\nThe licensees stated they had two veterinarians they were working with and were waiting to receive paperwork from\none of them. Both veterinarians were contacted. Both explained they were not the attending veterinarian and\nneither had examined the wolves for hair loss recently.\nThere are multiple reasons for hair loss in animals. Parasites, ill health, and poor diet are a few of the causes. Hair\nloss in any animal is a concern and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.\nThe licensees need to find an attending veterinarian to have the hair loss on the wolf hybrids and the overall health\non the remaining animals evaluated.\nTo be corrected by: July 1, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees."
