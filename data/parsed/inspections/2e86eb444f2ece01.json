      "narrative": "On inspection, four of the metal guillotine doors in the dog kennel used to permit access to the outside section of the\nenclosure was determined to be in disrepair and does not protect the dogs from potential injury. Of the twenty\ncanine enclosures (each with a metal guillotine door to allow access to and from the outside section of the\nenclosure), four had guillotine doors that became easily stuck in the metal track and would not become unstuck by\nre-pulling the rope pull. The stuck doors had to be freed by entering into the enclosure and applying an outside force\nin order to allow the doors to side down in its closed position. This is extremely dangerous if an animal is in the\nenclosure when the door becomes stuck since the operator must release the rope pull and physically enter into the\nenclosure allowing an animal to brush up against the door causing it to slide down. The weight of the metal door\ncould easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an animal. There is no counterweight or\nmechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force other than a metal clip used to hold the door in its\nopen position. This clip must be unhooked when trying to close the guillotine door. At the time of inspection there\nwere no dogs present in the kennel; however, dogs will be arriving at the facility in 2-3 weeks. According to staff\nthere were no plans to repair the four guillotine doors before the dogs were to enter into the kennel. Repair or\nreplace the four guillotine doors to prevent the doors from becoming stuck. Additionally, monitor all guillotine doors\nso the doors can be operated that protects the animals from possible injuries.\nCorrect by: 8/21/2014\nThe inspection was conducted with the Large Animal Veterinarian, and the exit interview was conducted with the\nDirector of Research Integrity & Compliance."
