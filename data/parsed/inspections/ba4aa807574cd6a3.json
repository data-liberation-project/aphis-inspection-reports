The deficiency was related to the protocol citation identified on the previous USDA APHIS\ninspection. On the Semiannual Report to the IO dated July 15, 2013 the deficiency was labeled as significant with a\nplan to correct Protocol 2010-0628 by having the protocol be (cid:28)re-evaluated to ensure literature searches, narratives\nand long term effects are properly described(cid:29). The correction schedule was marked for December 20, 2013. At time\nof today'(cid:25)s USDA APHIS inspection the protocol had not been changed and failure to adhere to the plan and\nschedule had not been reported to APHIS. Facility representatives indicated the reason for this was due to the fact\nthere were no more animals available for use on the study. Some IACUC members believed protocol 2010-0628\nhad been inactivated. Protocol 2010-0628 was never inactivated. Not only was this protocol unchanged but also the\nprotocol's annual review was approved in January 2014. It is a fundamental duty of the IACUC to correct all\ndeficiencies according to the plan and schedule stated in the Semiannual Report. Failure to comply with the\ncorrection plan and schedule can result in a further decrease in animal welfare along with preventing the IO from\nassuring the requirements of 9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3 will be met by the facility. Any failure to adhere to the plan and\nschedule that results in a significant deficiency remaining uncorrected shall be reported in writing within 15 business\ndays by the IACUC, through the Intuitional Official, to APHIS and any Federal agency funding that activity.\nCorrect by notifying APHIS and any Federal agency funding this activity within 15 days."

The correction date for the protocol to contain a complete description of the\nproposed use of the animals was by Dec. 20, 2013. According to IACUC records review of the full protocol was\ndone on 1/28/13 and the protocol expires on 1/28/16.

All\nactive protocols to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity\ninvolving animals, must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.\nThe inspection was conducted with a facility representative and the exit interview was conducted with the IO,\nDirector and Associate Director ORI, Associate Director DLAR, clinical veterinarians, ORI and DLAR staff.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBrunkhorst Susanne, Veterinary Medical Officer"
