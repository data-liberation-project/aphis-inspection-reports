A female Dachshund identified as Anna #707627615 was lying in her water bowl. There\nwere also three Cocker Spaniels identified as Jack #965111016107, a male white and tan in color, Lollie\n#95600008888335, a female black and tan and heavy bred and Missy # 075275115, a female golden in color that\nwere housed in this area. All four of these dogs were panting heavily and had lolling tongues. Readings from a\nKestrel 3000 at 1042 at the height of the dogs were: Ambient temperature: 94.4 F, Heat Index: 127.0 F and\nHumidity: 83.6%. Kestrel readings on the housing shelters for these enclosures were: Ambient temperature: 95.8 F\nand Humidity: 80.0%. Shade provides comfort for the animal during periods of direct sunlight and provides shelter\nfrom inclement weather. The licensee must provide shade for these animals within one hour and assure that all\nanimals are provided with shade at all times as required.\nCorrected during inspection by moving these dogs to temporary housing with shade."
