The veterinarian recommended additional enrichment but it is unclear from documentation whether or no\nit was provided.

At the time of inspection, the animal did not\nappear to have any additional enrichment compared to all the other monkeys in the facility. This is not adequate\nattention or enrichment for an animal with such excessive hair loss. Hair loss can be a sign that the animal is in\npsychological distress. Failure to implement a special plan regarding environmental enhancement in animals\nshowing signs of psychological distress can lead to further psychological distress or animal self-injury. The licensee\nmust develop, document, and follow an environmental enhancement plan that specifically addresses animals\nshowing signs of being in psychological distress through behavior or appearance (hair loss).\nTo be corrected by: from this day forward.\nThe inspection and a thorough verbal exit interview were conducted with facility representatives on 30 July 2014.\nAdditional Inspectors\nOwens Amanda, Veterinary Medical Officer"
