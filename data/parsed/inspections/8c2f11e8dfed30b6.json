The edges of the wound have curled back and appear dry in some areas. The hair\naround the wound is matted and wet in appearance. Another wound was found on the right side of the dog's neck\napproximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size. The edges of this wound appear dry with a pocket forming under the skin. The\ntissue inside this wound appears reddened and moist. The facility representatives stated this dog did not look like this\nyesterday during daily observations and that this dog has been housed with female Bichon \"Luna\" for approximately one\nweek with no issues observed.\n-A female Bichon \"Luna\" MC#6100 and #3389 was found in poor dental health. One canine tooth could be observed with\na receding gum line that was reddened, inflamed with a spot of blood visible. The inspector was unable to examine the\nteeth more closely due to the dog reacting painfully to the exam. The licensee stated this is abnormal behavior for this\ndog.\nSevere soft tissue injuries and poor dental health may lead to pain, distress and further systemic problems for the\nanimals. Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include adequate\ndaily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. These dogs must be evaluated by a licensed\nveterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan in writing. This treatment plan must be\nmade available for APHIS inspection. The dogs were taken to the attending veterinarian during the inspection.\nTo be corrected by: End of Business 24-April-2024."
