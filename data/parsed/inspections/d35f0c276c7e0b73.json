This\nincludes camels, sheep, goats, pigs, muntjac deer, fallow deer, bongo, llama, giraffe, sitatunga, oryx, zebra, and\nkudu. These animals are housed in the walk through area of the zoo which is open to the public. Additionally, one\ntemporary pen was set up on a grassy section of the zoo grounds to allow public interaction with two young llamas.\nThere are no barriers present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the\nentry gate and coin feeders are located throughout the facility. There are no attendants present during public\ncontact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of\nmaterial with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public\ncontact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must ensure that during periods of\npublic exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general\nviewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public\ncontact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these\nlocations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.\n*** The camel identified for a veterinary care issue on the last inspection was seen by the veterinarian.\n*** The inspectors were unable to assess the presence or absence of the elephant handler during periods of public\nexhibition due to limited public attendance during the inspection.\n*** The citation under Section 3.127 (d) from the previous inspection report has a correction date of March 1, 2018.\nThis inspection was conducted on Tuesday October 24, 2017 with the facility representative and the owner.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the owner and his wife on Wednesday October 25, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nColeman Randall, Animal Care Inspector\nBrunkhorst Susanne, Veterinary Medical Officer"
