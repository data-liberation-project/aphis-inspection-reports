This male maneuvers with\na limp on the affect leg.\n***A female goat in the nursery area had a large severely bilaterally deformed udder. The licensee stated she had\nmastitis last year when she kidded and he treated her. The animal also had excessive hoof length on its rear\nhooves causing them to curve upward and crack. The veterinarian has still not examined this animal. Mastitis is a\npainful and uncomfortable condition and this animal has a malformed udder likely secondary to an inappropriately\ntreated mastitis.\n***An additional newborn fallow deer laying beside an adult fallow deer inside the rhino enclosure had a large round\nspot (approximately 1 1/2 to 2 inches round) on its head that was hairless and grey.\n***A large male Watusi was observed tilting its head at an irregular angle. The animal has been observed in the\npast exhibiting this abnormality and it appears to be becoming more pronounced.\nThe attending veterinarian must be made aware of changes in animals health in order to adequately diagnose and\ntreat them. The licensee must have the above listed animals assessed by the attending veterinarian for appropriate\ndiagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must follow the treatment plan and assure that all of the animals are\nprovided with adequate veterinary care as required."

There are no attendants in place to keep animals\nfrom escaping the facility grounds through this manner. There are cattle guards on the road in several sections of\nthe park which the owner has stated the animals will not cross.
