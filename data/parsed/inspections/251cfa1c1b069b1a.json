Guests are allowed to enter to feed the parakeets a seed mixture from their hands. During feeding, some seed falls\non the ground and the birds land on the ground to get the seed. Guests are instructed to shuffle their feet or sit to reduce\nrisk of stepping on a bird but in this incident, a small child was sitting on a bench and their feet could not reach the\nground. When the child hopped to the ground, they landed on a bird, killing it. Care must be taken so that there is minimal\nrisk of harm to the birds during public exhibition. The facility must take measures to ensure safe handling with sufficient\ndistance and/or barriers between the birds and the general viewing public to assure the health and safety of all animals.\nCorrect by 8/25/24."

It is important to remove worn and broken furnishings and enrichment items to\nprevent injury and death. Furniture-type objects and other objects that enrich a bird's environment, must be species-\nappropriate and be designed, constructed, and maintained so as to prevent harm to the bird.
