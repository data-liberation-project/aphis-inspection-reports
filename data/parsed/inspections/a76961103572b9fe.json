On 8/27/2023, staff removed pods from the mesquite trees inside the enclosure to ensure\nthey were not being eaten instead of the regular diet, but the prairie dogs still remained unseen and did not take the\nregular diet offered.

      "narrative": "An exhibit used to house black-tailed prairie dogs failed to protect the animals from tunnel collapse, leading to mass\ndisappearances and deaths of the animals. During March 2022, the facility became aware that the entire colony of 14\nadult black-tailed prairie dogs was missing. According to zoo staff, camera surveillance and excavation of the exhibit\nperimeter and most of the tunnels did not reveal definitive evidence of predation, a route of escape or any carcasses. The\nfacility assumed predation to be the cause of the animal disappearances. Staff reinforced dig barriers, refilled the exhibit\nwith the original soil and enclosed the open top of the exhibit with a mesh to prevent predator access. The facility obtained\na second colony of 12, three-month-old black-tailed prairie dogs on 6/17/2023 and introduced them to the previous prairie\ndog exhibit on 8/23/2023, after a quarantine period. A veterinary record entry dated 9/15/2023 states, \u201cKeepers have not\nidentified prairie dogs since put on habitat.\u201d Zoo staff initiated excavation of the exhibit two weeks following the\ndisappearance and began finding the carcasses of prairie dogs from the original colony as well as the newly introduced\ncolony on 11/3/2023. Zoo staff took photographs of some of the carcasses as they were found, using microchip scanners\nto identify individual animals in the some of the photographs. Deceased animals identified in the photographs had\nmicrochip ID numbers 202468, 202469, 202470, 202471. The Chihuahuan desert exhibits supervisor participated in the\nexcavation and identification, and stated to the inspector that tunnel collapse appeared likely in many places where the\ndead animals were found. Veterinary records on 11/3/2023 indicate that Prairie dog ID #202469 was the first carcass\nrecovered from the new colony, and that it was \u201c\u2026found under a concrete portion of the habitat and presumed tunnel\ncollapse is cause of death.\u201d On 11/27/2023, three prairie dogs identified by microchip as being members of the new\ncolony (ID numbers 202474, 202477, 202478) were found alive and were immediately taken to the on-site veterinary\nhospital. Veterinary records state the animals were responsive and defensive, but emaciated, with hair loss and flaky to\ncrusty skin. Despite prompt supportive care, one of the three survivors (ID #202474) died the following day. A gross\nnecropsy was performed on site and samples were collected and submitted for histopathology. Results indicated the\ncause of death was attributed to blood clots in the vasculature resulting from a systemic infection caused by severe\nbacterial bronchopneumonia. Additional comments in the histology report support a recent and prolonged period of the\nanimal not eating. As of the date of inspection, the remains of 9 out of 12 of the animals in the newer colony were\nexcavated and identified by microchip implants; the carcasses of 10 out of the 14 original colony were found, though only\none of that group was positively identified by microchip (ID #202106). The facility plans to continue indoor-only housing for\nthe two animals recovering under veterinary care until they can be relocated to another facility.\nHabitats for animals with natural burrowing behaviors must be designed and constructed to prevent issues such as tunnel\nand den collapse, which hinders or prevents daily observations that are important for detecting health and welfare\nproblems. Such collapses can even lead directly to entrapment and subsequent death by injury, illness, drowning,\nsuffocation or starvation if animals are unable to return to the surface for food and water.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animal enclosures are suitable to support the natural behaviors and activities of the\nanimals they house; facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals\ninvolved and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
