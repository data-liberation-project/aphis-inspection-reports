The\nlicensee was asked about the red area on the tiger and he stated that the park employees did not follow the feeding\nprotocol for this enclosure. He stated the employees were throwing meat over the fence instead of following the\ncurrent policy. The employees are supposed to lock all tigers out of the arena, then enter and place the meat in 16\nseparate piles at least 15 feet apart. The licensee believes the injury was likely a scratch or bite which occurred\nduring feeding. The animals had been fed that day just prior to the inspectors arrival. The licensee must have\nadequately trained employees to maintain an acceptable level of husbandry practices. Employees must follow park\npolicies to help ensure the safety of the regulated animals.\nCorrect from this point forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
