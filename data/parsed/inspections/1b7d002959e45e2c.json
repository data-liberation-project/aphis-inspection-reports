      "narrative": "The following animals need to receive veterinary care:\n**** In building number eight a seven year old fawn colored female Pomeranian (microchip # 101347290) had an\naccumulation of brownish-green debris covering her check teeth and molars extending into the gumline. The shape\nof the teeth is no longer visible. The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and\ntooth structures, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal. These\nsigns are consistent with the presence of dental disease. The licensee must have this animal examined by a\nveterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented\nand provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary\ncare at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 12-29-2014.\n**** In building number ten an adult female Boston Terrier born June 2013 (microchip #941000016003745) had\nbilateral corneal ulcers, but the left eye appeared to be more red and inflamed than the right. Both eyes were\npartially cloudy in appearance and the white/sclera of the left eye was more red in color. This could be due to an\ninjury, infection, allergies, irritation or other medical conditions. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted\nnor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that this was caused by\nscratches when this dog was a puppy and has not been evaluated by a veterinarian since the initial puppy exam.\nEye problems can be painful causing discomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog. The licensee\nmust have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nThe outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee\nmust ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 12-29-2014.\n**** In building number ten an adult male Boston Terrier (microchip #0A01583215) had interdigital cysts on his front\nleft paw. The affected area is circular in appearance (estimated size of a pea) and there is some swelling due to\nfluid buildup between the toes of the foot. The licensee stated that today was the first time the problem with the foot\nhad been noticed. Fluid buildup can be painful causing discomfort and it could potentially affect the mobility and\ndaily activity of the dog. The toes were splayed when the dog was standing in a normal position, which could cause\npain and discomfort to the dog. The licensee must have this dog seen by a veterinarian to determine and obtain an\naccurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan and document all findings and treatments for the inspectors to\nreview at the next inspection. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 12-29-2014.\n**** An adult, female fawn colored pug (microchip# 029105586) had cloudy eyes and discharge from both eyes. It\nappeared that the entire left and right eyes were grey to blue in color. The left eye appeared more reddened\ncompared to the right eye. The left eye also contained a central area of debris with hair stuck to the eye. This eye is\nreddened and has an area of a mucous-like substance at the top aspect of the eye. The right eye has a thick\nmucous-like substance covering the entire cornea. The right eye's bottom eyelid, further away from the nose, the\nhair surrounding the eye was crusty and a wet and a sticky discharge was noted. The attending veterinarian had not\nbeen consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. Eye problems can be painful causing\ndiscomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a\nveterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must\nbe documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate\nveterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: 12-29-2014.\n**** A black, adult female pug (microchip# 4B181A6B08) in building six had opacities and grey to blue colored\neyes. There was also a clear discharge from the animals' eyes. The hair around the eyes was slightly wet, matted,\nand crusty. The licensee stated that the animal had dry eye/KCS in both eyes. This animal hadn't ever been seen\nby the attending veterinarian, but the licensee stated that he had doctored the eyes on 7-3-14 and documented it,\nbut no follow up visit or care has occurred since the initial treatment.
