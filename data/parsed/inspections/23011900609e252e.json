USDA personnel observed the animal, which was lying down with its back legs splayed out in an\nabnormal position. USDA personnel notified one of the auction veterinarians, who oversaw the movement of the animal\ninto a trailer. The animal was unable to stand so employees carried the animal. The veterinarian stated that the animal\nhad not been consigned to the auction this weekend, but was left over from an earlier sale. The veterinarian stated that he\ndid not have the authority to treat the animal and so it was loaded on a trailer and taken off site without receiving medical\ntreatment. Daily observation of animals is important for the prompt identification and treatment of medical issues. Animals\nwho are not observed adequately may suffer from medical problems that go untreated.

Some of the rabbits\nhad no drinking water. When water was provided some rabbits drank ravenously for a prolonged time.

The facility representative was informed and the remaining rabbits who\ndidn\u2019t have water were promptly provided with water. One female white rabbit and 7 kits (tag #4102) was extremely\nrestless and hungry. The rabbits were trying to reach a half-eaten carrot that was beside their cage. When USDA\npersonnel placed the carrot into the cage, the rabbits ravenously ate it, pushing each other out of the way. The kits\ncontinued to lick the bars of the cage where the carrot had been. Facility staff were informed and the rabbit was provided\nwith food. The morning of 9/16/23 some cages of rabbits had empty or no water bowls.

Food and water are important for animal health and wellbeing. Animals that do not\nhave adequate food and water may suffer from thirst, hunger, dehydration, low blood sugar, or death.
