The\nlicensee stated that eye drop medication was currently being administered to treat the condition. The licensee has\nno documentation from a veterinarian regarding the use of eye drops to treat this dog. Not having clear vision can\ncause\ndiscomfort and affect the health and well being of the dog.

The potential for injury exists if the dog is not able\nto see clearly.\nThe dog has a thick brown material coating the cheek teeth and a recessed gumline. The abnormal buildup of\nmaterial on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures, be painful, impact the ability of the\ndog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal.\n.\n2. A black female pug 'Eudora' (053-563-279) born 4/3/10 has an abnormal right eye. The eye appears sunk in and\nmuch smaller than the left eye.
