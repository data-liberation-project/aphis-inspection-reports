      "narrative": "A zebu bull housed in the petting area was observed to have overgrown hooves, A castrated white sheep was\nobserved to limp and when standing held his left front leg up. The inside ( medial ) claw of his right front hoof is very\nlong. The alpaca's nails and toe pads are overgrown and turning inward in an unnatural position. The lower jaw of\none barbado ewe is not aligned with the upper jaw and bulges on the left side. The caretaker stated to the inspector\nthat the ewe was injured as a lamb and despite veterinary care the jaw did not heal properly. The ewe is in good\nbody condition and was observed eating pellets, however there is concern that the back teeth ( molars ) may be mal\naligned as well and with time the ewe may have trouble eating. There is one barbado ewe that was housed\nseparately. She is alert and active but very thin ( ribs, spine and pelvic bones are visible ) . She has feces matted on\nher tail. A sika doe was observed to have extremely overgrown hooves. She flipped her feet out as she walked and\nher back was in a hunched position. Severely overgrown hooves may cause pain or distress to the animals as it\nprevents normal movement. Animals need to receive routine hoof care before their hooves become excessively\nlong and overgrown, The above listed animals need to be examined by a veterinarian and receive proper treatment\nfor their conditions and sedation if needed for hoof care.\nCORRECT BY : 12-21-15\nNOTE : The attending veterinarian was called during the inspection and an appointment was made.\nThe inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the manager."
