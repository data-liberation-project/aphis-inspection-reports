      "narrative": "There is a juvenile male tiger 'Tony', that has been used in full contact exhibitions with the public up until the first\nweek of January 2020, when the tiger was over 20 weeks of age. There are multiple photos of interactions of the\ntiger with the public while having no lead or harness, nor a staff member in sight that had immediate control over the\nanimal. There are photos from November 14 to December 29th, 2019 of the tiger between 16-20 weeks old sitting\non the laps of adults, and in a standing position with his large paws on the shoulders, or hanging on the front of\nadults and/or children while being fed milk from a bottle. The tiger is seen in one photo having its nail stuck in the\njeans on the knee of a woman kneeling for a selfie with the tiger, while there is no lead or direct control over the\nanimal by a keeper. On 12/20/19 there is a photo of an approximately 11 yr old boy holding a bottle, while the tiger\nstands on a rock while holding the boy\u2019s arm in his paws, leaning against the boy\u2019s body, with 2 public member\nadults on either side of the boy. There was no direct control over this tiger if he were to scratch or bite the boy. On\n12/30/19 the tiger is shown loose in a group of 5 people, 3 children around 10 years old, one possible teen and one\nadult. They are all on a rock inside of the tiger\u2019s enclosure while the tiger walks around them and towards a bottle.\nThere is no way to have direct control over a loose 5 month old tiger, and even if the tiger did have a leash or\nharness managed by an experienced trainer, it was already too big, too fast and too dangerous to be in direct\ncontact with any member of the public.\nA photograph on 12/29/19 shows a woman holding up the tiger while he is standing up on his hind legs and holding\na bottle with his paws. The tiger was tall enough to be just under the chin of the woman. The keepers are usually in\nthe area and/or taking the photos but they would not be able to get to the tiger if the animal decided to bite or claw\nin play or aggression, or if he was to get a claw caught in their clothes or frightened and react in a fearful manner.\nThere is one photo of Tony standing on a rock with his paws on a woman\u2019s shoulder while she holds a bottle, with\nher approximately 9yr old son standing underneath the tiger with its elbows on the boy\u2019s shoulder. There were an\nadditional two people off to the side petting the tiger. There was no capability of direct control over this tiger if he\nwere to play-bite or slap with his claws, or if he slid his paws down the front of the adult or child, or if his claws\nsnagged the people in the face, neck or body.\nThis juvenile tiger was being used well over 16-20 weeks of age in full contact, loose in its cage with members of\nthe public present, with no way to control the animal utilizing a lead/harness, or trainer that was close enough to be\nable to stop an incident if the tiger was to become too playful or aggressive. While a keeper may have been in the\narea taking a photo or 5-10ft away during the time photos were taken, there was no way they could get to the tiger\nin time to prevent an injury. By the time they observed the animal was starting to bite or scratch, it would be too late.\nThe tiger is at the age that he is biting, scratching/pawing and play wrestling and is too big (over 55lbs), and too\nstrong to be loose in a cage with members of the public, and especially young children present.\nThe public was taken into the tiger\u2019s primary enclosure where there were no public barriers or areas to prevent\ncontact between the public and tiger. There were no leads/harness or collar on the animal that might have been\nused to help keep the tiger in direct control of the keeper. Due to the lack of physical barriers, the safety of the\npublic depends solely on the supervision of the keeper who does not have any sort of direct control over the animal.\nThe lack of adequate barriers and or distance from exhibited animals could easily lead to injuries or harm to the\npublic and/or animals.\nThe facility must ensure that during public exhibition, all animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to\nthe animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing\npublic. As the tigers become older, larger and stronger, direct contact with the public must stop. The use of an\napproved restraint system in conjunction with distance/barriers must be present in exhibitions where the tiger is\nbeing displayed out of an enclosure, or whenever the public is taken into an enclosure, in order to protect the public\nand the animal. Larger, more dangerous juvenile tigers cannot be exhibited to the public with a leash as the only\nbarrier, and the public cannot be allowed to come into direct contact with these animals.\nThe handling procedures between the public and the tiger, as depicted in the pictures, underscore the lack of\nknowledge, experience and good judgement of the licensee with potentially dangerous animals.. The lack of proper\ntraining and experience while raising and handling a tiger can pose a serious threat of harm to the animal,\nemployees, and the public, as it grows and becomes stronger and possibly more aggressive. The licensee has not\nreceived any acceptable specialized/hands on training in handling or training of adult tigers.\nThe licensee must demonstrate adequate knowledge and experience of the animals in which they maintain,\nincluding working directly with the more dangerous older juvenile and adult big cats."

      "narrative": "A perimeter fence variance was issued in July 2017, giving the licensee more time to complete the fence. Since\nthen, the licensee has completed the fence around half of the property with three entry gates still missing and the\nentire back fence line on the property that has not been completed. This variance was only provided to cover only\nthe species that were on site at the time (4 fox, 2 serval, 2 lynx). However, since the last inspection in 2018,\nenclosures for two Albifron lemurs, two coati, a Geoffrey\u2019s cat, two badgers, two porcupines, two bobcats and two\ntigers (5 months, 10 months) have been added to the outdoor area with no perimeter fence surrounding these new\nenclosures.\nThe tiger, porcupine and bobcat enclosure utilize one side of the wooden planked 8ft perimeter fence for one of its\nprimary enclosure sides, so there is no distance at all between the enclosure and a secondary perimeter fence. The\ntiger and bobcat enclosures do have a top on them, however using the perimeter fence also as the primary\nenclosure fence has not been approved by a variance and doesn't meet perimeter fence requirements. Currently,\none side of the tiger enclosure is next to the ungated entryway to the property where there is easy access from an\nadjacent public road. This could be used by members of the public to access the facility including the tiger\nenclosure due to the lack of any fencing/barrier to keep people out. There is continual construction on the tiger\nenclosures and a variance request is in process, however the primary enclosures are not finished. Presently a\nmember of the public could walk or drive through the opening in the fence and have direct access through the\nprimary enclosure fence to a 5-month-old and a 10-month-old tiger.\nWhen there is no perimeter fence, animals that escape their primary enclosures can easily escape from the entire\nfacility. Lack of a perimeter fence also allows for easier contact between unwanted animals/people and the animals\nhoused in their primary enclosures. This possible contact can cause increased stress, disease transmission, or\npossible injury to the regulated animals as well as injury to the unauthorized animal/public. A primary enclosure\nusing the perimeter fence on any side without the 3ft distance between the perimeter fence and primary fence\nincreases risk of unauthorized access/contact with regulated animals.\nAll outdoor housing facilities must be surrounded by a perimeter fence of sufficient height (either six feet for the\nbobcats/lemurs/coatis/Geoffrey\u2019s cat/badgers and porcupine or eight feet for the tigers) with sufficient distance\nbetween the primary enclosure and perimeter fence to prevent unauthorized contact or entry to the facility's\nanimals.\nInspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, the exit report was gone over with the facility\nrepresentative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGage Laurie, Big Cat Specialist\nKingston Susan, Supervisory Compliance Specialist"
