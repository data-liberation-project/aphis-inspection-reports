      "narrative": "(b)(2)\nAV clinical notes for a male lion named Batman, which were unavailable until after the inspection of 7/22/14,\nindicate that on 3/19 /14 he was observed to have his right third eyelid elevated and the eye half closed and\ndrainage present. On 3/21/14 it is noted that the third eyelid is even more elevated and the eye more closed. The\nAV notes do not state whether these observations were made by her or someone else. On 3/26/14 the AV clinical\nnotes did indicate that she observed the animal in person. According to her notes the (cid:28)eye was open to almost\nnormal position(cid:29) and (cid:28)there was minimal drainage(cid:29). She also noted the lion (cid:28)appeared weak in the rear and slightly\nfavored the right rear leg(cid:29). The lion was given 5 cc Pen G but no diagnostics appear to have been done at that time.\nFrom 3/27/14 until 4/5/14 the lion received intermittent Pen G injections. On 4/3/14 the AV noted the licensee\ncommunicated to the AV that the lion was (cid:28)showing strange movements(cid:29).\nOn 4/5/14 the AV visited the facility and observed the lion. She notes (cid:28)the eye is much improved(cid:29) but he (cid:28)appears\nweak and somewhat uncoordinated in the rear(cid:29). The AV noted the licensee (cid:28)decided he did not want further\ndiagnostics or treatment(cid:29).\nThe AV also noted (cid:28)we expect his neurologic condition to deteriorate and Tim plans on euthanizing with a gunshot\nto the head when Batman(cid:25)s quality of life is no longer adequate(cid:29).\nThis AV resigned as of the end of April, 2014.\nOn 5/1/14 a contract with a new AV was entered into by the facility but as of 8/5/14 a formalized plan of veterinary\ncare by the new AV had not been finalized and signed. The new AV did state that she had read the previous AV(cid:25)s\nclinical notes concerning Batman but as of 8/5/14 the new AV had not addressed Batman(cid:25)s condition or alter the\nmethod of euthanasia.\n*****The licensee is responsible for ensuring appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases\nand injuries are provided to resident animals. The licensee failed to ensure appropriate care was given to this\nanimal by failing to allow the previous AV to carry out diagnostics and possible treatments. The licensee failed to\nensure appropriate care was given by not requesting the new AV evaluate the animal immediately. This lion is only\n11 or 12 years old. With adequate veterinary care it could possibly live for several more years."
