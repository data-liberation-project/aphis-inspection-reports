The skin\nthat could be observed under the mats appeared flaky with debris and had balded where the mats were pulling.\nIn cage #7 there was an adult Havanese female and an adult Shih Tzu male that were observed to have excessively\nmatted hair. The adult male Shih Tzu had long knotted mats, one of which was visualized to be attached to it's anus\nentrapping feces. The facility stated that this particular dog was difficult to catch, in which only the facility representative\ncould handle him.\nThe facility stated that the dogs had not been shaved due to the drop in temperature and cold snaps occurring at night.\nMeasures should be put in place to ensure the dogs could be groomed without shaving, preventing matting and ensuring\nthat they weren't subjected to the cold temperatures. Matting can be a painful condition that can lead to other health\nconcerns such as skin irritations and infections and the dogs must be groomed to prevent them. It can also make an\nexamination of the animals eyes, ears, skin and teeth difficult to perform. The facility must provide preventative care and\ntreatment to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and\nteeth. Correct by May 24, 2022.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nEnd Section"
