Prior to the inspection, the licensee had made an effort to remove the waste buildup and treat\nthe ground with a pesticide to kill maggots. Dead maggots were seen at one drain exit, however, maggots were still alive\nat a second drain exit. The accumulation of waste exposes the dogs to potential disease and pest hazards.
