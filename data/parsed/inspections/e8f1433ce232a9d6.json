      "narrative": "Areas of disrepair were identified within some of the dangerous animal enclosures:\n- The top hinge for the door into the new black bear\u2019s catch pen is externally rotated creating an approximately 5-inch\nwide gap extending vertically between the top 1/3 of the gate and the adjoining fence.\n- The metal mesh roof of the catch pen in the enclosure housing the tiger Golden had a few holes, the largest one\nmeasuring about 10 inches long by 12 inches wide. Two areas were also seen along the far edge of the roof that were\ndisconnected from the metal post with one part bowing up about 3 inches in height for a distance of about 18 inches while\nthe other bowed into the enclosure about 4 to 5 inches for about 3 feet of length. One corner of the mesh top was also\ndisconnected creating a triangular piece (both sides about 1.5 feet long) of metal mesh bending down into the catch pen.\n- The roof of the catch pen in the enclosure housing the black bear, Little Anne, had two gaps between the metal mesh\nand the metal pole. One was along the front edge and was about 30 inches long and ranging from 2 to 4 inches in width.\nThe other was a triangular gap on the side corner that went from a height of 2 inches up to 10 inches for a distance of\nabout 3 feet. A large gap was also observed between the shift door and the roof in this catch pen.\n- A large section of the roof over the catch pen in the enclosure housing the lion Libby bowed inwards significantly, up to\nabout 1.5 feet, in front of the concrete dens. The two pieces of metal mesh that came together to make the roof in that\narea were separating in the bowed portion.\nThe tiger and bear catch pens did not have hot wire to keep the animals off the fence and in all areas mentioned above\nthe animals could interact with or worsen the damaged sections described. Areas in disrepair such as these could result\nin animal injury as well as escape and may allow entry of unwanted animals.\nThe two wolves\u2019 primary enclosure did not have sufficient dig deterrents to safely contain the animals. The enclosure did\nnot have hotwire at the bottom of the fence nor, per a facility representative, did it have a dig barrier. In addition, two holes\nwere found in the catch pen created by the wolves. An enclosure without proper dig deterrents or dig barriers may not\nsafely contain wolves, that as a species are known to be extensive diggers, and as individuals are showing a\npredisposition to digging.\nBoth tiger enclosures had a tree near the fence on the creek side:\n- Per a facility representative, the trunk of the tree in Golden\u2019s enclosure was 5 feet away from the primary enclosure\nfence. An angled metal kick-in of the primary enclosure fence came even closer to the tree, ending within a couple feet of\nthe trunk.\n- Per a facility representative, the trunk of the tree in Gabby\u2019s enclosure was 12 \u00bd feet away from the primary enclosure\nfence. A thick tree limb spanned more than half that distance going towards the fence. The limb was over 7 feet above\nground per a facility representative, yet slightly lower than the 8ft primary enclosure fence.\nWithout proper deterrents, the tree and tree limbs this close to the fence may serve as an escape path for the tigers.\nHousing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to safely\ncontain the animals.

The fencing in that area was not secured to the ground thus creating a large opening/access\npoint between the creek and the walking path.\n- Near the caretaker\u2019s access gate, an approximately 12 feet long section of the perimeter fence surrounding the foxes,\nand porcupines' enclosures, was 70 inches to 71 inches tall instead of the required 72 inches (6 feet). In addition, four\ngaps, ranging from 6 to 12 inches wide, were found at the top of both sides of two access gates in the perimeter fence.\nWith such gaps and insufficient height in some areas, the fences may not adequately provide a secondary containment\nsystem to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier to keep animals and unauthorized\npersons out. The facility must ensure they maintain in good repair a continuous 8-foot-high perimeter fencing for\ndangerous animals (lions, tigers, bears, wolves), and 6-foot-high fencing for non-dangerous animals (foxes, porcupines).\nSuch fences must be at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure for animals housed outdoors.
