Records document that Kharabali 'bumped' the wall and/or pole 11 times on 08-Nov-2023, and had increased\nrespiratory rates, a possible indicator of pain and/or distress. Records note mandibular/maxillary osteomyelitis and a\npossible hairline fracture on 14-Nov-2023. Facility records note that on 28-Nov-2023 Kharabali injured herself again, and\non 2-Dec-2023, she was diagnosed as having bilateral mandibular fractures. There are notations throughout the records\nof placing buoys, pads, and staff in the habitat intermittently to protect her from hitting surfaces. In the records, on 3-Dec-\n2023, it is noted that staff had been evacuated from water due to 'lighting', and Kharabali was noted to 'make contact' with\nrostrum on wall multiple times ('5x-1x was hard') during this timeframe. Approximately one hour later, a buoy wall was\nconstructed and deployed from the skimmer box to the door at the surface level. Subsequently, the records show that on\n8-Dec-2023 Kharabali hit the wall with her rostrum and sank to the bottom, and on 9-Dec-2023, the facility placed pool\nnoodles to prevent contact with the walls. These reactive measures were inadequate protection for this animal, based on\nthe progression of existing injuries, and continuing documentation of contact with the walls in the records. Handling of\nanimals must be done in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrect by 7-Feb-2024"
