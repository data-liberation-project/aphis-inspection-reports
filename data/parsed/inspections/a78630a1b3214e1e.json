The licensee must ensure that\nall animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n-- \"Monkey\" also had several abnormal masses of various sizes on his back and sides. The one on his back was the\nlargest mass measuring approximately a half inch in diameter. The attending veterinarian had not been contacted\nand the dog had not been evaluated at the time of the inspection. These masses could continue to grow or become\nopen sores. A veterinarian needs to evaluate these masses to determine if treatment is required.\nTo be corrected by: 10/6/16.\n-There were two adult Dachshunds inside the primary enclosure that had toenails on the front feet that were very\nlong. Long toenails on the front two feet were estimated to be an inch in length. In addition, long toenails can\ncause an alteration of gait, cause the animal pain and discomfort and can grow into the toe pad causing damage,\nlameness, and possible infection. Lack of toenail care on a regular basis can affect the health and well-being of that\ndog.\nTo be corrected by: 9/29/16"
