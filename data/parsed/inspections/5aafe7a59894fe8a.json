The licensee removed the collar and the skin underneath was eroded\nwhere the collar was and it had some dried material around it. The licensee treated this animal's neck and moved it\nto a separate enclosure (29B) for further treatment. Daily observations need to be improved to find conditions such\nas this so that they can be treated promptly per the attending veterinarian's instructions.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMoore Chad, Animal Care Inspector"
