According to the licensee there was another male in the cage that was\nremoved three days prior and likely caused the injuries.\n*** A spiny mouse was observed huddled against the side of the aquarium by the water bottle. Upon further observation, a\nlarge wound was present covering the right and underside of the neck. The lesion was missing fur and appeared several\ndays old.\n*** Numerous degus housed among three glass aquariums had scabbing and old wounds along their tails. Dried blood\nwas visible along the glass walls of several aquariums.\nThe injured animals identified above were not identified by the licensee before the inspection despite the fact the injuries\nwere several days old. Untreated injuries, wounds, and illness can cause pain and distress to animals as well as lead to\nmore serious medical complications such as infection or abscesses. Daily observation needs to be conducted to assure\nthat injuries and illness are being identified in a timely manner so health care needs can be communicated to the vet for\nguidance on treatment. The facility needs to develop and implement a method of daily observations of all animals and\nfrequent timely communication to the AV whenever animals are identified in need of care. Additionally, ensure that all\nanimals identified above are examined by a veterinarian and provided with appropriate care per that veterinarian\u2019s\nrecommendations.\nCorrect by: May 28, 2021"
