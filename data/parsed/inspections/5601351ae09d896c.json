Knowing the size of tissue\nsamples in this case is important for determining the protocol's pain category as well as determining that\npre-procedural and post-procedural animal care is adequate. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the\ninvestigator provides a complete description of proposed activities that involve the use of animals in order that those\nactivities may be adequately reviewed and determined to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect by June 26, 2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility director."
