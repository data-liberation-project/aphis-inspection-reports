      "narrative": "On 6/30/2022, a Vervet (#2226) died while under anesthesia during a surgical procedure to implant a headcap.\nAnesthesia was administered and monitored by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and a Research Assistant (RA) during\ninitial surgery preparation and the first hour of the surgery. At that point the AV departed leaving the RA in charge of\nanesthesia with instructions to contact the AV if any issues arose. 25 minutes later the Vervet\u2019s head became dislodged\nfrom the apparatus that kept it stable during surgery. The head was quickly replaced into the apparatus. The lead surgeon\nasked the RA to confirm the status of the endotracheal tube, and correct placement was assumed due to \u201cfrosting\u201d or\nappearance of vapor within the tube walls. About 15 minute later monitoring devices began to register declining blood\noxygen levels and the pulse derived from the ECG monitor was lost. The RA believed these were possible mechanical\nfailures and began monitoring heart rate using a stethoscope. Surgery was concluded about 1 \u00bd hours later and the AV\nreturned. Once the Vervet was taken off the ventilator, there was no spontaneous respiration, and heart sounds could not\nbe heard using the stethoscope. The Vervet was pronounced dead moments later. The facility believes that the\nendotracheal tube may have become dislodged during surgery leading to hypoxia and eventual cardiac injury. It is the\nopinion of both the AV and RA that the RA did not have sufficient training to properly respond to the situation.\nThe health and wellbeing of animals, especially during complex surgical procedures requiring prolonged and properly\nmonitored and regulated anesthesia, depends on staff that have the proper training and experience to perform their\nduties. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research assistants, and other personnel\ninvolved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties. The RA in this incident is no longer\nadministering or monitoring anesthesia unsupervised and is receiving additional training.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.\nn"
