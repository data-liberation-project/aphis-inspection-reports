The dewclaw\nnails were overgrown to the point they were curling back into the pad and his right front dewclaw was imbedded in his foot\npad and could not be removed even when the nail was cut. This dog is very thin with prominent vertebrae, ribs and hip\nbones and no visible fat covering. This dog also had severe tarter build up covering his teeth and his gums are red and\nirritated. The condition of the mouth could be impacting his ability to eat properly. This dog should be examined by the\nattending veterinarian to have his foot pad assessed and the nail trimmed and to assess his dental needs and overall\nbody condition.\nCorrect by: April 19, 2022\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
