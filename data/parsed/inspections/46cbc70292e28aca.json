This plan should\ninclude criteria for when pain relief or other methods for reducing pain and distress need to be provided to ensure a\ngood quality of life and to prevent worsening of the underlying condition. The licensee should document that he is\nmonitoring this animal and when pain relief or other methods are provided to reduce pain and discomfort so the\nveterinarian and APHIS officials can evaluate if the plan i effective."

The licensee left a volunteer to monitor the reindeer during\npublic exhibition while the licensee went inside the mall to act as Santa Claus. After the licensee left, the reindeer\nwas startled by children running toward the pen, she jumped out of the pen, and was running at large until the\nfollowing day when the licensee was able to recapture her with assistance from local animal control and police. The\nlicensee stated that the pen had not been adequately secured and the volunteer was not able to control the animal\n(which was wearing a halter and lead rope) to prevent the escape. This reindeer was reported to run through city\nstreets and swam through a nearby reservoir while being pursued by law enforcement so she experienced\nsignificant behvioral stress and was at great risk for injury or loss of life.\nThe licensee did not adequately protect this animal or have an appropriately qualified person to ensure the animal\ncould be safely contained in the temporary exhibit or handled to avoid behavioral stress or physical harm.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected for all subsequent exhibitions of animals by the licensee."
