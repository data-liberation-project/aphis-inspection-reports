Lightly touching\nthe crusted area confirmed that the area was swollen around the protrusion and there was some pale discharge that\ncame out from underneath the crusted material. The swelling and pale discharge are signs of an active disease\nprocess that needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for treatment.
