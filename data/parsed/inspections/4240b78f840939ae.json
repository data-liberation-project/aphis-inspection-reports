This was observed for at least a minute and a half. Although there\nwas a recent reintroduction of queens which had been separated to raise their young, the conflict appeared\nsustained and extreme. In addition, there were no partitions or visual barriers which would have allowed any\nindividual in the group to hide.\nIn another harem enclosure, healing scratches were noted on three of the cats. In addition, in a third harem\ngrouping, one male was noted to distinctly separate himself from the rest of the group, had healing scratches on his\nnose, and what appeared to be an old ear injury. A review of this cat\u2019s medical record indicated that the animal had\na history of previous scratches, which were noted on an entry dated 7/18/17. These repeated incidents suggest\nincompatibility within this harem group.\nIncompatible grouping and stressful re introductions can lead to continued distress and injury which affect the health\nand well-being of the animals.\nFacility shall observe animals for compatibility on a continuing basis and document these findings in order to devise\nand implement effective approaches to minimize distress and maximize compatibility.\n*******Correct from October 5, 2017 forward\nThis inspection was conducted on October 2- 5, 2017.
