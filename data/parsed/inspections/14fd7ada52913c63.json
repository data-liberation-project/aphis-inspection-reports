On 4/9/24, 9 rabbits\nwere administered the induction medication intravenously (IV) between 9:25am and 11:28am. All rabbits were observed\nto be doing well at 12:30pm. High doses of sub-cutaneous (SQ) glucose were then administered at 2:30pm, 6:30pm, and\n10:30pm. No glucose checks were performed. Rabbit #2457 was found dead at 8:30am on 4/10/24. Rabbit #2453 was\nfound unresponsive at 8:30am on 4/10/24, presumed hypoglycemic but without a blood glucose check to confirm, and\nadministered a high dose of SQ glucose before being found dead at 10:30am. Rabbits #2454 and #2455 were\nadministered additional doses of glucose at 9:30am on 4/10/24. Rabbit #2454 was found dead 4/14/24. Rabbit # 2455\nwas found obtunded at 8:50am on 4/16/24; at 9:30am, glucose reading was \"HIGH\" and the rabbit died at 9:40am.\nPresumptive cause of death for all rabbits was diabetic shock. After suspending the protocol, the remaining 5 rabbits were\nstabilized with IV fluids and insulin. Several unapproved significant changes likely contributed to the death of the 4 rabbits.\n1. The induction medication was administered by a different route than approved (IV instead of IP).\n2. Twice daily monitoring of blood glucose for 5 days after induction was not done as indicated in the protocol.\n3. Glucose administration was not approved in the protocol.\n4. Insulin was never given as indicated in the protocol.\nFailure to follow the approved protocol and making unapproved changes does not allow the IACUC to review these\nchanges as required and ensure the animals involved do not experience negative impacts to their health and well-being.\nThe IACUC must ensure that all significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are\nreviewed and approved prior to implementation.\nCorrected prior to the time of inspection on 7/16/24."
