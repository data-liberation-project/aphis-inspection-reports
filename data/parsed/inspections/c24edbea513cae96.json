The change in the otters\ndiet shall be prepared with consideration for the species and approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure its an\nadequate diet. The mullet in an uncovered box had dry outside surfaces, cloudy eyes, soft when touch and foul\nodor. It was stated that the fish were in the freezer one week, however the condition of the mullet appears this fish\nhad been thawed more than the two days in insufficient temperatures of 32 F to 45 F, that was recorded during this\ninspection.

This\nground beef has been stored at insufficient temperatures for at least several days or more and appears obtained\nprior to the other meats.\n3) The outsides of the pork and some of the chicken that is fed to the large felids and raccoons were thawed and\naccording to the curator was just obtained several days ago. The curator stated that the walk in freezer would be\nrepaired the day after this inspection which would be at least 3 days with possible insufficient refrigeration.

All diets need to be followed and the diet for the\noverweight male adult white tiger needs to be reviewed by the attending veterinarian to ensure that its a complete\nnutritional diet.\n5) This facility is in the process of breeding their large felids, however there is no diet available if cubs would be\nunable to feed from their mother. Often there are issues with the mother feeding her cubs, so there must be a\nwritten alternative diet available.\nAll animals at this facility must be given a complete adequate diet approved by the attending veterinarian and or\nnutritionist.\nTO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY.\nThis inspection was conducted with the care taker and exit interview with the Curator."
