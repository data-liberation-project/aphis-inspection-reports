The\ntemperature at the time of the inspection was 68 degrees F according to Weather.com and was partly sunny. Lack\nof shade does not allow the dogs protection from the direct rays of the sun which may cause them discomfort and\ntheir well-being may suffer.\nOutdoor housing facilities must have one or more separate areas of shade and all shaded areas must be large\nenough to contain all the animals at one time. The licensee must provide these dogs with shaded areas within their\nenclosure in order to offer them protection from direct sunlight and to promote their well-being. The licensee must\nensure that all dogs housed in outdoor enclosures have access to shade at all times of the day.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
