The\ntwo enclosures are located on the west side of the facility, and the rain has soaked the soil to create muddy\nsurfaces throughout much of these enclosures. Proper drainage is necessary to ensure the animals have clean, dry\nand comfortable enclosures at all times, and the accumulated mud promotes sanitation and husbandry issues.\nThe licensee must ensure that all enclosures have a suitable and effective method to prevent the accumulation of\nboth water and muddy surfaces. To correct this issue, the licensee plans to strip the affected enclosures down to\nthe rock surface, dig a trenching system utilizing pipes to remove the excess water, and cover the pipes with gravel\nand a wooden platform.\nThe facility's Wolf Encounter Experience is under review.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative."
