This inspector was concerned that this rabbit had ear mites in this\near. The facility wanted to confirmed (or refute) the inspector's tentative diagnoses and their attending veterinarian\nobtained an ear swab sample which confirmed the presence of ear mites.\nThis rabbit previously had ear mites on 5/19/15. The veterinarian instructed that this rabbit be treated for one day,\nrechecked in 2 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. The medical records indicated that the rabbit was initially\ntreated, but never reexamined as per the veterinarian's instructions.\nThe amount of the debris observed in the ear canal would indicate that this infection has been present for several\nweeks, and the attending veterinarian agreed with this assessment.\nThe rabbit was treated for this case of ear mites during the inspection, and is due for a re-exam in 2 weeks as per\nthe veterinarian's instruction. All animals shall be observed daily in sufficient detail to assess their health and well\nbeing, taking into account previous history of disease &/or other conditions that may be prevalent to a particular\nspecies, to minimize the discomfort of affected animals as well as the possibly of disease transmission to other\nsusceptible animals. A mechanism for direct & frequent caretaker communication is required so that timely\ninformation about animal health & well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian to reduce the risk of further\nspread of the disease to the affected animal as well as other susceptible animals\nNo further correction at this time\nThe exit interview was conducted with the Curator"
