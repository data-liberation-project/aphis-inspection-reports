This was currently the only feed available for the\nanimal. According to the licensee, the coatimundi was fed a dry kibble dog food and the feeder was cleaned every\ncouple of weeks. It appeared that the coatimundi would not be able to eat the food within the self-feeder without\neating the contaminated food. The animal was observed eating the food from the top of the self-feeder which is\nwhere the abnormal appearing food was located. Contaminated food can decrease the animal's acceptance of the\nfood and can increase the risk of disease and health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the current caked and\nmoldy-like feed. The licensee needs to establish and maintain a program to ensure that food is wholesome,\npalatable, free from contamination and that there is no molding, deterioration and/or caking of feed at all times. TO\nBE CORRECTED BY: Close of business on the day of inspection.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO), Stephanie Osborne (ACI) and the\nlicensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nOsborne Stephanie, Animal Care Inspector"
