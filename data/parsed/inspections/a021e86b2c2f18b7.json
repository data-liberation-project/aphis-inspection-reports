The discharge was draining down her face on that side becoming darker (red-brown)\nfurther away from the ear. The tissues inside the ear are swollen to a point that the ear canal is no longer visible. In\naddition, there was an odor coming from the ear. The Licensee stated that he originally noticed the issue in March\n2019 when he purchased the dog and has been intermittently treating with \"Ear Mite Killer\". The Licensee stated\nthat the last time the ear was looked at or treated with \"Ear Mite Killer\" was on or around 8/10/2019. The facility\u2019s\nwritten program of veterinary care currently provided him three methods of treatment. However; the Licensee is not\nusing any of the options listed in the Program of Veterinary Care. The Attending Veterinarian was contacted and\nagreed that given the severity and duration of the issue that the dog should be examined. The Licensee is currently\nnot using the methods he has available to prevent control, diagnose or treat the health issues with this dog.
