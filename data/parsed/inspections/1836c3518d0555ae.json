This dislocated board had a space between it and the adjacent boards which created gaps that\nwere at least a foot long and a few inches tall on each side of it. The partially unsecured floorboard extended into an\nadjacent enclosure, housing three adult dogs, where the board was observed to be more mobile than the rest of the\nflooring when the dogs walked on it. The floorboard had decreased security and the gaps were large enough for the dogs'\nfeet and/or legs to pass through, which could increase the risk of injury.
