Any person who is subject to the\nAnimal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at any location other than the person's approved\nsite, except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a written itinerary to the AC Regional Director.\nThe itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall\ncontain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any\nlocation other than the person's approved site. The licensee must submit an itinerary for any upcoming events that\nare at a location other than the approved site and that extend overnight.\nCorrect by COB (8:00pm) 03/09/2020 with submission of an itinerary for the current event.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSebera Shannon, Animal Care Inspector"
