Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized\npersons from going through it or under it, permitting contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as a\nsecondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the\noutside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or\npersons outside the perimeter fence. Non-dangerous animals housed in outdoor facilities require a 6-foot-tall perimeter\nfence around their enclosure and must be at least 3-feet away from any enclosures or buildings.\nCorrect by August 18, 2023.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
