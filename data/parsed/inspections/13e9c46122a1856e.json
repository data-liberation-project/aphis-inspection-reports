She stated that he curator, who recently left her position there, had contacted the veterinarian but it did\nnot get recorded. During the inspection there were no notes or other documentation available to verify if the\nattending veterinarian had been contacted, if he had examined the animal, and what if any treatment was\nrecommended.
