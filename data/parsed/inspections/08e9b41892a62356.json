This tissue was approximately a 1/4 inch in diameter and looked like a rupture or a growth\ncoming out of the eye with some weeping. The dog appeared healthy and jumping around, however the injury or\ngrowth needs to be seen by a veterinarian. The issue had not been noticed by the licensee until during the\ninspection and the veterinarian was contacted after the inspection was complete.\nThere was a male Boxer #134 that had multiple lumps or growths on the outside of his right and left rear feet, and\non the top and sides of his toes on his front feet. The lump on his right rear foot located on the outside toe was\napproximately 2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide and deep, was very red and raw in appearance with some fluid\naround the sore . The other fleshy lumps were healed over, or older in appearance.\nIt is imperative that any injuries or growths are identified as soon as they occur and a veterinarian is contacted in\norder to decrease the time an issue can cause pain or discomfort for the animal, and in order to decrease the\nchances of a treatable injury from becoming a chronic or incurable health issue.\nThe licensee needs to contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment as necessary as soon as health\nissues are identified.\nTo be corrected by: September 11, 2014"
