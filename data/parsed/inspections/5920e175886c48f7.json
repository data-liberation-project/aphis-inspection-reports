      "narrative": "Medical records state that on the morning of December 31, 2024, Snapper, an adult female sea lion, vomited a piece of\nfoam that she likely ingested during the blood collection/catch performed the previous day. The foam piece was\napproximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size and was traced back to the foam pad used in a medical procedure the previous\nafternoon. No other pieces of the pad were determined to be missing. At approximately 2 pm on December 30, 2024,\nSnapper was placed in a squeeze cage as part of a medical procedure. As the cage is tightened around the animal, they\nwill sometimes begin to strike out and mouth or bite at its surroundings. A foam pad is placed along the sides and front of\nthe cage to help position the animal and to help prevent the animal from injuring itself or its teeth on the metal bars of the\ncage. During the procedure, Snapper began to mouth and bite at her surroundings. It is believed that this is when she\ninadvertently bit off and ingested a piece of the foam pad in front of her.\nIngesting foreign material can cause the animal to experience discomfort, stress, and possible injury.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. To be corrected by the next\nre-license inspection.\nThis is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class \u201cC\u201d license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the\napplicant.\nAll items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by March 31, 2025, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee\nand must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.\nRegulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nKRISTIN NAPOLI, SUPERVISORY ANIMAL CARE SPECIALIST n"
