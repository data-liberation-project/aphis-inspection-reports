On 11/5/23, while two lab\nmembers were attempting to separate two cohoused nonhuman primates using a panel divider, one animal\u2019s tail was\ninadvertently caught behind the divider causing an injury that resulted in a partial surgical amputation. On 11/17/23, a lab\nmember was attempting to separate the same cohoused nonhuman primates in the incident that occurred on 11/5/23.\nDuring this process, the animal hit a portion of the dividing wall with its leg while running around the enclosure, resulting in\na laceration over its patella requiring surgical closure. On 1/5/24, during a cage change, a vole was inadvertently crushed\nbetween the cage and cage lid while it was attempting to escape its enclosure. The IACUC had previously reported both\nnonhuman primate events to the appropriate regulatory authorities including the USDA prior to inspection and had already\ntaken appropriate corrective action, including suspension of the protocol the animals were involved with, and instituting\nadditional positive reinforcement training and measures which resulted in significant improvement in the animals\u2019\nbehavior. Handling of all animals must be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not\ncause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrected prior to inspection."
