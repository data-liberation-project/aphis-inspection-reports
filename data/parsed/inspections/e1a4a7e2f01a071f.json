      "narrative": "Male Maltese (microchip #4964067354) was observed holding his left front foot off the flooring. The dog was mostly\nnon-weight bearing on this foot when he moved around the enclosure. Closer inspection of the dog revealed that\nthe toenails on all four feet are extremely overgrown and all the toenails have developed a severe curve. While\nexamining the left front foot, the inspector noticed that the toenails were growing under the foot towards the paw\npads. There is also a large ball of matted hair on the bottom of both front feet. This dog has a large clump of\nbrown tartar covering the top half of the surface of the left upper canine tooth and nearly the entire surface of the\nupper right canine tooth is also coated in a thick buildup of brown tartar.\nMale Chihuahua (\u201cEarl\u201d, microchip #033-793-272) is observed holding his tongue out the right side of his mouth.\nExamination of the dog\u2019s mouth revealed that the upper right canine tooth is heavily coated in a thick buildup of grey\nand brown colored tartar. This tooth is also loose and moved easily when touched by the inspector.\nFemale Yorkshire terrier (microchip #4826410972) has a very thick buildup of dark brown tartar covering nearly the\nentire surface of the upper left and right canine teeth. The gums have become slightly reddened. This dog also has\nexcessive matting of the hair coat on the right side of her body. The matted hair is beginning to become tightly\nadhered to the body. The license stated that she grooms all the dogs once a year.\nMale Maltese (No ID found) has a very thick buildup of dark brown tartar covering the entire surface of the cheek\nteeth on both sides of the mouth. Nearly the entire surface of both upper and lower canine teeth and all the front\nteeth are coated in the dark brown tartar. The gums have become moderately reddened. This dog also has\nmultiple sections of matted hair along the front and inside of both hind legs. The matted areas have entrapped dirt\nand grime and are nearly black in color. Clumps of matted hair are also found on the bottom of the feet and the\ntoenails on all four feet are overgrown and developing a severe curve. The inspector observed the toenails laid out\nsideways from the foot when the dog was standing on the flooring.\nPoor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and could lead to further health issues. The above\nmentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective\ntreatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector\nupon request.\nMatted hair coats could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Female Yorkshire terrier (#4826410972), male\nMaltese (No ID found), and male Maltese (#4964067354) must also receive hair coat maintenance to remove the\nmatted hair from their coats and the bottom of their feet. The licensee must establish an effective hair coat\nmaintenance plan that will keep the hair coats free of matting at all times.\nMale Shih tzu (microchip #48315C7D26) has excessively long toenails on all four feet. The toenails have\ndeveloped a severe curve and are beginning to grown towards the bottom of the dog\u2019s foot. Overgrown toenails\ncould also cause pain and discomfort, as well as, affect the dog\u2019s natural gait. This dog, as well as, male Maltese\n(No ID found), and male Maltese (#4964067354) must have their toenails trimmed to an acceptable length. The\nlicensee must develop a plan to maintain the toenails of all the dogs at a proper length at all times."
