The vervet got scared and bit/scratched the licensee who then dropped the\nvervet. During a second live video exhibition the vervet again bit/scratched the licensee twice. The licensee states that he\nflung out his arm and leg after each bite reflexively. In both instances it appears that the vervet was stressed by being\nhandled and acted out by biting. The vervet did not appear to be harmed in either incident and appears healthy during\ntoday's inspection. The licensee states that after these incidents he has discontinued using the male vervet in live\ninteractive videos.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.
