There is a dried dark discharge around the eyelids of both eyes and mucus on the\nsurfaces of the eyes. The mucus on the right eye of the dog was green. Eye problems can be caused by a variety of\nproblems and can be painful.\nThere is Rugby Artificial Tears Ointment prescribed by the attending veterinarian to treat the eyes. Due to the\nongoing condition of the eyes, the licensee must have this dog reevaluated by the veterinarian for additional\nveterinary care and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided\nto the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all\ntimes.\n* An approximate nine year old tri-colored, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, (cid:28)Mandy(cid:29) with number 093093000 has an\nexcessive clear fluid discharge from both eyes. The centers of both eyes, the (cornea), are bluish white. Eye\nproblems can be caused by a variety of problems and can be painful.\n(cid:28)Mandy(cid:29) has an accumulation of brown material completely coating and obscuring the \" cheek teeth \" (premolars)\nand molars and the canine teeth. The gums have receded away from the canine teeth and some of the molars.\nThere is a white, creamy discharge along the upper gum line. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue\nand tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall\nhealth of the animal.\n* An one year old male, Wheaton Terrier, (cid:28)Patrick(cid:29) with number 4C2C4DoC36 has an open wound on his left back\nleg. The wound is approximately one inch in diameter. This wound is red to pink in color with a moist creamy\nsubstance. Also, there is a wound on top of the cranium (head). This wound is reddish brown in color and moist.\nThe wound is approximately \u00bd inch in diameter. Although the owner is treating the wounds with iodine, there was\nno communication with a licensed veterinarian about this dog.
