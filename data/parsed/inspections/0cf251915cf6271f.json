The\ntwo hamsters were not observed again until 12:00 p.m. on May 30, 2017 when they were found dead.

According to lab personnel non-pharmaceutical grade Vancomycin has been used on all\nhamsters receiving this antibiotic since October 2016. To ensure consistency and effectiveness non-\npharmaceutical-grade substances should only be used in regulated animals when commercial products are\navailable after specific review and approval by the IACUC. Deviations to approved protocols must be reviewed and\napproved prior to implementation.\nCorrect by: All future significant changes to protocols must be approved prior to implementation."
