The small white feed buckets containing the\nrations for several species including the African crested porcupine and the wallaby included some overripe and\nspoiled cut up cantaloupe. The orange fleshy part of the cantaloupe was overripe and mushy. The outer rind\ncontained white and green mold on it. A sour smell was present. A bushel basket next to the feed buckets contained\noverripe and moldy whole cantaloupes and others contained spoiled apples that the facility representative stated\nwere being discarded. The facility representative stated that there was not enough refrigerator space available to\nstore all the produce used to feed the animals. Spoiled food should not be fed to animals as it may no longer be\nwholesome or nutritious and may be contaminated with microbes that may make the animals ill. The overripe\ncantaloupe issue was corrected during this inspection by removing the cantaloupe from the rations. Correct from\nthis day forward by ensuring that all food is wholesome, palatable and free from contamination and of sufficient\nnutritive value to maintain all animals in good health."
