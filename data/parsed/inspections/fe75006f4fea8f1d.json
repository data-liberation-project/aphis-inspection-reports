Inadequate construction and maintenance of a primary enclosure can negatively impact the health, safety\nand well-being of the animals enclosed therein. Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable\nmaterials so that they are structurally sound, kept in good repair, and must be constructed and maintained so that they\ncontain the birds securely. The facility made temporary repairs to the mesh and other areas that were damaged and are in\nthe process of making plans for permanent repairs soon.
