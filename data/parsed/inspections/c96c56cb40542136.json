And, the mane has thinned as would be seen on a one\nyear old lion. There is also a watery discharge around the lion's eyes.\nA dose of testosterone and a course of antibiotic has been administered per the veterinarian's instruction.

An examination\nby a veterinarian with exotic cat experience is needed to determine the cause of the lion's weight loss and\ngeneralized unthriftiness to determine the appropriate options for treating the lion's condition.\nCorrect by October 10, 2016\nThis is a focused inspection to check the care and welfare of a white pig and the male lion.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with owner."
