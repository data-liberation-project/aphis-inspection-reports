When\nquestioned, the PI states that the chosen euthanasia time was to prevent unnecessary animal discomfort. However, the\nhealth records show no indication of illness or clinical signs that would lead to humane euthanasia and the protocol itself\ndoes not allow for any potential deviation based on scientific knowledge or experience.\nThe protocol and any supporting documentation must fully describe and record all proposed animal procedures. Early\neuthanasia due to reaching humane endpoints is an important consideration in animal welfare, however the current\nprotocol is not written in a manner that supports such decisions.\nThe IACUC must approve and monitor all procedures on regulated animals to assure adherence to the allowed\nprocedures.
