The licensee believes this medicine to be amoxicillin, the\ninspector cannot be sure of what medicine is contained in the bottle. When the inspector contacted the attending\nveterinarian, he stated he prescribed Amoxi-drops twice a day and a facility representative stated to the veterinarian they\nhad some at the facility to use. The veterinarian did not authorize the use of Fish-Mox or expired amoxicillin for this dog.\nThe use of an unapproved medicine or an expired medicine does not ensure the medical condition is being appropriately\ntreated and that the puppy is receiving adequate veterinary care.\nThe licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee\nmust obtain the appropriate medication from a licensed veterinarian and follow the attending veterinarian\u2019s care\ninstructions.\nTo be corrected by: 24-February-2023."
