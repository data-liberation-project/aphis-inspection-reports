The lead system is being utilized to move the animal from the enclosure to the\nstage area, which serves as an exercise pen. The facility still has not completed training and gained experience\nmaintaining and handling adult cougars. Failure to handle the animal properly will increase the risk of harm to the\nanimal or to the public, or may lead to potential escape. This facility must either hire an individual who has the\nnecessary handling experience and knowledge, or obtain the necessary experience themselves before continuing to\nmaintain and handle the animal in this manner (by the lead system). This remains uncorrected.\n(This was a focused inspection with the licensee, Joe Kovach, ACI and Dr. Hammel).\nAdditional Inspectors\nHammel Kurt, Veterinary Medical Officer"
