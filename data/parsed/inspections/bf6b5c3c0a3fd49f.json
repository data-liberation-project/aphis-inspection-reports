The front portion of the turf closest to their accessible pool of water was covered in\nold food waste and old fecal material. The old and accumulated waste had also attracted gnats, which were seen crawling\nover and flying around this waste. A facility representative stated that the turf is occasionally taken off the enclosure floor\nand cleaned; however, they did not know the last time this occurred. Old food and feces can lead to the contamination of\nthe animals, may cause illness in the animals or create odors, and could attract pests which could cause stress and/or\nlead to the spread of disease. Excreta and food waste must be removed from the primary enclosures and from under and\naround primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of feces and food waste.
