The\nenclosures with trees that are too close to the fences are #11, #15, #17, #18 and #19a. We are removing\nenclosures #8 and #14 due to the age and health conditions of the cougars 'Leroy' and 'Monica'. However, the trees\nmust be addressed prior to different animals being placed in these enclosures (#8/#14)\nThe facility needs to remove any trees that are too close to the primary enclosure fences. If the trees are not going\nto be removed, an adequate kick-in over the top of the tree and/or around it that prevents the animals from climbing\nthe tree to escape must be added or another method must be devised by the facility to effectively prevent the\nanimals from using these trees for the purpose of escape. Taking these preventative measures and maintaining the\nenclosure fence according to AWA regulations and standards should decrease the risk of escape by the regulated\nanimals that can climb and decrease the potential for safety risks to the animal and general public.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with licensee and Dr. Susan Kingston, VMO. The licensee refused to sign\nthe inspection report upon advice of their lawyers. The report was left with the licensee and a copy was sent via\ncertified mail."
