Currently, all animal\nuse activities have no protocols assign to them, only SOPs; however, there is no SOP or any written instructions for\ninjecting adjuvants in goats. The current SOP has an accurate summary of the animal use activity, but is still\nmissing required information listed in 2.31(d) and (e). Some of these adjuvants can cause severe inflammatory\nreactions and acute pain such as the Freund(cid:25)s complete adjuvant used by the facility. Because of the potential for\npain and/or distress, a search for alternatives for animal use is also required. The protocol for blood collection from\ngoats are missing the approximate number of animals to be used, the rationale for involving animals, the rationale\nfor species, the rationale for the number of animals to be used, and the provision for the use of analgesic,\nanesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs where indicated to minimize discomfort and pain to the animals. It is necessary\nfor an IACUC to review and approve the proposed activities for the care and use of animals and to provide the\nproper oversight of the use of animals by the research facility. Lack of supervision by an IACUC often leads to\nnon-compliances with the Animal Welfare Act and this decreases animal welfare. Correct by ensuring all animal use\nactivities have been approved by the IACUC before any animal procedures are begun, and ensure all required\ninformation listed in 2.31 (d) and (e) is made available to the IACUC.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Superintendent.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMchenry Kerry, Veterinary Medical Officer"
