The cub exhibited distress by vocailization numerous times throughout the day and\none of the handlers was seen at least two times to pull back the cub prior to allowing customers to hold him due to\nsquirming and vocalization by the cub. The same cub was still being handled for pictures with the public when we\nleft for the day at approximately 4:30 PM, 6 hours later. The line to wait to have pictures taken with this cub\nremained long and steady for as long as the APHIS officials were able to observe the activity. According to the\nlicensee there were no other cubs at the facility young enough to be used for picture taking with members of the\npublic to allow alternation in the handling of this cub. The licensee stated that the cub did receive breaks but these\nwere not being documented nor could the APHIS officials see whether handling was suspended and, if so, for how\nlong.\nHandling of animals, particularly young animals, shall be done in a manner that does not cause trauma,\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nTo be corrected on all subsequent handling of animals."

The plan, at a minimum, must address social grouping,\nenvironmental enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and restraint devices and their use. The plan and\nenvironmental enrichment must be approved by the attending veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to\nthe animals on the environmental enhancement plan. At the time of this inspection, there was no written plan\ndenoting any enrichment and no log book or calendar showing that enrichment takes place. The animals have\ndifferent items in their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens.\nNonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that need to be addressed when in captivity. A\nwritten plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional standards, and available for review by APHIS\nofficials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of these animals is being appropriately addressed.\nExhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement of nonhuman\nprimates that is in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the AV.\nTo be corrected by 9/30/2014."
