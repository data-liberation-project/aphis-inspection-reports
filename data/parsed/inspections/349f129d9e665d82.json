The veterinarian wrote a note stating that she had visited Cindy at the home site\nand pacing was not observed.

      "narrative": "-While in travel status for several months of the year, the primary enclosure for the three bears is a rectangular\ncattle panel enclosure set up in a building with pine shavings on the floor. There are no visual barriers in the\nenclosure that allow the animals to avoid each other or get out of view of the guests. There are no furniture items,\nwater tubs, straw or bedding that allow the animals to express normal postural or social adjustments. Black bears\nnormally engage in postural behaviors of swimming, climbing, digging and denning and socially need to be able to\nhave the choice to get away from each other.\n-Cindy, the female bear, was observed pacing in the travel trailer for at least 10 minutes and was observed pacing\ninside the exhibit along the front panel for a period of time. In both the travel trailer and the public exhibit Cindy\nseemingly would only break from the pacing behavior if the younger bear Barney would grab at her legs. She would\nthen turn on him mouth open until he would submit and she would begin pacing again. Pacing in black bears is an\nabnormal behavior pattern and can indicate stress, frustration, or an underlying medical condition.\n-When Andy, the older male bear, was brought out of the travel trailer and placed in the public exhibit, and when\ntreats were provided his movements were stiff and slow. Andy has been diagnosed with arthritis by a veterinarian.\nSeveral times Barney, the younger 4 year old black bear, would try and elicit a response from the older bear and\nwould get on top of him and Andy would tolerate it for a few moments before opening his mouth and the younger\nbear would get off. Andy has no way to separate himself from the younger bear which can cause additional stress or\nis potentially painful in his geriatric condition.\n-This inspection occurred on the MSU campus in Bozeman, MT.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMckinnie Carolyn, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
