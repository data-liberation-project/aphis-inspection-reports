Both medications were intermingled with other\nproducts that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The effectiveness of the\ndosage level and expected results could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated if these medications\nare administrated past the recorded expiration date. In addition, the usage of expired medications on regulated\nanimals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice.
