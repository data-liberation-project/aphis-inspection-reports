When the procedure was completed, the pig was carried by a\ntechnician back to its primary enclosure and was noted to be limping and not wanting to bear weight on the right\nhind limb. A veterinarian was contacted, the fracture diagnosed by radiography, and the pig was euthanized per the\nprincipal investigator in consult with the veterinarian.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrection should include continuing to implement training of personnel in handling of animals and ensuring all\nequipment is appropriate for handling of all animals."

The facility has moved the racks of guinea\npig cages so they are 6 inches away from the wall where the water lines are secured.\nFurther corrections should be pursued by the facility (eg. disconnecting unused water lines) and should be put into\nplace by 11/17/2014."

Enclosures that are not structurally sound or sturdy enough to contain the animals pose a risk\nfor escape and for a risk of injury to the animals.\nHousing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for\nthe species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must contain the animals securely.\nThe facility has added a secondary mechanism to secure the enclosures as a temporary correction.\nEnclosures that are suitable for larger male macaques should be available for use prior to acquisition of these\nanimals.\nInspection conducted on October 15-17, 2014 with facility representatives, APHIS AC VMO, CDC representatives,\nand VS-SA Inspector.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representatives on November 14, 2014."
