During anesthesia, \"Francis\"\nexperienced difficulty breathing due to suspected pulmonary bruising; although there was no penetration into the chest\ncavity, bite wounds were noted on the neck and lateral chest which penetrated deeply into musculature. Despite\nsupportive care, \"Francis\" did not recover from anesthesia. Leaving these two animals together in the same enclosure\nafter initially discovering the superficial scratches allowed aggression to continue, resulting in further trauma to \"Francis\"\nand leading to worse injury, deterioration of his health status, and death.
