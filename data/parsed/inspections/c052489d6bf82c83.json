Upon closer\nexamination, there is a clear yellowish scab-like lesion on the interior surface of the outer ear pinna. The skin of the\near in this area feels thickened. This condition had not been identified by the facility prior to this inspection, so it was\nnot receiving treatment nor had the attending veterinarian been consulted.\nConditions that have not been treated in accordance with the veterinarian's recommendations can lead to undue\npain, distress, or further illness and are not consistent with an adequate program of veterinary care.
