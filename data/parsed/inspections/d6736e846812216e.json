      "narrative": "-Two adult female dogs in the whelping facility were observed to be very thin. This included female Siberian\nHuskies, \"Gypsy\" (# 900032002244351) and \"Bella\" (#956000009756561). Both dogs had obvious visible waists\nand abdominal tucks. The tops of their lumbar vertebrae were visible and the pelvic bones were becoming\nprominent. Each of the dogs were housed with their litter. \"Gypsy\" had a litter of 7 puppies that were approximately\n2 1/2 weeks old. \"Bella\" had a litter of 8 puppies that were approximately 3 1/2 weeks old. According to the\nlicensee, he had noticed that the dogs were thin and was giving these females a can of adult dog food twice a day\nin addition to dry puppy food. A veterinarian had not been contacted about these dogs' conditions. A thin body\ncondition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee\nmust consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding the body conditions of both of these dogs. This veterinary\nconsultation is in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is\ndeveloped and followed. The licensee must document this information and provide it to the inspector upon request.\n-An adult male Pomeranian, \"Beau\" (# 956000009615895), had some clumps of fecal material matted in the fur\nunder the tail. There was also a small mat of fur noted behind the dog's right ear. Matting can be uncomfortable and\ncan increase the risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed and establish an appropriate\ngrooming schedule for all dogs as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by:\nSeptember 2, 2017.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
