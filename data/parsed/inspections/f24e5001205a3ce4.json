Employee stated that public\ncontact during photo shoots started with these two mountain lions at 3 weeks of age. At 3 week of age these\n\nneonatal nondomestic cats are not able to thermoregulate and lack a fully functional immune system to fight off\ndisease and infection. Because of their limited immunity their health is at risk if they are exposed to other animals or\noffered for public contact. Ensure that until these animals can thermoregulate and immunocompetent they are\nhoused in a control environment and handle these animals in a manner that does not expose them to any form of\npublic contact, to include public feeding.\nTo be corrected by: Immediately\n3.81                    REPEAT\nENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.\nThe plan for the environmental enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates, 2\nring- tailed lemurs acquired in July 2014, was not available for review at the time of this inspection. The plan, at a\nminimum, must address social grouping, environmental enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and\nrestraint devices and their use. The plan and environmental enrichment must be approved by the attending\nveterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to the animals on the environmental enhancement plan. There\nwas nothing documenting (i.e notebook, calendar) that enrichment is taking place. The animals have different items\nin their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens. Nonhuman primates have\ncomplex social and intellectual needs that need to  be addressed when in captivity. A written plan that is directed by\nthe AV, guided by current professional standards, and available for review by APHIS officials is required to ensure\nthat the psychological well-being of these animals is being appropriately addressed. Must develop, document, and\nfollow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement of nonhuman primates that is in accordance with\ncurrently accepted professional standards and as directed by.\n3.125(a)                    REPEAT\nFACILITIES, GENERAL.   \n**In the following enclosures, the doorframe around the den (shelter) had chewed, ripped wood or ripped fencing\nwhich are in disrepair and which could cause an injury to the animals :\n    2adult tigers, Montana and Poncho\n    3adult tigers, Capricho, Carolina and India \n    1 adult tiger, Pandora\n    2 adult tigers, Tutt and Nefertiti\n    2 adult tigers, Shenandoah and Sabre \n    2 adult tigers, Toni and Phoebe\n    1 adult lion, Savannah\n**In the following enclosures the wires holding the fence to the support poles are rusted and can easily break.

This enclosure previously housed\nbobcats, a much smaller animal than an adult leopard, and the shelter structure entrance is too small for a leopard\nto enter this structure or to have adequate room to make normal postural adjustments if able to gain access.\nAnimals housed outdoors should have appropriate shelter, natural or artificial, where they can escape adverse\nclimatic conditions and stay warm and dry.\nNatural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for\nall animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals. \n3.129(a)                    REPEAT\nFEEDING.    \n**According to the diet plan observed by the inspectors it calls for \u201cAdded Calcium supplement for the cubs\u201d.

The flies were numerous enough that the buzzing was audible while conducting the inspection. Fly\nstrips and containers with fly bait are being utilized, but are ineffective because they are either full of flies or\ncontainers were empty except for dead flies and debris. Flies and other pests may carry and transmit diseases to\nthe animals and a more effective method of monitoring and preventing their presence in/around enclosures, food\nstorage/preparation should be implemented.\nEstablish and maintain a safe and an effective pest control program which should include reduction of flies,\n\nparticularly around food and food preparation areas.\n3.132                    REPEAT\nEMPLOYEES. \nThe licensee is not regularly involved in the day to day care of the animals and facilities. Facility staff stated that\nthey  have 2 full time employees able to work directly with the animals and 2 other employees who are being\ntrained. The employees who are living on site have not been adequately trained for emergency situations. This was\nevidenced by not being able to explain the protocol in an emergency or escaped animal. This facility currently has a\ntotal of about 111 animal, including 12 different species. These species have complex medical, behavioral,\nnutritutional and other husbandry needs. Conditions at the facility currently do not meet the professional level of\nhusbandry practicies described in the regulations and standards.  Young animals at the facility were being hand\nraised and require around the clock specialized care and feeding. A total of 32 enclosures, affecting 64,had no\nshade. This has been an ongoing problem  that has been cited since May 2009. At least 4 enclosures were in vary\ndegrees of disrepair that was cited on 12/9/2015 inspection. The excessive number of animal welfare concerns\nindicates that there is not a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain a professionally\nacceptable level of husbandry practices and lack in emergency  procedures. Facilities are required to utilize a\nsufficent number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional husbandry standards described in\nthe regulations and standards to ensure that the animals are appropriately maintained, sanitary facilities and receive\nappropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding and watering.\nLicense must evaluate the current work load and staffing level to ensure that a sufficient number of adequately\ntrained employees are utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable leve of husbandry practices described in\nthe regulations and standards.\n3.133           DIRECT\nSEPARATION. \nTwo adult tigers were observed fighting in the enclosure housing three adult tigers named \"Lazareth, \"Diablo\" and\n\"Twinkle\". Staff member was unable to identify which two tigers were fighting and inspectors were told fighting only  \noccurs when they are being fed. No food was present at the time and both cats were observed multiple times\nfighting with visable wound marks on shoulders and hindquarters. The continutally fighting could interfere with their\nhealth, cause  undue stress or potentially lead to the death of one of the tigers. This could possibly be a\nbehaviroral/dominace problem and should be observed, evaluated and recommendations being provided by a\nveterinarian.\n \nAnimal housed in the same enclosure must be compatible.so it does not interfere with their health or causes\n\ndiscomfort or distress.\nEnsure that all animals housed in the same enclosure are compatible.\nTo be corrected by: Immediately\nInspection conducted on 8/24/2016 with a facility representative, AC Supervisory Animal Care Specialist, Tanya\nTims, Animal Care Inspector Cindy Rhodes and APHIS Security Ken Miller.\nA through exit briefing was conducted in person on 9/2/2016 with the facility representative who accompanied\nAPHIS Officials on the inspection.\n>>>The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information\nmanagement system.   Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was\ndeployed, the \u201cprepared by\u201d date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the\noriginal inspection report, which occurred on 8/26/2016.<<< \nAdditional Inspectors\nTims Tanya, Assistant Director",
