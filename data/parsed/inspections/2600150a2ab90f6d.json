I did not see anyone around. I knocked on the door to one of the barns\nin the front of the property. No one responded. I called three phone numbers and left messages on two of those.\nThe other phone number had a full mailbox. I honked my horn. After waiting about 15 minutes, an employee drove\npast. She was not comfortable going along on the inspection as she hasn't done it before. She attempted to\ncontact one of the other employees by phone, but was not able to get through to anyone. I told her I would write it\nup as an attempted inspection and would try again another day.\nEnd of report."
