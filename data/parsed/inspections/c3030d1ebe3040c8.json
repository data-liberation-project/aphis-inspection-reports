This incident had not been reported to the IACUC as of the date of this inspection. The IACUC\nlast met on September 14, 2017.\nOn the morning of September 1, 2017, approximately 22 turkey poults in one housing room were found dead by the\ncaretaker. According to the caretaker, several other poults appeared to be severely depressed at that time. Over\nthe next 24 to 48 hours, several other poults died. The daily observation (NCAH Animal Care and Use Log Sheets)\nsheet posted on the animal housing room door stated that a total of 38 died during this incident.\nThe daily observation sheet for this group of birds begin August 17, 2017 with no room temperatures recorded until\nSeptember 1st when it was noted the room was 64\u00b0F in the morning when the caretakers arrived to find the dead\nbirds. The caretaker stated that this room is normally maintained at a temperature of approximately 72\u00b0F. These\nbirds are maintained in this room with two heat lamps. Additionally, the facility was not monitoring the temperatures\nin the areas under the heat lamps.\nThe HVAC system was examined and adjusted the same day. Since September 2nd, the NCAH Animal Care and\nUse Log Sheets record the High/Low room temperatures for the surviving birds between 68-73\u00b0F. For poults, the\nhousing temperature surrounding the brooding areas that allow birds to move toward or away from a separate heat\nsource (such as heat lamps) should be maintained at 68 to 77\u00b0F (Ag Guide pg 116).\nA gross necropsy performed by a staff veterinarian on one bird revealed no significant findings. Four birds were\nsent for pathology/necropsy.

Also, the necropsy report suggests lack of nutrition (inanition).\nThe physical environment afforded by a poultry research or teaching facility should not put birds at undue risk of\ninjury or expose them to conditions that would be likely to cause unnecessary distress or disease (Ag guide pg 103)\nCorrect by: From this date forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nNOTATION: This facility was experiencing a staffing shortage at the time of this inspection.
