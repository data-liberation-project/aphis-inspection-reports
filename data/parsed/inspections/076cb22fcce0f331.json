      "narrative": "On August 9, 2014 a non-human primate (NHP) was injured while being restrained for treatment of a clinical\ncondition. The NHP, a six year old male macaque, was left on a restraint board in a treatment room during\nintravenous fluid administration. At some point during treatment the animal chewed through tape restraining his\nupper body to the board leaving his legs taped to the board. The animal's partially restrained condition was noticed\non a video monitor and he was captured by veterinary staff. The animal was found to have a broken leg, was\ntreated, and recovered from the fracture. Facility staff stated that restrained NHPs are supposed to have their\nrestraints checked every 15 minutes, however staff are not required to document restraint checks. In this case a\ntreatment document showed that the animal was restrained at approximately 10:30 hours, checked at 12:45 hours,\nand was found partially restrained at 2:30 hours. It is unclear if, or when, the restraints were checked between 12:45\nand 2:30 hours.\nAnimals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar\nproblems from occurring in the future.\nPreviously to have been corrected immediately.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
