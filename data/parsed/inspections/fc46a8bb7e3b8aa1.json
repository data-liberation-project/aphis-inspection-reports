During this time the animal had water rich fruit and vegetable enrichment\nwas consumed, therefore no additional treatment was needed. Lack of potable water in sufficient quantity to nonhuman\nprimates can negatively impact their health and well-being by resulting in dehydration, and possible death. Potable water\nmust be provided in sufficient quantity to every nonhuman primate housed at the facility. If potable water is not continually\navailable to the nonhuman primate, it must be offered to them as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
