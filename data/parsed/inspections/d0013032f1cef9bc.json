These 4\npuppies did not receive a distemper vaccine before their disposition date at 8 weeks old.\nParasites and communicable diseases such as distemper virus are hazards to dogs and puppies and may result in stress,\ndiscomfort, general unwellness, or even death if contracted and not treated. Routine sampling of internal parasites and\npreventative care in the form of vaccination for contagious diseases are methods used by veterinarians to be able to\nprovide early detection or early protection against these disorders. Each dealer must follow an appropriate PVC for dogs\nwhich addresses the requirements for adequate veterinary care for contagious diseases and sampling and treatment of\nparasites.

      "narrative": "The facility did not create adequate medical records for 3 litters of puppies (13 puppies in total) born in 2025. The facility\nuses a vaccine called Nobivac Canine DAPPv + Cv. This vaccine consists of two vials: a liquid portion, the Cv\n(coronavirus vaccine) which is meant to be used to reconstitute the powder in the second vial, the DAPPv (Distemper-\nAdenovirus-Parainfluenza-Parvovirus vaccine). Each vial has a removable label that can be affixed to a medical record for\ndocumentation purposes. When creating such a medical record, the facility only retained and used the labeling from the\nCv vial and did not include any of the information from the DAPPv vial. The result is that it would appear the puppies in\nthese litters did not receive the vaccinations contained in the DAPPv vaccine. These vaccines protect against highly\ncontagious and potentially deadly viruses, distemper and parvovirus, which are required by the Animal Welfare Act and\nthe Program of Vet Care. It is important for medical records to be accurate so that the complete vaccine status of a puppy\nis understood. Complete records also allow USDA inspectors to ensure that facilities are appropriately following the\nProgram of Vet Care as outlined by their Attending Veterinarian. Correct by ensuring that the facility makes and retains\ncomplete medical records which can be made available for USDA inspection, and which include the names of all vaccines\nand treatments administered and the dates of administration.
