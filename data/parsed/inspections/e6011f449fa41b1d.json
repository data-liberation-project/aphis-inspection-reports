      "narrative": "A female juvenile hedgehog housed in the north side of the showcase enclosure with 4 other weanling hedgehogs\nwas noted to be lethargic, seen to sneeze multiple times, and appeared to have an elevated breathing rate at rest\nas compared to the other animals. The animal was noted to lay on her sternum or partially curled on her side while\nthe other juvenile hedgehogs were roaming throughout the enclosure and nudging her. The employee was directed\nby the AC VMO to remove this hedgehog for closer examination. Her breathing had a clicking noise and she\nappeared weak while being handled. A larger female in this enclosure was also noted to sneeze multiple times,\nhave a clear nasal discharge, and would lick her nose repeatedly after sneezing as well as when she was running in\nthe exercise wheel in the enclosure.\nLethargy, reluctance to move, nasal discharge, sneezing, and abnormal breathing rate and sounds may indicate a\nsevere illness and should be identified quickly so that the animal can be separated from others in case of infectious\nillness and so the animal can be evaluated by the attending veterinarian as soon as the problem is noted.\n**These hedgehogs need to be evaluated by a veterinarian by 9/23/2015 to determine a diagnosis, initiate a\ntreatment\nfor the diagnosed condition, and to develop a plan for follow-up to ensure the animal responds to the treatment as\nexpected. Records containing information on the suspected diagnosis, treatment needed, and follow-up plan need\nto\nbe made available to APHIS inspectors by 9/25/2015."
