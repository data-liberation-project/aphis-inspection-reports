The hair loss was about an\ninch in length on the dorsal (top) area of his neck and extended down both sides of his neck. There was also a little\nhair loss on the ventral area of his neck. One of the two female prairie dogs came briefly to the entrance of one of\nthe burrows during the inspection and was observed to have hair loss on her body. None of the prairie dogs have\nbeen seen or treated by the veterinarian for hair loss. Hair loss may have many causes such as parasites,\ninfectious, nutritional, and may be a sign of a more serious health concern. The prairie dogs must be evaluated by\nthe veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care. Correct by having the prairie dogs evaluated by the\nveterinarian. The licensee must document and maintain records of examination, treatment and outcome for future\ninspections by APHIS officials. Correct by February 24, 2017."
