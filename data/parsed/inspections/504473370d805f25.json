      "narrative": "A lamb being transported in a crate with an adult sheep (the mother) was killed during an approximately two hour\ntrip from UC Davis to second research facility. The animal was being used in a heart disease study. The lamb had\nsurgery at UC Davis prior to shipment and was considered to be in compromised health. The 106 kg (233 pound)\nfemale sheep (ewe) was being shipped with the lamb in an enclosure designed for smaller ewes. The SOP\n(standard operating procedure) for Sheep Transport to the second facility stated that the (cid:28)large transport crates(cid:29)\nused to transport ewes and one or two lambs measured 28\"(cid:29) in length by 32(cid:29)\" in width, and 35(cid:29)\" in height. A facility\nrepresentative stated that in the past the ewes being used under the protocol were much smaller and that the crate\ncurrently in use was larger than the one specified in the SOP. The crate used to transport the above animals\nactually measured 46.5\" in length by 26\" in width x 30\" in height, as reported by the second research facility which\nwas in possession of the crate. The IACUC minutes from the facility receiving the animals stated that (cid:28)\"a very large\newe fell on a lamb during transportation between UC Davis and.... only smaller ewes will be transported going\nforward.(cid:29)\"\nIn response to the above incident, the protocol was amended to state (cid:28)\"request that the vendor try not send us ewes\nover 100kg. The vendor will accommodate us when possible\"(cid:29) The amendment also states that the facility will (cid:28)try(cid:29)\ntransporting (cid:28)overly large(cid:29) ewes separately from the lambs.\nAnimals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort. The IACUC should ensure that SOPs are kept current and regularly reviewed to ensure\nthey are appropriate for their designated animal activity. The IACUC should also ensure that corrective actions for\nhandling issues will prevent similar problems from occurring in the future. Stating that the ewe was (cid:28)overly large(cid:29) is\nin this case the equivalent of stating that the crate was too small for the animal. The weight of the ewe in above\nincident was only seven kilograms (15.4 pounds) more than a 99 kg ewe that is not considered (cid:28)overly large.(cid:29) The\namendment does not address whether the crates are appropriate for the size of the animals being transported, nor\ndoes it incorporate changes that will prevent a similar incident in the future.\nCorrect immediately.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
