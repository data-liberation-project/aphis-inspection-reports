Failure to have an adequate barrier between the public and\na fixed outdoor exhibit for nonhuman primates may result in harm to the animals or the general public. Fixed public\nexhibits housing nonhuman primates, such as zoos, must have a barrier between the primary enclosure and the public at\nany time the public is present, in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the nonhuman primates.\nCorrect by 7 April 2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nn"
