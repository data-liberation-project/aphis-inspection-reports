Brownish-orange material\nwas easily removed by touching the surface. The overlying paint is also starting to peel away. The bottom third of the\nenclosure walls is created from \u201cTrex\u201d decking with the upper two thirds painted concrete. Directly to the left of the\nleftmost stall door, the concrete has several areas of chipping paint that are actively peeling. Rusted metal cannot be\nadequately sanitized due to the irregular pitting of the surface. Additionally, peeling paint can be ingested by the animals\nand lead to illness or disease.\nCorrect by December 1, 2022 by making sure all housing facilities for dogs are kept in good repair and protect the animals\nfrom injury."
