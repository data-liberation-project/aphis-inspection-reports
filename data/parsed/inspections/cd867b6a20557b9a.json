      "narrative": "During this inspection an adult male lion named \"Zar\" was found to be emaciated. All ribs, vertebral bodies, pelvic\nand hip bones were prominently displayed. The skin was noted to be laying flat over the hips and femurs, no\ndiscernable body fat was present and loss of muscle mass was obvious. Respirations were rapid and shallow The\nlion appeared reluctant to move, quietly depressed and was not observed standing during the inspection that lasted\nseveral hours.\nThe licensee stated that the lion had been showing signs of illness for over a month with a depressed appetite and\nwas recently observed ambulating but was very unsteady standing/walking. The animals condition had not been\ncommunicated to any veterinarian at the start of this inspection. No veterinary examination, diagnosis or treatment\nhad been obtained.\n*The adult male white tiger named \"Toby\" was noted to have a swollen and discolored left front dewclaw. It was\ndetermined that the claw has grown into the pad of the dewclaw. The claw of the first digit on the left rear foot has\nalso grown into the pad. Although the tiger was not limping he was observed licking the dewclaw area. The\ndewclaw swelling and inflammation may indicate discomfort is experienced by the animal and/or infection is present.\nThe ingrown nails were not previously identified by the licensee . No veterinary examination or treatment had been\ninitiated for these problems as of the start of this inspection.\nDelivery of adequate veterinary care under the Animal Welfare Act includes the use of appropriate methods to\nprevent, control , diagnose and treat animal injuries, diseases and medical concerns. Treatment or veterinary\nintervention was not provided for the two animals described above. The lion appears to be in critical condition and\nrequires immediate veterinary care. These animals must be examined and treated by a veterinarian to demonstrate\nadequate veterinary care can be established and maintained by the licensee.\nCorrect by: The non-compliance related to the lion was corrected prior to the completion of this inspection. The tiger\nwas examined and initial treatment provided prior to the completion of this inspection. Veterinary follow-up for the\ntiger must proceed as directed by the examining veterinarian.\nThe inspection was conducted with the licensee and a consulting veterinarian.\nThe exit interview was conducted on June 24, 2019 with the licensee."
