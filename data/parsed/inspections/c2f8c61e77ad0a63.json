While conducting this inspection it was noted that a black and white llama was not responding to our presence.\nThis animal had been moved up to this pen, along the upper walkway, so that she could be watched. The staff had\nnoticed that she was acting differently than usual. When we approached her we noticed that she was standing\nperfectly still with her head hung downward. She did not respond to our presence. The owner went into the\nenclosure and got her to walk around the pen. However, once he left she resumed the same posture. Again, she\nwas very still and held her head level with her body. This did not appear to be normal behavior for a llama.\nHowever, no documentation was available in regards to her condition and consult with the attending vet. To ensure\nthat this animal was under veterinary care, documentation will need to be made and kept on the premise.\n*** To Be Corrected By: April 4, 2017\n2. At this time we also noticed that the lynx was in need of veterinary attention. The lynx appeared to be in good\ncondition. However, she was noted to have drool coming off her bottom jaw. When speaking to the owner we were\ninformed that she had an abscess in the recent past. He was unsure of when the vet had been out. But the\nattending vet had been called and the abscess was treated. There was evidence of a small wound on the right side\nof her face, close to her mouth. Due to the fact that she is drooling, the attending vet will need to be consulted on\nthe progress of this injury.\n*** To Be Corrected By: April 4, 2017\n3. As we approached the red fox enclosure it was noted that one of the foxes had hair loss along the tail and both of\nits back legs. There were bare patches on the back of the fox's thighs. Its tail also had small patches of hair loss. In\nspeaking with the owner he was unaware of this animals condition. Again, this fox will need to be evaluated by the\nattending vet to diagnosis and treat this hair loss.\n***To Be Corrected By: April 4, 2017\nThe attending vet had come out to the facility and evaluated all of these animals on April 5, 2017"
