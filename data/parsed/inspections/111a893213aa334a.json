At this inspection, the small circular areas of hair loss on the paws all have new hair growth\noccurring. Although the treatment given appears to be working, the Attending Veterinarian has not signed off on\nthis particular treatment.\nBecause ringworm can be a recurring problem, the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian need to develop a\nwritten plan for how it will be treated. The treatment plan needs to include treatments to be used, any\nenvironmental measures to take, and public safety issues to address, such as when the animals can have public\ncontact.\nTo be corrected by 4-15-16.\nExit briefing conducted with facility representative."
