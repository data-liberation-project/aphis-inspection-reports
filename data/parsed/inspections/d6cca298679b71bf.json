      "narrative": "The ongoing protocol 14-004 was reviewed during this inspection including the surgery records for 11 sheep. The\nsurgery description includes the use of a paralytic to relax the intercostal musculature during the thoracotomy.\nStandard procedure for the facility is to monitor heart rate and blood pressure for depth of anesthesia when\nparalytics are in use since both parameters are known to increase if the animal is experiencing pain. The protocol\ncalls for a cardiac bypass as part of the surgical procedure. The paralytic was shown in the records to be\nadministered several times until the end of the cardiac bypass. Animals placed on cardiac bypass can not be\nadequately monitored using heart rate and/or blood pressure since the bypass machine is controlling these\nfunctions for the heart. The sheep are under the influence of the paralytic during the cardiac bypass so an\nadditional method of animal monitoring must be instituted to ensure the sheep are maintained under sufficient levels\nof the anesthesia and analgesia while under the effects of the paralytic. See section 2.33(b)(4) below for specific\nexamples. Adjunctive methods for assessing pain and anesthetic depth such as a peripheral nerve stimulator\nshould be considered when paralytic agents are being used (especially when heart rate and blood pressure are\nunable to be monitored due to concurrent use of cardiac bypass machines or administration of cardio-active drugs).\nSurgery must be performed with appropriate analgesics / anesthetics and monitoring to assure that the animal is not\nexperiencing pain during the procedure with the use of paralytics. Correct from this day forward."

      "narrative": "Protocol 13-028, which is now closed (completed), and all associated records for the 30 study animals were\nreviewed at this inspection. The protocol states that \"Rabbits will be weighed weekly...\" and weighing is widely\nconsidered a good method of monitoring health in rabbits including pain/distress.\nRabbit 10 weighed 8.6# on arrival and 8.4# at surgery 7/16/13. The rabbit was not weighed at the next group\nweighing 7/19/13 and was found dead 7/25/13. At that time it weighed 6# according to the records. If the rabbit had\nbeen weighed with the group 7/19 or a week after the last weight 7/23 it might have been identified for treatment in\ntime for a positive outcome.\nRabbit 15 weighed 7.6# on arrival 7/15/13 and had surgery 7/18/13. By 8/2/13 the rabbit weighed 5.4# but no\ntreatment was noted in the records for this rabbit. By 8/9/13 the rabbit weighed 4.8# and had suffered injuries from\nthe other rabbits. Euthanasia was performed 8/14/13 and the necessity might have been avoided with earlier\nintervention.\nRabbit 25 weighed 8# on arrival 7/2/13 and had surgery 7/15/13. It was identified as having a luxating patella\n7/19/13 and received two days of pain treatment. By 7/26/13 the rabbit weighed 6.6# and maintained this weight\nuntil 8/16/13. No further treatment or special consideration was noted in the records. Although it was weighed\nweekly there was no additional diagnostic testing or treatments provided (such as continued analgesics, individual\nhousing, the addition of soft bedding, nutritional support, additional monitoring etc.) despite weight loss. The rabbit\nweighed 5.8# Friday 8/23/13 and there was no record of veterinary examination for this weight loss. The rabbit was\nkept through the weekend and until the study ended for that group Tuesday 8/27/13. This animal may have\nexperienced pain or distress during the period it was maintained without treatment as indicated by 12% weight loss\nbetween weighing 8/16/13 and 8/23/13.\nThese three rabbits all had weight loss that could indicate pain or distress. Monitoring methods must be\nconducted as outlined in the IACUC approved protocol. Additionally, animals exhibiting clinical signs of injury,\nillness, or pain (such as significant decreases in weight) must be referred to the attending veterinarian for\nappropriate diagnosis and treatment. Monitoring data must additionally be reviewed for trends that might indicate\nproblems that would respond to treatment. Treatment must be initiated in a timely manner to assure the animals are\nnot living with pain or distress that could be controlled. Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs\nof adequate veterinary care that include: The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\ndiseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Correct from this date forward."

      "narrative": "Section 2.33(b)(4) Veterinary Care: The surgery records of three sheep on the ongoing protocol 14-004\ndocumented signs of pain that were not appropriately addressed by the surgery personal of the principal\ninvestigator.\nSheep B3379 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/11/14. During\nthe cardiac bypass there was a notation that the animal was kicking. A paralytic was administered with the\nanalgesic and increase in the anesthetic agent. As stated in the protocol the analgesia and anesthetic should be\nallowed to bring the animal to plane III anesthesia before the administration or re-administration of a paralytic to\nensure the animal is not experiencing pain during the surgical procedure.\nSheep B3382 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/11/14. Both the\nheart rate and the blood pressure increased after the cardiac bypass and remained at that level until the end of the\nsurgery, about 45 minutes. The heart rate increased from an average of 73 to 106 and the blood pressure\nincreased from an average of 79/50 to 102/76. During the 45 minute period with the elevated heart rate and blood\npressure the gas anesthetic was decreased from 2% to 1% for the last 30 minutes. No additional analgesics were\nadministered during this 45 minute period. An additional dose of paralytic drug had been given during the cardiac\nbypass so the sheep would have been under the influence of the paralytic. Pain was then not appropriately\naddressed in this sheep, the sheep should have received an agent for pain relief which would lead to a decrease\nthe heart rate and blood pressure.\nSheep B3386 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/13/14. After the\nincision the average heart rate increased from 92 to 144 and the average blood pressure increased from 83/61 to\n119/101. An analgesic was given to decrease the pain and the resulting high blood pressure. Five minutes later\nthe heart rate was 149 and the blood pressure 112/91. Metoprolol (not an analgesic or anesthetic) was given to\ndecrease the high heart rate and blood pressure. The use of Metoprolol was not included in the protocol. Eight\nminutes later the heart rate was 103 and the blood pressure was 106/79 and an additional dose of the paralytic drug\nwas administered. The cardiac bypass was initiated four minutes later. As the protocol indicates, an increase in\nheart rate and blood pressure indicates perception of pain by the animal. The increase in heart rate and blood\npressure were considered signs that the sheep was experiencing pain. Giving a drug that affects heart rate and\nblood pressure prevents these parameters from being used to monitor pain when paralytics are used. The sheep\ndid not have its pain addressed before additional paralytic was given.\nParalytic agents prevent the animal from moving even if it experiences pain. Heart rate and blood pressure often\nincrease when animals experience pain and are therefore used to evaluate the depth of anesthesia in lieu of muscle\nresponses such as eye twitch. When heart rate and blood pressure rise during anesthesia, additional pain relieving\n(analgesic) and/or anesthetic agent are necessary to assure the animal is not experiencing pain. This is especially\nimportant in animals that are unable to respond due to a paralytic agent. Based on the examples above, the\nveterinary guidance on use of paralytics to include monitoring with appropriate response does not appear to be\nadequate as required by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations. Each research facility veterinarian must provide\nguidance on appropriate monitoring and subsequent treatment by personnel involved in handling, immobilization,\nanesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia. This assures the least pain and distress is felt by the animals.\nCorrect for all future surgeries.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility Vice President and facility Veterinarian.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMiller Dana, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist\nGeib Mary, Veterinary Medical Officer"
