Some of the organic material appeared\nto be dry kibbles of dog food and/or fecal material with a white discoloration to it. Some small insect-like bugs were\nobserved in between the two layers of flooring as well. This build up of dirt, grime and organic material can increase\nthe risk of pests and other disease hazards to the dogs. The licensee must clean between these layers of flooring\nand must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally\naccepted husbandry standards and practices.
