The following\ndeaths with dates of the death were reported: 1 dead muntjacs (12/30/24), 1\u201413 year old fallow deer (1/16/25), 4\nchickens (1/16/25, 1/16/25, 2/25/25, & 2/26/25),1 duck (1/19/25), 2 parakeets (1/28/25 & 2/22/25), 2 lovebirds (2/1/25 &\n2/10/25), and 3 cockatiels (2/2/25, 2/2/25 & 2/23/25). In addition, 1\u20149 year old fallow deer died on 1/20/25 while under\nveterinary care and 1\u20147 year old alpaca was euthanized on 1/29/25 while under veterinary care. The primary common\nnecropsy report findings for the 2 chickens that died on 1/16/25, the fallow deer that died on 1/16/25, the fallow deer that\ndied on 1/20/25, and the alpaca that was euthanized on 1/29/25 were severe loss of body fat from negative energy\nbalance. In addition, the pathology report for the fallow deer that died on 1/16/25 described severe dental disease. The\ncause of death for the cockatiel that died on 2/23/25 was proposed by staff to be injury or old age. The cause of death of\nthe remaining 10 animals was unexplained.\nThe health and well-being of 16 animals over an approximately 3-month period was adversely impacted by inadequate\ndaily observations and communication with the attending veterinarian. Even the two animals that died under veterinary\ncare had clearly not been consuming adequate nutrients for a significant length of time. The two chickens that died in\nFebruary were observed to be ill and were separated, but the attending veterinarian was not contacted. The remaining 12\nanimals that died were reported as dead with no reported observations of the animal being ill. This indicates there is not a\nrobust program in place to identify animal health, husbandry, and/or facility problems and prevent unnecessary and\nunattended deaths.\nThe facility must establish and maintain a program of veterinary care that includes daily observation of all animals to\nassess their health and well-being. Further, there must be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the\nattending veterinarian, so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being is conveyed to\nthe attending veterinarian."
