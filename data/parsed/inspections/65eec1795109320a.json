The\nlicensee must assess all perimeter fences at the facility for adequate height and structural integrity and modify the existing\nfence(s) or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 8 feet in height. The perimeter fence(s) must be a\nminimum of three feet from the primary enclosures and constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by\nrestricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the\nanimals in the facility.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 30, 2022.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd Section"
