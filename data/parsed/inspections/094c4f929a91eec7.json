During the inspection, APHIS officials witnessed a sheepshead fish biting\na wound measuring ~3\u201d by 4\u201d on the right side of Betsy, causing bleeding from the wound and causing her to flinch. This\nfish continued to swim around Betsy and pick at the wound. Both Betsy and Ariel were seen with multiple lesions on their\nsides and top side of their tails. Betsy\u2019s wounds consist of two roughly circular areas on the left flank, one measuring ~5-\n6\u201d in diameter, and one located more towards the head measuring 2-3\u201d in diameter; one ovular area on the right flank\nmeasuring ~3\u201d by 4\u201d; one circular area on the right middle side measuring ~2\u201d in diameter; and one irregular area on the\ntail measuring ~7x10\u201d. Ariel\u2019s wounds consist of one kidney bean shaped area on the left flank measuring ~2\u201d by 4\u201d; two\nareas on the right flank, one measuring ~2\u201d by 5\u201d, and one located more towards the head measuring ~2\u201d in diameter; and\nthree irregularly shaped areas on the tail, one measuring ~5\u201d by 7\u201d, and two measuring ~3-5\u201d. These lesions are indented\nwith skin missing and are white in color with spots of red due to blood. The wounds on Ariel\u2019s and Betsy\u2019s tails are also\nsurrounded by excessive and thickened white to grey tissue, ranging in size from 1-3\u201d in width, and approximately 1-2\u201d in\nheight. According to records and animal care staff, Heinz also has wounds from fish bites. The records also indicate that\nthe manatees are showing behaviors such as eating in different places and holding their tails out of the water in order to\navoid the fish. According to the manatee veterinarian, the wounds have been unable to heal due to continued biting from\nthe sheepshead fish. The manatee veterinarian further commented that the cool water (74F) is impeding wound healing.\nApproximately two weeks ago (end of May, 2025), the facility added 1\u201d x 1\u201d mesh at the perimeter fencing below the\nbridge to help exclude the sheepshead fish; facility staff also translocated approximately 5 of the sheepshead fish to an\narea away from the manatees. Roughly 10 sheepshead fish remain present and trapped in the primary enclosure housing\nthe manatees. Animal care staff and the manatee veterinarian report that the mesh and primary enclosure fencing do not\nexclude smaller pinfish, which have been seen biting the thickened tissue around the open wounds.\nAllowing unwanted animals access to animal enclosures can lead to pain, discomfort, and ongoing injury.
