During the cleaning of the bear enclosure, the gate leading to the\nsecondary containment area was left open. As the caretaker was hosing down the bear enclosure, a member of the\npublic entered the area and reached her hand into the bear enclosure to pet it. The bear reacted by grabbing her\narm and possibly biting. The patron sustained non-life threatening injuries. The bear was un-harmed.\nLeaving the barrier / perimeter fence gate open during public exhibition allowed a member of the public to come in\ndirect contact with the Himalayan bear resulting in an injury. The integrity of a barrier / perimeter fence must be\nmaintained to prevent the public from coming in direct contact with the bear. Standard operating procedures for the\nsecuring of gates and entry into the secondary containment area for the Himalayan bear enclosure must be\nmodified and followed for the safety of the bear and the public. Correct immediately.\nThis is a focused inspection. The exit briefing was conducted with the owners."
