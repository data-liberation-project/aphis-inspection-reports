Her three 3 week old puppies (Id#s 22-030, 031, 032 ) were crying with outstretched necks and moved to be\nclose to the water bowl that had just had cold water poured into it.\nA Yorkshire Terrier female (Chloe, m/c#900001898042818) and her 5 puppies (DOB 7/9/22, Id3s 22-025, 026, 027, 028,\n029) were panting excessively and curling close to the water bowl that had just been filled with cold water.\nThe temperature outdoors was 98 degrees F and the air conditioner was not functioning and the fans were inadequate to\ndecrease the temperature inside the building.\nUnrelieved heat stress can lead to dehydration. Puppies are unable to thermoregulate which makes them more\nsusceptible to the hazardous effects of heat and humidity. The dams did not allow the puppies near them so they could\nnot nurse and this can add to dehydration and unmet nutritional needs.\nWhen climatic conditions present a threat to animal health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate\nthe impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity and time\nthat is detrimental to the animal\u2019s health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal\u2019s age, species,\nbreed, overall health status and acclimation.\nThese animals must be provided with an environment that is more suitable for their health and well-being and this must be\nmaintained.\nTo be corrected by close of business this day (8 August 2022)\nNote: The dogs were placed in an air conditioned room in the house while a new air conditioner unit was being\npurchased.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
