      "narrative": "One adult white female poodle (microchip number 5242) had injury of the left front leg. The dog was not fully bearing\nweight on its front left leg while standing and walking. The foot of the dog was twisted outward when in a standing or\nsitting position. When gently manipulated by inspectors, the foot was not stable and moved independently of the rest of\nthe leg. Also, a \u201ccrunching\u201d and \u201cpopping\u201d was felt when the foot was gently manipulated. The licensee told the inspectors\nthat the animal had been licking the leg and foot since the time of injury. The dog had licked the area to the point that\nthere was no hair present. The licensee informed inspectors that the injury was due to a fight that took place on 11-April-\n2023 (14 days ago). The licensee stated he moved the dog to another kennel at the time of injury and began treatment\nwith penicillin. As of the time of inspection, the licensee had not consulted the attending veterinarian about this dog and\nher injuries.\nFailure to adequately treat injuries once they are observed can lead to increased pain, prolonged suffering, and furthering\nof injuries in the animals. Lameness is a significant indicator of pain and limb instability with \u201ccrunching\u201d on palpation can\nbe a sign of orthopedic problems such as trauma and fracture. Failure to provide appropriate methods to properly\ndiagnose and treat the underlying cause of orthopedic problems in a timely manner may result in unnecessary pain and\nsuffering.\nOne adult white female Bichon (microchip number 7072) had an open wound on the left side of the neck that required\nveterinary care. This round, inflamed lesion with moist and pink exposed tissue was approximately one and a half inches\nin diameter and was observed on the left side of the neck. In addition, the wound was surrounded by brown and yellow\ncrusts and pink fluid was observed draining from the wound area. At the time of inspection, the licensee had not noticed\nthe wound and had not consulted the attending veterinarian. An untreated open wound can lead to further medical\ncomplications, unnecessary pain, and distress for the animal. Failure to communicate with the attending veterinarian\ncould result in improper care for the animals.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals showing signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a timely manner\nby a veterinarian as part of the facility\u2019s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility uses appropriate\nmethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries. The outcome of this consultation including the\ndiagnosis, treatment plan and how the condition will be resolved must be documented and provided to the inspector upon\nrequest. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care. The animals listed here must be seen\nby a veterinarian by 5:00pm on 25-April-2023."
