      "narrative": "A gray standard female chinchilla, Z-6632, had an abnormal 1 inch diameter mass with an open lesion on the\nunderside of her neck. Upon further examination, a portion of the animal\u2019s collar was embedded in the neck. The\nskin around the affected area was covered in a thick yellow/green discharge and crust. In addition, there was a\npungent odor present as the collar was being removed.\nA beige female baby chinchilla from RN2715 had hair loss and reddened skin on the right side of her face.\nA gray standard female baby chinchilla from RN2745 had hair loss, reddened skin, and white crusts over the left\nside of her nose.\nThe right eye of a gray standard female baby chinchilla from RN2704 was crusted shut. Upon the licensee opening\nthe eye, a small amount of white pus-like material could be observed as well as the green crust that had been\nkeeping the eye shut.\nA grey standard male baby chinchilla from MV153 had several areas of affected skin. An area approximately 1 inch\nin diameter on the top of the neck and an area on the back side of the left rear leg had hair loss, reddened skin, and\nwhite crusts. Hair loss, brownish crusts, and reddened skin was observed above the right eye and below the left\neye. Between the eyes the skin was reddened with an active lesion and hair loss.\nAn ebony male chinchilla, MW19, had hair loss around both eyes and around his nose. The skin around the nose\nwas reddened and there was an active lesion on the left side of his nose.\nA gray standard chinchilla, M535, had a green/yellow discharge surrounding both eyes that was wetting the fur.\nAll of the health issues identified above are significantly impacting animal health and well being. Daily observation of\nthese animals is not effective. Thus, health issues are not identified within a timely manner. It is the licensees\nresponsibility that daily observations are completed appropriately and effectively. Additionally, there must be a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure all health issues are\naddressed within a timely manner, to include the animals identified above."
