A metal section of the\nfloor near the south side of the enclosure has been damaged by the animal with a resulting hole approximately 6\ninches in diameter. The rough edges of the hole have been pulled into the enclosure. Continued damage to the floor\ncan contribute to possible escape and/or injury to the animal.\n*The metal shelter used to protect the sheep and goats from inclement weather is deteriorated and dilapidated.\nThis shelter is in such a state of disrepair that it does not appear safe for animal access because of the risk of injury\nto animals. The shelter appears structurally unsound with sagging sides and roof and has a deteriorated back wall\nwith a resulting large hole.\n* The primary enclosures housing the sheep and goats and guanacos and deer has a shared chain link fence that is\ndamaged. The damaged section of fence, located at the east side of the enclosures next to the sheep and goat\nshelter, is partially collapsed.\nHousing facilities must be kept in good repair in order to safely contain the animals and prevent injury. The\ndamaged areas described above should be repaired or replaced.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
