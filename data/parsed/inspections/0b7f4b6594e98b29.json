Worn and frayed carpeting poses a risk of potential foreign body ingestion to the animal. Elevated, small\nround perches or elevated circular metal wires are not appropriate materials for this species to climb onto and could\ncause animal injury. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to\nprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nCorrect by 11/25/2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
