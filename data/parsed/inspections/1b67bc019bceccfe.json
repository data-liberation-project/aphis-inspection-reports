The current plan has not been evaluated and updated with the current AV under contact for this facility. \n \nNot producing and following an adequate PEEP under the direction of the AV can put the nonhuman primates (NHPs) at\n\nthe facility at risk of injury or lack of adequate enrichment.  \n \nThe regulations state that exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment \nenhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance \nwith the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and \nas directed by the attending veterinarian. The plan, at a minimum, must address each of the following: a. social grouping, \nb. environmental enrichment, c. special considerations, d. restraint devices and e. exemptions. Correct by 29Feb2024. \n3.85 \n   \nEmployees. \nBased on the details included in additional citations regarding the nonhuman primates (NHPs) in this report (2.40b3, \n2.131c1, 3.81), the facility had not maintained adequate staffing to meet the professional requirements of the AWA \nregarding NHPs. Specific examples of inadequate staffing include: not having an updated and complete PEEP that is \nactively followed by the facility, the death of a lemur with no follow-up for cause and impact, and the injury to a patron by a \nlemur.  \n \nNot having adequate staffing puts the health and well-being of the lemurs and capuchin at risk of disease, injury and/or \ndeath.  \n \nThe regulations state that every person subject to the Animal Welfare Act maintaining nonhuman primates must have \nenough employees to carry out the level of husbandry practices and care required in this subpart. The employees who \nprovide husbandry practices and care, or handle nonhuman primates, must be trained and supervised by an individual \nwho has the knowledge, background, and experience in proper husbandry and care of nonhuman primates to supervise \nothers. The employer must be certain that the supervisor can perform to these standards. Correct by 29Feb2024. \n3.125(a)  Repeat\n   \nFacilities, general. \nThe enclosure housing 4 goats had an area about 1.5\u2018-wide where the bottom of the chain link fence was bowed into the \nenclosure and appeared to have been pushed in by an outside animal/animals. There were loose personal dogs, pigs, \nponies, emus, alpacas and a llama in the playground area outside the goat enclosure (but within the perimeter fence) \nduring this inspection.  \n \nNot having secure enclosures puts the goats at risk of injury or escape due to this gap in the fence.  \n \nThe regulations state that the facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the \nanimals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good \nrepair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. \n3.131(a)  Repeat\n   \nSanitation.\n\nThe kinkajou enclosure located inside the primary residence contained excessive amounts of food debris and feces; most \nof the lower \u00bc of the cage was coated in grime and needed cleaning.  \n \nNot maintaining adequate levels of sanitation can pose disease risks for the animals and the people in the household.  \n \nThe regulations state that excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent \ncontamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. \n3.131(c) \n   \nSanitation. \nThe lower pool in the otter enclosure was empty but contained a mop, a skimmer net, a squeegee, scrub brushes and \nother cleaning implements. \n \nLeaving pool cleaning equipment in an area occupied by otters puts the otters at risk of entrapment injury, ingestion of \nforeign material, and potential exposure to chemicals.  \n \nThe regulations state that premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the \nanimals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Correct by 17Feb2024. \n3.132 \n   \nEmployees. \nBased on the additional citations regarding the mammals in this report (2.40b3, 3.125a, 3.131a, 3.131c), the facility had \nnot maintained adequate staffing to meet the standards and requirements of the AWA. Specific examples of inadequate \nstaffing impacts include: Buddy the Cavy's attack weeks prior to receiving veternary care, Archie the Cavy's severe eye \ninfection, the Bison's upper respiratory infection and subsequent death, infant wallaby not defecating for 5 days before \nveterinary evaluation and likely having aspiration pneumonia from force-feeding, and leaving the pool-cleaning equipmnet \nin the enclosure with the otters.  \n \nNot having adequate staffing puts the health and well-being of the mammals in the facility at risk of injury, poor health and \ndeath, each of which has occurred between 01January2023 and 15Feb2024. \n \nThe regulations state that a sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the \nprofessionally acceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices shall be under a supervisor \nwho has a background in animal care. Correct by 29Feb2024. \n3.152(b) \n   \nFacilities, outdoor \nOne turkey was contained in an open area that provided no shelter or cover to allow the animal seek protection from rain, \nwinds, and inclement weather. Significant rains had occurred the night prior to the inspection and strong gusty winds were \nblowing during the inspection.\n\nNot providing adequate shelter from rain, winter winds and inclement weather can have serious negative impacts on the \nhealth of the turkey due to exposure.  \n \nThe regulations state that outdoor housing facilities must provide adequate shelter, appropriate to the species and \nphysical condition of the birds, for the local climatic conditions to protect the birds from any adverse weather conditions. \nCorrect by 17Feb2024. \n3.153(b) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nThe sun conure was housed in a horizontal guinea pig enclosure. The bird was restricted from flying and conducting other \nnormal bird behaviors due to the vertical limitations of the enclosure.  \n \nNot providing adequate space for flying and climbing can have negative impacts on the bird\u2019s well-being and health.  \n \nThe regulations state that primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so as to allow each bird to make \nnormal postural and social adjustments, such as dust-bathing and foraging, with adequate freedom of movement and \nfreedom to escape from aggression demonstrated by other animals. Correct by 17Feb2024. \n3.154 \n   \nEnvironment enhancement to promote psychological well-being. \nThe Bird Environmental Enrichment Program (BEEP) was incomplete and not detailed enough to meet the required \ncategories in the regulations. There was no description of enrichment for the different species groups, no details regarding \nsocial grouping needs for the species held (compatability of 2 macaws and 1 sun conure with contact to each other; single \nhousing of 1 nanday conure and of 1 cockatoo), and no special considerations are documented for the 2 known feather-\nplucking birds (macaw and cockatoo). The AV had reviewed the initial brief document prepared by the facility and had \nrequested additional details and information, which had not been provided to the AV at the time of this inspection.  \n \nNot developing and following an appropriate BEEP can put the health and welfare of the birds at risk.  \n \nThe regulations state that exhibitors must develop, document, and follow a species-appropriate plan for environment \nenhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of birds. The plan must be approved by the attending \nveterinarian and must be in accordance with the regulations in this subpart and with currently accepted professional \nstandards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides. The plan, at a minimum, must address each \nof the following: a. social grouping. b. environmental enrichment. c. special considerations. c. Restraint devices and e. \nexemptions. Correct by 29Feb2024. \n3.158(a)(1) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.\n\nThe shelter structure in the sun conure\u2019s enclosure and the floor in front of the enclosure were splashed with feces from \nthe macaws loose in the room.  \n \nNot maintaining adequate levels of sanitation and protecting the conure from the macaw feces presents a disease and \npest risk.  \n \nThe regulations state that excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures and from under and around \nprimary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling \nof the birds contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. Correct by \n17Feb2024. \n3.159 \n   \nEmployees \nBased on the additional citations regarding the facility\u2019s birds in this report (2.40b3, 3.52b, 3.53b, 3.154), the facility did \nnot maintain adequate staffing to meet the requirements of the AWA. Specific impacts of inadequate staffing include the \nincomplete BEEP, not addressing the needs of the singly housed birds and the feather-plucking birds, and not providing \nadequate shelter for the turkey. \n \nNot having adequate staffing puts the health and well-being of the birds in the facility at risk.  \n \nThe regulations state that a sufficient number of adequately trained employees or attendants must be utilized to maintain \nthe professionally acceptable level of husbandry and handling practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices must be \nconducted under the supervision of a bird caretaker who has appropriate experience in the husbandry and care of birds \nthat are being managed in a given setting.
