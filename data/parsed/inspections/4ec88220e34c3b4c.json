Although the handler was experienced, and this procedure had been carried out\npreviously without incident, upon removing the bats from the enclosure it was discovered that four had perished,\npresumably from the group having crowded into a corner.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\nharm to the animals. The facility self-reported this incident, and immediately took steps to prevent a recurrence,\nincluding reducing the number of bats to be placed in the transport enclosure, and additional supervision at the time\nof weighing. This incident was initially investigated at the time of the last (3/23/16) routine inspection, but additional\npathology reports were still pending at that time.\nCorrected prior to inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
