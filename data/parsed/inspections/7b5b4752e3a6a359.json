Per the licensee, the emu had been placed into this\nenclosure along with two other emus in order to separate them from their cohorts due to compatibility issues. The wire\nfencing of this outdoor primary enclosure was made of wire mesh with spacing between the wires measuring\napproximately 4 by 4 inches and 5 feet high for about 80 percent the enclosure. A section of the fence facing the\nneighboring property instead had six high tensile strung single wires (each strand approximately 12 inches apart) for a\nheight of about 6 feet. Per the licensee, the emu got its leg tangled in two of these single stranded wires and died from its\ninjuries shortly thereafter. Additionally, on this inspection, partially unrolled chicken wire was found lying within the emus\u2019\nprimary outdoor enclosure, located within the sheltered structure lying on its side by the storage receptacles, possibly\nallowing for entanglement and/or injury. Failure to provide a safe primary enclosure can result in injury and/or death of the\nbirds. Housing facilities for birds shall be designed and constructed for birds housed in them and shall be kept in good\nrepair and protect the birds from injury.\nCorrect by: FEBRUARY 21, 2024."
