      "narrative": "Appropriate methods had not been used to treat three sick and/or injured pigs observed at the facility. An expired\ninjectable antibiotic had been used to treat two of the pigs (#88928 and #88925) prior to the inspection. The\nexpiration date on the label of a bottle of injectable corticosteroid that was also used to treat the pigs had been\ncovered by a veterinary label making it impossible to determine the expiration date on this bottle. According to an\nemployee, treatment had been completed and the lameness exhibited by pig #88928 had not improved. An\nemployee also stated that pain medications had never been given to the lame pig.\nA third pig (#90933) was found recumbent by facility employees at approximately 8:30 the morning of the inspection\nand was recumbent and vocalizing at the time of the inspection. Several scratches were apparent on the\nhindquarters and a substantial amount of fecal material was also adhered to the animal's skin. According to an\nemployee the attending veterinarian had been called after the animal was found but had not called back regarding\ntreatment as of approximately 11:00 hours. The animal was isolated but had received no treatment. There were no\ntreatment records for any of the animals nor was there any record the attending veterinarian had been contacted for\nany of the three animals. All three pigs were found in concrete stalls with no bedding.\nExpired medications may not be effective and should not be used on regulated animals. Documentation of\ncommunications with the veterinarian and animal treatments facilitates ongoing animal care and demonstrates that\nthe animals are receiving appropriate treatment of injuries and diseases. Housing seriously sick or injured animals\non bare concrete may exacerbate their condition and thus the pain and distress felt by those animals. The facility\nshould ensure that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.\nCorrect by 17:00 hours for the above animals and from this time forward for all other veterinary care issues."
