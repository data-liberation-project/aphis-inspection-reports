In the trench, spanning the length between the two biscuit feeding platforms and beyond, a large\namount of disintegrated primate biscuits mixed in with leftover enrichment items was accumulating. A thick layer of\ngreyish white mold-like material was seen covering the food waste creating a uniform mass.\n- Other enclosures similarly had a large amount of food waste accumulating in the trenches around the perimeter. In one\ncompound in particular, the waste accumulation was preventing the drainage of standing rainwater from the previous day.\nDuring this inspection, numerous flies were seen over the accumulation of food waste. Primates were also seen\ninteracting and sitting on the accumulated waste. According to the husbandry staff, the food waste was last removed\nduring the previous cleaning approximately 3 to 4 weeks ago. The accumulation of old food provides an area for pest\nreproduction which can cause irritations to the nonhuman primates. Furthermore, the nonhuman primates may come into\ncontact with or possibly consume the moldy food. Housing facilities must provide for regular and frequent collection,\nremoval and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, debris, garbage, water and any other fluids and\nwastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risk.
