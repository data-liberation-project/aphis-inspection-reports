      "narrative": "A male rabbit was found to have a fractured humerus on May 5, 2015. The rabbit had been taken out of his cage on\nMay 4, 2015 and weighed for a procedure the next day. The next morning the rabbit was taken out for surgery,\nthere was no abnormal movement or behavior noted at that time. The rabbit underwent anesthesia for a procedure\nand while anesthetized he was found to have a fractured humerus. The rabbit was euthanized while under\nanesthesia. An investigation was performed but it was inconclusive as to the cause of the fracture. The caretakers\nhad not noted any abnormalities while handling the rabbit and no procedures had previously been performed on the\nrabbit. The review indicated that staff considered the rabbit to be highly excitable and would become agitated when\nsomeone approached the cage. The staff also indicated they heard the rabbit running around his cage and a loud\nbanging noise after the rabbit was returned to its cage, but there was no observation made at that time to see if\nthere was any injury. The staff also failed to observe the fracture when the rabbit was handled the next morning in\npreparation for a procedure. Although the cause of the fracture was not determined, the information provided\nindicates this rabbit may have injured itself after being returned to its enclosure as evident by the loud banging\nnoise.\nAll animals shall be handled in a manner that will minimize distress and protect them from injury.\nThe corrective and preventive measures instituted after the incident appear to be appropriate.\nExit briefing conducted with the Institutional Official and other facility representatives on 9/24/2015. The report\ndelivered on 9/29/2015 via email."
