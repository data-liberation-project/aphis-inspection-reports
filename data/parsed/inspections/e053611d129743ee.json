The attending\nveterinarian visually examined Caesar and indicated that additional diagnostic information could be obtained if\nCaesar were to be sedated for a more thorough exam. Records indicated that the board of directors did not want\nCaesar to be sedated. Caesar was subsequently administered therapeutic treatment prescribed by the attending\nveterinarian on July 7, 2016, and continued to be monitored. Caesar was found dead on July 13, 2016.\nThe records suggested the attending veterinarian did not have appropriate authority to ensure the provision of\nadequate veterinary care in this situation. The licensee must ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate\nauthority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care.\nThe facility has updated relevant animal and veterinary care policies affirming the authority of the attending\nveterinarian.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
