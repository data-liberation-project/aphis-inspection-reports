Upon further examination, there was a circular area of hair loss with\nreddened skin on the backside of the left hind leg, and the skin on the top of her vulva was swollen and reddened as well.\nWhen the inspectors asked the licensee to remove her from her enclosure and place her on the floor to prompt her to\nmove, she was very reluctant and only moved for a few steps before she sat down in the same awkward position and\nbegan licking those areas. When the licensee was asked about this dog's disposition, he stated no issues have been\npreviously identified with her, but she was always \"a sitter.\" He also identified previous animals of her lineage as having\nsimilar issues, but did not communicate with the veterinarian about these previous issues. A lack of daily observation in\nconjunction with the lack of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian prolongs pain and\ndiscomfort by not allowing health problems to be addressed in a timely manner. Ensure daily observations of any\nabnormal behaviors or issues have been identified and communicated with your attending veterinarian within a timely\nmanner. Corrected at the time of the exit interview. This animal has an appointment with the attending veterinarian\ntomorrow morning.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nSHANNON SEBERA, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOREnd Section"
