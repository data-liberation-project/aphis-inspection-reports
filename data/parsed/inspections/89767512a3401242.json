The overall height of\nthis fence measures 7'4\". Non-rigid fencing-like-material has been added to each of the two front corners of this\nenclosure to widen the kick-in. In an adjacent enclsoure, there is a tree that overhangs and touches its fence. This\nenclosure also houses cheetahs.\nIt does not appear the height of the enclosure or the material used to widen the corner kick-ins is appropriate for the\nanimals involved. In addition, the presence of overhanging trees may provide a means for animals to escape.\nEnclosures housing potentially dangerous animals must be constructed of such material and of such strength as\nappropriate for the animals involved. Trees growing near enclosure edges should be cut back or removed to\nminimize the risk of an animal escaping. A system should be in place to ensure housing facilities are structurally\nsound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.\nTo be corrected by December 15, 2015\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.\nAccompanied on inspection by Dr. Tyler Fields, Veterinary Medical Officer\nAdditional Inspectors\nFields Tyler, Veterinary Medical Officer"
