      "narrative": "During the inspection, the steer, Horney Freckles, was in need of veterinary attention. He was reluctant to stand or\nwalk and when he did walk, he moved very slowly with a stiff gait. The left front foot was dropping in the rear and\nthe hooves were slightly overgrown. The steer had hair loss and redden skin on the right rear flank (4 inches in\ndiameter) and dewlap (6-8 inches in diameter). His legs and abdomen were covered in feces and urine and this is\nwhat he was laying in. The facility failed to observe that this animal was in need of veterinary attention. A facility\nrepresentative stated that the attending veterinarian is scheduled to come out on Tuesday, 10/10/17 to exam the\nanimal and to trim the slightly overgrown hooves. There is currently no paperwork showing that the attending\nveterinarian had examined this animal in the past year and the facility was unable to provide any documentation\nindicating that the attending veterinarian was notified about the current condition of the animal.\nDaily observation of the facility animal is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and\nwell-being are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or\nbehavior must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure\nadequate care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and\nsuffering and the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate\ndaily observations of their animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner\nand appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.\nDate to be Corrected: October 7, 2017\nAdditional Inspectors\nBolinger Jean, Compliance Specialist"
