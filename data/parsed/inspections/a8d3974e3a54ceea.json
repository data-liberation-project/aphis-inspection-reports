No other\ncubicles were affected. This condition may be emanating from either the grout, glass door seals, or some other\nsurface(s) that is not impervious to these secretions in this particular cubicle.\nProlong exposure to this irritating odor can increase the risk of respiratory infections and irritations of the respiratory\ntract, and causes discomfort to the cats in this area and does not provide for their health and well-being.\nThe cats shall be provided with an enclosure that minimizes odors.\nCorrect by July 18, 2014\nThe exit interview was conducted with the Interim Director"
