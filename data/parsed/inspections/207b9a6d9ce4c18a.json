Closer observation of this animal revealed a large, hard, dried clump of feces tightly\nattached to the hair on the underside of the base of the tail and covering the anus. There are also numerous\nsmaller clumps of feces matted within the hair surrounding the dog(cid:25)s anus. Feces that have become trapped in the\ndog(cid:25)s hair coat can cause pain or discomfort and could lead to further health issues for the dog. The licensee must\nremove all the feces from this dog(cid:25)s hair coat. The licensee must develop an effective plan for hair coat\nmaintenance to ensure that feces will not become entrapped within the hair coat of any of the dogs.\nCorrection date: End of business on December 09, 2015\nExit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
