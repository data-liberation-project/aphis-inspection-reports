The pigs are Yucatan so there is additional skin care provided. The oils applied twice a week add to\nthe floor being slippery. I observed two of the pigs feet slide a little while walking, they appeared hesitant in their\nmovement. The surface of the flooring does not allow for the pigs feet to get a grip while walking which can result in\ninjury. In addition, the platforms were observed bending under the pig's feet which also interfered with the pig's\nability to ambulate properly. Records indicate that this problem was identified in July 2015, but it has not yet been\ncorrected.\nAppropriate housing conditions shall be provided for the species housed in the enclosure.\nThe transport cage used to transport the pigs to the main center is broken on the bottom left corner. The plastic has\nleft cracks large enough to easily allow an animals leg to break through which may cause injury. The crate shall be\nremoved or replaced to prevent injury.\nCorrect by October 31, 2015.\nExit briefing conducted with the Director of Veterinary Services, DLAS, and other facility representatives."
