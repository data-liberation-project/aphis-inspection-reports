      "narrative": "The licensee interfered with the inspection process by providing false statements and false documentation to the\ninspector during the inspection.\nOn 5/31/2017 the inspector competed a routine inspection at the facility. At that time of inspection, the inspector\nwas notified by the Licensee that three Canadian Lynx had died since the last inspection. According to the licensee,\n\u201cwild dogs\u201d had penetrating the perimeter fence and fought with the Lynx fencing of the primary enclosure killing all\n3 lynx. During the inspection, the licensee was asked about the events repeatedly and in significant detail without\nchanging this story. When the inspector went back to the facility on 6/2/2017 to complete an exit interview the\nLicensee stated that the details provided on 5/31/2017 were incorrect and that the three Lynx were killed by his\npersonal dog (details below). He stated that he was upset by the incident and didn\u2019t want to admit that it had been\nhis personal dog. There were no disposition records present at the facility for these deaths.\nIn addition, on 5/31/2017 an APHIS 7020 Animal Disposition form was present at the facility for two female Lynx\nshowing that they were donated to a non-USDA licensed individual in Indiana on October 18, 2016 and/or\nNovember 17, 2016 (there were two dates on this document). The Licensee did not have any acquisition\ndocumentation for these animals. When the licensee was asked about these animals, he provided the breeders\nname and USDA License number that he supposedly obtained the animals from verbally. In addition, he stated that\nthey animals had been acquired one day prior to transferring them to the Indian facility. There were no written\nanimal acquisition records for these animals. When the inspector returned on 6/2/2017, the licensee stated that the\nacquisition and disposition information he had provided on 5/31 for these animals was incorrect. He had now stated\nthat he had never seen or taken possession of the animals listed on the APHIS Form 7020. He stated that he had\nfalsely created these documents for the facility in Indiana. He stated that he created these documents with hopes of\neventually obtaining them from the Indian individual. The licensee stated that he thought that this would allow him\nto replace two out of the three lynx that were killed in December before anyone had realized that the three Lynx\nwere no longer at the facility. However; he was not able to obtain these animals and has not heard anything further\nabout these animals.\nProviding complete and accurate information is essential to the inspection process. Making false or fraudulent\nstatements and/or providing false documents to USDA Officials interferes with the inspection process and may\nprevent officials from determining compliance with the AWA. Although the licensee eventually provided an account\nof events that appears reasonable, this was only after repeated questioning. Ensure that for all future inspections,\nall statements made to APHIS Officials and documentation provided are accurate.\nCorrect By: Providing correct and accurate information, both written and orally, to APHIS officials from this day\nforward."

      "narrative": "On 6/2/2017, the inspector was informed by the Licensee that the three Canadian Lynx died after being attacked by\na personal dog. He stated on or around December 14-16 of 2016 he returned home about midnight to find that\n\u201cRay\u201d, a male Irish Wolf Hound, had not come to greet him as usual. When he went looking for Ray, he found he\nwas inside the Lynx enclosure. Ray had gotten through the perimeter fence and into the Lynx enclosure. He stated\nthat the lock was still on the primary enclosure door, however, the door was pushed inward at the hinge. He\nspeculated that the hinge of the door must have been worn or rusted allowing it to turn or pushed inward, which in\nturn provided the dog access into the enclosure. The licensee stated that when he discovered this incident, Ray\nwas lying next to one of the Lynx bodies with one paw/leg over the body and tugging on the scruff portion of the\nLynx back/shoulder area with his mouth. That Lynx and both others were already dead.\nBased on the statements made by the licensee, it appears that the primary enclosure was not structurally sound or\nmaintained in a manner to protect the lynx from injury or in this instance being killed. Failure to construct\nenclosures with sufficient structural strength and maintain them in good working condition can result in animal\nescape, injury or as in this case the entrance of predators. All primary enclosures must be constructed of such\nmaterial and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. In addition the enclosure shall be maintained\nin a manor to protect the animals from injury and/or death. The licensee must ensure that this enclosure and all\nothers are constructed in a manner that it can be properly secured and protect the animals contained therein from\ninjury and or death.\nCorrect By: Prior to housing any future animals within this enclosure and not later than 6/9/17."
