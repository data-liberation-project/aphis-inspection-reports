The\ncavy enclosure has chain link fencing underneath the enclosure to prevent escape from digging; however, there are\ntwo holes (approximately 1 foot in diameter) underneath the enclosure in which the cavies(cid:25) feet could easily pass\nthrough the chain link fencing. Feet or legs can become injured if an animal becomes entangled in the chain link\nfencing. Mulch was placed to fill in the hole underneath the fencing at the time of exit. The issue was corrected at\ntime of exit.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee."
