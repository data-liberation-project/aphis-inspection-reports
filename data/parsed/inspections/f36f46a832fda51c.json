A Kestrel thermometer reading in the shade inside a typical\nenclosure was 105 degrees F.\nMeasures should be undertaken to prevent overheating, and ensure the comfort of the animals. Measures could\ninclude, but are not limited to, increased ventilation, fans, misters, pools, and/or frozen treats. Severely hot weather\ncan cause discomfort and threaten the health of the animals.\nTo be corrected immediately.\nAn exit interview was conducted with the animal exhibitor.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGage Laurie, Big Cat Specialist"
