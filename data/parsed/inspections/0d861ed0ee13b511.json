Rabbit B404 was\nobserved by the inspector on 15 AUG 16 to have an approximately 1.5 in L x \u00be in W elliptical dermal wound on the\nleft shoulder. The wound had a dry scaly yellow central surface with pink to red thickened edges. A piece of black\nsuture like material was noted along the top edge of the wound. There was no evidence that any observation of this\nwound had been made. The post-operative record for rabbit B404 located in the room did not have any\nobservations documented on the form as of 8/5/16 through 8/15/16 at the time of inspection. There had been no\ncommunication of the rabbit\u2019s clinical condition to the veterinarian.\nRabbits B407, B111, B112 and B422 also underwent a surgical procedure the week of 8/4/2016 as per IACUC\napproved protocol and no observations had been performed and documented on the post-operative record for these\nanimals.\nDaily observations of all animals needs to be performed to assess their health and well-being. Communication of\nthese observations need to be made in a timely manner to the veterinarian to ensure proper care is provided.\nAs of 8/16/16 the wound had been diagnosed by research personnel as a surgical incision dehiscence and had\nbeen surgically corrected before the end of the inspection.\nRecommend the facility evaluate the current procedures on post-surgical monitoring and communication with the\nattending veterinarian as of the end of the USDA inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nThe inspectors completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information\nmanagement system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was\ndeployed, the \u201cprepared by\u201d date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the\noriginal inspection report, which occurred on 17 August 2016.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLopinto John, Veterinary Medical Officer"
