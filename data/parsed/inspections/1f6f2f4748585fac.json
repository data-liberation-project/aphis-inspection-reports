At the time of the inspection the cooling system had a mechanical failure and was in the process of\nbeing repaired. Excess odors could cause discomfort and health problems for the sugar gliders. Facilities shall\nprovide adequate ventilation for the health of the animals and to prevent discomfort in the animals. Adequate\nventilation is required to eliminate strong odors."
