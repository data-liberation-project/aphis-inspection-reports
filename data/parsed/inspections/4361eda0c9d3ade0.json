The three gorillas were in their outdoor exhibit space at this time.\nThe keeper secured the secondary containment doors and assessed that the gorillas were contained to their\nbuilding. By looking through the containment door window, keepers made the observation that the door leading from\nthe den to the keeper area/secondary containment was ajar and the lock was locked through the lock hole on the\nden. The keepers then made a code red radio announcement.\nIn the keeper area, where the gorilla\u2019s hay was discovered, there are many items stored related to the care of\ngorillas and maintenance of the exhibit such as enrichment items, trash cans, fans, etc. The emergency response\nteam was assembled. The team leader instructed the keepers to occupy the gorillas\u2019 attention with food and away\nfrom the entrance of the gorilla building. The facility was able to safely secure the den door lock and contain the\ngorillas without the use of chemical restraint or shooting/dart equipment.\nFollowing the incident, an investigation determined the gorillas got out of their dens as a result of keeper error. On\nthe evening of Thursday, April 20, 2017 the keeper who locked the gorilla dens put the lock in place but failed to\nlatch the lock which allowed the animals to open the den door. The locks on the den door are not in need of repair.\nAnimals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Though the\ngorillas remained within secondary containment, had they gained outside access it could have resulted in serious\nanimal or human injury. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained to protect and contain the\nanimals.\nCorrect by: This day forward.\nThis inspection took place May 16-17 with the general curator and various facility staff.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the general curator, attending veterinarian, and the director of husbandry."
