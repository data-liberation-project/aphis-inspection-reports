Pig #58450 was given a clinical score (CS) of 4. As\nper protocol and as stated in the email to the researchers, animal care staff reentered the room between 12:00 and 12:45\npm to administer treatments, where it was noted on the medical record that pig #58450 was experiencing cyanosis around\nthe snout and little interest in food, indicating a further decline in health. Per protocol and animal care standard operating\nprocedures, any animals experiencing a CS of 4 or more shall be reported to the attending veterinarian. The research\nfacility was unable to clearly demonstrate that their staff followed the protocol and animal care standard operating\nprocedures on whether the attending veterinarian was notified after the first and second observations of pig #58540. They\nwere also unable to clearly demonstrate when the notifications took place and if euthanasia was authorized by the\nattending veterinarian. After reviewing the incident report and speaking with facility researchers and animal care staff,\ninspectors found conflicting information on whether research staff had a reluctance for approved humane euthanasia of\nthe pig based on how they understood the protocol. The research facility was unable to demonstrate that their mechanism\nof direct and frequent communication required to relay timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,\nbehavior, and well-being was conveyed to the attending veterinarian. This resulted in a delay in the timely treatment\nand/or humane euthanasia of pig #58450 as outlined in the protocol. The research facility must establish and maintain a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,\nbehavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian to ensure that research studies involving animals will\navoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals.
