The licensee stated that he found her in her pen that way this morning (09/15),\nhe thinks she may have been attacked by the other dog(s) in the enclosure. He said that he put some ointment on it and\nmoved her to another enclosure. I asked if he had contacted or planned on contacting the attending veterinarian and he\nstated that he was just going to see how it would heal using the ointment that he had. Failure to have the issue addressed\nby the attending veterinarian can result in additional pain and discomfort to the animal as well as worsen the severity of\nthe injury. The animal must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and the prescribed treatment must be\nadministered.\nCorrect By: September 16, 2021\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
