The French Bulldogs both had sores on the sides of their abdomen about dime to nickel size that were dark\nred to brownish with some greenish to yellowish discharge. Many fleas were observed on both French Bulldogs. The\napplicant said that she is having a flea problem in the kennel and that many dogs had been having problems. She said\nshe was giving them Frontline, but it didn't seem to be helping. She said she had not contacted her veterinarian about\nthese dogs or the flea problem.\nSome dogs with fleas have allergic reactions that make them extremely itchy. If unrelieved, this scratching leads to hair\nloss, damage to the skin, infections, and sores that are a source of constant discomfort and even pain in advanced cases.\nFleas can also harbor tapeworms that can cause disease in dogs if ingested.\nAppropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, and diagnose diseases. Dogs with skin disease must be seen by\na veterinarian and a plan for eliminating fleas and preventing re-infestation must be documented and followed.\nTo be corrected by: 09/11/2021"
