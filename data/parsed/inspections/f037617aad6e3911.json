There were no other birds in the\nprimary enclosure, only the male and female Screech Owls. There were no bird carcasses found inside the enclosure,\nonly some feathers located beside a 1.5 x 2 inch gap under the wooden based/wire fence along the back of the primary\nenclosure where it appears the predator gained entry into the enclosure.\nWhile there is 2 x 2 inch wire fencing covering the entire dirt floor, there was nothing connecting the 1 x 2 inch side wire\nwith a wooden base to the floor wire. It appears the predator was able to dig under the wall and make a 1.5 x 2 inch gap\nbetween the base of the wall and floor wire and gain entry. There were no other gaps or holes anywhere else in the\nenclosure where a predator could have gained entry or exited with the owl carcasses or any tracks or other clues to\nidentify what predator came into the enclosure and killed the Screech Owls. The zoo has had problems with mink within\nthe past month and currently have been trying to remove them from the property and are now going to seek assistance\nfrom other sources. On October 26, 2024 all of the other birds housed outside in other enclosures in the zoo have been\nmoved inside to winter housing.\nThe lack of secure predator proof enclosures for bird species can cause possible stress to the animals by allowing\npredators to enter the primary enclosures to harass, injure or kill the regulated species.\nHousing facilities for birds must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of bird\nhoused in them. They must be kept in good repair, protect the birds from injury, and restrict other animals from entering\nthat may negatively affect the welfare of the birds within.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nn"
