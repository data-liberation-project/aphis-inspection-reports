Also, the outside edge of the left ear was noted to have an irregular shape and appeared scab-like.\nThe inside of the left ear appeared moist, reddened and inflamed. An abundant amount of a thick yellow\nmucous-like material was observed covering the inside of the ear flap extending down into the ear canal. The hair\naround the margins of the inside of the ear appeared matted with some of this discharge-type material which also\nhad a black tarry appearance along this region. At least two small (approximately \u00bd cm diameter) red circular\nsore-like lesions were noted on the inside of the edge of the ear flap. When asked to see the right ear of the dog,\nthe licensee attempted to show us but the dog growled and further attempts to visualize the ear were discontinued.\nThe licensee stated that (cid:28)Dude(cid:29) had been seen by a veterinarian in June for an ear infection. According to written\ndocumentation at the facility, the licensee treated the ear for 14 days and treatment was stopped on June 28, 2016.\nAccording to the licensee, she was unaware of the dog(cid:25)s current ear condition. This dog(cid:25)s current condition could\nindicate an ear infection which could be painful & could lead to additional health problems for the dog. The licensee\nmust have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made\nand an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and\nmake it available to the inspector upon request.
