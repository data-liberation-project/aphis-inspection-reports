Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to\nthe animals. All structures must be maintained and kept structurally sound. The affected structures must be\nrepaired and/or replaced. Corrected by the exit interview.\n** The primary enclosure housing 7 Patagonian cavies had a hole that went beneath the fence. The mouth of the\nhole was about 10-12 inches wide and about 4-6 inches tall. The hole poses a risk of escape to the animals. A\nsystem should be in place and maintained to ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to\ncontain the animals. Corrected by the exit interview.\n** The chain link fence for the primary enclosure containing a tiger named Magoo and another primary enclosure\ncontaining a tiger named Special had trees/cane that were growing along the fencing and beyond the kick-ins.\nThese two tigers are younger and could use the base of the trees to climb up and out of the enclosures. The fencing\nand tree cover around the fencing must be maintained to effectively contain the animals in their primary enclosures.\nThe affected structures must be repaired and/or replaced. All housing facilities should be maintained and kept\nstructurally sound to protect and contain the animals.\n** The guillotine door on the den for 4 bears had 2 pieces of metal protruding into the opening of the shelter. The\nmetal pieces could potentially cause injury to the animals. All structures must be maintained and kept structurally\nsound. The affected structures must be repaired and/or replaced.\n*** In the den for 4 bears there was a feeding tube that extended into the den directly above a food receptacle. The\nfeeding tube was broke so that the end directly above the food receptacle was jagged and could pose a risk of injury\nto the animals. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury. Corrected by the exit interview.\n.\n** The den roofs for the tigers, Magoo and Special, were made of plywood that was wrinkled on top and the layers\nof the plywood were separating. The tops of the plywood had a black powdery look. The plywood on both dens\ncould be pulled up about \u00bd inch. The floor of the den for the leopard, Namib, had plywood with a black powdery\nlook and the layers were separating. The floor would move a little when pressed against. The weakness of the\nplywood for the roofs and floor could break from pressure against it or weight on it posing the risk of injury or\nescape. The housing facilities must be repaired and/or replaced and should be maintained and kept structurally\nsound to protect and contain the animals.\n** The primary enclosure fence for the tiger, Tigger, had a loose wire that was hanging into the pen. The loose wire\ncould pose the risk of entanglement and injury. The housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally\nsound to protect the animals from injury.\n** There was a dead tree limb that had fallen and extended from the public pathway across the perimeter fence and\non top of the enclosure containing the leopard, Namib. Left unaddressed the tree limb could pose a risk of injury or\nescape.

The first day of the\ninspection there was liquid that had leaked onto the floor that was attracting flies and had a foul odor.

It appeared as if they tried to clean up\nthe puddle of liquid but a closer look revealed that there was more liquid leaking out with white larvae \"maggots\" at\nthe base of the freezer. The temperature inside the freezer obtained with the Raygun was 63 degrees F. The\nfreezer is not properly refrigerating the contents within and it is also leaking.
