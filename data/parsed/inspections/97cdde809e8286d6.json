The licensee reports that this happened\nwhen she was trying to get his ears to stand upright using self-adhering wrap and a cardboard tube. The licensee noted\nthat 2 days later the tips of the ears were cold. When she removed the bandages, there were sores present on the ears\nfrom the bandage being too tight. Bandaging the ears was not in the Program of Vet Care but the licensee did seek\nveterinary care to treat the injury to the ears. Using unapproved methods can lead to injury and be painful.\nA female French Bulldog named Tia (#5873) has a hairless, reddish-purple, swollen lump on the skin in between the third\nand fourth toes on the left front paw. The lump appears to be a cyst that has ruptured with a small amount of discharge.\nThe licensee had noticed the lump before it ruptured but was not sure how to treat it. Allowing conditions to progress\nwithout treatment can lead to pain, infection, and other complications.\nA male Corgi named Jojo (#5875) has several mats in his fur all over his body and the hair is greasy. The licensee was\naware of the mats but said it was just his fur type. Mats in fur can trap dirt and moisture, leading to skin disease.\nWhen unapproved methods are used or conditions go untreated, injuries can occur and disease conditions can progress.\nCorrect from this day forward by using only approved and appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat\nand control diseases and injuries as instructed by the attending veterinarian."

There was brown cloudy liquid pooling in a large defect of the concrete.\nOn the east side of the building, the outdoor portion of 2 indoor-outdoor enclosures had rusted, pitted, and broken\ncorrugated metal, creating sharp, jagged points protruding into the enclosures. The enclosures house 2 female American\nEskimo dogs, Ivory Fox (#40244) and Snow Angel (#9968), both with litters of puppies.\nIn two indoor-outdoor wire enclosures on the East side of the building, the wire was rusted and broken, creating sharp\npoints and holes that could injure the dogs. There were sharp metal points protruding into the kennel containing one male\nYorkshire Terrier. A female pug, Cyndee, was housed in an enclosure with an entire line of broken wire, creating 2\ndefects, one measuring approximately 8\" x 1\" and the other measuring 4\" x 2\" in the outdoor portion of her kennel. The\ndoor of her kennel was also heavily rusted and pitted.\nIn an indoor/outdoor wire enclosure on the east side of the building, containing a male poodle named Ralphie, the plastic\nlining of the door leading to the exterior was broken, exposing rotten and jagged wood.\nCrumbling, broken, and rusted enclosures can lead to lacerations, entrapment, and other injuries. When enclosures allow\nwater and waste to pool, it creates a disease hazard and attracts pests. Correct by 1/15/23 by ensuring housing facilities\nare constructed in a structurally sound manner and kept in good repair as to protect the animals from injury."
