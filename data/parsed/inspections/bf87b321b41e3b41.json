      "narrative": "A Patagonian cavy was observed with visible areas of crusting and scabbing on its lower back covering most of the hip\narea during this inspection. This cavy also had open, ulcerated wounds on both hocks. The facility stated that a cat\nattacked this Patagonian cavy, who was previously housed with another cavy and 2 wallabies. The facility reached out to\nthe AV via text on Saturday, 10Dec2022. A photograph of the animal was shared, and the facility employee asked if\nchlorhexidine and doxycycline should be administered. The AV agreed to this weekend care. The facility utilized\ndoxycycline left over from another cavy's prescription through the weekend. The facility requested additional doxycycline\nfrom the AV, who provided an additional prescription several days later. The animal was never presented to or examined\nby the AV; however, these wounds (and the new wounds on the hocks) were visible during this inspection that occurred 8\nweeks after the initial back injury report. In the inspector's conversation with the AV, the AV stated that they were not\naware of the ongoing medical concerns for the cavy, specifically that the reported injuries allegedly caused by a cat had\nnot healed appropriately and that active wounds were present on the hocks. The facility was aware of the ongoing and\nnew wounds on this animal but did not seek veterinary care or communicate the animal\u2019s status with the AV during the 8-\nweek period between the reported injury and this inspection. Not communicating animal injury and wound concerns to the\nAV in a timely manner and not seeking appropriate veterinary care leads to unnecessary discomfort for the animal, has\nnegative health impacts for the animals, and severely compromises the authority of the AV. Per the regulations, each\ndealer and exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of\nadequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use."
