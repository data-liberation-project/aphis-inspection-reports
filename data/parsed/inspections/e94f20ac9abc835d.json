The gums are starting to recede over the upper teeth and she has at least one\nloose tooth on the top left side of the mouth. Tanzie was identified by the facility attending veterinarian as having\n\u201cmoderate to severe tartar\u201d in March 2020. Tanzie has not been treated for this condition since the diagnosis in March.\nAccumulation of tartar can lead to dental disease resulting in infected gums, tooth loss, and possible secondary systemic\neffects. The presence of loose teeth at this time is a potential source of pain which may affect Tanzie\u2019s ability to eat, and\ncan have a negative impact on quality of life.\nImmediately after concluding the inspection, the licensee contacted the attending veterinarian and scheduled an\nappointment for a dental cleaning in early January.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nKristina Shank, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOREnd Section"
