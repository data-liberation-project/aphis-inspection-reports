Those unsealed surfaces are covered with a brownish material, indicating that\nthey cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized. There is also a crack in the floor of the chamber room that extends the width\nof the room.\n-- In one of the kennel rooms housing six of the eight adult, male and female dogs, there are areas of the indoor runs that\nhave exposed, unsealed concrete where the epoxy paint has been worn or chipped away.\nSurfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized, creating the potential for harboring\nmicroorganisms that can pose a disease risk for the dogs. Absorption of water via cracks or other unsealed areas can\nalso undermine the structural integrity of surfaces, causing them to fail and potentially injure an animal. Surfaces of\nindoor housing facilities, including floors and walls, must be impervious to moisture. The licensee must ensure that\naffected surfaces are sealed or painted in a manner that makes them impervious to moisture, and ensure that all surfaces\nare appropriately maintained at all times in order to support the health and well-being of the animals.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: 29 APRIL, 2022.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.\nEnd Section"
