      "narrative": "---A young tiger named \u201cBubbles\u201d died shortly after the last USDA inspection. According to the conversation during the\ninspection with the facility representative, the cub choked on a chicken bone. They explained that they were able to\nremove the bone, but the cub \u201cnever acted right\u201d after that, then choked again and died a couple of days later. The facility\nrepresentative failed to communicate this to a veterinarian and therefore this cub failed to receive adequate veterinary\ncare in a timely manner (after the first incident of choking). If the facility representative had communicated this\nimmediately to a veterinarian, this cub could have received adequate veterinary care as soon as it was noticed to not be\n\u201cacting right\u201d and it may not have died.\n---During the last USDA inspection, a geriatric wolf hybrid named \u201cCochise\u201d was observed to be extremely thin (hip bones\neasily visible) and moving very slowly. During this inspection the facility representative explained that the wolf had died. A\nmedical note dated 11/2/2000 addressing only his limping was provided during this inspection. This medical note was\ndated prior to the last inspection. No medical records were provided indicating that the facility representatives\ncommunicated \u201cCochise\u2019s\u201d condition to a veterinarian after the last inspection. He therefore received no medical\nassessment and care from a veterinarian addressing his condition as instructed on the last inspection report. Weight loss,\nespecially in geriatric animals, can be a result of problems such as, but not limited to, numerous metabolic diseases and\nother illnesses, changing dietary requirements, and/or intestinal parasites.\n--- During the last USDA inspection, a geriatric lion named \u201cSimba\u201d was observed to be thin and have areas of hair loss\non his upper back legs. The medical notes that were provided during the inspection did not indicate that the facility\nrepresentatives communicated \u201cSimba\u2019s\u201d condition to a veterinarian. The veterinarian referenced by the facility\nrepresentatives during the inspection verified that he had not been contacted about this animal's conditions since the last\ninspection. \"Simba\" therefore, received no medical assessment and care from a veterinarian for his current conditions as\ninstructed on the last inspection report. Weight loss and hair coat changes, especially in geriatric animals, can be a result\nof problems such as, but not limited to, numerous metabolic diseases and other illnesses, changing dietary requirements,\nand/or intestinal parasites.\n--- During the last USDA inspection, A liliger named \u201cDjango\u201d was observed to be limping. The daily medical documents\nshow that the facility monitored the limping and found it to be improving in the days after the inspection. When the limping\nreturned on 12/21/2020, a prescription medication was given to \u201cDjango\u201d for 7 days. The medical notes that were provided\nduring the inspection did not indicate that the facility representatives communicated \u201cDjango\u2019s\u201d condition to a veterinarian\nas instructed on the last inspection report. The medical records do not show communication with the veterinarian\nregarding instructions or approval for the use of any medication for this animal\u2019s condition. The veterinarian referenced by\nthe facility representatives during the inspection verified that he had not been contacted about this animals since the last\ninspection. Gait abnormalities can result from problems such as, but not limited to, injury, orthopedic problems, and/or\nmetabolic and diet problems. Limping also indicates the animal is painful. The use of medications not approved by a\nveterinarian can result in the failure of the condition to be addressed and for unintended side effects from the medication.\nThe facility representative must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary approved nutritional and medical care\nat all times as directed by a veterinarian which includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat\ndiseases and injuries."

Gait abnormalities can result from problems such as but not limited to injury, orthopedic\ndisease, and other neurologic medical problems. Limping also indicates the animal is painful.\n---The black jaguar \u201cBagheera\u201d had hair loss on the end and sides of his tail. The facility representatives said they have\nnoticed limited tail sucking in the past with Bagheera but were not aware of the extent of the hair loss that is now present.\nThey have not consulted with a veterinarian regarding this animal\u2019s condition prior to the inspection. Coat/hair loss can be\ncaused by problems such as but not limited to trauma, parasites, stress/behavior, and other dermatologic medical\nproblems.\nFailure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a veterinarian can result in prolonged pain,\nsuffering, and even death. The facility representative must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of\ndirect and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health,\nbehavior, and well-being are conveyed.\n***The facility currently does not have an attending veterinarian and therefore also does not have a written program of\nveterinary care or an environmental enhancement plan for nonhuman primates. These are all required by the Animal\nWelfare Act. According to a court order, the facility has until January 29 to employ an attending veterinarian.\nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors:\nCYNTHIA DIGESUALDO, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICEREnd Section"
