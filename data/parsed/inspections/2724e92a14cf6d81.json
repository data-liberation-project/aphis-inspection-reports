One goat came over and drank water as the receptacle\nwas filling, but only drank for 10-20 seconds. When the automatic water supply is shut off, either additional water\nreceptacles should be available or the water should be manually turned on as often as needed to maintain fresh\nwater for the animals until the automatic system is working again.\nAccess to sufficient potable water is required to maintain the health and well-being of animals and is also critical for\nmaintenance of body temperature on warm and sunny summer days. A system of maintenance of the water\nreceptacles and provision of adequate potable water is required to maintain the health and well-being of the\nanimals.\nCorrection date: 21 Aug 2017\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives."
