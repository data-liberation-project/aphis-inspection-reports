      "narrative": "*On April 13, 2023, a bison calf was seen laying in/near to the drive through road in the veld area by members of the\npublic. Park staff at the grizzly area advised inspectors that they received multiple complaints from members of the public\nbetween 9:30-10:30 am. The first report (9:30-10 am) was given to one of the grizzly staff members who went into the\nreception area with the concerned visitor and reported the down calf. Between 10-10:30 am other members of the public\nreported the down calf to another member of the grizzly staff advising the calf was still breathing, but it was labored and in\ndistress. The grizzly staff member texted the Wilstem office to advise the situation. Both reported incidents were advised\nby the Wilstem reception area to tell the public that \u2018the calf was born earlier that morning and was fine, it was just drying\nin the sun\u2019. The management park staff advised they told reception to tell the public that reply. Management staff advised\nthey did not get any report of the down calf until they were at lunch at about 12 pm, and they returned as soon as they\ncould to the veld area where they found that the calf was dead. There is a large amount of time between the notifications\nof a down calf in the veld area, and the response from the Wilstem management staff arriving to check on the animal.\nThere were no other staff members contacted to check on the calf until the veld staff could arrive and check on the calf.\nThe animal had initially been reported as breathing with difficulty and was not attended to until it was found dead approx.\n1-2 hours after the first reports. There was no veterinary care provided or necropsy done to determine the cause of death.\nDelayed observation of animals when reports of concern are made by members of the public or staff can lead to severe\nhealth and welfare issues, unnecessary pain and suffering and possible death if not treated in a timely manner.\nAll regulated animals must be monitored on a daily basis and appropriate veterinary care provided as soon as situations\nare observed, and medical intervention is required.\n*One (1) adult male giraffe, Marchello, approx. 7 years of age was observed as being underweight due to the lack of\nmuscle definition around the back, hips, ribs, abdomen and hind leg areas. Marchello was noted with decreased muscle\nstructure appearing as indents along both sides of his spine, on the back of the thigh muscles and upper rump area on\neither side of the tail, prominent hip bones and hip pins, and a deep recessed area in front of both hip bones appearing\nconcave (dented inwards). The ribs and base of the tail had several folds of loose skin present, which is not normal for a\ngiraffe with a healthy body weight. When staff were questioned, they advised they were not aware the giraffe was\nunderweight, however after pointing out the condition during the inspection the facility staff could see the concerns\ninspectors had. The staff advised they had previously placed the giraffe on a diet where the grain amount was decreased\nby a moderate amount to prepare for the summer public feeding encounters where they would substitute the decrease in\ngrain with lettuce that is fed by the public on a daily basis. It was noted by facility staff that he had shown less interest in\nthe treats provided (lettuce) when on the higher grain amount. When discussing the signs of low weight on the giraffe,\nfacility staff felt like he was more ideal in weight than when he had previously been overweight due to past feeding\nregimens. The allowance of the underweight condition of Marcello shows a lack of understanding/knowledge in diet\nrequirements and the ability to recognize proper giraffe body condition.\nThe lack of timely observations on body weight condition could cause a treatable condition to become chronic or possibly\nfatal with unnecessary pain or discomfort depending on the reason for the weight loss. All food consumption should be\nmonitored with proper weight monitoring protocols established for timely diet adjustments to be made to prevent weight\nloss or excessive gain.\nEach dealer and exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include\u2026 daily\nobservation of all animals to assess their health and well-being.\nDaily observation includes knowing how to assess animals for adequate and appropriate weights according to age, life\nstage and health status, as well as species specifics. This also includes timely observation of animals of concern.\nIncomplete assessment of health can lead to severe medical conditions and affect the health and welfare of the animals.\nCorrect by completing daily observations of all animals. Consultation with the Attending Veterinarian on ways to assess\nweight in various species would be beneficial. Other ideas may include implementing and training employees on weight\nassessment of various species, conducting thorough daily observations with documentation, and periodically weighing\nanimals.\nCorrect by: July 24, 2023\nCorrections already implemented: Veld staff lunch breaks are staggered so that one staff member is present at all times\nwhile the park is open."
