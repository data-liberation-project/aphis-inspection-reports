The dog was matted under the neck, front rib cage, and\nfront legs. The matts covered approximately 50% of the neck and front rib cage and approximately 80% of the two front\nlegs. The hair was heavily twisted and ropey. Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal. In addition,\nmatting can foster skin disease and can hinder the animal\u2019s ability to move or defecate normally.\nThe licensee needs to remove the matted fur on this dog. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the applicant\nmust establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all the dogs to prevent the development of excessive\nmatting. The licensee must ensure that all animals always receive adequate veterinary care.\n*A female cream and black pug (#6502 last four) and a female cream lab X. (#9425 last four) both have excessively long\ntoenails. Some of the toenails are starting to curl back. Long toenails can be painful and cause discomfort when a dog is\ntrying to walk. The potential for injury exists if a toenail becomes caught in the plastic flooring.\nFor the prevention of pain and discomfort, all toenails must be trimmed on a regular basis and or according to a toenail\ntrimming scheduled that must be established.\n* The pug (#6502 last four) had two interdigital growths on both front feet. Both growths were between digits two and\nthree for both front feet. The grows were approximately 13 MM round and protruding between the digits approximately 6\nmm outward. The growths appear moist.\nThese growths must be seen by the Attending Veterinarian (A.V.) and a consultation of the outcome must be maintained\nalong with any treatment. This applies to all veterinary care for all dogs.\nTo be corrected by, 3-September-2024."
