Three (3) animals were captured (on) 12-6-24 and\nadditionally on Dec 7, 9, and 10, 2024 were captured and had to be euthanized due to the potential threat of introducing\nunwanted pathogens to the colony.

On the March 7, 2025 IACUC meeting one of the last two animal was captured.\nHowever, after talking with the attending veterinarian it had to be euthanized due to having spent time outside the\nperimeter fence. According to the Attending Veterinarian one animal is still missing and has not been captured by the time\nof the inspection.\nIt is important that all gates and latches be kept in good repair and firmly secured to prevent opportunities for animals to\nescape or injure themselves. The primary enclosures should be maintained to contain the non-human primates securely\nand prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.\nCorrected by the time of inspection."
