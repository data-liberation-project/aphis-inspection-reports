The area of hair loss extended approximately 3\ninches up from the tip of the tail and the hair appeared in patches with large areas of exposed skin present. Approximately\n2 inches up from the tip of the tail in an area without hair, there was a red and inflamed looking lesion/wound which\nappeared about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. According to the applicant, he had been aware of the tamarin's condition and felt that\nthe hair loss had been sudden but couldn't be sure exactly how long it had been that way. He also stated that he had\nadjusted some of the enrichment in the animal's enclosure and he felt the animal's condition had improved since it had\noriginally been identified, however, the lesion was still present and a veterinarian had not been contacted about the\nanimal's condition. This animal's condition could be due to an injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition that\ncould cause discomfort. The applicant must ensure that a veterinarian is consulted regarding this animal's condition so\nthat a diagnosis can be made and a treatment plan developed and followed. The applicant must ensure that all animals\nreceive adequate veterinary care at all times."
