In total, the inventory\nof the mentioned small avian species was reduced from 136 to 58, a 57% reduction in inventory of small avian species.\nWhen asked about this inventory reduction, establishment employees stated that they sometime find birds dead from\nunknown causes. No other explanation for the loss of inventory was provided and no records were available or provided\nto show this reduction of inventory was due to the sale or donation of the mentioned bird species. No veterinary exams or\nnecropsies were performed to determine cause of death of the birds found dead.\nThe health and well-being of 78 birds over an approximately 5-month period was adversely impacted, resulting in their\ndeath. This indicates there is not a robust program in place to determine the reason for loss of animals, which could stem\nfrom underlying herd/flock health issues, poor husbandry practices, or facility problems.\nThe facility must establish and maintain a program of veterinary care that includes daily observation of all animals to\nassess their health and well-being. Further, there must a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the\nattending veterinarian, so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being is conveyed to\nthe attending veterinarian.\nTo be corrected from this day (12/16/2024) forward."
