Intensive veterinary care was provided for the animal\nfor 48 hours. Lack of clinical response to intensive treatment and negative trends in diagnostics led to the decision to\nhumanely euthanize the animal. The enrichment chains had been in use for over 8 years with the herd of swine consisting\nof 10-40 animals at any given time with no adverse events recorded. However, using enrichment items that can cause\nharm to the animals can result in injury or death of the animal. The regulations state that handling of all animals shall be\ndone as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. All chains were immediately removed from the swine\nenclosures. Corrected prior to inspection.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
