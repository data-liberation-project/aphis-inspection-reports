While the right side of the building is being spot cleaned daily, the keeper is\nunable to clean the left side properly due to the inability to lock the primates out of the building long enough to allow\nfor proper daily spot cleaning. The buildup is from the past 2 to 3 days as the owners are out of town. While the\nanimals can get away from that area of the building and do not have to make contact with that area, there still has to\nbe daily spot cleaning provided. The surfaces above the windows, upper PVC pipe holds on the swings, and door\nflap have a buildup of dirt and grime that needs to be cleaned/sanitized more often to prevent the amount of buildup\nthat was observed during this inspection.\nThe primary enclosure of the primates is to be spot cleaned on a daily basis to prevent the buildup of feces and\nurine, that can become a possible health hazard to the regulated animals if left for several days.\nThere are five areas under the windows, above the base board area where there appears to be some water leaking\nor dampness that is leaving water marks and damp areas on the wall surfaces. Under one of the windows there is a\nwet mark (approx. 1ftx1ft) that has a moderate amount of black looking mold on the surface of the wall in the water\nmarked area. These areas are not able to be sanitized properly if they are damp or if mold is growing on the damp\nsurface. These areas can also become weak in structure and be a source of damage or contact with dangerous\nmaterials if dug at by the primates when the surfaces deteriorate due to the moisture. The back of the entry door\ninside the primary enclosure appears to have had the surface along the base of the door peeled off, exposing the\nwood beneath. Once the water resistant covering is removed the area is unable to be sanitized properly and the\narea should be repaired or replaced to allow for proper sanitization.\nAny moldy, damp or damaged surface that cannot be cleaned or sanitized can be a possible source of bacteria or\ndisease if left in contact with the regulated animals.\nAll surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals must be repaired or replaced when worn, soiled or\ndamaged in order to allow for proper sanitization. The licensee must provide daily spot cleaning and removal of\nfeces and urine from the primary enclosure. If they are out of town, the daily spot cleaning must continue, and if the\nkeeper is unable to do the job due to the animals interference, then the facility must provide a method of locking the\nanimals out during the cleaning process, both for the safety of the keeper and the regulated animals.\nTo be corrected by: November 14, 2017 for the spot cleaning and sanitizing\nDecember 1, 2017 for repairs to the walls and door\nInspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative."
