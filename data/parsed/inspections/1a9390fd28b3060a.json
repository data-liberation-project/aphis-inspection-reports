A\ndiagnosis of a proximal tibial fracture near the growth plate was made and pain medications were given under the\ndirection of a Veterinary Instructor at the time of diagnosis. The kitten had been separated from her enclosure\nmates and was on \"cage rest\" in a hospital that had no elevated resting platform as required under the housing\nstandards (3.6 (b)(4)). No documentation had been made at the time of this inspection on 9/10/2014 regarding a\nplan for management or treatment of this kitten which should have included directions from a veterinarian regarding\nhousing enclosure restrictions, pain management duration, and plan for re-evaluation to determine course of healing\nand use in teaching activities. The pain medication had been changed on 9/5/2014 but it could not be determined if\nthis was directed by a veterinarian as the treatment sheet was signed only by the Program Co-Directors. The\nProgram Co-Director had requested documentation from the Attending Veterinarian and other Veterinary Instructors\ninvolved in the evaluation of this kitten but nothing was available at the time of this inspection. The electronic\nmedical records have been updated as of 9/11/2014 to reflect veterinary input but this was not documented at the\ntime of the inspection.\nIn order to ensure that animal's requiring veterinary care are receiving appropriate and timely treatment, especially\nin the case of painful conditions like a bone fracture, records documenting the diagnosis and treatment plan, which\nincludes any specific needs to reduce pain and prevent further injury, shall be created, updated, and maintained so\nAPHIS and any other personnel involved in the care for these animal's can know what is being done and what the\nexpectations are for recovery and/or follow-up care.\nA mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems\nof animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nTo be corrected by 9/16/2014."

The dog was removed from the enclosure for examination and the left\nhind foot was found to be swollen and pink when compared to the right hind foot. The dog would bear weight on the\nfoot but frequently held it up in the air and seemed tender when the foot was touched. No one had noted this\nproblem before the APHIS AC VMO had identified the problem. The slatted floor in the primary enclosure had gaps\nthat were wide enough to allow the toes of this dog and another adjacent Boston terrier dog's toes to pass down into\nthe gaps, posing a risk of injury to the toes and feet.\nThe facility does have rubber mats that can be placed in the primary enclosures to protect the dog's feet but had not\nput mats in these two enclosures. Hudson's left hind foot appears to have been injured by the gaps in the slatted\nfloor.\nPrimary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they:have floors that are constructed in a manner\nthat protects the dogs' and cats' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow\nthe dogs' and cats' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.\nTo be corrected by 9/16/2014."
