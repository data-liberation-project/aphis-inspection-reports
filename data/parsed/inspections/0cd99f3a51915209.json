The worst of the enclosures are unoccupied, and have exposed wire ends. These\nruns must not be used until repairs have been completed. The two occupied runs do have a lesser degree of\ndamage, but require repair as well.\nGoats held for teaching in the large animal barn are in stalls intended for larger animals. The vertical bar\nconstruction of the enclosures has been supplemented with wire mesh to keep the animals inside the enclosure.\nThe mesh on the stall fronts is light-guage welded wire. The goats have been abusing the wire mesh, bending the\nmetal and causing broken welds. Stalls R5 and R6 are the most affected, and sharp ends are exposed in R5.\nExposed wire points pose a risk of injury to the animals in the enclosures. The enclosures must be frequently\ninspected and repaired as necessary to ensure the animals stay safely inside the enclosure.\nCorrect the dog runs before next use. Correct the goat enclosures by May 31, 2014.\nThe inspection was conducted on May 14-15, 2014, and was accompanied by the Attending Veterinarian and facility\npersonnel.\nThe exit briefing was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian and the IACUC Coordinator."
