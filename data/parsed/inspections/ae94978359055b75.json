Except for the addition of the Tums tablet, this was basically the same diet the marmosets were\neating during the last inspection.

The facility\nshall contact their veterinarian or a veterinary nutritionist and ensure that the diet fed to the marmosets is appropriate for\nthe species according to generally accepted professional nutritional standards."
