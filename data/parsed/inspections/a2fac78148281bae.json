      "narrative": "During this USDA inspection, the inspectors reviewed the room temperature and humidity records for the tree shrew\nrooms. Records for the indoor housing room UUU used to house 29 adult and 3 infant tree shrews show that in the\nmonth of Jan. 2014 humidity levels ranged from 15-35% with only one day consistently above 30%. In the month of\nFeb. 2014 humidity levels ranged from 2-33% with no days above 30% all day. During the first half of Mar. 2014\nhumidity levels ranged from 17-30% with no days above 30% all day. Tree shrews are a species from south-east\nAsia that live in tropical and sub-tropical areas that are usually moist environments. During the inspection it was\nnoted that several of the tree shrews showed dull dry looking coats that were sparse over the tail and tail head\nareas. Low humidity levels can lead to medical issues such as skin and respiratory abnormalities and can lead to\ndiscomfort for animals. All indoor housing areas shall maintain humidity levels at 30-70 percent and specific housing\nroom humidity levels should take into account the housed animals' age, species, breed, overall health status and\nacclimation status. The facility shall increase the humidity through temporary measures by 3/21/2014 and will\ncorrect the humidity issues via permanent long-term corrective actions by 9/1/2014."
