      "narrative": "During this inspection on December 19, 2017, I observed numerous adult goats and sheep showing lameness\nwhile standing, walking, and running in the pasture near the barn that have not been provided adequate veterinary\ncare. I observed a young goat deceased laying in its cement culvert shelter that was not provided adequate\nveterinary care.\nThere is a matted white and brown ram limping and favoring his front left limb while walking and keeping his limb\nelevated while stationary. During the previous inspection on October 19, 2017, this sheep was putting more weight\non his left limb but now its mainly elevated when standing. A brown and white ewe is limping favoring her left front\nlimb while walking as she did during the previous inspection on October, 19, 2017. These two sheep were\nidentified on the previous inspection report as goats as a typographic error. There is a white ewe with overgrown\nhooves limping favoring her rear limbs while walking to eat hay. There were several other goats and sheep that had\nsome lameness however I was not able to identify them due to many of them running away then standing in a\nstationary position. There is a 3 month old goat deceased in its cement culvert shelter. This goat had been\ndeceased for some time due to the foul odor, excessive flies and maggots outside the rear area. The care taker\nstated that this young goat was born a runt with medical issues they took care of but appeared not to have any\nrecent health problems. According to the care takers and manager none of these lame goats and sheep and the\ndeceased goat received previous veterinary. Without adequate veterinary care for these lame goats and sheep they\nmay develop further medical problems and endure more pain and discomfort.\nFor the health and welfare of the animals at this facility this exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of\nadequate veterinary care to its animals that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,\nand treat diseases and injuries."

It was evident that this goat having a strong foul odor, covered in flies and maggots at the rear\narea was not observed for numerous days. It was stated that this goat had previous medical issues since birth and\nthe facility treated it, however the attending veterinarian was never notified to ensure adequate veterinary care was\nprovided. Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being and Provided, further, That a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of\nanimal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nTO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATLY\nI accompanied the facilities attending veterinarian and licensee at the facility on December 20, 2017. The attending\nveterinarian visually observed the goats and sheep that are lame but no treatment was provided. His\nrecommendations for treatment were given to the licensee. I spoke with the facilities manager by phone on\nDecember 21, 2017, at 4:30 p.m., and the attending veterinarians recommendations for treatment would be\nfollowed. The manager stated their facility intends to exhibit the farm animals as an agricultural exhibit and plans to\ncancel their USDA license. Since there were some differences about the definition of exhibiting farm animals for\nagriculture purposes, I recommended to notify the eastern regional office in writing to ensure compliance.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility care taker and manager on December 19, 2017, and\nwith the licensee on December 20, 2017."
