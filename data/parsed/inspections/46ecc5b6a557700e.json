The Tamarin that is\nsingly housed in the farm animal barn has access to an enclosure that is along the outside wall of the barn.\nAlthough the enclosure is ~5(cid:25) off of the ground there are some areas with a large enough mesh that may allow the\npublic to have direct access to this primate. There is one wooden support post, in the front of the leopards holding\narea, that has begun to loosen up. This now allows for the fence to move back and forth. There is also a wooden\nsupport post in front of the bobcat enclosure that has also loosened up. Again the barrier is able to move back and\nforth. To ensure that the public does not have direct access to these animals these barriers will need to be\naddressed.\nTo Be Corrected By: September 6, 2014\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the licensee."
