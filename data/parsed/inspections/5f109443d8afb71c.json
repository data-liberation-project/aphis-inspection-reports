There is\na dried dark discharge around the eyelids of both eyes and a small amount of mucus on the surfaces of the eyes.\nEye problems can be caused by a variety of problems and can be painful.\n* Female, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, \"(cid:28)Twix\"(cid:29) with number 4B170B1905 has blue/white color to the entire surface\nof her left eye. The color on the surface of the eye makes it difficult to see into the eye. Eye problems can be\ncaused by a variety of problems and can be painful. This dog also has gums that have receded away from the\n(cid:28)\"cheek teeth(cid:29)\" (premolars) and molars on the top of both sides of the mouth that have exposed the tooth roots.\nThere is also an accumulation of brown material coating about half of the canine teeth and the molars. Dental\ndisease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of\nthe dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal.\n* Male, Maltese, (cid:28)\"Mischief\"(cid:29) with number 4A3B2A7E34 has an accumulation of brown material completely coating\nand obscuring the \"(cid:28)cheek teeth\"(cid:29) (premolars) and molars and about half of the canine teeth. The first upper (cid:28)cheek\nteeth(cid:29) were loose when touched. The gums are red and have receded away from the surface of the \"(cid:28)cheek teeth(cid:29)\"\nand molars. There is a white, creamy discharge along the upper gum line.

The mats are on all four\nlimbs and are tight against the skin. Matted hair can cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted\ncoats do not provide complete protection against the elements. The licensee must remove the matted hair. As part\nof the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance\nto ensure that animals are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a\nregular basis.\n* There is a bottle of \"(cid:28)Excede\"(cid:29) Injectable and a bottle of Oxytocin injectable with no directions for appropriate use\nfrom the attending veterinarian. These medications were found intermingled with other medications in the whelping\nbuilding refrigerator and are therefore considered ready for use.
