This abnormal build-up of material extended into\nthe gum line. The gums appeared reddened, swollen and had receded along some of these teeth. The abnormal\nbuild-up of material on the dogs teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. The dogs dental\ncondition could be painful, may decrease the dogs ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health.\nThis dog also had a pea sized gray spot in the center of the pupil on the left eye. The skin immediately surrounding\nthis eye was missing fur. There was a whitish material that was wiped from the dogs eye prior to closer inspection.\nThe dog did seem to have above normal tear production, and had a brown material in the fur around the eye. Eye\ndischarge, discoloration, and excessive tearing can be caused by an infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other\nmedical conditions that could be painful.\nOn the scruff of this dog there was a golf ball size area with a blackish material caked in the fur. The skin under this\nwas red and oozing a blood like fluid. This skin lesion could be the result of injury, infection or other veterinary\nmedical condition which could be painful.\nFemale Yorkshire Terrier (084-102-559) was not bearing weight on its left hind leg. There was a lesion on the pad\nbetween the middle toes. The pad lesion on the rear foot was, oozing a clear liquid, reddened, and slightly swollen.\nThe lesion on the pad could be the result of injury, infection or a variety of veterinary medical conditions which may\ncause discomfort.\nMale Bengal (041-597-005) was excessively scratching its left ear. The back side of the ear was missing fur and\nhad some scabs. When the ear was massaged, the cat would continually try to scratch with its hind leg, and would\nshake it's head after someone touching its ear. This cats condition could be an indication of parasites, infection\nand/or a variety of other veterinary medical conditions.\nThe licensee must have these animals seen by a licensed veterinarian regarding these animal's conditions in order\nto obtain an accurate diagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nThe licensee had several unlabeled medicine containers. All of these medications were stored with other\nmedications\nthat were currently being used and therefore ready to use. The use of medications that are not properly labeled may\nharm the animals. Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the\ncontents of the container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications\nare not used past their expiration dates. As part of the program of adequate veterinary care, the licensee must\nensure that all medications are labeled with the contents (name and concentration of drug), dosing instructions\n(specific for the species of animal being treated), and expiration date.\nTo be corrected by: May 17, 2014."

The contaminated\nfood in each of these self feeders was located at the opening where the dogs access the food. In one of the\nfeeders, some of the food appeared like a dark brown soupy mush. The food in this feeder was wet with mushy food\ncovering most of the bottom, and most of the rest of the food had a grayish-white, mold-like material.
