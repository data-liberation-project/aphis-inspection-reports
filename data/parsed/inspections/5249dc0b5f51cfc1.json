During the course of the inspection, it was\nrevealed that the facility had run out of the tranquilizing medication. Without consulting the attending veterinarian for\nguidance, approximately 18 rabbits had been euthanized without tranquilization according to a facility\nrepresentative. Failure to provide the tranquilizing medication to personnel performing euthanasia resulted in a\nchange from the veterinarian-approved method of euthanasia. Based on discussion with the person performing the\nprocedure, this change likely resulted in distress of the animals prior to unconsciousness. The appropriate facilities\nand equipment shall be provided so veterinary guidance regarding euthanasia can be followed.\nSince this was noted, the facility has implemented corrective measures. The tranquilizing medication was made\navailable to personnel on May 31st, 2018. A record keeping and ordering system has been put in place to ensure\nthe medication is available from this point forward.\nThis inspection and an initial exit interview were conducted with animal facility personnel on site on May 30th, 2018.\nA supplementary exit interview was performed on site with facility representatives on June 6th, 2018."
