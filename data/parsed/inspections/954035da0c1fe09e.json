Both\nkennels had damaged areas where the chain link was pulled away from the metal support frame at the bottom. The\ndamaged areas resulted in holes or gaps above the metal supports and crumpled chain link at the level of the\npuppies. Additionally, ends of the heavy gauge chain link wire were exposed, turned toward the interior of the\nkennels and accessible to the puppies in multiple areas.\nHousing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The animals could\nbecome entangled in the damaged fencing and contact with the exposed ends of heavy wire could cause injury. The\ndamaged areas and wire ends should be repaired, replaced or removed.\nCorrect by: September 20, 2018.\nThis inspection was conducted with a manager/family member.\nThe exit interview was conducted by conference call on September 13, 2018 with the licensee and APHIS\npersonnel.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBolinger Jean, Compliance Specialist"
