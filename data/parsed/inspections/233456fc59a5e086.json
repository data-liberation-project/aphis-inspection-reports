      "narrative": "* \"Polly,\" a 3 year old English Bulldog, (ID#: 006819365), had a one inch wide spot on her right front leg that was\nraised about a quarter of an inch. The licensee reported that this was caused another dog biting her days before.\nWhen the swollen area was lightly touched, a pale liquid followed by a reddish clear liquid came out of the open\nwound in the center of the swollen area. The licensee reported that this dog was not being treated for wounds and\nhadn't thought that the wound was, 'that bad.' Swollen, untreated wounds that have pale discharge and reddish\nclear discharge can be painful and may lead to further health problems if not treated.\nThe licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian on this swollen wound in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document\nthis information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals\nreceive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date or had no expiration date: Oxytocin Injection (cid:19) no\ndate, Oxytocin Injection - 7/2014, Draxxin -1 Feb 2014, Cabergoline 125 mg (cid:19) 7/12/15, Cabergoline 120 mg (cid:19)\n7/1/2014, Doxycycline 100 mg - 10/2012, Erofloxacin 22.7 mg (cid:19) no date, Baytril 68 mg (cid:19) no date, Baytril (cid:19) Jun 2016,\nCephalexin (cid:19) 2/31/14, Vitamin K (cid:19) Jan 16, Marquis (cid:19) Oct 13 and Strongid SA no date.\nThese medications were intermingled with other products on the medication counter top that are currently being\nused at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Expired drugs and drugs with no known certainty of the\nexpiration date may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. The\nlicensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled properly in accordance with\nstandard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. This will\npromote the health of 31 adult dogs and 27 puppies."
