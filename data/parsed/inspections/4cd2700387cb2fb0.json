This included taking all 5 gliders out of their pouch/sack for each interaction.\nThere is only one staff member present during the interaction and the single staff member is responsible for handling and\nmonitoring the 5 gliders, as well as responsible for monitoring the actions and behavior of the guests who participate in\nthe interaction (varies from 1 guest up to 3 or 4; 2 guests participated in the 5/13/23 interaction). The guests are seated\non a bench inside the exhibit and the staff member takes the 5 gliders out of the pouch/sack and places them on and near\nthe guests. The animals are then allowed to freely run over the guests for a period of time. During the interactive exhibit\non 5/13/23, the guest was bitten by the glider when they closed their hands and squeezed the glider when it was moving\nacross their hands.\nHandling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,\nexcessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Sugar gliders are small pocket-sized\ntree-dwelling nocturnal animals that move quickly, are active at night, and sleep during the day. Members of the public,\nespecially children, can easily become startled or frightened by the quick movements of these animals. Similarly, sugar\ngliders, particularly juvenile animals, may become startled and bite when not handled properly by inexperienced members\nof the public. The presence of only a single staff member with responsibility for monitoring both the behavior of 5 animals\nand the actions of multiple guests during an interaction, means that the staff would not be likely to intervene to protect the\nanimals or guests if something goes wrong. This is not handling the animals as carefully as possible or ensure the safety\nof the animals and the public. Following the bite, the staff member reported that they were unsure which of the five gliders\nused in the interaction had bitten the guest. As a result, all 5 animals were quarantined by state health officials.\nFailure to handle animals as carefully as possible can result in behavioral stress, physical harm, and/or unnecessary\ndiscomfort to the animals, and can result in injury to members of the public. Correct by ensuring that all animals are\nhandled as carefully as possible by ensuring that an adequate number of staff are present to monitor the actions of the\nanimals and members of the public during animal interactions. Correct from this date 6/2/23 forward."
