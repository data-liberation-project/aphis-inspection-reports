An appendix attached to each\nprotocol discussed general surgery principles to be followed but neither the protocol nor the appendix stated the\nsurgical procedure clearly and in detail. In addition there were no details of what anesthetic drugs were to be used,\nhow the animal was to be monitored during the surgery and what pre and post surgical procedures were to be\nfollowed. Pain/discomfort relief measures were not stated clearly and in detail.\n*Protocol ETCR-16-0177 discusses blood draws and blood volumes related to experimental procedures in the\nprotocol. An experimental timeline table shows these experimental blood draws but then also shows additional\nblood draws for blood testing. These additional blood draws are not described in the protocol by timing or volume of\nblood to be drawn.\n*Protocol 16-0173 discussed euthanasia and gives the drug, dose and route for administration of the euthanasia\ndrug. The procedure description states that xylazine or acepromazine will be given prior to the euthanasia drug but\nno dosages or routes of administration are noted.\nA protocol must be complete in order to allow the IACUC to fully understand the procedures and uses the animals\nwill be undergoing so that the IACUC can adequately review a protocol to ensure that the protocol meets regulatory\nguidelines. A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed\nuse of the animals. Correct from this day forward.\nExit conducted with undersigned IACUC chair."
