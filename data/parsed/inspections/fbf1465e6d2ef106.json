A lock was noted on the animal's primary\nenclosure which didn't allow the animal access to the larger portion of the outdoor housing while fencing around the\narea was being repaired. Not being allowed out of the primary enclosure for extended periods of time can have a\nnegative welfare impact on the animal which can lead to hair loss and poor body condition. Although the pig has\nbeen housed at the facility for several weeks, the attending veterinarian had not been contacted to evaluate the\ncondition of the pig. Direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on\nproblems of animal health, behavior and well-being is communicated to the attending veterinarian. The licensee\nmust contact the attending veterinarian to have the pig's condition evaluated for diagnosis and treatment.\nCorrect by close of business 10/02/2019."
