In an attempt to aid in maternal bonding, a lambing jug/smaller enclosed area\nwas made using the existing catch pen at the rear of the barn stall.

At approximately 6pm, staff went back to the barn to check on the lambs/let\nthem loose if bonding was successful. At that time, one of the lambs, apparently attempting to return to the catch pen, had\ncaught its head/neck between the vertical metal bar and wall plate nearest the lower wall hinge on the catch pen. The\nlamb was found unresponsive and CPR was started but resuscitation was not successful.
