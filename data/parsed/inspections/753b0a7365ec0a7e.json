However, the facility did not\nhave an Attending Veterinarian (AV) under formal arrangements and there was no current, written, Program of Veterinary\nCare (POVC). Records indicated that the previous Attending Veterinarian had not visited the facility since May 24, 2023.\nWhen asked about this, the facility representative stated that the previous Attending Veterinarian started making excuses\nfor not being available to look at their animals and eventually became unresponsive to their calls. On June 2, 2025, the\nfacility had another veterinarian come to the facility to extract a broken tooth from one of their tigers. The facility\nrepresentative stated that they discussed the possibility of that veterinarian becoming the new Attending Veterinarian for\nthe facility, but they have not yet formalized an agreement.\nAn Attending Veterinarian and a written program of veterinary care is needed to establish an adequate standard of\nveterinary care for the animals on hand.\nEach exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending\nveterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and\nregularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.

Bare skin could be seen\non most of his arms, legs, chest, abdomen, and at the base of his tail.\n\u2022 A pot-bellied pig named Miss Piggy was emaciated. The skin from the back of her head to the base of her tail was\ncrusty, raw, and inflamed with bloody areas and lifting scabs.\n\u2022 A black pot-bellied pig housed with three other pigs, and a goat was seen laying on the ground. This animal was\nemaciated with the bones of its spine, ribs, and pelvis, clearly visible. Several skin folds could be seen that gave the\nimpression that the animal was once much larger and the stretched skin was now too much for its thin frame. This animal\nwas unresponsive and did not move while being observed.\n\u2022 An orange female tiger and a white male tiger were observed with hairloss on the back of both ears. The tips of the male\ntiger\u2019s ears were crusty with visible bloody areas. No flies were seen on or around the ears. The tigers are individually\nhoused. A facility representative stated that the animals were causing the injuries by rubbing their heads against their\nenclosures.\n\u2022 A white pig with black spots was thin with poor body condition, while the black pig in the same enclosure was robust. A\nfacility representative stated that both animals eat fine, but they did not know the last time the animals were tested for\nworms or internal parasites.\nFailure to identify health issues or concerns by daily observations, or failure to maintain timely communication about those\nfindings to the Attending Veterinarian can lead to treatment delay, which may negatively impact the health and well-being\nof the animals.\nEach exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observation of all\nanimals to assess their health and well-being as well as direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the Attending Veterinarian.

The sides of the tub had a caked-on layer of a white, crusty, mineral \nscale-like substance with other dirt and grime extending into the water. There was no other water available for these \nanimals. \n\u2022 The enclosure housing a black pig and goat had a rectangular, black rubber tub filled with water. The tub had cracks on \ntwo opposite rims, and one side was split and separated, allowing the water to drain out onto the surrounding ground. The \ninside of the tub was dirty and covered in a caked-on layer of white, crusty, mineral scale-like substance. There was no \nother water available for these animals. \n \nFailure to offer potable water as often as necessary can lead to dehydration. Dirty water receptacles can contaminate the \nwater which may have an adverse effect on the health and well-being of the animals.\n\nAll water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary and potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the \nhealth and comfort of the animals. To be corrected from this day, August 22, 2025, forward. \n3.153(a) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nThe facility failed to maintain three of their bird enclosures in good repair. \n\u2022 The enclosure housing a scarlet macaw had a metal grate with a blue perch and plastic food bowl attached to it. The \nmetal grate was covered in flaking, pitted rust. The metal connector for the blue perch was also covered in flaking, pitted \nrust. The horizontal metal frame below the door of the enclosure had flaking paint, and flaking, pitted rust. \n\u2022 The metal enclosure housing a yellow naped parrot is covered with pitted rust. The lower main horizontal support beam \non the left side of the enclosure is rusted out with missing pieces, leaving gaps between the vertical bars and sharp \njagged edges. A portion of the rear wall, side walls and roof, are covered with sheets of corrugated metal. These metal \nsheets have areas of deep rust with holes that leave sharp, jagged edges within reach of the bird. \n\u2022 The enclosure housing a monk parakeet has numerous areas of rust, mostly concentrated around the joints where the \nvertical and horizontal support beams meet. The bottom right edge of the upper door and upper right edge of the lower \ncage door have flaking paint and heavy pitted rust. Several of the vertical metal wires that make up the cage walls are \nrusty and showing signs of damage. \n \nPrimary enclosures that are not kept in good repair may create hazards which can injure the birds housed within them or \nmay become structurally compromised.  \n \nPrimary enclosures must be kept in good repair and must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the birds \nsecurely and have no sharp points or edges that could injure the birds. To be corrected by October 17, 2025. \n3.154 \n   \nEnvironment enhancement to promote psychological well-being. \nAt the time of inspection, there was no documented program of environmental enhancement available for review, for the \nbirds housed at the facility. \n \nAn adequate environmental enhancement program is essential in promoting the psychological well-being of birds. \n \nDealers, exhibitors, and research facilities must develop, document, and follow a species-appropriate plan for \nenvironment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of birds. This plan must be made available \nto APHIS upon request. To be corrected by August 29, 2025. \n3.158(a)(1) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nThe facility failed to prevent the accumulation excreta and food waste from the primary enclosures housing birds. \n\u2022 The enclosure housing a scarlet macaw had a metal horizontal support bar that was covered with a layer of caked-on \nexcreta and food waste. A hairy white mold-like substance was seen growing from areas of the caked-on waste. The\n\nsame accumulation of waste was seen on a 12-inch pink perch that was attached near this metal support bar. \n\u2022 Inside the enclosure housing a yellow naped parrot, there are two metal cages. The bird was observed sitting on the \ndark gray cage to the left. On the floor of the dark gray cage is an unattached rope perch and wooden frame that has \nbeen chewed. Fragments of the wooden frame are scattered across the floor of the cage with accumulations of excreta \ncovering the rope, wood and floor of the cage. \n \nFailure to clean accumulations of waste materials can increase disease hazards, attract insects, pests, and be a source of \nodors. \n \nExcreta and food waste must be removed from the primary enclosures and from under and from around primary \nenclosures as often as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to reduce disease hazards, \ninsects, pests, and odors. To be corrected by August 25, 2025. \n3.158(c) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nThe facility failed to maintain adequate housekeeping for the premises and surrounding grounds. The facility is located on \nseveral acres of largely undeveloped land with a robust collection of native plants and grasses. The warm temperatures \nand recent heavy rains have led to the rapid growth of the surrounding vegetation. Almost all of the enclosures on \nproperty are surrounded by tall weeds, grasses and overgrown bushes. Many of the weeds and grasses have grown to \nlengths in excess of 4 feet in height. Around the enclosures housing a scarlet macaw and a yellow naped parrot is a pile \nof cut branches from recent pruning. There are also tall grasses and bushes nearby.  \n \nTall weeds and grasses provided nesting grounds and harborage for pests and vermin which can be harmful to the health \nand well-being of the animals housed at the facility. \n \nPremises, including the surrounding grounds must be kept clean in order to facilitate husbandry practices and to reduce \nor eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, pests, and vermin. Weeds, grass, and bushes must be controlled so as \nto facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the birds. To be \ncorrected by August 29, 2025. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. \n \nAdditional Inspectors: \nMoira Roberts, VETERINARY MEDICAL OFFICER n",
