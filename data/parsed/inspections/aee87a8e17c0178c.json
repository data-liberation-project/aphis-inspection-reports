      "narrative": "During the inspection there were three health issues identified that had not been reported to the attending\nveterinarian or treated due to not being observed. A brown hound #4446 had a 'hotspot' type of skin irritation\nlocated on his left shoulder, approximately 6 inches in diameter with a 2 inch pusy center. The skin was red and\noozing tissue fluid due to the irritation and there was some hair loss in the area. The dog did not appear to be in any\nvisible signs of discomfort or pain and looked to be in good condition, however the injury was at least a few days old\ndue to the size when found during the inspection and had not been observed by the staff. The dog was in a pen with\n2 other hounds.\nThere was a sow (#612) that had an extremely swollen right ear that was full of fluid approximately 2-3 inches thick,\nrunning the entire length of the ear 8-9 inches long. There was some red colored fluid oozing around the ear tag and\nthe ear hung down the side of the sows face and over her eye due to the weight. There was a sow (#847) that had a\nfluid filled swelling on top of her left knee approximately 4 inches in diameter. The sow was able to walk, however\nshe did have a limp occasionally due to the swelling. Both sows appeared to be in good health and not in any\nobvious pain, however there were signs of discomfort due to limping by #547 and some head shaking from #612.\nDue to the three injuries not being observed until during the inspection, there had not been any treatment given or\nveterinarian contacted.\nIt is very important that any injuries or illnesses are observed as soon as possible in order to prevent an minor issue\nfrom becoming chronic and to decrease the time an animal is in any discomfort or pain. Daily observations of all\nanimals, especially in large populations (350 dogs/ 1700 pigs) as with this facility need to be conducted making sure\nall animals are made to move and be seen.\nTo be corrected by: CORRECTED\nDuring the inspection the veterinarian had been contacted and all three animals were treated. The dog(#4446) had\nthe injury shaved, cleaned and treated. Sow (#612) had her ear drained and sow (#547) had her knee drained\nunder the direction of the attending veterinarian. All animals are on the facilities treatment log to continue with daily\ntreatment as needed and monitoring until the injuries are resolved under the direction of their veterinarian."
