      "narrative": "During inspection, the following animals were identified in need of veterinary care:\n- A white and grey rabbit was seen with heavily matted and muddy fur on the hind end and on both hind feet. The matts\nwere pedunculated, pulling at the skin beneath. The rabbit squirmed and seemed to experience pain when the matts were\ngently tugged. The rabbit had difficulty hopping/walking with the matts and was seen biting at the matts when sitting down.\nThe rabbit also had many small scabbed over wounds on both ears and on the right side of the neck.\n- Another white rabbit was seen with many ulcerated areas as well as small scabbed over wounds inside both ears. Red\nscratches and small wounds could also be seen on the external portion of the left ear.\n- Two female goats in the hayride area seemed to have hoof issues. A gray and white goat had overgrown hooves in all\nfour feet. She stood with the hooves on the hind feet spread out, walked with a slight limp on the hind feet and would shift\nher weight by alternately lifting one then the other when standing. A white and black goat had overgrown hooves on the\nhind legs and was seen lifting up/not putting weight on the right hind foot. She was reluctant to move, and the bottom of\nthe right hind foot was impacted with dirt/mud.\n- The 5 adult goats in the enclosure near the hayride area all had overgrown hooves extending beyond the toe and\nstarting to curve inward.\nThe applicant did not identify the conditions affecting the above-mentioned animals and therefore did not seek veterinary\nmedical care. In addition, a juvenile black goat with a white spot, was seen holding his right forelimb up when standing\nand limping on that leg when walking. The facility representative explained having noticed this condition on this goat\nbefore but did not treat or contact the attending veterinarian for treatment.\nFailure to promptly identify diseases/injuries as well as neglecting to seek veterinary guidance once problems arise delays\ntreatment and may cause undue pain/distress in animals with conditions such as these listed here. A more rigorous\nmethod of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to assess their health and well-being. Direct and\nfrequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention.\nThe currently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. To be\ncorrected by May 6th, 2023."

Information on the care for these animals is being\nacquired from google, the sellers and the feed supply store employees. The following areas showed the applicant\u2019s lack of\nknowledge of the species:\n- The enclosure for the porcupine was not set up taking into consideration how strong of a burrower the species is. The\nporcupine was able to damage the chain link metal dig barrier provided creating sharp points and there was only a thin\nlayer of dirt over the barrier. The enclosure was set up to prevent climbing, yet this species is not known to be particularly\ninclined to climb and to be more terrestrial.\nThe porcupine enclosure was not provided with a den or bush or items of the sort that would allow the animal\u2019s natural\ntendency to remain in areas that offer security especially while asleep during the day.\nThe applicant did not know of common medical conditions to monitor for a porcupine and did not have a prevention plan.\n- The applicant was not aware of the psychological impact of imprinting on hand reared male kangaroos and did not have\na plan to prevent the development of abnormal/aggressive behavior.\nThe applicant had not started feeding soft hay or greens to the kangaroo during the process of weaning and did not have\na plan on how to have him develop his adult digestive system into a foregut fermenter.\nThe applicant did not have a specific plan for feeding once the kangaroo was weaned.\nInsufficient knowledge or experience of acquired exotic animals, can lead to the use of inappropriate housing, diet, and\nhusbandry measures. The applicant must consult with the attending veterinarian and must acquire the necessary\nknowledge needed to develop a complete plan for hand raising a kangaroo and for caring for a porcupine. The applicant\nneeds to have adequate experience and knowledge of any wild or exotic animals she plans to acquire."
