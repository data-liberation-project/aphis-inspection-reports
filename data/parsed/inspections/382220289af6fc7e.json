The public was observed going into the enclosure to feed and pet the goats. However,\nthere was no attendant available in the area when this took place for the monitoring and handling of the animals.\nThis can increase the risk of harm for the animals and the public.\n* Four enclosures did not have an attendant to observe the animals and public or public barrier fence. These\nenclosures were: an enclosure housing three llamas, seven goats, one sheep; an enclosure housing 10 rabbits; an\nenclosure housing three pigs and an enclosure housing five pigs. The risk of harm to the animals and public is\npotentially possible.\nPublic exhibition of animals or animals the public comes into contact with must be handled so there is minimal risk\nof harm to the animals and the public. This will ensure the safety of the animals and the public."
