All semiannual reports must be reviewed and signed by a\nmajority of the IACUC members, include any minority views, and be submitted to the Institutional Official at least every six\nmonths. These reports must identify and describe departures from the regulations or standards, distinguish significant\nfrom minor deficiencies, and provide a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates correcting each deficiency.\nTO BE CORRECTED ON THE NEXT SEMIANNUAL REPORT.\nThis inspection was conducted with the IACUC Chair, Lab Manager and IACUC Administrator.
