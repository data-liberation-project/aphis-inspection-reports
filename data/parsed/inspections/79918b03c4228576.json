This protocol utilizes two sheep every 10-14 days. There is no record being kept to demonstrate that\nany sheep in this protocol have received the dexamethasone injections. In addition, the sheep are not being\nindividually weighed prior to being used on the protocol. Failure to weigh each individual sheep makes accurate\ndosing extremely difficult. The facility must ensure that accurate weights are obtained for each animal prior to being\nutilized on the protocol. Records must be kept for any medications given to ensure that appropriate relief is being\nprovided for the animals on this study.\nCorrect from this time forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBaker Jeffrey, Veterinary Medical Officer"
