The animals were in good body condition and did not appear lethargic. The\nlicensee had not observed the health conditions in the guinea pigs, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was\nnot administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided\ntreatment options.\nSwellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of the\nanimal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment\nfor disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the\ncondition is contagious.\nThe licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending\nveterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment."
