The male's\nhooves are overgrown and curved under so that weight is being placed on the hoof tips. The female's hooves are\ncurved to the side and the tip of two front hooves are broken. Overgrown hooves may affect gait, result in broken\nhooves and/or lameness. The hooves must be trimmed to prevent these risks. The female is pregnant so the\nlicensee should involve the attending veterinarian in determining course of action for addressing the hooves.\nCorrect by 17 March 2016.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the owner."
