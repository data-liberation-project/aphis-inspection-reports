A\nRedbone Coonhound (Microchip # 98102003968162 ) is thin in appearance. When viewed from the back and side, the\nribs, backbone and hip bones were visible. In addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent waist were observed. Per the\nIACUC representative, the AV found worms in May and treated the animals. He also ordered that the animal be given\ndouble feedings. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted about the animal not\nshowing any improvements or gains from double feedings. The loss of body weight could be an indication this dog is not\nreceiving adequate nutrition or it could be internal problems. This can affect the ability of this dog to gain or maintain it's\nbody weight.\nA yellow male Labrador Retriever ( Microchip # 985112004242042) had dropped hips and struggled to stand. He had a\nprostrated stance and appeared weak. He had pressure sores from laying down on his elbows and legs. The IACUC\nrepresentative stated that in May the animal presented as \"doing fine\" at his last examination but his condition had\nseverely declined in the last 3 weeks. In this time he has been having difficulty ambulating and getting out of it's own urine\nand feces. The IACUC representative stated that his quality of life has drastically changed. At the time of the inspection\nthe facility had not consulted with the AV on recent developments nor was there any follow-up examination to assess his\ncurrent state for a new treatment plan.\nA black female Labrador Retriever's (Microchip # 956000004042894 ) ears were thickened extending into the ear canal.\nThe facility stated that she has always had this condition and they were instructed to clean the ears, which wasn't noted in\nthe medical records. The process has been ongoing but the facility has not consulted the AV on the next step.\nThe use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be made available to\nensure that adequate veterinary care is received."
