      "narrative": "***An adult female German Shepherd Dog (0A01567767) had an accumulation of dark discharge-like material in the\nfur under her right ear. She would also occasionally shake her head and tilt her head down in the direction of the\naffected ear (to the right). According to the licensee, the dog had had a previous injury approximately one year ago\nand a portion of the dog\u2019s right ear flap was missing. Also, according to documentation at the facility initialed by a\nveterinarian in January 2018, the dog had been examined by the attending veterinarian and no additional abnormal\nconditions were noted with the ear at that time. Attempts to make a closer observation of the ear were made during\ninspection, however, the dog seemed painful, whined and shifted and/or shook her head making further observation\ndifficult. Further attempts to examine the dog were not made as she appeared nervous and would run away at\nadditional attempts. The licensee had not noticed the dog\u2019s current ear condition. This dog\u2019s condition could be due\nto an infection, injury or other veterinary medical condition would could be painful. The licensee must consult with a\nveterinarian regarding this dog\u2019s condition. This veterinary consultation is in order to ensure that an accurate\ndiagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.\n***An adult male Poodle (018366883) had matted fur and a ropey-like appearance to his fur generally over his entire\nbody. Clumps of matted fur were present mostly along his legs, towards his lower back and under his tail. There\nwas also fecal material matted in the fur under the tail. Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of\nskin sores. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed and establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all\ndogs.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
