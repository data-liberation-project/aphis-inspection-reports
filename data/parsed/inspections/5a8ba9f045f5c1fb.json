The sink contained a stack of bowls with some brown dirt/grime on their surfaces, a heat\nlamp, plastic scoop, pieces of insulation-like material and some other miscellaneous items. On the bottom surface of the\nsink, some black to brown pellets were observed that appeared to be mice droppings. There was insulation material\nstored under the sink which was visible since there was no door to cover the material. There was another sheltered\nbuilding, housing a dam and her litter, which had a walkway with some food waste that was scattered across much of the\nfloor; there were also some areas on the floor with smears of brownish material that appeared to be fecal material.\nAccording to the licensee the floor had last been cleaned/swept prior to the weekend. Accumulations of trash, junk, waste\nproducts, and discarded matter can increase the risk of pests and could negatively impact the health and well-being of the\nanimals. The buildings and surrounding grounds of the housing facilities must be kept clean and in good repair to protect\nthe animals from injury, to facilitate husbandry practices required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and\nliving areas for rodents and other pests and vermin at all times. The licensee started to address these areas of the\nsheltered buildings after the inspection of the animals and facilities. To be corrected by: May 19, 2021.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
