      "narrative": "***DIRECT - A female Shih Tzu (#956000004724179) had a cloudy right eye. The right eye had a clear to whitish\ngrey mucoid-like discharge present in the corner of it. The fur surrounding the majority of the eye appeared wet with\neye discharge. This discharge extended down the nose and face from the corner of the eye. The fur in this area\nappeared to be discolored red to dark brown. There also appeared to be a divot-like lesion on the surface of the\neye closest to the corner of the eye. The eye was pinkish red around this lesion. The rest of the eye appeared blue\nto green to grey and individual eye structures were not easily visible within the eye. Several red vessel-like\nstructures were observed on the inside of the eye and in the surrounding white tissues. According to written\ndocumentation at the facility, the licensee had \u201ctreated for sore eyes\u201d on September 28, 2016. On October 1, 2016\nthere was a notation that the dog was better and \u201cno treatment needed\u2019. According to the licensee, the dog had not\nbeen treated for an eye condition since October 1st and he had not had the dog seen by a veterinarian for its eye\ncondition. The cloudy eye and discharge could be the result of an injury, infection or other veterinary condition\nwhich may cause discomfort.\n***An approximately 5 \u00bd month old female fawn Pug (#7E10105942) had a right eye that appeared smaller and/or\nsunken compared to the left eye. The dog also had some hair loss and multiple scab-like lesions around its face.\nOn closer observation, the dog\u2019s right eyeball was difficult to see and was mostly covered/surrounded by pinkish\nwhite tissue under its eyelids. According to the licensee, he had treated for a cold in the dog\u2019s eyes when it was a\nyoung puppy and was still with its littermates which he thought had similar conditions but this dog\u2019s eye did not\nrespond as well as the others. The dog also had some hair loss on the outside ear flaps. Both ears had raised, red,\ncrusty, scab-like lesions in the areas of hair loss. The right ear was more affected than the left; the right ear also\nhad a small red and scab-like lesion on the inside of it near its edge. A similar scab-like lesion was observed on the\ntop of the dog\u2019s head. This dog had not been examined by a veterinarian for either condition nor was there any\ndocumentation at the facility of any treatment given to the dog for either condition. This dog\u2019s conditions could be\ndue to injury, infection or other veterinary medical conditions.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate\ndiagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must document\nthis information and provide it to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by: October 14, 2016."
