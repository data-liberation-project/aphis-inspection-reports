Upon closer examination, there was a loose piece on the right side of its mouth. I was not able to\ndetermine whether it was a loose piece of tartar or a loose tooth covered in tartar. I also observed a small amount\nof red fluid coming from this area in what I assume to be blood.\nDental issues can be painful and the mouth/gums can become infected. In addition the infection can become\nsystemic causing further health issues. The dog needs to be seen by the Attending Veterinarian and treated per\nhis/her instructions.\nCorrect by 4/16/19.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd of report."
