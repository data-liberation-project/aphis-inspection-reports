While the facility representative was wiping out the eye, a veterinarian was not\ncontacted for proper diagnosis and treatment.\nThere is a 2.5 month old female Australian shepherd puppy and three male 10 week old bulldog puppies housed together\nthat had some green and/or white discharge coming from the noses and eyes. During the inspection coughing and a\nhacking type noise could be heard from several of them. A raspy breathing sound or the sound similar to mucus in the\nlungs could be heard when listening to their breathing standing next to the enclosure. A veterinarian has not been\ncontacted about the puppies before the inspection.\nThe Australian shepherd puppy appeared to be under weight with the abdomen area being indented more than what is\nnormal, and the hip bones being more pronounced. This puppy had been taken to the vet a week before and the\nveterinarian did not prescribe any treatments advising the puppy seemed fine. However, the day after the vet visit the\npuppy started coughing and the facility decided to medicate and treat themselves instead of contacting the veterinarian for\nproper diagnosis and treatment after other symptoms appeared.\nThe lack of timely veterinary care can cause a treatable condition if caught early, to become more serious or fatal if there\nis no treatment and cause unnecessary pain or discomfort to the regulated animals. Self treatment with antibiotics/drugs\nwithout the proper diagnosis and consultation of the veterinarian can pose a serious risk for the regulated animals if the\nmedicine is incorrect for the problem and/or the animal is over or under dosed for the health issue.\nA veterinarian must be consulted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the regulated animals.\nTo be corrected by: The licensee made an appointment with the veterinarian during the inspection for October 13, 2021"
