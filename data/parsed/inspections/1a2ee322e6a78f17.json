An elevated shelter/den box (approximately 5.5 feet off the\nground) that a gray fox was sleeping in had flooring that was coming loose and a corner of the flooring was separating\nfrom the walls with the corner flapping/moving as the fox was breathing. The side of a wolf shelter in an enclosure\ncontaining 3 wolves had the back wall coming off. The underground fencing in the arctic fox enclosure was washed out\nunderneath and there was a gap between the fencing and the ground underneath. The same enclosure also had rabbit\nwire with sharp points protruding from it into the enclosure. Screwheads/nailheads were sticking out on the flooring of\nvarious wooden resting platforms in multiple fox and bobcat enclosures. An igloo shelter for an enclosure containing 6\nwolves was cracked and had a hole in it.\nThese maintenance issues create various safety hazards for the animals. The fox could potentially fall through the flooring\nof its shelter as its sleeping. Shelter with holes in it or the walls coming off doesn't properly protect the animals from the\nelements of the weather. The underground fencing with the gap underneath could potentially cause injury if the arctic fox\nstepped through the fencing and got its leg stuck. Sharp points in an enclosure can also cause injury.\nAll shelter or resting platforms being provided to the animals need to be fixed and maintained so no\nscrewheads/nailheads or sharp points are sticking out, no walls or floors are falling off of the provided shelters, and no\nanimals can stick their limbs through the underground fencing as they walk through their shelter."
