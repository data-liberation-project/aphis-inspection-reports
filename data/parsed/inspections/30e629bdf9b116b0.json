The employee stated that Superior\nwill immediately apply for a registration. Handling animals in an airport moving from above-wing to below-wing without the\nrequired regulatory oversight can lead to unregulated handling of animals, putting the animals at risk of unnecessary\nbehavioral stress, trauma, escape, physical harm, or loss of life. The regulations require that each carrier and\nintermediate handler register with the Secretary by completing and filing a properly executed form which will be furnished,\nupon request, by the Deputy Administrator.\nConducting regulated activity without a valid registration violates the Federal Animal Welfare Act.\nNo regulated activity can be conducted until a valid registration certificate is issued by USDA Animal Care.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.\nn"
