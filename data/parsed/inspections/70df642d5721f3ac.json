      "narrative": "A female white Bichon (Microchip #103820126, DOB 06/23/09) has a section of discolored hair on the lower part of\nher left front leg. Closer inspection revealed an approximately 2 centimeter irregularly shaped section of skin that\nwas mostly hairless. The skin in this area was mildly reddened with small dark spots on the surface of it. This\naffected section of skin was also raised and felt firm in some areas and softer in other areas. The hair surrounding\nthis section of skin was slightly damp. The licensee stated that she had not consulted a veterinarian about the\ncondition of this dog's leg.\nA female Shih Tzu approximately 8 years old (Microchip # 080-876-540) has moderately cloudy eyes. The\ncloudiness is irregularly shaped and is present throughout each eye. There is a thick yellow-green discharge with\ncrusting present on the eyelids of both eyes. The licensee states that she spoke with her attending veterinarian on\nJanuary 30th, 2016 regarding this dog's eyes. The veterinarian prescribed an eye medication twice a day for five\ndays. The licensee states that they have not spoken with the veterinarian regarding this dog since January 30th;\nhowever, they have continued the treatments as initially prescribed by the veterinarian. Although this dog was\ninitially evaluated by the attending veterinarian, its eye condition has not resolved and the animal needs to be\nre-evaluated by a veterinarian to update the treatment plan. This dog also has a severe build-up of a thick, grey/tan\nmaterial encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth and nearly the entire surface of the canines and front teeth.\nThe majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the grey/tan\nmaterial. All of the gums are moderately red and swollen and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth.\nA female Shih Tzu (Microchip #048-063-513) has cloudy eyes. The surface of the left eye is moderately cloudy and\nthere are blood vessels running across the surface of the eye from the white of the eye. The right eye is severely\ncloudy and nearly the entire surface of the eye has a brown discoloration. There is mild amount of thick brown\ndischarge and crusting on the eyelids of both eyes. The licensee provided documentation that they noticed a\nproblem with the eyes on January 26th, 2016, but they have neither treated the animal nor have spoken to a\nveterinarian regarding the eyes.\nA male Bichon (Microchip # 004375805) has a cloudy right eye. The eye is mildly cloudy throughout the surface of\nthe eye. There is an excessive amount of clear drainage present on both the top and bottom eyelids. The hair is\nseverely wet and matted from the drainage. This dog also has a severe build-up of a thick, grey/tan material\nencasing all of its upper and lower cheek teeth. The majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized\ndue to the excessive build-up of the grey/tan material. All of the gums are severely red and swollen and in some\nareas they are pulled back from the teeth. In many areas of the mouth, the gums are bleeding and there is a creamy\ndischarge present along the gum-line. The licensee states that this dog has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.\nDental, eye and skin conditions such as these can be painful and/or distressful to the animal and may lead to further\nhealth complications. All animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that\nan accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,\nincluding the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the\ninspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times."

      "narrative": "In the outdoor section of one enclosure in the \"Female Building\" the inspectors observed one female Shih Tzu that\nwas walking in a hesitant/shuffling manner. Physical inspection of the dog revealed no abnormalities and she was\nplaced back in her enclosure and walked with a normal gait while on the solid surface of the indoor section of her\nkennel. When the dog returned to the outdoor section of the enclosure, whose floor is constructed of tenderfoot\nflooring, she once again began to walk cautiously. As the inspectors watched, the dog's feet and legs began to fall\nthrough the openings of the tenderfoot flooring. Feet and legs passing through openings in the floor could cause\ninjury to the dog.\nPrimary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from\ninjury and do not allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through any openings. The licensee must house this dog in\nan enclosure where the openings in the floor are not large enough to allow her feet and legs to pass through. The\nlicensee must ensure that all flooring in all used primary enclosures is safe for the dogs at all times.\nCorrection date: February 12, 2016\nExit interview was conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Heather Cole, VMO and the facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCole Heather, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
