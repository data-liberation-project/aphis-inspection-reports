At\n11am on 5/8/14 the licensee had moved the dogs from two separate enclosures without shade or shelter into one of\nthe enclosures together. The licensee hung a black material over a corner of the enclosure to provide shade.\nHowever, the licensee only provided one medium size dog house.

The National Weather Service predicts rain and thunderstorms for the next 5 days.\nAdequate shelter is necessary to protect the animals from the elements. The licensee shall provide one or more\nshelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow\neach animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to\nthe shelter structures, one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large enough to contain all\nthe animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun.
