Two rabbits had large swollen nipples that had turned black. Two rabbits\nhad large sores on their hocks so that they were reluctant to move. One rabbit had a head tilt and was circling. One rabbit\nhad protruding teeth and was not eating. All of these conditions are chronic in nature but had not been noted by the\nlicensee or his employees. When conditions go unidentified, treatment is delayed and they can become more severe,\ncausing increased suffering, and even death in the animals. All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and\nwell-being and any problems promptly communicated with the veterinarian. Correct immediately."
