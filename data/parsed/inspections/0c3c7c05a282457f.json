      "narrative": "One adult, tan, female dachshund (\"Phyllis\" Microchip # 076112937) has a severe build-up of a thick, yellow/tan\nmaterial encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth and approximately half of the surface of each canine. The\nmajority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the yellow/tan\nmaterial. There is a yellow/tan/milky substance running along the top of all of the upper cheek teeth near the gum\nline. The gums are severely red and swollen and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth. All of the dogs(cid:25)\nnails were excessively long and starting to curl. One nail on the back, right foot was severely long and curled back\nonto the side of the foot pad.\nOne adult, female, grey and white poodle (Tag # 183) is limping and carrying her left, front foot. There is a small,\nsoft, approximately 1-2 cm in diameter, red/dark pink swelling on the top of the same foot. Cloudy, red fluid was\nexpressed when the licensee squeezed the swelling. The animal (cid:28)yipped(cid:29) slightly when the licensee touched the\nswelling. The licensee stated that the dog occasionally limps but he had not noticed the swelling which he called an\nabscess. Immediately, the licensee obtained 4/10 of a cc of penicillin and placed it within the opening of the\nswelling. There is no documentation that this animal has been seen by a veterinarian for this issue or that the\nlicensee has consulted with the veterinarian about treating swellings, such as abscesses, with penicillin in this\nmanner.\nConditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. Both animals listed above\nmust be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an\nappropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and\nresolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee\nmust ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.\nOne, adult, black shih tzu (\"Ziggy\" Microchip # 0A02130637) and one, adult, grey and white, cocker spaniel/poodle\ncross (no ID) have severely matted hair-coats. On both of the dogs, the majority of the mats are on the back half of\nthe body, but there are mats on the chest and sides of the body as well. The hair all over the body and face of both\ndogs was very long and clumped together. The hair around the face of the shih tzu was wet and hung down in front\nof the eyes.\nThe inspectors were unable to do a hands-on physical exam for these two dogs due to their aggressive nature. The\nlicensee confirms these dogs are matted.\nMatting can be painful and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. All dogs need to have their hair\ncoats routinely maintained in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases associated with excessive\nmatting."
