Earlier in the day, the animals had been handled for diagnostic testing and transferred to clean\nenclosures. However, one owl monkey was missed and remained in the nest box while it was transferred to the\ncage wash room , hosed down and processed through the cage wash. Failure to properly transfer the animal for\ncleaning purposes according to the Owl Monkey Husbandry SOP caused the animal to go through the cage wash. It\nis unknown if the animal was alive prior to the cage entering the cage wash. A necropsy diagnosis to determine\ncause of death was not possible due to the condition of the remains.\nThe IACUC immediately investigated the incident and promptly notified the USDA inspector. Corrective actions\nimplemented include retraining employees on the SOP for sanitation and adding additional requirements to the SOP\nwhich include additional ID on cages, opening cage doors during transport to cage wash, a closer check of the nest\nbox and a final check of the entire cage by the cage wash attendant. Animal observations will be made at a time of\nday when the animals are more likely to be active allowing for an improved assessment of animal health.\nInappropriate handling of animals can lead to unnecessary pain or distress. Handling of all animals shall be done as\nexpeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,\nbehavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCORRECT FROM THIS TIME FORWARD\nThe focused inspection was conducted with the facility director and employees."
