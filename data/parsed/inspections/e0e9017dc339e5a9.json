The fence\nshould consistently meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. This facility should have a\nperimeter fence which adequately prevents people and animals from passing through or under the fence, and which\ncan also act as a secondary containment system for the animals on exhibit. This facility houses animals such as big\ncats, bears, hyenas, and elephants, and therefore the perimeter fence should be at least eight feet in height, and it\nshould either fully enclose the whole premises, or the areas where these animals are housed, with a perimeter\nfence measuring at least six feet in height for the other animals. There should be a separation of at least three feet\nbetween the animals on exhibit and the perimeter fence, and it should preclude contact with people or animals. The\nfence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here. Failure to\nmeet these standards could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.\nThis is a repeat citation; it was previously cited in 2012, 2013, and 2015.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representatives."
