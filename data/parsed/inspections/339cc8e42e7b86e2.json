The protocol\nhad poorly described the guidelines for closely monitoring the ferrets during the study. It was determined that there were\nno specific parameters or signs described to properly evaluate the health and well-being of the animals during the\nadministration of the smoke that would alert the observer of any pain and/or distress exhibited such as discomfort, uneven\nbreathing or cessation of breathing. The fact that there were no specific parameters in place to properly evaluate the\nphysical state allowed the oversight of 3 ferrets succumbing to the lack of appropriately mixed air/smoke exposure without\nany intervention in a timely manner. There needs to be a more effective and precise way to monitor the health of the\nanimals while receiving cigarette smoke/air to prevent the likelihood of another animal being misevaluated to prevent the\nanimals from experiencing unnecessary pain and distress and/or death. The cigarette smoke exposure protocol must\ncontain a description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to the animals will be limited to that which\nis unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research. Correct by 3/24/2021.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, IACUC Chair, IACUC Director,\nAssociate VP Research Regulatory Office and Associate IACUC Director.\nEnd Section"
