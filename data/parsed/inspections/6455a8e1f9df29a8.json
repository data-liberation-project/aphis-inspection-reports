Pools must be of sufficient\nsurface area and depth to allow each bird to make normal postural and social adjustments, such as immersion, bathing,\nswimming, and foraging, with freedom to escape from aggression demonstrated by other birds in the enclosure. Dry areas\nmust be of sufficient size to allow each bird to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of\nmovement and freedom to escape from aggression demonstrated by other birds in the enclosure.\nCorrection Date: December 31, 2025.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
