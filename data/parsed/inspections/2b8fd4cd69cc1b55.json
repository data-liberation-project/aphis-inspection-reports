The humane endpoints on the IACUC approved protocol\nstate that if symptoms of ocular pain become so severe that the animal cannot open the eye and is reluctant to manually\nmanipulating the eye to open, the animal will be euthanized. Research records and research staff indicate that 4 rabbits\nexhibited severe conjunctival swelling and redness. The research staff further report that the animals were so reluctant to\nopen their eyes that general anesthetic was employed to restrain several animals for experimental observations. Per\nresearch staff, observations on this study are usually conducted on alert animals with brief manual restraint.\nFailure of the research personnel to adhere to the humane endpoints in the IACUC approved protocol resulted in these\nanimals experiencing unrelieved pain and distress and constitutes a significant change that was not reviewed or approved\nby the committee.\nOn April 27th during inspector review of an animal room containing rabbits, a research staff member was observed to\nadminister eye drops (buffered salt solution, or BSS) to one rabbit. On discussion with the lab member, the PI had\ndirected its administration to assess whether the solution was contributing to adverse reactions being observed in\nexperimental animals. The use of BSS is approved on the protocol for lubrication of the eye throughout the contact lens\nstudy, but the experimental assessment of topically administered BSS in a na\u00efve rabbit was not reviewed or approved by\nthe IACUC. Changes in experimental design that include the addition of animal procedures and/or increase the number of\nanimals used must undergo IACUC review and approval prior to being implemented.\nAny proposed significant changes to ongoing activities must be reviewed by the IACUC and must be approved by the\ncommittee before the research activity is conducted.\nTo be corrected by May 2nd, 2022, or prior to the use of further animals on this protocol.\nA focused inspection was conducted starting on April 27, 2022. This inspection report is limited to the Direct non-\ncompliance identified during that inspection. An additional inspection report will be delivered with the other issues\nidentified during this inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted April 27-28, 2022 and the exit briefing was conducted with the Vivarium Manager and\nIACUC Chair on April 28, 2022. A second exit briefing with additional facility representatives was conducted on May 2,\n2022.\nEnd Section"
