The category D protocol (#1632) described postoperative pain control procedures including at a\nminimum an injection of buprenorphine immediately postoperatively. Procedure/treatment cards, observed at the\ntime of the inspection, showed that no buprenorphine had been given to the first set of animals (approximately 17 of\nthem) undergoing the surgery between the dates of June 9 -14, 2017. When the attending veterinarian was notified\nof a hamster that was not doing well after the surgery, she discovered the omission of buprenorphine. The IACUC\nmust ensure that activities that involve surgery must include appropriate provisions for post-operative care of the\nanimals and that researchers and staff are trained in appropriate surgical and postoperative care. The lack of\nappropriate post-operative analgesics, as approved by the IACUC, can result in unnecessary discomfort and pain\nfor the hamsters.\nThe following corrective action has been taken: The attending veterinarian stated that a review, observation, and\ncorrections of the surgical procedures and care was conducted and staff were re-instructed on following protocols\nas approved. Treatment cards starting on June 14, 2017 indicated that buprenorphine was being administered.\nAppropriate changes were instituted by the attending veterinarian to correct this noncompliance."

      "narrative": "A principal investigator conducted a surgical procedure on hamsters using a surgical approach and post-operative\ncare that was not approved in their protocol. The procedures/approach that were used differed significantly form the\nIACUC approved protocol. An animal was euthanized following complications in this surgical procedure. The\ncategory D protocol (#1632) for hamsters contained an ovariectomy procedure indicating the use of a ventral\nmidline approach. At the time of inspection, multiple hamsters on this protocol were observed to have lateral flank\nincisions. The IACUC approved post-operative procedures also included pain management with buprenorphine, but\nthis was not provided for the initial set of animals.\nThe attending veterinarian indicated that she was notified by the staff caring for the animals that one of the first\nanimals to have surgery was not doing well. After assessing the animal it was euthanized and a necropsy was\nperformed. The veterinarian indicated that the incision site had not been sutured closed appropriately and there was\nintestinal herniation/entrapment. Two additional hamsters have been euthanized post-operatively but the cause is\nstill under investigation. The veterinarian stated that a review, observation, and corrections of the surgical\nprocedures and care was conducted and staff were re-instructed on following protocols as approved. Written reports\non the this incident and corrective action were not yet available at the time of the inspection. The attending\nveterinarian stated that a revision of the protocol is being submitted by the researcher to the IACUC and that they\nplan to report the matter to OLAW.\nA proposal to conduct an activity involving animals or to make significant changes in an ongoing activity involving\nanimals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals and must be approved by the\nIACUC. Changes to procedures must be approved prior to their implementation to ensure the changes are in\naccordance with this subchapter and to ensure the procedures avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to\nthe animals. Failure to have the changes approved by the IACUC can lead to unnecessary pain, discomfort and\ndistress. The researcher must submit a proposal that accurately describes the procedures to be performed and\ndemonstrate that personnel performing the procedures are adequately trained.\nCorrect from this point forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian."
