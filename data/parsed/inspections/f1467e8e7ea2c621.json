The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel\npoles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest\nupon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep\nroots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is\napproximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. The enclosure currently houses a ~3 year old male lion and a ~ 2\nyear old female lion with limited mobility. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure\ncontainment of the animal. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats, additional\ncontainment measures must be made to the lion enclosure to prevent escape.\nNOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were made.\nThe exit briefing was conducted with the owner."
