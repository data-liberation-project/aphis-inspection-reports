A veterinarian needs to be contacted whenever there\nis a sign of disease so the disease can be properly diagnosed and the animal treated. This will improve your\nreproductive success and increase the welfare of your animals. While it is up to the discretion of your attending\nveterinarian, significant numbers of unexplained deaths warrant diagnostics be preformed which may include a\nnecropsy.
