      "narrative": "Multiple dogs had medical issues that had not been identified by the facility or treated by the Attending Veterinarian (AV)\nprior to the inspection.\n***A 10-year-old female yellow Labrador dog (\u201cSpring\u201d, microchip 900215003196994) had an approximate 0.5 inch\ndiameter firm round mammary mass on the right side. Adjacent to this mass were several pink skin sutures. Facility\npersonnel had not identified the mammary mass or sutures prior to the inspection. There is no mammary mass noted in\nthe medical records and no recent surgery records to explain the sutures.\n***An 8-year-old female Weimaraner (\u201cStar\u201d, microchip #995112004242291) had an approximately 2-inch-long oval\nshaped firm movable lump in the middle of her back, over the spine in the lower back area. This lump had not been\nidentified by the facility staff prior to the inspection, had not been documented in the medical records, and had not been\ncommunicated to the Attending Veterinarian (AV).\n***A 2-year-old male Beagle dog (\u201cRanger\u201d, microchip #956000012520481) was very thin. When viewed from above and\nfrom the side, the ribs and backbone are clearly visible. In addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent waist were\nobserved. The dog\u2019s ribs and backbone were easily palpable with very little fat overlying the bones. This dog was not\nidentified by the facility as being excessively thin prior to the inspection. Medical records show the dog was last evaluated\nby the Attending Veterinarian in May 2022, there are no entries since that time. According to facility records, the dog has\nlost 3.2 lbs since November: the document provided by the facility representative stated this dog weighed 22.4 lbs in\nNovember 2023 and 19.2 lbs in December 2023, a loss of 14.2% body weight in one month.\n***A 12-year-old female yellow Labrador dog (\u201cBlue\u201d, microchip #956000012520839) has difficulty standing, walking, and\nmoving around her enclosure. The dog moves slowly and is reluctant to walk. She has noticeable weakness in her hind\nlegs. Her hind limbs are noticeably stiff, with little muscle, and she appeared to have difficulty controlling them to maintain\nnormal posture. The facility had not identified this dog as having issues with her hind limbs prior to the inspection, and\nmedical records show no observation or entries since April 2022.\n***Two dogs had severe dental disease that had not been previously identified by the facility:\nThe first dog, a 5-year-old female Harrier dog (\u201cPenny\u201d, microchip 956000012520534) had severe dental disease. Thick\nbrown hard material was seen on the back upper teeth, covering the teeth completely, and the gums around these teeth\nwere red and swollen. There was a small amount of grey material at the gum line.\nThe second dog, a 10-year-old male yellow Labrador dog (\u201cEagles\u201d microchip #3196987) had severe dental disease. On\nthe left side there was thick brown material covering most of the upper back teeth. On the right side there was thick brown\nmaterial completely covering three upper back teeth with grey material and hair present at the gum line. The gums around\nall of the affected teeth were red and swollen.\nDaily observation of animals for health and behavior problems is essential for the prompt identification and treatment of\nthese issues. Animals who have problems that are not promptly identified by the facility and communicated to the\nattending veterinarian may suffer from discomfort, pain, stress, disease progression, and even death. Correct by ensuring\nthat daily observations are conducted on all animals, and that all issues are reported to the Attending Veterinarian\npromptly so that assessment and treatment can be provided."
