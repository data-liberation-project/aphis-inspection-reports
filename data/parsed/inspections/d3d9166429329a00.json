These animals should be evaluated and treated as determined appropriate by the Attending\nVeterinarian (AV).\nThree adult donkeys are obese, with heavily crested necks and excess fat along the back and rump. At least two of\nthem have misshapen front hooves consistent with chronic founder. None appear to be lame at this time. A female\norphan foal with the jenny by the house appears to be unthrifty; she looks thin and has a scruffy haircoat.\nIt is reported that none of these have been evaluated by the AV for these conditions. Obesity in donkeys\npredisposes them to various health problems like laminitis. Acute laminitis is not only painful, it can be\nlife-threatening. A management plan to reduce weight to reduce the risk of obesity-related health problems needs to\nbe formulated with the AV. The foal needs to be evaluated to determine if intervention is necessary to help improve\nher health status.\nCorrect by 11/27/2015."
