The week prior, the\nlicensee had sent the area supervisor an email explaining that she was in and out and didn'(cid:25)t want (cid:28)\"Doris'(cid:25)s\nreplacement(cid:29)\" to waste their time trying to do an inspection. Because of that email, an attempt was made to inspect\nlater than the common 8 to 5 business hours, but well within the defined business hours in the Regulations which\nare from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. According to 9CFR 2.126(a) licensees must allow APHIS officials to enter their place\nof business and carry out their official duties during working hours\nMs. O(cid:25)Neal was in her yard with several dogs when I pulled into her driveway. I attempted to crack my car door to\ntell her who I was but she started yelling for me to stay in the car. I shut the door and waited while she put up the\ndogs. I then rolled down the window and asked if it was safe to get out. Ms. O(cid:25)Neal said yes and then began\nyelling that I should have called before driving down the driveway. The licensee was verbally harassing from the\nbeginning even after I identified myself as an APHIS official. I asked her if she was done yelling at me because if\nshe continued I was going to write her up for harassment of and interference with an APHIS official. The licensee(cid:25)s\ncomments were (cid:28)\"You do what you have to do(cid:29)\", \"(cid:28)I don(cid:25)t care who you are, you don(cid:25)'t come down my driveway\nwithout calling....you'(cid:25)re lucky you didn(cid:25)'t get a bullet in you.\"\nThe comments and the licensee(cid:25)'s manner were threatening and verbally abusive. I considered the comment about\na bullet to be a threat and a refusal for inspection so I immediately left the property.\nLicensee should be more receptive to the inspection process and allow inspections to occur without incident from\nthis day forward."
