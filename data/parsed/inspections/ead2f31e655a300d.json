It appeared difficult for some of the dogs to maneuver around the fecal material in the outdoor\nportion of the sheltered building; however, there were some areas of flooring that did not have fecal material and the\ndogs could avoid it. According to the licensee, it had been two to three days since the outside of the enclosures had\nbeen cleaned. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease hazards and the dogs becoming soiled.\nThe licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact are spot-cleaned daily and\nsanitized in accordance with Sec 3.11 (b) to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. To be\ncorrected by: October 30, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
