The licensee said that one of her dogs has\nmammary tumors and has not been seen by a vet, but it was being euthanized by gunshot next week. The\ninspector removed her camera from the vehicle and the licensee said, \"(cid:28)You can'(cid:25)t take photos, I don'(cid:25)t allow that\nhere.\"(cid:29) so the inspector explained that photos were required of this dog, but the licensee continued to ask, \"(cid:28)Why do\nyou have to take a picture of a dog I'(cid:25)m putting down next week?\"(cid:29) Inspector responded to the question with the\nsame answer each time, yet the licensee continued to ask it; interfering with the inspection process.\nDuring the time the inspector was at the facility she asked the licensee multiple times if she should start the\ninspection or leave. The licensee would agree to the inspection and then tell the inspector to leave if she was going\nto take photos. When the inspector asked for the final time if she should do the inspection, the licensee agreed to it,\nbut when the inspector said she would put any non-compliance items on the report, the licensee threw out her arms\nand said, \"(cid:28)Oh no, then I(cid:25)'m not letting you in!(cid:29)\"\nThe licensee'(cid:25)s husband arrived and told the inspector, \"(cid:28)You'(cid:25)re not taking photos here.(cid:29)\" He then challenged the\ninspector by asking, a minimum of four times,\"(cid:28)How long have you worked here?\"(cid:29) and then demanded to know why\nthe inspector wouldn'(cid:25)t answer the question. Licensee then aggressively said to the inspector, \"(cid:28)All you do is come\nhere and give us trouble with the Animal Welfare people!(cid:29)\" Inspector said, \"(cid:28)No it'(cid:25)s not(cid:29),\" and he angrily said,\"\n(cid:28)What do you do!(cid:29)\" The inspector then entered her vehicle and left the facility at 1:24pm.\nThe line of questioning by licensee(cid:25)'s husband was an attempt to make the inspector feel incompetent and did not\npertain to the current inspection. The inspector felt that his statements referring to animal welfare people and\ndemanding to know, \"(cid:28)What do you do!\"(cid:29) were threatening and made the decision to exit the premises. The\nlicensee(cid:25)'s continued asking of the same question interfered with the start of the inspection and the inspector'(cid:25)s\nability to regulate the licensee(cid:25)s facility to enforce the Animal Welfare Act.
