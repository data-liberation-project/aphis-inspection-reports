      "narrative": "\"Sassy\", a female bobcat was observed with a broken right front leg approximately three inches up from the toes.\nDuring the last inspection the foot was dangling and it was clearly broken. There was no broken skin or discharge\nobserved. The licensee stated that \"Sassy\" had arrived at the facility in this condition and had been seen by the\nveterinarian. The licensee further stated that the veterinarian said that nothing could be done for the animal. When\nthe licensee was asked for the medical documents, she indicated they were at the veterinarian clinic, but she would\nobtain them.\nOn today's inspection the licensee was asked again for medical documentation, but could not provide any. The\nattending veterinarian was contacted and it was discovered that the attending veterinarian had no knowledge of a\nbobcat with a broken leg at the licensee's facility. The inspector was unable to view \"Sassy\" as she was in the area\nwhere other bobcats had just given birth and another was about to give birth.\nThe use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat animals is a requirement of this section of\nthe Animal Welfare Act. Failure to obtain appropriate veterinarian care for Sassy has caused \"Sassy\" unnecessary\npain and discomfort from the bone on bone contact and may have caused a lifetime disability.\nThe licensee is required to have \"Sassy\" seen by the attending veterinarian and to follow all recommendations\nincluding those regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment and future recheck examinations as needed.\nAdditionally, the licensee must maintain a record of these recommendations for APHIS officials.\nThe license was verbally instructed to make phone contact with the attending veterinarian and have a medical\nappointment by close of business September 17, 2015, same day as the inspection.\nAn exit interview was conducted with facility representative."
