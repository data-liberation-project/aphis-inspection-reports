There were two\nareas approximately 2 inches long, 1/2 inch wide of exposed muscle tissue that was caught in the buckle of the\ncollar. There was some yellow/green infected mucus with a very strong odor was oozing from the muscle tissue that\nwas caught in the buckle. The collar had been put on the pup and not checked as she grew, causing the collar to\ncut into her neck.

All collars on the\nregulated animals must be checked and loosened to prevent injuries.\nThe attending veterinarian was contacted during the inspection, and coming to the property by the end of the day.\nThe collar was removed and treatment being provided.\nTo be corrected by: February 16, 2017"
