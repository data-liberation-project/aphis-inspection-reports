Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin which is painful and cause\npotential skin irritations. Long nails may get caught in the wire mesh which could lead to injury. Long nails may also\ncause abnormal splaying of the toes which can lean to chronic foot problems. These dogs need to be groomed on a\nroutine basis to prevent these mats from developing and to keep the nails an appropriate length for the health and\nsafety of the dog.\n**In addition, #13 \"Brady\" was noted to be thin with prominent back bones and hip bones on back end and easily felt\nribs. He is a young adult animal (4 years), and has access to ad lib food. There may be an underlying health\nproblem that is causing him to lose weight or preventing him from gaining weight. This dog should be assessed by\nthe attending veterinarian to appropriately diagnose and treat any issue.\n*** In addition, # 25 Megan was noted to have accumulation of tartar and redness of the gums. Routine dental care\nneeds to be addressed at this facility for adequate prevention and control of dental problems. This dog should be\nassessed by the attending veterinarian for appropriate dental care.\nCorrect by: December 14th, 2017"
