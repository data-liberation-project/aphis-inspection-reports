This head position does not change whether the fox is standing,\nwalking, or laying down. The licensee states the AV has examined this animal for this issue in the past and it is a long-\nstanding issue. She also reports that this fox is not very handleable for treatments.\nAPHIS officials spoke with the AV on the day of the inspection. The AV reports Ruger has a history a polyp (benign mass)\ninside the right ear canal. Some topical medication had then been prescribed to help control location inflammation caused\nby the mass. The AV had not noted a head tilt at that time. The AV was neither aware the mass has grown, nor that the\nfox currently has a head tilt. He reports that with the condition worsening an examination would be in order so he can\ndetermine the best course of action moving froward.\nThe licensee must ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries\nfor animals of the facility. The licensee must have this fox evaluated by the AV for appropriate diagnostic and prognostic\nrecommendations.
