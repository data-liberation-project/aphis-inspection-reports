      "narrative": "***A female Chocolate Lab ( #94) was limping, and favoring her right front paw. Upon closer observation, noticed a\nquarter sized mass connected to a middle digital pad and laying between the digital pad and the metacarpal pad.\nThis mass was large enough that it was extended past the digital pads. The skin between the toes was reddened.\nThere was also a dime size abrasion on the back of the metacarpal pad. The mass and abrasion on this paw could\nbe the result of an injury, infection, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may cause discomfort. The\nlicensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding this animal's condition by April 10, 2015 in order to\nobtain an accurate diagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nVeterinary care for Border Collie (083) from the February 26, 2015 inspection has been addressed.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee and Chad Proctor ACI."
