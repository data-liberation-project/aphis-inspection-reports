However, the\nIACUC did not prepare and submit to the Institutional Official the required reports of the evaluations it conducted on those\ndates. The IACUC records reviewed showed that the IACUC identified multiple deficiencies during the semi-annual facility\ninspections it conducted including holes in the yard, outdoor housing needing repairs, broken doors, paint chipping in\nruns, and a back door needing repair. However, a lack of completing the required evaluation reports means that the\nIACUC members failed to distinguish these deficiencies as significant or minor and failed to document a reasonable and\nspecific plan and schedule with dates for correcting these deficiencies. Failure to continuously provide complete and\nthorough semiannual reports to the Institutional Official hinders the facility\u2019s ability to adequately address animal welfare\nconcerns appropriately."
