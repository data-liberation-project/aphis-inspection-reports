There is a heavy gauge metal chain wrapped around a\ntree in the whitetail deer enclosure that presents a risk of entanglement. A wooden feeder in the shelter for the\nwhitetail deer has nails exposed on one end. Fencing material is used to keep the bison from damaging the trees\ninside the enclosure. At least one of the trees has broken wires on the fencing leaving sharp points protruding\noutward and some of the fencing material used consists of barbed wire also with sharp points. Sharp points, nails or\nother risks such as chains present physical hazards that could cause injury to the animals. The licensee already had\nplans to replace the stretch of fence between the whitetail deer and bison enclosures and has the supplies on hand;\nhowever, sharp points must be addressed in the meantime to minimize injury risks to the animals. Remove, repair\nor replace the above mentioned areas to prevent injury. Correct by July 30, 2014."
