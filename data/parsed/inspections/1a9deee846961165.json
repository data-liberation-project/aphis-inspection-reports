The rabbits\nare now being housed in outdoor enclosures that do not have a fence to keep predators from having contact with\nthe rabbits. Coyotes have been seen on the premises of the outdoor housing facility. Rabbits housed outdoors are\nvulnerable to attacks by predators; therefore outdoor housing facilities for rabbits are required to be fenced, or\notherwise enclosed, to prevent the entrance of predators. Failure to provide this fencing in a manner that excludes\npredators can lead to severe injury and / or the death of animals. In addition, as rabbits are prey species, presence\nof predators can cause stress even if they are not physically harmed. The licensee must ensure that the rabbit\nenclosures are fenced or are otherwise enclosed to minimize escape, to prevent entrance of predators.\nCorrection date 1 July 2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
