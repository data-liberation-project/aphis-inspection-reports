Review of Protocol #2012-014: The 2/19/14 modification approved by the IACUC added a new animal use\nprocedure that also included different anesthetic agents than the anesthetic agents that were approved by the\nIACUC in the original protocol. The 2/19/14 modification that was approved by the IACUC did not include a\ndescription of the dosages for the new anesthetic agents.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, a proposal for animal use must contain a description of procedures designed to\nassure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited in order to minimize discomfort and pain to the animals. A\ndescription of the analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs is required in order for the IACUC to determine that\nthe proposed activities are in accordance with all of the requirements of this subchapter.\nThe IACUC needs to address this item as identified for both of these proposals.\nCorrect by 5/30/14.\nNOTE - Exit interview held 5/15/14 on-site with facility representatives.
