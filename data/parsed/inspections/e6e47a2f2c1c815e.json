This lesion penetrated full thickness of the skin and was deeply\npacked with a large amount of white, toothpaste consistency discharge. Neither of these veterinary issues had been\nnoted by the licensee and had not been communicated to the attending veterinarian.\nDaily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being must be completed. Daily observation of animals\nmay be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian. A mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal\nhealth, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nDaily observations must be made of all animals housed at the facility. The attending veterinarian must be contacted when\na veterinary issue is noticed to alleviate these painful conditions."
