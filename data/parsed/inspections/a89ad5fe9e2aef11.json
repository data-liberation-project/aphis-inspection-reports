The potential for increased\ninsect & pest infestation exists when animal waste is not removed in a timely manner but allowed to buildup in the\nlitter boxes. The potential for respiratory problems exists when the cats are subjected to the continual smell of\nanimal waste that is collecting. Removal of animal waste in the litter boxes in a timely manner before build up\noccurs is necessary to ensure the health & well being of all cats.
