      "narrative": "There is a female Brown bear 'Chloe' in the enclosure containing two other bears that had an unknown injury in the\narea of the left elbow, where there was a significant amount of bright red blood in the fur. The blood was rubbed on\nthe left side of the muzzle and on the outside of the left thigh in the fur coat. It is unclear where the blood is coming\nfrom, however the injury appeared to be bleeding during the inspection. The other bears did not come out of the\nshelter and it is unknown if the other bears have an injury due to a fight, or if there was a separate issue that caused\ninjury to this bear. This injury had not been observed until found during the inspection, and therefore was not yet\nseen by the veterinarian.\nThere was a Kangaroo that had died of unknown causes that the veterinarian had not been contacted for. When the\nanimal first presented it was ill, and the licensee did not contact the veterinarian. A person in Australia was\ncontacted instead, and the animal died within 24hrs. A necropsy was never conducted and a veterinarian was never\nconsulted.\nThere were two baby otters that died due to a possible formula issue, however a veterinarian was not contacted and\nthe animals were not seen by the veterinarian during the time and the animals died. No necropsy was conducted.\nThere was one adult otter that appeared sick and died within the hour, however the licensee advised he did not\ncontact the veterinarian and did not have a necropsy conducted on another unknown death. These 4 animals died\nat this facility since the last inspection that was conducted.\nIt is important that a veterinarian is contacted and proper diagnosis and treatment is provided as soon as an injury\nor illness is observed in order to prevent unnecessary pain and discomfort, or cause a treatable condition to\nbecome chronic or cause death if left untreated. The lack of a proper diagnosis in cases where there is unexplained\ndeath, can lead to a potential disease risk to the other animals in the collection, if it is an infectious disease.\nThe licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the possible injury or determination\nof where the blood came from on the bear. All health related illness or issues that are observed in the animals shall\nresult in the veterinarian to be contacted for proper treatment and diagnosis . Any unexplained death requires a\nnecropsy, as has been discussed in past inspections."
