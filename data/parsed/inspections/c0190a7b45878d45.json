      "narrative": "At the time of inspection it was noted that Koko, the 46 year old female lowland gorilla, has been experiencing\nepisodes of lethargy and inappetence for approximately one month. Marked muscle atrophy has been noted in the\nmedical records. Caregivers describe her as lethargic and depressed, but with some good days and some bad\ndays.\nThe attending veterinarian assembled a team to immobilize Koko on 6/21/17 in order to perform a diagnostic\nwork-up, which was strongly recommended by the attending veterinarian in order to determine whether Koko may\nhave some treatable underlying cause for her decline. The procedure was cancelled with the parties involved\n(owner / exhibitor and attending veterinarian) disagreeing on the appropriateness of the timing. As of the day of\ninspection on 7/5/17, the recommended diagnostic testing had not been completed in order to determine possible\nunderlying causes for Koko\u2019s recent decline. Additionally, Koko has recently been experiencing unexplained\nepisodes of twitching and stupor that the attending veterinarian believes may be medication-related, and there has\nbeen some documented confusion regarding adjustments to drug regimens. The attending veterinarian stated that\nhe sees Koko\u2019s condition as stable at the moment, but there are many unanswered questions about her recent\ndecline and new symptoms.\nAnimal exhibitors shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of\nadequate veterinary care, to include diagnostics and careful oversight of medications. Failure to follow the attending\nveterinarian\u2019s instructions could be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals.\nThe exhibitor shall ensure that the attending veterinarian is able to closely monitor Koko\u2019s status from this time\nforward, with compliance with the veterinarian\u2019s recommendations. The exhibitor shall work with the attending\nveterinarian to develop a clear plan regarding Koko\u2019s current condition, and possible diagnostic and treatment\noptions and recommendations, with this plan to be available for inspection by 7/14/17. Adherence to this plan\nshould be closely followed and documented. The attending veterinarian must be given appropriate authority, so as\nto make the best decisions regarding adequate veterinary care, in order to safeguard the welfare of the animals on\nsite.\nThis was a focused inspection on veterinary care.\nThe inspection was conducted on 7/5/17 with the Associate Director of Research and Care. An exit interview\noccurred via teleconference on 7/6/17 with the owner / exhibitors, the Associate Director of Research and Care, and\nthe two USDA inspectors who conducted the inspection.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSchnell Michael, Veterinary Medical Officer"
