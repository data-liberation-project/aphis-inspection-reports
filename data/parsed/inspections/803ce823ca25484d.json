      "narrative": "A female giraffe, Jane, has a severe angular deformation of the fetlock of the left forelimb. She has had a moderate\nangle for many years thought to be from an old injury. She is now reluctant to bear weight on that leg, and is shifting\nher weight back onto her hind limbs. Her comfort level has recently and quickly deteriorated to this level and she is\nvisibly uncomfortable and reluctant to move.\nThe Attending Veterinarian (AV) had not yet been notified of this change.\nDaily observation of each of the animals is required so any problem or negative change in condition can be promptly\nreported to the AV to be addressed. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment helps improve treatment results\nand/or minimize suffering.\nCorrection: The AV must be notified immediately to evaluate Jane's condition. Note: The AV is scheduled to look at\nthe giraffe today, 10/23/2018.\nThis inspection and an exit interview was conducted with the ranch manager. An additional briefing was conducted\non 10/23/2018 by telephone with the licensee."
