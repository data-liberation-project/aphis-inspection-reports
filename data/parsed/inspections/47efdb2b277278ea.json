This flooring is a heavy gauge rubber or\nplastic-coated metal flooring with rectangular openings that are approximately \u00bd inch by 2.5 inches. This flooring has\nbeen identified on previous inspections to be dangerous because dogs have been found by inspectors with feet / toes\nstuck in the flooring.\n*** On this inspection a total of 2 dogs were found actively stuck in the flooring to the point that the facility representatives\nhad to remove one of them from the flooring.\n- In Building G1, Room 6, an adult beagle, CHLCSB, was found with his right rear foot trapped in an opening in the slatted\nfloor. He was quickly and easily removed by staff after being found.\n- In Building G1, Room 10, an adult beagle, CHICDM, was found with her right rear foot trapped in an opening in the\nslatted floor. She required a couple minutes of manipulation before her foot was freed by facility representatives. The dog\nremained calm during manipulation to free the foot. After being freed from the floor and relocated to different flooring, she\nwas observed and displayed no signs of lameness or pain.\nOpenings in the floor that are large enough to allow the feet and legs to pass through can lead to entrapment of a dog\nwhich can be painful, distressful, and may result in serious injury to the animal.\nPrimary enclosures for dogs must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs\u2019 feet and legs from\ninjury. When floors are of mesh or slatted construction, they must not allow the dogs\u2019 feet to pass through any openings in\nthe floor. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that eliminates the risk of entrapment and injury and ensures no\nfeet or legs can pass through the floor openings.
