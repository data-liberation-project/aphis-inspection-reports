      "narrative": "This facility has suffered four lamb losses due to predation (thought to be by coyote) since October 2018. The\nfacility has had a guard llama housed with the sheep. The fencing is mesh (field fence in some areas, chain link in\nothers) with electric wire or barbed wire on top.\nThe first loss was in the night of October 4-5, 2018. The second was sometime during the night of May 27-28, 2019.\nFor this one, it was discovered that nearby construction had caused damage to the fence, allowing entry of the\npredator. The fence was quickly repaired. The third loss was overnight on June 18, 2019. The fourth was in daylight\non the morning of July 12, 2019, and occurred in the alleyway connecting the barn/barnyard area to the\nfarther-away pasture. Each of the lamb deaths of the 2019 crop was followed by the facility reviewing their program\naccording to a document \"Wild Predator Loss Prevention Best Management Practices for Sheep,\" a document\nproduced with input from producer groups and government agencies. Prior to the fourth death, the sheep were\nconfined overnight to the small pasture where the barn is located. This area has a security light. The facility has\nagain reviewed its practices, and is consulting with USDA Wildlife Services for help in dealing with the predator(s).\nPerimeter fences are not required for farm animals, such as sheep, as long as the facility has effective security\nmeasures in place. The repeated predation incidents indicate that security measures are not effective to protect the\nanimals from harm..\nCorrection was in process at the time of inspection: the facility has been reviewing and revising their practices\naccording to the above-mentioned document with each lamb loss. They have outlined further tactics and resources\nunder consideration to be employed to increase their success in protection from predation.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel."
