  "narrative": "A focused inspection was conducted with the licensee and 2 APHIS inspectors to re-evaluate two animals with\nveterinary conditions cited during the inspection of 9/19/2014. \n \n**The bull reindeer calf had been separated from the herd along with 2 other calves for weaning purposes.  He did\nappear to have a more normal gait and stance but did not move around much in this enclosure despite the other 2\ncalves being very active. Due to the severity of the animal's condition (a fractured right hind limb), continued\nmonitoring daily is necessary.  A follow-up examination and diagnostic testing is to be performed by the attending\nveterinarian before 11/30/2014, or prior to commingling with the adults if to be done sooner than 11/30/2014, to\nensure the leg is fully healed.  \n**The husky-malamute dog, Mikoh ID# 9, was noted to no longer have any eye discharge and the condition has\nresolved.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRhodes Cindy, Animal Care Inspector",
