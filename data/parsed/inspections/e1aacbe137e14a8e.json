This section of fencing is detaching from the lower edge of the wood board, creating a small\ngap. On the left side of the enclosure the wire mesh is separating from the lower edge of the middle wood fence\nboard, creating a small gap in the fence. The goats may be injured on the broken wires and/or get their head\ncaught in the fencing if they try to put their head through the gaps. The enclosure fence must be repaired or\nreplaced to protect the goats from injury.\n2) The shelter for the red deer has several nails protruding down through the ceiling. The antlers of the deer may\nrub against the points of the nails and be injured. The nails must be removed or the exposed nail points hammered\nback against the ceiling to protect the deer from injury.\nCorrect both by May 27, 2014.\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility partner."
