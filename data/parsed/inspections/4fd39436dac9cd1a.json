      "narrative": "On the morning of May 24, 2017, APHIS personnel observed two prairie dogs that were stumbling and falling while\nwalking in the enclosure. They struggled to right themselves after they fell over. They were wobbling from side to\nside. When APHIS personnel went back to the enclosure during the afternoon, two prairie dogs were seen to have\nthe same clinical signs. Veterinary records show that the most recent examination of the prairie dog colony by a\nveterinarian occurred on April 5, 2016.\nDaily Keepers Notes provided by the facility dated two months ago, on March 24, 2017 show that a \u201cneurological\nprairie dog\u201d was observed. The animal was not seen by a veterinarian. No follow up was provided.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\nAdditionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals\nat the facility.\nAll prairie dogs with the observed clinical signs must be examined by a veterinarian no later than close of business\non May 25, 2017 to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans for the problems cited above. The\noutcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should\ninclude the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests, and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the\nveterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions and entries on a log and/or calendar\nand/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animal.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and\nthe need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nFrom this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate\nveterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for\nproviding adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted on May 24, 2017. This report is limited to direct noncompliant items\nidentified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items will follow. Both the\ninspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative on May 24, 2017.\nAdditional Inspectors\nTheodorson Elizabeth, Director\nBolinger Jean, Compliance Specialist\nTims Tanya, Assistant Director"
