      "narrative": "Three instances were identified where the facility did not adequately diagnose or treat animal conditions:\n- The male black bear Baloo had an abnormal posture and gait. He walked slowly, reluctantly and took very short steps.\nWhen standing he was hunched with an excessive outward curvature of his back and both hind limbs tucked underneath\nhis abdomen. He also had on the elbow of his left front leg a large hairless callused skin area. The facility confirmed that\nBaloo will sometimes ambulate on his elbows instead of standing up completely. The facility is currently treating Baloo for\narthritis but did not bring the above-described abnormal posture and gait to the veterinarian\u2019s attention for further\nevaluation.\n- The yellow, green and black budgie had an injured right wing. The bird overall looked unkempt with ruffled feathers and\na dropping right wing protruding downwards at an awkward angle. Where the feathers parted, the exposed limb was\nreddened and inflamed. The budgie was inadequately housed in a large cockatiel aviary requiring him to walk long\ndistances on the floor and climb the side of the enclosure fencing. The lower perch he was provided was too large for him\nand still significantly elevated from the ground. The facility did not identify this budgie has requiring further veterinary\nevaluation and did not provide adequate housing for his condition.\n- Calvin, a capuchin monkey, is being treated for a heart condition. One of his medications, Sotalol, had been expired\nsince 02/14/2024, but was still being given at the time of inspection, about 4 weeks past that date.\nInadequate diagnosis of animal conditions could result in delay in proper veterinary attention as well as undue animal\npain/distress. Expired medications may lose functionality or could become detrimental to the health of the animals. The\ncurrently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.\nCommunication with the veterinarian was initiated at the time of inspection. However, in cooperation with the attending\nveterinarian, the facility must develop appropriate methods to diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by March 18, 2024."
