During this inspection each time I approached the Bull Terrier in his\nkennel she began to spin in circles repeatedly in a fast motion for over minute until I stepped away. I observed\nsome hair loss on the ground and nose irritated where it rubbed against the chain link fencing. During previous\ninspections this dog exhibited the same stereotypical behavior but not this excessive. The care takers and licensee\nhad stated that that this dog was not able to exercise with the other dogs because she would harm them. It was\nstated by the care takers that they take this dog outside on a leash once a day.\nWhen asked about this behavior, the licensee stated that he was not aware of the cause. Abnormal repetitive\nbehaviors, often called stereotypies, can develop in response to many stressors including: lack of space, exercise,\nunder or over stimulation in their environment such as being housed alone. Because these behaviors often\ndevelop in response to distress, they are important indicators of behavioral ill-health and require veterinary\nintervention to properly diagnose the most likely causes and prevent farther deterioration by providing an\nappropriate treatment plan to address the stressor as well as the abnormal behavior.\nCorrect by having this dog evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnosis of the cause of this behavior and\ndevelopment of an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. Written documentation by the Attending\nVeterinarian, recommendations regarding kennel space, exercise, enrichment and any other steps necessary to\naddress this abnormality. This shall be maintained by the licensee for review by APHIS Officials. Additionally, the\nlicensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of these recommendations for review.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: FEBRUARY 20, 2017."
