      "narrative": "A goat with identification # 21135 was observed around 10:30 AM by the Animal Care inspectors. The goat\nappeared to be very depressed, with its head and ears down, reluctant to walk, and breathing in a loud, heavy\nmanner. Records showed that this goat was under treatment for urinary calculi, and it may have been depressed in\npart due to treatment with acepromazine that morning, which can have a sedative effect, but also helps to relax the\nurinary tract and allow stones to pass. The regularly on-site veterinarian was on vacation for the current week, and\nthe off-site attending veterinarian was not scheduled to be there until the next day. Around 3:30 PM the goat was\nexamined again by the Animal Care inspectors, and it was found to be lying sternal, head flexed back toward its\nflank, and vocalizing with most breaths, in a manner suggestive of pain and agonal distress. The veterinary\ntechnician was summoned, and reported that she had recently treated the animal, but had been unable to contact\nthe attending veterinarian. Staff indicated they did not have an alternate emergency veterinary provider, and they\nwere unable to contact the attending veterinarian. The staff eventually decided to euthanize the goat, and around\n4:15 PM the goat was euthanized by the staff on site. A veterinarian was never contacted prior to euthanizing the\ngoat.\nEach research facility is expected to have in place a program of veterinary care that includes the availability of\nemergency care. Allowing 21135 to suffer throughout the day without the consult of a veterinarian was not in the\nbest interest of the welfare of this animal.\nSteps should be taken to ensure that emergency veterinary care is available at all times, as needed, in order to\nsafeguard the well-being of the animals on site.\nPrevious correction date: to have been corrected immediately."
