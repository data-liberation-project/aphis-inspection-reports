Although the dogs have been moved to these\nenclosures temporarily while the main housing is being renovated, the inability of the dogs to express normal\npostures in their primary enclosures for an extended length of time may lead to abnormal conformations, stress,\nand/or discomfort. These dogs shall be placed in enclosures that provide at least the minimum amount of height as\nrequired in Section 3.6 (c) of the regulations.\nThe inspection and exit briefing conducted with the IACUC Veterinarian."
