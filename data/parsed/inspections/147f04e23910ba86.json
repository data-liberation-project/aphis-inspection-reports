The licensee had identified these animals\nprior to inspection, but the attending veterinarian had not been notified. There is no guidance in the Program of\nVeterinary Care for the treatment of this condition.\nIn the 2nd pen from the door, an adult tan and white guinea pig had a round, firm swelling under the chin\napproximately 1\" in diameter.\nIn the 5th pen from the door, 3 guinea pigs were identified with the swellings. A tan, brown, and white adult\nguinea pig had a swelling approximately 1.5\" in diameter under its chin. An adult guinea pig, mostly black with some\ntan and white markings, had a swelling approximately 1.5\" in diameter under its chin. An adult guinea pig, mostly\nwhite with small black and tan markings, had a swelling approximately 1\" in diameter under its chin.\nIn the 8th pen from the door, 2 guinea pigs were identified with the swellings. An adult guinea pig, mostly grey\nwith some white, had an asymmetrical swelling that was overall approximately 1.5\" in diameter under its chin. The\nswelling was composed of several firm, round structures, with the largest one on the right side of the animal's neck,\nand measuring approximately 1\" in diameter. Another adult guinea pig, black with white markings, had a firm\nswelling under its chin approximately 1/2\" in diameter. The surface of this swelling had a small tan crust and the\nskin was pale pink, consistent with a healing wound or draining tract.\nIn the 9th pen from the door, 2 animals were identified with the swellings. An adult black and tan guinea pig had a\nswelling approximately 1\" in diameter under its chin. An adult tricolor guinea pig had a swelling approximately 1.5\"\nunder its chin.\nThese swellings may represent an underlying disease process or an active infection. When problems of animal\nhealth are identified, direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required to ensure the\nprovision of adequate veterinary care. The veterinarian must be contacted to provide guidance for the care of these\nanimals.\nTo be corrected by June 7, 2019."

All of the enclosures with the breeding animals have a buildup of wet bedding material and a wet,\nbrown slurry around the waterers and the drainpipes. This buildup is preventing the water from draining out of the\nenclosure, resulting in very wet bedding around the waterers. Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized\noften enough to prevent the accumulation of excreta or other debris, and they must be cleaned and effectively\nsanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
