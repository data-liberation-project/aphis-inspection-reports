The facility representative reported that the litter of border collies being weaned in the sheltered\nfacility were the offspring on the red and white male and one of the border collie females. The inspector informed the\nfacility representative that if dogs are intermingled with facility dogs, producing puppies for the facility or intact and on the\npremises they must be accounted for on the APHIS form 7005 for the facility.\n-There were APHIS form 7005s filled out for litter of puppies through May of 2024 but records for puppies after May were\nnot available to the inspector. The cage cards for the puppies did not contain all the information that is on the APHIS form\n7005 so all puppies should be recorded on an APHIS form 7005.\nAccurate record keeping is crucial for ensuring a thorough inspection and needed to rapidly identify and trace animals in a\npotential disease outbreak. Each dealer and/or exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and\ncorrectly disclose the information in 2.75(a)(1)(i) through 2.75(a)(1)(ix) for each dog purchased or otherwise acquired,\nowned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or\notherwise disposed of by that licensee.
