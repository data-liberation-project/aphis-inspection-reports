The facility began construction on the Dolphin Stadium area in\nOctober 2021. This construction has disrupted the dolphin pools natural water flows. Additionally, the facility has been\nrefurbishing portions of their life support system and is currently waiting to install a new sand filter for the larger water\nsystems of Dolphin Stadium. Due to these various factors, the bottlenose dolphins were consistently exposed to total\nchlorine ranges above 1.0 PPM for approximately two weeks in December 2021. Additional upgrades to the Sea Lion\nMain life support systems led to persistent algae blooms that were difficult to remove mechanically. Review of medical\nrecords and interviews with both the current and former attending veterinarians confirmed that the algae blooms did not\nhave any observable detrimental effects on any of the animals housed at Sea Lion Main. The attending veterinarian gave\nthe life support staff permission to raise the free chlorine ranges from a maximum of 0.4 PPM to 0.7 PPM in order to treat\nthe algae blooms. Subsequently, the animals residing in those pools were exposed to total chlorine levels above 1.0PPM\nfor the first two weeks in January 2021 and from March 3rd, 2021, to April 21st, 2021. Two of the pinnipeds residing in\nthose pools have chronic eye conditions; one harbor seal recently underwent cataract surgery.\nIndustry standards set the maximum level of total chlorine at 1.0PPM. Total chlorine is a measurement of both free\nchlorine and chloramines. Chloramines are much more irritating to an animal\u2019s skin, eyes and lungs than free chlorine.\nIncreasing chlorine to levels above industry standards in pools that actively contain animals in order to combat algae\nblooms is not an acceptable method of disinfection. Total chlorine levels above 1.0PPM for long periods of time can\ncause the marine mammals skin, respiratory, and eye issues. Constant management and maintaining chlorine levels\nbelow 1.0 PPM is necessary to maintain the health and welfare of the marine mammals.\nCorrect by February 26, 2022."
