      "narrative": "On today\u2019s inspection, a white female chaweeni puppy born on 8/12/2019 was noticed to be sitting in the corner of\nthe whelping box as its litter mate ran around. After watching the puppies for a few minutes, it was apparent that\nthe puppy was not moving or as active as the other puppy due to an impairment of her hind legs. She would try to\nmove around, but was unable to rise to her feet as her legs remained curved up under her, stiff and non-weight\nbearing. She would inch around on her belly after several attempts to use her hind legs. At one point the Licensee\ntried to coax the puppy to move and she cried out after several attempts of being unable to rise to her feet and walk.\nThere was a total of 4 puppies in this litter, 2 of the litter mates are identified on the cage card as dying from\nunknown causes on 8/20/2019. The Licensee did not communicate with the Attending Veterinarian after \u00bd of the\nlitter died un-expectantly 8 days after birth. In addition, the Licensee did not notice the hind leg issue with this\npuppy. Failure to preform daily observation and identify health concerns, such as this, delays the process of\nproviding appropriate veterinarian care to animals that are in dire need and can prolong an animal\u2019s pain and\ndiscomfort. The Licensee must have methods in place for daily observation of all animals. In addition, the Licensee\nmust ensure that there are mechanisms of direct and frequent communication in place and that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems, to include the dog identified above, of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed\nto the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect By: Close of Business on 9/24/2019"
