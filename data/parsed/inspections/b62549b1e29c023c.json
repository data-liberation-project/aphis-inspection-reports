      "narrative": "A litter of at least seven rabbit kits was found dead in the outdoor rabbit enclosure which housed twelve adult\nrabbits. The dead baby rabbits were found in an animal carrier which had been placed in the enclosure as an\nadditional shelter space. The dead rabbits were found scattered throughout the floor of the carrier which contained\nold, wet, and dirty hay. There was dark wet material and fecal build up under the hay surface so this container did\nnot appear to have been cleaned for several days. The kits appeared to be at least several days old based on their\nsize and that fur was beginning to grow. The licensees indicated they were not aware that one of the rabbits had\ngiven birth. Although they had cleaned and fed the animals in the main enclosure they had neglected to clean or\ncheck the carrier which was facing toward the back of the pen. Adequate daily observation of the animals and the\nenclosure was not performed so they did not find that a rabbit had given birth and that infant animals were present\nwhich needed care. The lack of adequate daily observation of every animal and all parts of the enclosure can\nresult in pain, suffering, or death of animals when they are in need of care and have health or welfare concerns. A\nsuitable nest box containing clean nesting material must be provided in each primary enclosure housing a female\nrabbit with a litter, the nest boxes and enclosure must be kept clean and dry, and daily observation of all the animals\nmust be conducted to assess their health and well-being and communicate health problems to their veterinarian.\nThe licensee indicated that they had been doing daily observations during pen cleaning and feeding. They stated\nthat they intend to change their processes and have a written protocol for checking animals and that they would\nstart doing a separate wellness check on every animal in the mornings as a separate activity from other\nmaintenance.\nCorrect from this point forward.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees."
