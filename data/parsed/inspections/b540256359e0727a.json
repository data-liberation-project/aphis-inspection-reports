      "narrative": "The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 10:30am on 07/27/2016.\nThe inspectors arrived along with NY Department of conservation officer as a team inspection. Upon arrival, I\nknocked on the door and rang the doorbell several times. Ms Leo came to the doorway and when I said hello and\nshe gave me no verbal acknowledgement. I introduced Dr. Lupo and also stated we were with DEC Officer Thomas.\nI told her we needed to do an inspection and she walked past me towards the garage next to the facility. As we\nwalked to the garage, I asked if her opossums were still housed in the garage and she stated that (cid:28)they were no\nlonger at the facility(cid:29). I asked \"(cid:28)oh, where did they go?\"(cid:29) At this point Ms. Leo stopped, turned to me and stated that\nshe needed to contact her lawyer before doing the inspection. I said ok and she left us to go into the house. We\nthen stayed by the garage and waited for her.\nSeveral minutes later she came to me and stated that, \"(cid:28)you need to talk to my lawyer before I'(cid:25)ll do the inspection\".\nI explained to her that, \"(cid:28)No, based on the conditions of her AWA exhibitor license, I did not need to talk to her\nlawyer prior to an inspection.\" (cid:28) She again tried to hand me a business card and I asked her,\" (cid:28)If she was refusing\nthe inspection process\"(cid:29). She again stated that, \"(cid:28)I needed to talk to her lawyer first\"(cid:29) to which I replied,\" (cid:28)no, and\nasked her again if she was refusing the inspection process and that I needed a verbal confirmation of that\"(cid:29). At this\npoint she dropped the business card and walked away from us. I immediately looked at Dr. Lupo and Officer\nThomas and confirmed that she had refused the inspection process. Officer Thomas picked up the business card\nand proceeded to call her lawyer. The approximate time was 10:42 when Ms. Leo went into the house. Officer\nThomas spoke to the lawyer stating that Ms. Leo was violating both USDA regulations and NY state regulations by\nnot allowing the inspection process. He then informed Ms. Leo that we had spoken to her lawyer and for her to call\nhim. After several more minutes she came back out of the house and asked all of us to leave her property.\nRefusal to allow APHIS officials to enter a facility in order to inspect regulated species and other potentially\nregulated animals is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Access must be granted to any facilities as\ndeemed necessary by APHIS officials in order to enforce the provisions of the AWA regulations and standards,\nincluding but not limited to animal housing areas, procedure areas, transportation conveyances, holding areas, or\nother auxiliary areas related to the care or use of regulated species. In addition records may be examined and\ncopied as needed and photographs taken of the facilities and animals as APHIS officials consider necessary.\nCorrect by allowing APHIS officials to enter and examine all facilities and animals properly.\nACI Andrea D'Ambrosio and VMO Dr Keri Lupo were present at the time of this refused inspection.\nAdditional Inspectors\nLupo Keri, Veterinary Medical Officer"
