The escape occurred sometime after the evening rounds at 4:30 pm on July 31, 2021 and the morning\nrounds at 8:00 am on August 1, 2021 The wolfdog escaped his enclosure by digging down to the dig guard and pulling it\naway from the fencing allowing him to squeeze through the small opening he created. The animal\u2019s tracks were followed\nto one of the outer perimeter gates where he was able to squeeze underneath to escape the facility completely. Facility\nstaff did a thorough search inside the perimeter, then proceeded to search around the areas near the sanctuary. Local\nofficials and residents had been notified of the escape. The staff responded to all sightings; however, the exact location of\nthe wolfdog is not known, and the facility has been unable to recover the animal. Since the incident the facility has added\na bar to the perimeter gate so it cannot be pushed outward and filled in the ground with dirt where it eroded. The\nenclosure where the animal escaped from is not being utilized at this time. The facility will add new reinforced dig guards,\nand the hole filled before another animal is allowed into the enclosure. Animals escaping from primary enclosures are\nmore vulnerable to harm from surrounding predatory animals and further injury when they are not safely contained.\nCorrected before time of inspection.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Animal Care Supervisor and Executive Director.\nEnd Section"
