During a daily observation, the birds were found deceased among several outdoor aviaries.\nUpon examination of the outer barrier fence, two holes were found dug underneath the fence. The outer fence and\nprimary enclosure fencing were intact. Injuries among the deceased birds were consistent with predation. The aviary was\nbuilt around 2017 and has never had signs of attempted entry or successful entry of a predator. Primary enclosure fencing\nthat inadequately protects the animals within can allow injuries or potential predation. The facility corrected this non-\ncompliance prior to inspection. Corrective actions included extending the outer fence dig barrier deeper into the ground,\nadding in a weed barrier and metal mesh along with 9 tons of gravel outside the outer fence and between it and the\nprimary enclosure.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
