Additionally there are plastic containers that contain petroleum fuels located on a\nlow, unprotected shelf. These are accessible to the animals, and pose a risk of harm.\nAnimal enclosures must be appropriate for the animals involved, and should be free of items that could pose a risk\nto the animals, in order to protect the animals from injury or harm.\nTo be corrected by 11/19/18.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the assistant director of animal care, and the executive\ndirector."
