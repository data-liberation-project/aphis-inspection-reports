Based on conversations with facility staff and a visit to the satellite location, it\nis evident that rabbits are being housed in significantly smaller dog carriers which do not provide the minimum amount of\nspace required under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). At the time of the inspection, 6 rabbits were housed in identical\ntransport crates at the satellite location. The crates are 12 inches tall, which is 2 inches short of the AWA requirements.\nThe floor space provided by the crates is 20 inches long x 11 inches wide / 144 = 1.52 square feet; this is adequate for\nrabbits under 2 kilograms (who require 1.5 square feet of space) but is not adequate for rabbits weighing 2-4 kilograms\n(who require 3.0 square feet). Some of the rabbits used in the study weight less than 2 kilograms, but others weigh\nbetween 2 and 4 kilograms. According to facility staff, the animals live in the crates at the satellite location for about 24\nhours, and there is no other housing used for the rabbits at the satellite location. There is no scientific justification in the\nprotocol for housing rabbits in travel crates that fail to provide the minimum space require the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).\nThe IACUC did not approve housing rabbits in enclosures smaller than that required in the Animal Welfare Act.\nProposals and changes to animal use activities must contain accurate and complete information so that the IACUC can\noversee animal care and use and ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect by July 3rd, 2023 by ensuring that proposals to conduct animal activities, or to make significant changes to\nongoing activities containing animals, contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals."
