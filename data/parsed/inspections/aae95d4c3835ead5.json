During this inspection Barney\nwas also observed scratching himself in the areas of hair loss.\nUSDA inspection dated January 30, 2015, indicated Barney(cid:25)s condition existed over essentially the same areas of\nthe body. The inspection of January 30, 2015 also stated the attending veterinarian was contacted and the\ncondition was treated back in November 2014. It was also stated the patches of hair loss were much smaller at that\ntime.\nMr. Steele produced a document dated February 11, 2015 showing Barney had been seen and evaluated by his\nveterinarian. The veterinarian performed a skin scrape and prescribed shampoo and omega 3 fatty acid\nsupplementation.\nAlthough documentation indicates Barney(cid:25)s hair loss problem was seen by a veterinarian, it continues to be an\nongoing or reoccuring problem since at least November 2014. Hair loss can be an indication of an underlying\nmedical condition which may include parasites, allergies or some other disease process. Hair loss and associated\nscratching indicates Barney is experiencing skin irritation and discomfort.\nBarney(cid:25)s hair loss needs to be addressed again by the attending veterinarian and diagnostics run to determine the\nunderlying cause and a treatment regime started to correct this condition.\nCorrect by: March 25, 2016\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative at the close of this inspection.\nThis was a traveling site inspection conducted at the Medford OR Sports Show."
