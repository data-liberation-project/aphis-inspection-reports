      "narrative": "On July 27, 2017 an anesthetized rabbit on a study protocol was to be injected with a contrast medium. Following\ninjection the rabbit immediately died. The technician realized that the stop-cock valve used for the procedure had\nbeen turned in the wrong direction, the contrast medium had drained from the extension tubing, and air had been\ninjected instead. The technician explained that the stop-cocks that had been used historically had a valve that\nturned in one direction and the new stop-cocks recently purchased have a valve that turns in the opposite direction.\nThe technician was aware of this, but stated that she turned the valve out of \u201cmuscle memory.\u201d The facility\ndiscarded the remaining stop-cocks that function in this manner.\nOn August 11, 2017 an employee attempted to socialize two dogs against the recommendation of veterinary staff.\nOne dog had a history of dog related aggression and had been removed from the facility socialization list due to the\nrisk of dog and/or staff injury. The dogs fought, both dogs received lacerations, and one dog required sutures. Both\ndogs recovered and one of the two dogs has been adopted as a pet. Corrective action was taken by the facility.\nAnimals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar\nproblems from occurring in the future.\nThe inspection was focused on handling incidents that were self-reported to APHIS officials.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
