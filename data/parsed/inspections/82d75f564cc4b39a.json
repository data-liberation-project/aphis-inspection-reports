      "narrative": "An adult female reindeer named \"Clarice\" was significantly underweight. The ribs, spine, and hip bones were\nvisually prominent under her haircoat, indicating a lack of adequate fat covering. Weight loss can be the result of\nnutritional deficiencies, dental problems, underlying medical conditions, or parasites.\nThis reindeer also had many patchy areas of hair missing over her back and rump. The skin in these areas felt\ncrusty and small clumps of hair were continuing to fall out. Skin problems can be caused by bacteria, fungus,\nparasites, or underlying medical conditions. They may also be contagious to people or other animals. The licensee\nmust have this reindeer examined and treated by a veterinarian BY DECEMBER 29, 2017. If the animal's condition\ndoes not resolve with treatment or if it returns, the licensee must consult a veterinarian for further evaluation and\ntreatment.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative on December 18, 2017. Phone\nmessages with the result of the inspection findings were left for the licensee on December 18 and December 22.\nThe inspection took place at a venue in Branson, MO.\nAdditional Inspectors\nGraves Alicia, Animal Care Inspector"
