No baby Lemur was seen at the time of the walk though prior to opening to the public, according to the licensee.\nLack of observation of breeding conditions in animals can lead to issues during pregnancy or at birth and a lack of timely\nand accurate communication with the veterinarian.\nThe licensee has since contacted the attended veterinarian for the female Lemur and has ended the possibility of further\nbreeding.\nThe licensee must continue to observe animals conditions so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal\nhealth, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.\nThese corrections were made by April 23, 2023 and must continue.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nn"
