On April 29, 2023, according to the accounts from facility representatives,\nemployees observed high intensity sexual behavior between two adult male manatees, which resulted in rectal\npenetration of the smaller male, at approximately 10:00 am. Shortly after this interaction, employees collected a fecal\nsample from the smaller male and confirmed the presence of fresh blood. The sexual behavior continued throughout the\nday with periods of rest between high intensity interactions and occasional penetration. At approximately 5:15 pm, the\nlarger male was observed penetrating the smaller male again. When the larger male swam away, the smaller male was\nseen unresponsive at the bottom of the pool. It was confirmed that he had passed. Preliminary necropsy reports identified\na 14.5 cm tear in his colon, and other traumatic injuries, as the likely cause of death.\nProper handling of animals ensures that their mental and physical well-being is being provided for.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does\nnot cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
