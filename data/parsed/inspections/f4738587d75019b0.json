Two of the drugs for internal parasite control (fenbendazole and Marquis) used are not listed on the\nPVC.

Three of the older dogs are in need of\ndental care with large amounts of accumulated tartar on their teeth. These dogs do already have an appointment\nscheduled for 9/24/15 for a visit to the veterinarian for dental treatment. However, a written dental plan needs to be\ndeveloped with the attending veterinarian to help address dental health of the dogs before excessive amounts of\ntartar are allowed to build up.\nThe facility and the attending veterinarian need to develop a complete written program of veterinary care that\naddresses all routine veterinary health related procedures to be performed and drugs to be used at the kennel in\norder to ensure adequate veterinary care for the dogs. All drugs prescribed for individual animals need to be labeled\nwith instructions for the use of the drug and for which animal it is to be given. Correct by Nov. 1, 2015."
