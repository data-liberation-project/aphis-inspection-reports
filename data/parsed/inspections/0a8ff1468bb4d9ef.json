      "narrative": "* A female, red King Charles Cavalier (\"Pickles\" no ID#) had sores with missing hair on the top of three paws. The\nrear right paw had an open wound (approximately 1 inch long), oozing a small amount of clear discharge. The\nlicensee stated the dog was not under any treatment at the time of inspection and had no medical records\ndocumenting the condition of the dog's paws. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian by 26 April\n2014 to determine an appropriate treatment plan for \"Pickles\".\n* A female Shih Tzu (#0A02340836), had clumped, matted hair on her face, in front of her eyes and dangling off\nher face.\n* A brown and white,female Shih Tzu (#070-580-340) had a golf ball size of matted hair hanging on the side of her\nmuzzle. She also had matted hair that dangled over and adhered to her nose.\nMatted hair which is being pulled away from the skin is likely to be painful and can interfere with sight and eating.\nThis matted hair was hardened and in close proximity to the eyes, and could therefore easily scrape the eye and\npossibly cause an ulcer. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these dogs and ensure that excessive hair\nmatting does not occur.\n* The licensee had one bottle of expired medication (Strongid expired 1/2014). This expired medication was\nintermingled with other medications and was available for use on all the dogs. Expired medications may not be\neffective and could even be harmful to the animals. The licensee must ensure that no expired medications are\nadministered to the animals."
