The appearance is reddened and moist. Hair-loss is\nalso present on the wound. There is no documentation available showing the dog's wound has been treated or\nevaluated by a veterinarian. Open wounds can cause pain and discomfort and lead to other health problems.\nAn adult Golden Retriever identified by microchip #015-812-600 (Spike) has a problem that is affecting the dog's\nback legs. The dog is periodically carrying its left rear leg and trying to put as little pressure as possible on it. The\ndog is also slightly hopping on its rear right leg and making other abnormal movements when it(cid:25)s walking around the\nenclosure. The abnormal movements can be an indication of health problems and also be painful.\nThe dogs listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated.\nDocumentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments.\nTwo adult tan colored Wheaten Terriers identified by tattoo #135 and tattoo #66 have overgrown toenails. There are\nlong toenails that are laying sideways when the dog's foot is on a flat surface. Toenails that are excessively long are\nalso passing through the wire flooring and could potentially get caught. Overgrown toenails can cause pain and\ndiscomfort to the dogs. The licensee must trim the nails of these dogs to an appropriate length. The licensee must\nalso develop an effective plan to maintain the toenails of all dogs.\nAll dogs must receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\n*The Golden Retriever (#015-812-600) and Bulldog (#257) were evaluated by the attending veterinarian at the time\nof inspection."
