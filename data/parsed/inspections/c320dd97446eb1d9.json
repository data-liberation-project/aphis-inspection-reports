The burns were presumed to have occurred following a scheduled project procedure on\n9/12/23.\nDespite heat support during anesthetic induction and preparation, the nonhuman primate became hypothermic prior to the\nstart of the procedure. Intra-procedure heat support measures were utilized and increased the core body temperature a\ncouple degrees, but the animal had not achieved normothermia before the completion of the procedure. During recovery,\nthe animal was placed on a circulating water heating pad, wrapped in a large towel, and placed under a heat lamp. She\nwas continuously monitored until she was moving and ready to be returned to her home cage. In her home cage, the\nanimal was oriented with her head towards the front of the cage, and a heat lamp was placed outside the cage and\ndirected so that only a portion of the cage was illuminated/heated by the lamp.\nAccording to the facility, the burns most likely occurred during anesthetic recovery while the animal was still hypothermic.\nPoor tissue perfusion of the extremities due to hypothermia increases the risk of thermal burns from heat lamps. The\nanimal care technician does not recall exactly how close the heat lamp was to the animal, but believes it was closer than\nthe recommended 20 inches. The technician placed their hand in front of the heat source at the level of the patient at set-\nup and did not feel the heat was too intense; however, did not revisit this parameter during the rest of the anesthetic\nrecovery period.\nBetween 9/12/23 and 9/18/23, no health concerns were reported for this macaque and her appetite remained normal.\nUpon discovery of the burns, veterinary treatment was provided for the animal. In addition, corrective actions have been\nimplemented by the research facility.\nIt is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel involved in animal use are adequately trained to\nperform their duties.
