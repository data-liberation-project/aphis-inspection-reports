Both bears\nhave small patches of hair loss on their hindquarters and sides. This extended rubbing could indicate skin irritation\nand discomfort. The bear\u2019s hair loss and scratching should be communicated to the attending vet.\n*** Two geriatric Capuchin's had hair loss and were thin. Their hair loss and weight could be attributed to their age,\nor there could be underlying health issues contributing to their condition. There was no documentation indicating\ntheir condition had been conveyed to the attending vet.\n*** A geriatric red fox was walking and circling with its head tilted. The facility stated the animal had some possible\nvision loss, but there is no documentation indicating this condition. This animal\u2019s condition needs to be\ncommunicated to the attending vet.\n*** The chinchilla\u2019s fur coat was very coarse looking with tuffs standing straight up. Abnormal hair coats must be\naddressed by the attending veterinarian, since they may be caused by infections, parasitic, hormonal or metabolic\nissues as well as inadequate husbandry. These animals have not been provided with a dust bath since their arrival\nto the facility. Dust bathing for chinchilla\u2019s is a normal postural adjustment that allows them to care for their own fur\ncoat. In addition to a veterinary work up, these animals need to be provided the appropriate dusting material and\npan to sufficiently dust bath multiple times a week. This needs to be addressed in consultation with your veterinarian\nfor their health and well-being of the chinchilla.\nThe facility needs to put into place a mechanism of communication in a timely manner with the attending\nveterinarian so that accurate information on animals\u2019 health and behavior is conveyed. Daily observations lead to\nearly detection of animal health issues and can assist the vet with a thorough history to help with diagnosing\nproblems. All animals noted should be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and treated per their\nrecommendations.\nCorrect by: July 19, 2017"
