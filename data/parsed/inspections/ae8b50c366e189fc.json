There are 4 areas\nwithin this pen where there are holes up to 1-1.5ft deep below the exposed 4x4 fencing, which is a possible hazard if the\nanimals feet fall through. There is a 1ft x 1ft hole under the fence inside the lockout area in the second enclosure on the\nright side of the facility housing the black wolf hybrid. If accessed this would allow for one of the wolf hybrids to get into\nthe secondary lockout area. The front gate of the perimeter fence has an area at the bottom approximately 1ftx 1ft that\nhas been bent up away from the framing, with an attempt at a repair with a piece of wire. This repair is not sufficient to\nkeep animals in or out of the perimeter fence if it was tested with any strength.\nAs the hybrids run around the perimeter of their enclosure or get a drink of water, they continually have to jump over the\nexposed wire/hole or balance their feet on the wire squares to prevent their feet from falling through. The exposed fencing\nwith holes beneath could make it possible for one of the hybrids to put a foot though the fence holes and drop down into\nthe hole possibly causing an injury, broken leg or snagging themselves on the corners of the exposed wire panels. The\nremaining holes are possible entry or exit points for the regulated animals or other outside animals to gain entry into the\narea.\nAll exposed fencing and holes in the ground of the enclosure should be filled in and covered in a manner that protects the\nwolf hybrids from injury, and prevents them from digging out of the enclosure through tunneling under the fence. All holes\nin the fence perimeter and in lockout areas should be repaired or replaced to keep all regulated animals in the facility and\nother animals from gaining entry into the primary enclosure area."
