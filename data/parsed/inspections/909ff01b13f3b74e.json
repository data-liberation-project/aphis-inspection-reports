Rust doesn't allow for the enclosures to\nbe properly sanitized. In addition if the rust eats through the bottoms pipes on those three enclosures any further, it\nmay weaken the fencing or provide a gap for the dogs in those enclosures to be able to escape. The rusted\nsurfaces on these outdoor enclosures needs to be repaired or replaced so the surfaces can be easily cleaned and\nsanitized and to ensure that no dogs escape from their enclosures.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd of report.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHovancsak Catherine, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
