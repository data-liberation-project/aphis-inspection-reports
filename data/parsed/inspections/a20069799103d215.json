      "narrative": "The perimeter fence on the West side of the lower pasture for 7 adult bison and 2 bison calves was determined to\nbe insufficient. The alleyway between the enclosure and perimeter fence had dense grass, bushes, and small trees\ngrowing in the area and gave the appearance it had not be maintained in months. The foliage not only blocked the\nview of the perimeter fence in certain areas but also had misshapen the fence. Multiple bottom sections of the\nchain-link perimeter fence were bulging outward and had even caused the separation of the metal pipe framework.\nOne drainage area under the perimeter fence had such significant erosion that an approximate 18 inch gap was\npresent between the bottom of the perimeter fence and ground. The perimeter fence is next to a wooded area and\nwalkway where families with small children commonly come. Since the other sides of the perimeter fence were well\nkept, an employee was asked about the cause for this side(cid:25)'s lack of maintenance. Their response mentioned lack\nof manpower, resources and a small alleyway that would not fit their mower. The perimeter fence is vital in\nprotecting the enclosed animals from exposure to diseases in the wildlife and protecting the public from injury. The\nfence as is will not restrict animals or children from contact with the bison. Repair or replace the perimeter fence so\nthat it will restrict animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the\nbison. Remove all foliage blocking the view of the perimeter fence.\nInspection and exit interview were conducted with the Interpretive Naturalist."
