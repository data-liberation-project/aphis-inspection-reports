At the time of the\ninspection, several Boston terrier puppies had dug underneath the wire and were in multiple adjacent enclosures\nhousing adult breeding males and females. This is dangerous for these puppies as they could be injured by the\nadult dogs. In addition, a jack russel terrier had jumped out of its enclosure, killed a chicken and then jumped into\nthe boston terrier enclosure and deposited parts of the chicken in with the puppies. There was a large amount of\nchicken feathers throughout the out door run.\nThese outdoor enclosures must be constructed to contain the dogs securely and keep other animals from entering\ntheir enclosures.
