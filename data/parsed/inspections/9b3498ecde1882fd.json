In the whelping\nportion of the sheltered building there were 4 female dogs with litters; including one female dog with a litter of three\npuppies; two female dogs each with a litter of two puppies; and one female dog with one puppy. All the enclosures had\nwater bowls, but they were dry. The licensee stated that he has a worker that comes and does evening chores at night\nand probably left around 6pm the night before and he hadn\u2019t been out yet this morning. The licensee provided water for\nthe four female dogs at the time of inspection; However, upon providing the dogs with water, one adult black and white\nfemale Shih Tzu, microchip # 956000010767846, approximately 4 years old drank continuously for approximately 1\nminute and 12 seconds. During this time one of her two puppies hovered over her trying to get a drink for itself. Failure to\nprovide continuous potable water may result in severe dehydration which could have a detrimental impact on the health of\nthe animal. Potable water must be continuously available for dogs. The licensee must ensure that each dog is provided\nwith potable water at all times in order to support their health and well-being. To be corrected: from this point forward on\n3/17/2023.\nNote: The licensee provided each of the female dogs with water in their enclosure at the time of the inspection\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
