Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is\nrequired for all drugs used by the registrant.\nThe written PVC requires additional guidance for the method of euthanasia to be used by the facility for small\nanimals, including the use of anesthesia, CO2, equipment, and the personnel trained and authorized to perform the\neuthanasia for the various species. Additional guidance and training in the procedure for euthanasia by the\nattending veterinarian is required to ensure animals are humanely euthanized according to the latest AVMA\nGuidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2013 edition).\nAdditional specific guidance is required for the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate\nguidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does\nnot ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by\ndeveloping and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.\nCorrect by April 17, 2016."
