The tiger attempted but was unable to\nlift his tail to urinate. The tiger was observed drinking water for approximately 45 seconds. According to the facility\nmanager, the tiger was previously on the road and brought back to the home facility the week prior (04/17/17)\nbecause he was not eating. The employee spoke with the attending veterinarian when the tiger was brought to the\nfacility and the veterinarian indicated he would evaluate the tiger but as of the time of the inspection had not\nperformed an evaluation. Lack of veterinary care can lead to pain and suffering of the animals. Licensee must\nhave the animal evaluated by the attending veterinarian.
