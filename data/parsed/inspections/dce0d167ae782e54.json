The left eye has a protruding \"bubble-like\" bulge on the pupil that is clear in appearance with a small\nspot of grey in the center. The bulge is approximately one quarter inch in diameter. The center of the interior portion\nof the right eye is cloudy and grey in color. There is a dark brown crusty matter in the fur around the edges of both\neyes.\nA white, grey and red male Shih-tzu approximately 9 years old (microchip number 0922-8062-4) has a problem with\nits right eye. The eye appears cloudy with a blue-grey color, making it difficult to visualize the pupil and other interior\nparts of the eye. The surface of the eye surrounding the cloudy portion is a pink color. The dog is also missing\nseveral teeth. At least one tooth was observed loose after the inspector applied light pressure to the top tooth in the\ncenter. Several remaining teeth have a dark brown discoloration next to the gums. Loose teeth can be painful and\nimpact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal.\nThe abnormal appearance of the animal's eyes could be an indication of injury, infection or other medical issues\nthat could be painful. The licensee must have both animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain a diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plan. The outcome of these consultations must be documented and provided to the inspector\nupon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times, including the\nuse of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnosis, and treat diseases and injuries.\nTo be corrected by: October 14, 2014.\nExit interview conducted with licensee."
