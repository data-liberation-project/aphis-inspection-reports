It does\nnot list/include all species currently at the facility (exhibit goats). There is a lack of detail in regard to the\npreventative care recommendations for all species. For example, for ectoparasite and internal parasite control for\nwild/exotic animals it simply states \"2x a year\". For domestic species there are no recommendations for external\nparasite control and for internal parasite control it states (cid:28)2x a year(cid:29). It is unclear as to whether this refers to\ntreatment and if so with what medications/dosages or if it refers to sampling/testing recommendations. The\neuthanasia recommendations are also incomplete: for wild/exotic species it states \"injection\" but does not state\nwhat type of injection and for the domestic species there are no recommendations. There are also no vaccination\nrecommendations for the exhibit animals. Lack of detail in the written program of veterinary care can lead to lack of\nadequate veterinary care for the animals. The facility shall, with their attending veterinarian, complete a written\nprogram of veterinary care that includes all aspects of veterinary care needed for the animals at the facility. Correct\nby 12/23/15."
