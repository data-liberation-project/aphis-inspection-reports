Additionally, it serves as\na secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. In its absence, there is greater risk of contact and\nunwanted exposure, with potential for injury and disease transmission to the unauthorized public or the regulated\nanimals themselves.\nThe perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical\ncontact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Fences less\nthan 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure, or less than 6 feet high, must be approved in writing by the\nAdministrator.\nTo be corrected by February 24, 2020.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee."
