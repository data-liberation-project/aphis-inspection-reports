The licensee stated\nthat she was not aware of this dog\u2019s condition. Once made aware of this dog\u2019s condition the licensee, following their\nProgram of Veterinarian Care, shaved the mat and treated the eye for the time being. This dog\u2019s matted hair around the\neye, crusty material and discharge from the eye could be due to a variety of veterinary medical conditions which may lead\nto pain and/or discomfort. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian regarding this dog\u2019s condition in order to\ndetermine an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan which must be followed and documented. The licensee must\nensure that adequate daily observations are performed to assess the health and well-being of all animals. A mechanism\nof direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,\nbehavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment\ncan be determined.\nTo Be Corrected: 3-5-2022\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nEnd Section"
