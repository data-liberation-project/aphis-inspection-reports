Also Wolfrun used 2 types of traps to try to catch the animal\nwith no positive results.\nAlthough the roughness of the area and the dense forest did not facilitate the recovery efforts and the multiple\nattempts of the facility to recover the escaped animal, the measures taken were not sufficient and/or appropriate.\nThis facility does not have staff trained to handle dangerous animals specifically regarding capture, handling,\nimmobilization, anesthesia, and tranquilization. A facility representative stated: \"one person on the dart team is\nretired Navy and the other has been hunting since he was age six; both men have excellent skills with guns\" ( the\nsecond person was not an employee of the facility). \"Excellent skills with guns\" is only part of an adequate\nqualification. The failure to re-capture this animal and its subsequent death puts in serious doubt the\nappropriateness of the measures taken to recapture the animal.\nWithout proper training the staff doesn't know how to handle the anesthetics and/or tranquilizers to use in the\nrecapture of escaped animals. (Type of medicine, dosage, size of the darts, etc.) In addition, the facility personnel\nhave not demonstrated that they know how to use the darts, prevent injuries, and put them in the most suitable area\ndepending on the species of the animal.\nThe failure to handle the animal properly and in a timely manner (recovered) evolved into the death of the animal\nand this is not in compliance with the requirements of the AWA 2.131 (b) (1) Handling: \"Handling of all animals shall\nbe done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress,\nphysical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\"\nThe escape and re-capture plan lacks information and guidance about which medicines can be used, when it can\nbe used, and how to use them (dosage, etc.). It also lacks guidance on when and how to quickly remove animals if\nthey are a threat to public safety.\nThe licensee must develop and maintain a complete and current plan to follow in the event of escape of any of the\nanimals; in addition it is necessary that all the employees receive basic training in this plan, and that this facility\nregularly performs escape drills exercises with all the employees and volunteers. Also all necessary measures must\nbe taken to prevent the reoccurrence of this kind of outcome, including additional training in the safety measures\nnecessary for the prevention of escapes for the entire staff of this facility.\nProfessional training in adequate Humane Capture and Handling of the animals is recommended for this facility.\nSome possible options include: the workshops from organizations like Safe Capture Group, the invitation of\nspecialists in the management of captive wild animals and/or training from recommended personnel from other\nfacilities with good escape and re-capture plans can be some of the possibilities to use for this training.\nAll the preventive measures, trainings and plans must be documented and must be available to the APHIS officials\nat the time of inspection.\nCorrect by: From now forward.\nInspection and exit interview conducted with the manager and the CEO."
