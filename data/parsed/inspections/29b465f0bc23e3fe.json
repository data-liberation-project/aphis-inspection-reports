There were multiple other 10ft x 10ft fenced off stalls holding various zebra, kangaroo, watusi, camel and\nalpaca along the length of and width of 2 sides of the total setup. The total area may be 20ft x 40ft, however there is\na loss of spacing for the open to the public feeding area where they walk among the animals to approx. 20x20.\nDuring the time of the inspection, there was only one attendant inside the corral area of the petting zoo who was\nletting everyone in at the same time without maintaining any limit of people inside having contact with the animals.\nAt one point there were over 45 people inside with 23 animals and 1 attendant, who was not watching any of the\npeople or animals the entire time. This happened several times with groups of 30-40 people moving in and out and\nwith only 1 attendant, who continually was not watching the animals or people in contact with them.\nToo many people in an enclosed area with multiple animals and only 1 attendant can easily cause an injury to one\nof the regulated animals. It is also too difficult for only 1 attendant to keep watch of over 10 people, and to have over\n30-40 people with animals loose roaming among them being fed. This limited number of attendants are not able to\nmonitor the animals properly to prevent any injuries to the animals, or public or to make sure inappropriate material\nis not being fed to the animals, hidden in a crowded situation.\nThere needs to be enough attendants to observe the public with the regulated animals, and they need to maintain\ncrowd control within the closed environment and not over load the capacity of the animal holding area with people.\nTo be corrected immediately.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Manager at the DuQuoin Fair in DuQuioin, Illinois."
