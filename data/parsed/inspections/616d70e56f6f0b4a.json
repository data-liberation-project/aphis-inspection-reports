The animal had a noticeable increase in respiratory effort, and each breath was easily heard audibly.\nThese breaths were heard standing up to 10 feet away from the animal. The animal was in good body condition and did\nnot appear lethargic. When asked if the animal had been seen by a veterinarian, the facility representative stated that they\nhad noticed the harsh breathing sounds coming from the ewe, but the veterinarian had not yet been contacted about the\nissue. The attending veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and they stated that they had been at the facility\none month prior to examine, vaccinate, and deworm the animals, and they had not noticed any respiratory signs at that\ntime. They confirmed that they had not been contacted about this ewe, and that the clinical signs described sound like\nsomething they would want to be notified of. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment for disease may result in pain\nto the animal, worsening of the condition, and possible spread of disease to additional animals if the condition is\ncontagious. The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate this animal and determine an\nappropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment. To be corrected by August 22, 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.\nn"
