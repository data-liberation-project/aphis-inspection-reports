There\nwas also no additional bedding observed inside the shelters for the spider monkeys. Although this inspector\ndetected some heat reaching the side of the enclosure, in the event of wind, rain and significantly cold ambient\ntemperatures, this set-up will not be adequate to protect the nonhuman primates. Exposure to the elements, wind,\nrain and cold temperatures without adequate shelter may cause discomfort and injury to the nonhuman primates.\nThe shelter must safely provide heat to the nonhuman primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling\nbelow 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C).
