The child was escorted by the parent and owner immediately to tend\nto the wound. The ferret was not harmed and was returned to its primary enclosure. The ferret did not have any\nphysical barriers other than the open top glass cased primary enclosure in which the owner allows the animals to be\nhandled by customers as long as they utilize sanitizer prior. The animal must be handled so that there is minimal\nrisk to the animal and to the public, with sufficient barriers in place to assure the safety of both. Correct by May 1,\n2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the authorized person."
