      "narrative": "Upon inspection of the records from the Feb. 2-3, 2018 and Dec. 1-2, 2017 auction sales, there were several\nanimals that were accepted for consignment from individuals without a valid USDA license. For example, the\nfollowing consignments for the December 2017 auction were from four unlicensed individuals: One porcupine and\n12 hedge hogs (#9190; 9162-9173); 53 hedge hogs and 7 guinea pigs (#9236-9251, 9254; 9260-9262); one female\nporcupine (#9148); one neutered male raccoon, a red fox, a pair of silver/marble fox, and a female coatimundi\n(#9256, 9257, 9258, 9258). During the February 2018 auction a ring-tail lemur (#4020) was consigned from an\nunlicensed individual. No official one-time exemption forms were included in the auction files provided to the\ninspector or in the Animal Care Information System. In order for APHIS Officials to track animal movement,\ninvestigate disease outbreaks, and to prevent illegal movement the person consigning the regulated animals to the\nauction sale must have a valid USDA License. The auction must not obtain an animal from any person who is\nrequired to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.\nThis was a records-only inspection conducted on April 5, 2018 at the Gulf Coast Auction in Madison, FL. Records\nfrom the December 2017 and the February 2018 auctions were inspected.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the facility representative."
