He was unable to conduct the inspection because he was babysitting young children. The inspector\nthen texted the licensee who said she had a doctor appointment with a specialist.

The inspector apologized that she could not wait that long and notified the\nlicensee that she would send an attempted report. The licensee then sought help from two different relatives but\nthey were also unavailable.\nAdditional Inspectors\nPlumlee Konnie, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist"
