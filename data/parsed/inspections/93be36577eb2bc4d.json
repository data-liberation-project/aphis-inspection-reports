      "narrative": "8 small ruminants were reluctant or unable to bear weight on some of their limbs or feet, and 2 additional small ruminants\nhad severely overgrown hooves. These animals are described below:\n1) A dark brown adult neutered male goat was extremely reluctant to bear weight on the left front foot, right front foot, and\nright hind foot. The animal was reluctant to get up and walk, and the right hind and left front feet appeared to be swollen.\nThe animal appeared to be in adequate body condition. The owner stated that he had treated the animal with LA-200\n(antibiotic) and a pour-on (topical) treatment from the feed store, and that the last treatment had been given was on\nSunday (March 7th). The owner stated that the lameness just got bad this past weekend, and that the animal had been\ntreated for this condition before.\n2) A black and white intact male goat, ear Tag #015, was reluctant to bear weight on both front feet, which appeared to be\nswollen. The animal was observed to have difficulty laying down and was seen to balance on his front knees with his head\ndown. The animal appeared to be in adequate body condition. The owner stated that he had treated the animal with LA-\n200 (antibiotic) and a pour-on treatment, and that the last treatment was administered 6 days ago (March 3rd).\n3) A black and white intact male sheep was extremely reluctant to bear weight on the right front foot, which appeared to\nbe swollen. The owner stated that this animal had been fine on Sunday, when it had been used for a petting zoo, and he\nhad not yet treated this animal for the lameness. The animal appeared to be in adequate body condition.\n4) A small light brownish red female goat had severely overgrown hooves on the back legs, and was reluctant to bear\nweight on the right front foot. The goat was in thin body condition and had a tucked abdomen. The hooves on the back\nlegs were so overgrown they were curving upwards and causing the back feet to be in an abnormal position. The owner\nstated that he had plans to trim the back feet and treat the right front foot for foot scald. The owner stated that this animal\nhasn't been lame on Sunday.\n5) A white Dorset adult female sheep had severely overgrown hooves on all four feet. The hooves were approximately\n1.5-2x the normal length. The animal appeared to be in adequate body condition.\n6) An adult white female sheep was lame on the left back leg. The animal had two lambs on her and a full udder and\nappeared to be in normal body condition. The owner stated that he had not treated her.\n7) A small male white and brown goat kid was reluctant to bear weight on the right front leg and the owner stated that he\nhad not been treated yet. The owner stated that this animal was not lame on Sunday.\n8) A grey and white adult female goat was lame on the right front foot. The owner stated that she had been treated with\nLA-200 (antibiotic) and a pour-on (topical) medication on Sunday.\n9) A small young black male goat kid, the offspring of the grey and white female above (#8), was extremely reluctant to\nbear weight on the left hind leg. The kid also had mild brown crusts around the nose and eyes. The owner stated that this\nkid had been given a dose of LA-200 (antibiotic) on Sunday.\n10) A black and white goat in the deer enclosure had severely overgrown hooves on the back legs. The animal appeared\nto be in normal body condition.\nThe facility owner stated that the attending veterinarian had instructed him to treat foot scald in goats with LA-200\n(antibiotic injection) and Copper tox (topical medication), but he had not been using Copper tox in part of concern about\ncopper toxicity in sheep. Instead, the facility owner had been using injectable LA-220 and a topical product for foot\ndisease from the feed store, the name of which he could not recall and which was unavailable at the time of inspection.\nAnimals that are reluctant or unable to bear weight on some of their limbs or feet may suffer from pain or discomfort, and\nthe condition may hinder an animal\u2019s ability or willingness to walk or run, to rest comfortably, and to access food, water,\nand shelter. The presence of severely overgrown hooves puts abnormal stress and strain on the hoof (foot) which can\ncause injury, inflammation, or dysfunction.\nCorrect by using a licensed veterinarian to provide adequate veterinary care for the sheep and goats."
