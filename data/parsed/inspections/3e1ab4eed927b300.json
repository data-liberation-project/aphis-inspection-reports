The veterinarians' evaluation of the procedure was that the difference in days\nbetween biopsies did not cause any adverse pain or effects to the NHPs.\n-Six starlings did not receive the protocol-indicated analgesia prior to and after vector infusions but they were under deep\nanesthesia and no adverse effects were reported/observed by personnel and the lab that studies starlings was found to\nhave taken corrective actions to prevent further recurrence.\nPrincipal investigators must ensure that procedures are done in accordance with the approved protocol.
