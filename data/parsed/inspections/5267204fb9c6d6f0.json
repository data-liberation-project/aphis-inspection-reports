The licensee provided an additional bowl of mush and the dog smelled it and\nwalked away. The dam has visible ribs, vertebrae and hip bones with little to no fat or muscle covering. The hair coat is\nthin and patchy as well with little to no hair on her tail. The licensee does not have a treatment plan approved by the\nattending veterinarian for underweight dogs and has not contacted the attending veterinarian regarding this dog. An\nemaciated or underweight body condition could indicate an underlying health issue and if left untreated could result in the\npain, distress, additional systemic problems or death of the animal.\nThe licensee must have frequent and direct communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate\ninformation on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being can be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. This\ndog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan in\nwriting.
