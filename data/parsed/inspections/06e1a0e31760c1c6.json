On September 30, 2016, personnel connected an enteral nutrition bag to a piglet's jugular catheter, an\nactivity not reviewed and approved by the IACUC in the Principal Investigator\u2019s animal study protocol. During an\nIACUC review of the event, the PI indicated personnel had accidentally attached an enteral nutrition bag to the\njugular catheter rather than the intended IV fluid bag. At the time of the incident, the error was realized by the\nlaboratory personnel and immediately reported to the veterinary staff. The Attending Veterinarian reported that the\npiglet died as a result of the incident. Although prior instruction had been provided to laboratory personnel for the\nappropriate post procedural care and feeding methodology for the animals on this protocol, personnel failed to\nfollow the IACUC approved protocol and prior training. Properly trained personnel are vital to ensure that research\nanimals receive proper care and optimal welfare. The research facility needs to ensure that all personnel involved\nin animal care and use are qualified and appropriately trained to perform their duties at all times. The research\nfacility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and\nswiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions, including but not limited to retraining of personnel and hiring a\nnew research assistant to oversee animal activities, to prevent future occurrences. This item has been corrected by\nthe facility.\nThe inspection was conducted with facility representatives on May 3 -4, 2017. An exit briefing was conducted with\nthe Attending Veterinarian on May 4, 2017."
