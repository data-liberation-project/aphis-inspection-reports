The debris accumulation along the walls appeared to be adhered to the enclosure surfaces.\nAccumulations of debris can create health hazards for guinea pigs. Although the facility representative indicated that\nenclosures are cleaned on a regular basis, the presence of the debris alongside the walls illustrated that the\nenclosures must be cleaned more thoroughly and/or more frequently to prevent debris accumulations.\nThe licensee must thoroughly clean and sanitize the enclosures at least once every two weeks or more often as\nnecessary to prevent an accumulation of debris. Correct by December 26, 2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
