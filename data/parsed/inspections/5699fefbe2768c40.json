This enclosure was inspected on April 30, 2019\nby a keeper and was reported to be in good condition and no gaps or openings were found. On May 12, 2019 in the\nearly morning it was discovered that Rita escaped from her enclosure. She was recaptured without incident at\n7:30am that same day and appeared to be in good health. The attending veterinarian was notified and examined\nRita on May 14, 2019, no injuries or medical issues were found. Through investigation, it is speculated that Rita\njumped up onto a narrow ledge at the top of her enclosure and managed to tear a small 6 in X 4 in opening where\nthe net covering the enclosure is attached to a cable and this is how she escaped.\nRita has been removed from this enclosure and is in an off-exhibit holding enclosure until repairs are made to her\non-exhibit enclosure.\nEnclosures for all animals must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in order to\nprotect the animals from injury. The facility should monitor all enclosures to ensure that they adequately contain the\nanimals housed within. A system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to\nensure the health and well-being of all animals.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative."
