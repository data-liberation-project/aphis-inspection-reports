      "narrative": "***On the morning of December 10th, 2020, an adult female reticulated giraffe was found dead in the giraffe enclosure\nafter experiencing exposure to extremely cold temperatures over the preceding weeks.\nA necropsy determined the cause of death was severe parasitism by intestinal parasites, causing blood loss (anemia) and\nprotein loss (hypoproteinemia). The giraffe was known to have intestinal parasites and was dewormed in accordance with\ninstructions from the Attending Veterinarian.\nFrom mid-November to mid-December 2020, the giraffe barn was renovated. The giraffes were able to move in and out of\nthe barn during the day while construction was ongoing, and were let out after the day's construction was finished. During\nthe last few days of November, outdoor temperatures consisted of lows in the 30F\u2019s and highs in the 50F\u2019s. Temperature\nwithin the barn was not recorded during November, but the animals were observed in the barn huddled in the corner\nwhere the heater was located. During the first week of December, outdoor temperatures consisting of lows in the 20F\u2019s,\n30F\u2019s, and 40F's and highs in the 50F\u2019s. Temperature measurements from within the giraffe barn included 42F, 40F and\n35F on the morning of December 2nd. Additional readings that week showed temperatures in the 40F\u2019s and 50F\u2019s inside\nthe barn.\nThe weather in the weeks leading up to the giraffe death was cold. The giraffe barn did not provide adequate heat for the\nlocal climatic conditions, especially before a barn door was installed. Exposure to cold temperatures is uncomfortable and\nmay impair a giraffe\u2019s immune system leading to sickness or death. Animals suffering from anemia are particularly\nvulnerable to the effects of cold weather exposure. The impact of cold temperatures on animal health may not be\nimmediately apparent and can have a delayed onset. The attending veterinarian concurs that the cold exposure may have\ncontributed to the death of the female giraffe.\nAt the time of this inspection, the giraffe barn had a door that closed and the temperature within the barn was being\nmaintained in the upper 50F\u2019s and low 60F\u2019s.\nCorrect by 01/29/2021, by continuing to provide heat and shelter for the giraffes that is adequate for local climatic\nconditions and to protect the animals from discomfort, and continuing to monitor temperatures within the barn to ensure\nadequate heat.\n***On November 17th, 2020, an adult female red river hog (\u201cStinky\u201d) was found \u201cnon-responsive and seizing\u201d in the\noutdoor enclosure and was brought inside the feed shed and provided with warmth and medical treatment. After\nrecovering, she was moved back outside and placed in an enclosure by herself, with a shelter and heat lamp. On\nNovember 25th, 2020, \u201cStinky\u201d was found to be \u201cnon-active, convulsing, cold\u201d in the outdoor enclosure and was brought\ninside the feed shed, where she was given medical treatment and warmth. \u201cStinky\u201d has been kept indoors since that time\nand has gained weight and is doing well, and facility management believes that the episodes described above were\ncaused by exposure to cold weather.\nOn November 30th, 2020, a second female red river hog who was housed with the male in the outdoor enclosure was\nfound to be cold and \u201cnonresponse\u201d with \u201cvery slight reflex\u201d and was brought inside the feed shed, provided with heat and\nshelter, and treated with medications. The hog died 90 minutes after being discovered. Facility management stated that\nthe cause of death was hypothermia, because the weather the night before had been very cold. A necropsy was not\nperformed. The Attending Veterinarian confirmed that the cause of death was likely hypothermia.\nFacility management indicated that the cold weather seemed to negatively impact the female hogs. The outdoor\ntemperatures during the end of November included lows in the 30F\u2019s and highs in the 50F\u2019s.\nAnimals who do not have adequate shelter during cold climatic conditions may suffer from hypothermia, discomfort, and\nfrostbite. At the time of this inspection, \u201cStinky\u201d was housed alone in an indoor enclosure with adequate heat and shelter.\nThe male remained outside, and a heat lamp was added to his shelter when temperatures were expected to be below\n40F.\nCorrect by 01/29/2021, by continuing to provide animals with adequate shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions,\nto afford them protection from the elements and to prevent discomfort."
