This method does not\nmeet the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act which requires euthanasia to be performed by a method that\nproduces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or distress, or a method that\nutilizes anesthesia produced by an agent that causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death. The\nlicensee reported 2 guinea pigs were euthanized this way approximately one month ago. The attending veterinarian\nwas contacted regarding the euthanasia method and did not approve this method being used without prior\ndiscussion and proper training.\nFailure to utilize a method of euthanasia consistent with the attending veterinarian\u2019s guidance and according to the\nrequirements of the Animal Welfare Act is likely to result in unnecessary pain and suffering to the animals.\nThe facility must utilize a method of euthanasia approved by their attending veterinarian and that complies with the\nrequirements of the Animal Welfare Act.\nCorrect from this day forward"
