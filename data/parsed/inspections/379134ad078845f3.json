The licensee had placed a metal mesh panel upright covering the exposed height of the gap but\nleft approximately an 8-inch-wide gap that the goats could attempt to go through trying to reach the metal roofing panels,\nvegetation or wood panel, that were located just behind the gap, potentially causing an injury or body part entrapment.\nThese areas of the primary enclosure could cause harm to the animals by allowing injury from the exposed sharp points\nwithin their enclosure or the gap in the wall.\nThe outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals\nfrom injury and to contain the animals.\nCorrected at time of inspection."

The structures\ncurrently provided to the existing animals at this facility need additional wind breaks to adequately protect from weather\nextremes. Additional shelters must be added to pastures prior to adding more animals to allow all animals access to\nshelter.\nInadequate shelter from the rain, cold, and other winter conditions could result in illness, as well as animal discomfort,\nduring winter weather extremes.
