The ammonia odor was strongest near the two front doors located near the hallway. There is a\nfresh air vent in the ceiling approximately 1/3 of the way in the room and a rear exhaust fan which was running\nevery 30 seconds in a five minute interval. Room # 1 is approximately 20 feet by 40 feet with a 9 foot ceiling. The air\ncirculating fan located near the fresh air vent in the ceiling did not appear to move air in the two front corners of the\nhamster room by the doors. Pans and bedding are cleaned at least weekly. The pans and bedding were last\ncleaned on Tuesday (2/26/19). The owner was in the process of cleaning pans in this room during the inspection.\nIndoor housing facilities for hamsters must be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the\nanimals. Licensee must ensure that hamster room is adequately ventilated at all times to protect the health and\ncomfort of the animals. The air quality must be improved in room # 1 housing Syrian/golden hamsters to reduce the\nbuildup of ammonia to protect the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by March 16, 2019.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner."
