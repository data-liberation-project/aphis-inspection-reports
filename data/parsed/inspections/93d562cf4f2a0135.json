The curator had informed the attending veterinarian of the lion being under weight. After further review of the\nlion(cid:25)'s medical record, there is no documentation of the lion being seen by the attending veterinarian for being\nunderweight nor is there documentation that the lion is receiving the changed diet. The diet for the lion currently\nposted in the kitchen is dated 12/2013 for 5 pounds of food for five days and two days of bones from chickens or\nrabbits. Failure to effectively communicate and document changes in health status and diet changes can potentially\nhave adverse effects on the animals health and inhibit weight gain.
