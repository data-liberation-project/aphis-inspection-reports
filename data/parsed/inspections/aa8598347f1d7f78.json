      "narrative": "A brown, adult female Shiba Inu identified by tattoo number #50, has a problem with its left front leg. The dog is\ncarrying its leg in an abnormal manner. The leg is non-weight bearing and when the dog tries to walk it hops to\navoid applying weight to the leg. The dog did not put its foot down the entire time while being observed by the\ninspectors. Failure of the dog to bear weight on its leg could indicate pain, discomfort and an underlying health\ncondition. The facility representatives stated that they were not aware of the problem but it may have been\ndocumented on the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s weekly report. The documentation for this problem does not indicate a\ndiagnosis and treatment plan. It simply states (cid:28)\"front foot watch close will recheck June 22 Wed(cid:29)\". This does not\nensure the dog is receiving adequate veterinary care.\nA white, adult female Lhasa Apso identified by tattoo number #1, has a problem with both eyes. The tissue around\nboth eyes is inflamed and reddened in appearance. The white of the left eye is extremely red in color and the hair\nsurrounding the eye is wet. There is also a greenish-yellow discharge coming from both eyes. A crusty brown\nmaterial is matted in the fur surrounding both eyes. Documentation for this dog does not indicate a diagnosis. There\nis a treatment plan listed but no records showing the treatment plan is being administered. Abnormal eye and skin\nconditions can be painful and cause discomfort to the dog.\nA brown, adult female Olde Bulldog identified by tattoo number #288, has an abnormal tissue growth in the corner\nof its right eye. The growth is covering approximately one-third of the eye(cid:25)s surface. There is also a whitish colored\ndischarge coming from the eye. The problem was identified first on April 27, 2016 by the attending veterinarian. The\ndocument simply states that the attending veterinarian will remove the growth when fully developed. The records do\nnot address the moist and whitish colored discharge that is coming from the eye. Abnormal tissue growth can be\npainful and cause discomfort for the dog.\nThe licensee must have the animals listed above examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and\nappropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented in detail and provided to the\ninspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nThe female Bulldog identified by tattoo number #257 and the male Golden Retriever identified by microchip number\n015-812-600 on the March 28, 2016 inspection report received veterinary care. The two Wheaten Terriers identified\nby tattoo numbers #135 and #66 received toenail maintenance.\nInspection and exit briefing conducted with the licensee, three facility representatives, Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin\nRanslem, ACI and an Iowa State Trooper.\nAdditional Inspectors\nMaxwell Kelly, Animal Care Inspector"
