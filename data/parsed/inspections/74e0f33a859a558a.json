      "narrative": "A tan eight year old Chihuahua, \"Hazel\", had been to the veterinarian on 26 September, 2019 and a dental cleaning\nhad been recommended by the veterinarian for the reddened gums and brown buildup on the teeth (both incisors\nand back teeth). The older tan Chihuahua \"Piper\" also had a dental cleaning recommended by the veterinarian for\nbrown buildup on the back teeth and inflamed, red gums. Both dogs had dental cleanings performed in 2017.\nDuring this inspection, both dogs were observed to have a large accumulation of yellow to dark tan/brown to black\nbuild up covering many of the teeth, with what appeared to be significant periodontal disease. The build up\nappeared heavier on both sides of the back teeth. The dog's gums were reddened and had receded along some of\nthe teeth as well.\nThe veterinarian has previously recommended to the licensee that dental cleanings for both dogs be performed as\nsoon as possible. At the time of inspection, there were no arrangements for dental cleaning, approximately two\nmonths after the Hazel's last veterinary examination. The dogs were currently not receiving any treatment. The lack\nof treatment for these dog's dental conditions can increase the risk that the condition will continue or worsen. The\nabnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition\ncould be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the\nanimal. The licensee must ensure that the veterinarian's treatment recommendations for both dog's dental condition\nare followed for the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care\nat all times.\nCorrect by 20 December, 2019\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSmith Pamela, Veterinary Medical Officer"
