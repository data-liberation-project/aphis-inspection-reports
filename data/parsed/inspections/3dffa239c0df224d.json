The park visitor was bitten or scratched on the left index finger during this\nfeeding. The park guest did not report this incident to facility personnel but later reported this injury to the State\nDepartment of Health which then placed the camel on a thirty day quarantine. This incident resulted in a negative health\nimpact to the park guest. Failure to adequately monitor public contact with animals poses a risk of injury to both the\nanimals and the public. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at\nall times during periods of public contact. To be corrected by August 16."
