Records show the surgeon, on the day of the surgery, observed a deficiency in\nthe pacemaker they were planning to use. To avoid prolonged anesthesia and a second major operative procedure, he\nreplaced the faulty device with a fully functioning pacemaker that he had immersed for approximately 20 minutes in Cidex\ndisinfectant solution, which the IACUC noted was a protocol violation. According to the CSMC AV Guideline: Chemical\nSterilization for Reuse of Implanted Devices document, a guideline that is referred to in the approved protocol,\u201d devices\nwill soak for a minimum of 10 hours in the chemical sterilant, rinsed thoroughly with sterile saline, and soaked for 10 hours\n(up to 48 hours) in sterile saline. Devices are then ready for immediate implantation.\u201d A review of documents and a\ndiscussion with the attending veterinarian (AV) confirmed the approved protocol was not followed as written.\nDocuments show there have been 4 prior occasions when the same surgeon has deviated off protocol since 2018.\n-On 3/8/2018 a bilateral femoral vein cutdown was performed on a pig without prior veterinary consultation from CM.\nThere were no complications associated with the procedure.\n-On 12/21/2018 a pig underwent peripheral venous injection of autologous (pig) stem cells not described on the approved\nIACUC protocol.\n-On 2/13/2019 the PI scheduled a pig to undergo surgery for telemetry implantation as a stand-alone procedure. The\nprotocol includes more invasive procedures, so the pig underwent a less invasive procedure than what is described.\n-On 1/27/22 an unapproved non-survival thoracotomy surgery was performed on one pig. Although a modification was\nsubmitted 2 additional procedures were performed prior to IACUC approval of the modification.\nThe IACUC has determined there were no animal welfare concerns regarding these occurrences. Records show\ncorrective action has been implemented after each incident to prevent reoccurrence, but additional events have occurred.\nFailure to follow an approved protocol may affect the health and well-being of the animals. These deviations from the\nprotocols were significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities that were not reviewed by\nthe IACUC.
