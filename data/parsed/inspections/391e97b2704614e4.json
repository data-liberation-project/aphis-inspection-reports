The\nmuntjac also has a swelling under its right eye. The facility isolated the muntjac but has not contacted the AV to see if\ntreatment is needed.\n\u2022 A lioness with a wound on the back of her neck for approximately two weeks. The facility has been treating this\nwound by isolating the lioness and applying a topical spray. While the injury has improved, the AV has not been\ncontacted.\n\u2022 Four ostriches with picking or barbering or fragile feathers. The facility did let the AV know that they were going to\nsupplement the ostriches with vitamin D, because the licensee was concerned about a vitamin D deficiency. No change\nwas seen with the supplementation. The licensee recently switched to alfalfa feed, because someone with a nutrition\nbackground told him that this might be a vitamin K deficiency. The AV was not notified about continued feather issues nor\nthe switch to alfalfa. No bloodwork or other diagnostic tests have been done on the ostrich.\n\u2022 A warthog with a broken right tusk\n\u2022 An elk with long hooves. All claws are overgrown and the right rear inside claw is curving to the right. The facility\nhas been hesitant to immobilize the animal for trimming because she may be pregnant. However, they have not\ndiscussed this with their AV.\n\u2022 A domestic sheep with a cut wound on its right left leg. The AV had originally seen the sheep when the wound\noccurred several months ago. However, the wound has not fully healed.\nIn addition the facility did not observe the following conditions during their daily observations and had not communicated\nthe issues to their AV: a young domestic goat with patchy hair loss on both sides of its body and a coyote with a\ndiscolored bottom incisor tooth.\nFailure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment for medical conditions may result in pain to the animal, worsening of the\nconditions, spread of disease to additional animals if the conditions are contagious, or death.\nCorrect by ensuring daily observations are performed on all animals to assess their health and well-being, and that a\nmechanism of direct and frequent communication exists so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal\nhealth, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV. The facility must communicate with the AV about the condition of\nthese animals and the AV must evaluate these animals and determine appropriate plans for diagnosis and treatment.\nTo be corrected by close of business on June 12, 2025.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted on June 11, 2025. This inspection report is limited to the Direct non-\ncompliances identified during that inspection. An additional inspection report will be delivered with the other issues\nidentified during this inspection.\nThis inspection was conducted with facility representatives.
