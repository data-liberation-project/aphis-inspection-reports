This failure does not allow oversight of animal use and the humane care and use program by the\nIACUC. Without this oversight lapses may occur that could affect adequate husbandry of the animals and their\nhealth and wellbeing. Conduct reviews of the humane care and use program at least once every 6 months and\ninclude the results of these reviews in the reports sent to the Institutional Official."
