The following instances of the laboratory staff implementing significant changes in an ongoing activity\nwithout prior review and approval by the IACUC and instances of the laboratory staff not following the approved protocol\nwere identified.\n1. According to the medical record of Pig 726, it underwent \u201cFluid Replacement\u201d procedure on 2/6/24 that included the\ninsertion of an intravenous catheter and the administration of inhalant anesthesia prior to \u201cFluid Replacement\u201d. This\nprocedure is not described in the IACUC approved protocol and was a significant change regarding the use of animals in\nan ongoing activity that was not reviewed or approved by the IACUC committee.\n2. IACUC approved protocol states that following the MI procedure the animals \u201care monitored for the 5 days post-op\nperiod\u201d and \u201cwill be checked at least once a day during the experiment\u201d. There was no documentation noted in the review\nof the medical records of 2 pigs that the monitoring of the animals was performed as described in the approved protocol.\nPig #726 underwent MI on 1/4/24 but there was no monitoring recorded in the medical record for 1/7/24 (post-op day 3),\nand there are multiple other days during the experiment when no monitoring of the animals was recorded in the medical\nrecords of pig #726 and pig #722.\n3. IACUC approved protocol states that aspirin will only be administered to pigs prior to the \u201cIPG\u201d procedure. However,\naspirin was administered to pig #726 and pig #733 prior to the MI procedure; the animals did not have the \u201cIPG\u201d\nprocedure. The administration of aspirin prior to MI procedure is not described in the IACUC approved protocol.\n4. IACUC approved protocol states that \u201csurvival studies that do not involve an open chest surgery require the\nfollowing\u2026..cefazolin\u201d. Pig #717 and pig #722 underwent a survival study that did not involve an open chest surgery.\nReview of the pigs\u2019 medical records revealed that a different antibiotic was given to the pigs and cefazolin was not\nadministered as is described in the approved protocol.\nPer this Section, with respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications to\nsecure approval, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing\nactivities prior to implementation by the investigator. Principal investigators are to follow the IACUC approved proposals\nand any proposed changes shall be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementation. The IACUC needs to\naddress the deviations with the IACUC approved protocol that were identified for this proposal for animal use and ensure\nthat all significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are reviewed and approved prior to\nimplementation. Correct by 4/5/24."

Entries made by veterinary and laboratory staff in the record of pig #726 for 2/3/24 and 2/5/24 noted that the animal\nwas lying down, lethargic, not finishing food, and was offered a special dietary product or fruit to entice it to eat. The\nmorning of 2/6/24 prior to a scheduled non-invasive study procedure, the entries in the record state that the pig was\nlethargic and had \u201cperipheral cyanosis\u201d however laboratory staff administered the injectable anesthetic and performed the\nnoninvasive procedure as planned. The last entry in the record on 2/6/24 was at 1410 when the pig was returned to its\nenclosure. There was no indication from the record that additional monitoring of the animal\u2019s condition was performed on\n2/6/24 following its return to its enclosure.\n2. Entries made by veterinary staff in the record of pig #726 for 2/7/24 noted at 8:50 AM that the pig was \u201clateral, cyanotic\nextremities\u201d and the pig tried to stand up twice but then fell on its side each time. Veterinary staff contacted laboratory\nstaff to inform them of the animal\u2019s symptoms. A veterinarian assessed the animal at 10:15 AM as being recumbent, pale\nmucus membranes, and the animal had cyanotic legs and ears. Despite the progression of the pig\u2019s clinical signs, the\nveterinarian did not euthanize the animal and prescribed the administration of a dose of the analgesic buprenorphine, to\nbe repeated at 3 PM. According to the record, the pig was not checked again by veterinary staff and laboratory staff\narrived at 12:02 PM to check the pig. The pig died at 12:08 PM. Necropsy revealed infection in the tissues of the neck and\nin the heart of the pig.\nPer this Section, each research facility shall maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of\nappropriate methods to control, diagnose, and treat diseases and problems of animal health. The entries made by\nveterinary staff in the record on 2/7/24 document that the clinical condition of the pig was deteriorating, yet the animal was\nnot humanely euthanized when the veterinarian assessed the animal at 10:15 AM on 2/7/24, the animal was not checked\nagain by veterinary staff following buprenorphine administration, and the animal subsequently died less than 2 hours later.\nCorrect from this date 3/5/24 forward by ensuring that appropriate methods are used to control, diagnose, and treat any\nproblems of animal health that develop to ensure that the research animals receive appropriate veterinary care."

The failure to contact the AV regarding problems of\nanimal health when the pig exhibited clinical signs following the 2/2/24 study procedure resulted inadequate veterinary\ncare and treatment of the animal.
