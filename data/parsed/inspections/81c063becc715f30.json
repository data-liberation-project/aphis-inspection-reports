She sustained injuries on her left hand and forearm,\nreceived immediate veterinary care and made a full recovery. At the time of inspection, the animal did not appear to\nbe in any pain or distress.\nUpon being notified of the escape of the monkey, the Veterinary Sciences Department immediately conducted an\ninvestigation. All the proper procedures had been followed by personnel. It could not be determined exactly how the\nanimal was able to escape from her enclosure, but it could have been attributed to the animal being able to unlatch\nan opening in the food access door.\nAs per section 3.80 (a) (2) (iii), primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the\nnonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.\nThe research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and implementing appropriate\ncorrective actions to prevent any future incidents.\nThis inspection was conducted on August 10, 2015.\nThis inspection and exit interview was conducted on August 11, 2015 with Dr. Ashley McIntosh (VMO), Dr.\nChristina Der (VMO) and facility representatives.\nAdditional Inspectors\nDer Christina, Veterinary Medical Officer"
