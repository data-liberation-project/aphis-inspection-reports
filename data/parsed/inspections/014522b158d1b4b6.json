The animal has over 80% coverage of tartar build up on the back\nmolars, multiple teeth on the left side of the mouth are mobile and the gums bleed when touched and an abscess is\ndraining on the right upper side of the mouth. The dog exhibited signs of pain during the exam including struggling\nand wincing.\nA fawn female pug with a microchip ending in 5803 was noted to have a nail that was completely missing on the\nright front paw. The area appeared raw and had a clear discharge coming from the nail bed.The licensee had not\nnoted the problem and was not providing treatment.\nTwo white female Bichons with microchips ending in 5290 and 6347 were matted mostly over their flank area. The\nlicensee states they only groom the dogs once a year. The skin underneath the mats did not appear irritated.\nA black and white female Boston Terrier with a microchip ending in 4339 had several round bald crusty areas of\nskin on her flanks and four red and swollen paws. The dog's chest and neck appeared to be red and had scabs and\ncrusty skin. The licensee had noted the problem and had treated the dog with Aloe First three times in one week.\nHowever their PVC states that they are to be treating minor skin infections with Aloe First twice a day for 7-10 days.\nThe licensee must provide adequate veterinary care for the kennel as dictated by the attending veterinarian.\nAdequate veterinary care is necessary to ensure optimal animal health.\nThe attending veterinarian must examine and provide adequate treatment for the Cavalier by 8/18/2017.
