In Amsterdam a sticker had been applied noting that the\npuppies were offered food and water at that stop. The paperwork for this shipment included an IATA checklist which\nhad been completed and signed, indicating that feeding instructions were attached to the crate, but they were not.\nFailure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the\ntime of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animals at risk. This information should be clearly displayed\non the carrier, during transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order\nto help ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives at the cargo office."
