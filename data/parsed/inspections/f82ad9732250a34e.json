The inspector had access to bobcats and educational animals at this time. Additionally one\nsection of the perimeter fence was open and anyone could have had access to the park with no employee\nknowledge. Although the park is closed during winter months, these doors and gates should be closed and locked\nto prevent unauthorized persons from entering the facility and for secondary containment should an animal get out\nof a primary enclosure. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the animals.\nCorrect by: Feb 18, 2016\nAn inspection briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection."
