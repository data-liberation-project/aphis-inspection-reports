The rust was\nfound to be pitting and flaking on the frame around the lower mesh panels on two sides of each enclosure.\n\u2022 In the singly housed lemur enclosure, two areas of excessive rust had caused deterioration of the enclosure\u2019s metal\npoles that anchor the chain-link. One area had completely rusted through the enclosure\u2019s lower horizontal metal pole at\nthe center back wall leaving approximately 16 inches of missing pipe with jagged metal edges remaining. The defect was\ncovered with a metal grate, but the rust continued along that lower metal pipe to the right rear corner of the enclosure.\nThere, it was rusted away at both the horizontal (missing approximately 4 inches) and the vertical portion (missing\napproximately 2 inches) of the metal pipes that made up that bottom right corner leaving sharp jagged edges as well.\nMore rust was observed flaking on most of the mesh panel at the left side of the enclosure where the lemur climbs. All\nthe rusted areas and sharp points were accessible to the lemur.\nLemurs were coming into contact with the rusted areas and the singly housed lemur was also exposed to sharp jagged\nedges. Excessive rust on surfaces indicate that the surfaces can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized. In\naddition, the excessive rust can affect the structural strength of the metal and exposure to jagged metal edges could\ninjure the lemurs. Rusty areas that cannot be treated, that have diminished structural strength, or are missing, will need\nto be replaced.

This perimeter fence also had gaps between two separate fence posts that were adjacent to\nopposite sides of a food storage building causing approximately 5-8\u201d wide gaps. An access gate of this perimeter fence\nwas found open during inspection and holes below the fence were also observed. The licensee stated the holes were\ncaused by a tortoise kept on the property that has been digging (one area was approximately 2 feet long by 3 feet deep\nby 3 feet wide with a piece of sheet metal overlying the hole, another hole approximately 18 inches long by 12 inches\ndeep by 12 inches wide had fencing material lying over it). Also, vegetation was overgrowing the 37 inch tall section of\nperimeter fence from the neighboring property. The vegetation was touching this portion of the perimeter fence along the\nshared property line for approximately 50 feet.\n\u2022 Another lemur, singly housed away from the other lemurs, was enclosed in a separate perimeter fence that was 6 feet\nhigh but not 3 feet from her primary enclosure. It was no more than approximately 12 inches away along two sides of her\nprimary enclosure, and at one area, was touching her enclosure due to a gap of approximately 9 inches where the 6-foot-\ntall panels did not touch to make a continuous perimeter.\nThe lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the non-human primates within the facility in that there\nisn\u2019t an adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient\nbarrier to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high for non-human\nprimates, as well as a minimum of 3 feet away from the primary enclosures, is needed. The perimeter fence must be\nconstructed to prevent unauthorized humans and other animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going\nthrough or under it. The facility shall ensure the primary enclosures for the non-human primates, are enclosed by an\nappropriate perimeter fence, or a variance, if appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be requested from the\nAdministrator/Regional Office.\nMUST BE CORRECTED BY: OCTOBER 10, 2022"
