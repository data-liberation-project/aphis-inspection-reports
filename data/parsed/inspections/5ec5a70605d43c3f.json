Rabbit #213\nwas immediately euthanized. The rabbits are individually housed, and the second rabbit in the enclosure with #213 had\nescaped from the neighboring enclosure. These rabbits are housed in racks of enclosures that have dividers between\nadjacent enclosures that have a 2.25 inch gap at the top. The rabbit from the neighboring enclosure was small enough to\nfit through that gap and get into #213\u2019s enclosure. The animal caretaker for the rabbits said that smaller rabbits upon\narrival to the facility are sometimes able to fit through the gap at the top of the divider. The attending veterinarian\nconfirmed that the rabbits are single housed because the enclosures are too small to provide adequate social distancing\nneeded to safely pair house them. A post-mortem examination was done on rabbit #213 and the facility incident report\nstates that a \u201ctraumatic lumbar-sacral fracture was identified \u2013 likely sustained during a fight with the escaped cohort.\u201d\nEnclosures for rabbits need to be constructed in a way that securely contains them and protects then from injury. The\nfacility has two types of enclosures for individually housing rabbits and the type that has the gap at the top of the divider is\nno longer in use since this incident.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.\nn"
