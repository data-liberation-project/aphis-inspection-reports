The PI discovered one bat had not survived transport and two other bats appeared\nvery weak and lethargic. The two weak bats were housed individually, provided food and water by the PI, including fruit, a\nfruit smoothie, and sugar water, and checked on frequently. Approximately 12 hours later, the bats were found deceased.\nAccording to the approved protocol, any illness or signs of abnormalities in the bats are to be reported to the university\nveterinarians. However, the PI failed to notify any university veterinarians regarding the poor condition of the bats upon\narrival. Failure to ensure direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding abnormal\nobservations found on animals prevents the veterinarian from assessing the animals and providing adequate veterinary\ncare. Correct by September 17, 2024, by ensuring any abnormalities found on animals during daily observations are\ncommunicated in a timely manner to the AV to ensure animals have access to prompt and adequate veterinary care.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
