The licensee reports\nthe enclosures are sprayed every morning to clean them and had been cleaned earlier in the day but cleaning issues\nwere identified in the afternoon. The enclosure housing the male capuchin itself was clean but there was an accumulation\nof food waste and excreta underneath and behind the enclosure. Apparently these are difficult areas to reach. The floor of\nthe female capuchin's enclosure had a thin layer of smeared excreta covering the floor. It appeared as if water/fluids on\nthe floor wetted and spread the fecal material. The bars of the enclosure had material the color of the fecal material and\nfeed biscuits smeared on them. The bottom of the feet of the capuchin were soiled by the material. A few flies were noted\nin the building. Accumulations of excreta and food waste can lead to soiling of the animals, attract pests and spread\ndisease/infection.\nThe facility must remove excreta and food waste from inside each enclosure daily and from underneath them as often as\nnecessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates from\nbecoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards, pests and odors. When water is used to clean the enclosure, nonhuman\nprimates must be removed unless the enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals will not be harmed, wetted or\ndistressed. Perches, bars and shelves must be kept clean. Correct by March 26, 2022."
