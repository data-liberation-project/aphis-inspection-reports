      "narrative": "On March 15, 2017 a routine inspection was performed at the DFW site of Qatar Airways Cargo. Records for\nanimal imports and exports were requested. An employee pointed out a couple of file cabinets and boxes and\nstated the records for the past 3 months were in the cabinets or the boxes. Records older than 3 months were in a\nwarehouse somewhere. These cabinets and boxes included all cargo shipped during the past 3 months, not just\nanimal records. In order to thoroughly review records for animals shipped since the last inspection records for every\npiece of cargo handled by Qatar since Nov 2016 would have had to be reviewed. Some of those records would\nhave been in the \u201cwarehouse\u201d and unavailable for review. The supervisor was not available at the time of the\ninspection so a business card and a note were left with an employee requesting the supervisor call me so we could\ndiscuss the situation. As of today, Monday March 20, 2017, I have not been contacted by anyone from Qatar about\nthese concerns.\nProviding adequate records in a timely manner continues to be a problem for this facility.\nCarriers and intermediate handlers must furnish to any APHIS official any information requested in connection with\nthe enforcement of the provisions of the AWA.\nThis inspection was conducted with a facility employee."
