Closer examination of the animal revealed\nnumerous small black insects crawling throughout the affected area. The licensee was unaware of the condition and\nstated that he has never applied parasite control products to the spotted skunk.\nA white, adult, female skunk has extreme hair loss on its body. The area behind both shoulder blades, across the\nback, and around the base of its tail are nearly completely devoid of hair. The hair loss extends down the sides of its\nbody to its abdomen. The last one-third of the tail also has severe hair loss and a crusty dark brown material is\npresent on the affected area.\nA white, adult, female raccoon has abnormal areas of hair loss on its body. The hair loss is located behind the rib\ncage across the right and left flank area. The area of hair loss is larger on the right side of the body and the entire\ntail is completely devoid of hair.\nThe licensee has not consulted a veterinarian about the abnormal health conditions of the animals listed above.\nSkin problems can indicate the presence of ectoparasites, poor health or nutrition or injury/trauma to the animal.\nConditions such as these may be painful, cause discomfort and lead to further health complications.\nAppropriate methods to prevent, control, observe, diagnose and treat diseases, injuries or parasite problems should\nbe in place for all animals. The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure\nthat an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This\ninformation, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made\navailable to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary\ncare at all times."
