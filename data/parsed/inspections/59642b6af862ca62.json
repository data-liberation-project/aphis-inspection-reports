We waited by the door for about 5\nminutes, when no one came to the door we returned to the vehicle to call the licensee. The licensee did not answer\nthe phone and a voicemail message was left. While waiting at the facility the licensee called us back and notified us\nthat he was currently out of state. He also informed us that he was not sure when he would be back to his facility. I\nasked the licensee if he could email his itinerary to me so I can try to arrange for another inspector to inspect him\nwhile he was traveling. The licensee stated that he would email his itinerary to me.\nAdditional Inspectors\nWelch Scott, Veterinary Medical Officer"
