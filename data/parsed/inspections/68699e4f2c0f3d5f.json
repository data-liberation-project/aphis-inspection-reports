I arrived at 1:45 PM and knocked on the front door and rang\nthe bell on the back door of the facility. I received no response. I called and texted both numbers that I had for the\nlicensee with no response. I then called the store in Saginaw site 001. I spoke to an employee that said she would reach\nout to the store manager as he was at lunch to see if he could contact the licensee. After about 20 minutes I called again\nand the store manager was back at the Saginaw store. I was told by an employee that the licensee had no signal on his\nphone and could not receive texts or calls and that the store manager had contacted the licensee using IM. I was told to\ntry to text again and I did with no response from the licensee. I decided to wait longer as I was told by the employee at site\n001 that someone was supposed to be at the store to pick the parakeets and rabbits up for transfer to Saginaw. I waited\nuntil 4:00 PM. I attempted to call the Saginaw store twice with no response. I then left to return home. Failure to provide\naccess to the facility, animals, and records for inspection is a serious violation of the AWA and regulations. Failure to\ncomply may result in enforcement action.\nEnd Section"
