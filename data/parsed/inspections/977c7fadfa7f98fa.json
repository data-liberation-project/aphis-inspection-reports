      "narrative": "A white, male Maltese approximately 10 years old and identified by microchip (#029-099-848) is exhibiting abnormal\nbehavior. The dog is observed in a sitting position and constantly licking its teeth and gums. After about a minute,\nthe inspector requested the licensee to remove the dog for a closer examination. Most of the dog's teeth are\nmissing, but among the remaining, there are two loose cheek teeth that are partially covered with a dark brown\ntarter. The dog also has an excessive build-up of dry, black-colored, crusty matter around both eyes. The crusty\nmaterial is matted in the fur with small areas tightly adhered to the skin. The skin in these affected areas appear raw\nand moist. This can cause discomfort for the dog and potentially lead to skin problems. The licensee stated that she\nwas aware of the condition but said pulling the mats off would redden the skin and make it worse. After the dog was\nreturned to the enclosure, it continued the abnormal behavior of constantly licking its teeth and gums. A veterinarian\nhas not evaluated the dog's condition. The dog's abnormal appearance and behavior can be an indication of mouth\npain caused by loose teeth and/or dental disease.\nThe licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan. Additionally, the licensee needs to consult the attending veterinarian to develop and follow a dental\nand hair coat maintenance plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the\ninspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times."
