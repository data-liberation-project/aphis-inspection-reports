      "narrative": "There are multiple animals identified at the facility that require veterinary care. This included:\nOne adult singly housed groundhog had a severe, mostly healed, injury to the right eye. The globe of the eye was not\nvisible and appeared to be sunken completely into the eye socket which was still open exposing soft tissue within. There\nwas a large amount of fur missing around the eye and the skin was discolored (glossy white where it normally would be\npigmented) these areas appeared to be scar tissue. There were a small number of scabs and moderate amount of flaky\ndried skin in this area. This area of apparent scarring covered several inches extending from the groundhog\u2019s ear past\neye. The scabs and dried flaky skin extended nearly to the nose. The lower lid of the eye was irregular and had a healed\ntear in it at the midpoint. The fur that is present on the upper eyelid had yellow-brown crusts accumulated and there were\nbits of bedding and foreign material on the groundhog\u2019s head and face and what appeared to be a small amount within\nthe eye socket. The licensee stated that the animal\u2019s injury was traumatic had been previously identified however, the\nveterinarian had not treated this animal when the injury occurred. Failure to have animals with injuries, trauma, and\nwounds examined by a veterinarian so that appropriate treatment can be provided may lead to infection, worsening of the\ncondition, and unnecessary suffering. Correct by having this animal evaluated by a veterinarian so that appropriate\ntreatment methods can be provided at this time to prevent foreign material from entering this area and worsening this\ncondition.\nOne adult white colored red fox, housed in a pair, had hair loss from the base to the tip of the of the tail. The licensee\nstated that this animal was just shedding its winter coat, however, the hair loss is extreme and focused nearly entirely on\nthe tail. The hair which remains on the tail is extremely short and patchy. There are several places along the underside\nand top where there appears to be no hair present. The last 1-2 inches of the tail have no hair present and there are red\nmarks that appear to be superficial abrasions or wounds that may indicate chewing. While shedding during this time of\nyear is consistent with normal physiological changes that fox undergo seasonally, the pattern and degree of hair loss is\nnot typical for shedding fox and must be assessed and treated by a veterinarian. Focal hair loss may occur due to injury,\nnutritional abnormalities, parasitic infection, or self-trauma from psychological distress. Failure to use appropriate\nmethods to control or diagnose abnormalities in the animals\u2019 fur can delay treatment or cause the condition to worsen.\nCorrect by having this animal evaluated by a veterinarian to properly diagnose the cause of this hair loss and follow all\ntreatment recommendations.\nThe program of veterinary care directs the facility to conduct fecal testing on 10 percent of the animals at the facility each\nyear. The licensee stated that he had not had fecal testing completed of any animals in the last year. Multiple animals\nhave diarrhea and loose stool at the facility. Dark watery stool was present in the enclosure housing one male and one\nfemale adult bobcat. There was approximately 5 approximately 2-5 inch puddles of black/green liquid excreta present on\nthe floor of the enclosure. The licensee stated that he had not seen this before, but that the diet had recently been\nchanged from chicken to muskrat and likely resulted in loose stool in the animals. One enclosure housing two red fox had\nyellow mucoid watery stool present under the enclosure. One enclosure housing a female artic fox with her litter of pups\nhad significant amounts of diarrhea underneath. Loose stool can be an indicator of intestinal parasites, nutritional\nproblems, and disease in the animals. Failure to consult the attending veterinarian when diarrhea occurs can result in\ndelay in diagnosis and treatment causing the condition to worsen. Additionally, failing to follow the guidance provided by\nthe attending veterinarian regarding routine parasite screening by regularly testing fecal samples can delay proper\ndiagnosis necessary for the prevention of parasitic diseases in these animals. Correct by ensuring that the routine fecal\nsampling of 10% of all animals annually that was recommended by your attending veterinarian as part of your program for\nadequate care is completed. Additionally, ensure that animals with active signs of diarrhea or loose stool are examined\nby a veterinarian so that appropriate treatment can be administered."
