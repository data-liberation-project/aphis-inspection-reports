      "narrative": "At the time of inspection, two wolves were observed to be in need of veterinary care.\n(cid:28)\"Baci\", a 15 year old male artic wolf was observed with a dark, black, thick discharge coming from the rectum. The\ndischarge was so profuse that it stained the fur around his hindquarters. The animal was observed licking the area\nrepeatedly. The licensee stated that \"Baci\" had cancer and that the veterinarian said if the tumor was removed\nsurgically, it would likely come back. The licensee said she was told to keep the animal comfortable until it was time\nto euthanize. The veterinarian stated that the wolf had been seen last December for a mass on the rectum. A biopsy\nwas performed and it was diagnosed as a perianal adenoma. However, the veterinarian recommended that the\nanimal be neutered at a clinic and told the licensee that neutering was often curative. The licensee declined to have\nsurgery for \"Baci\".\n\"Coco\", a 14 year old wolf was diagnosed with mammary cancer last July. The licensee stated that the veterinarian\ntold her to bring the wolf home and make her as comfortable as possible. According to the veterinarian, he told the\nlicensee that \"Coco\" was near the end of her life and prescribed Rimadyl, 75 mg tablets, to be given to \"Coco\" twice\neach day to help with inflammation and pain. However, the licensee stated that Rimadyl caused liver problems and\nthus did not administer this medication. Instead she was giving \"Coco\" an herbal supplement called Raviola.\nThe use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat animals is a requirement of this section of\nthe Animal Welfare Act. Failure to obtain surgery for \"Baci\" and not administering medication per veterinarian(cid:25)s\ninstructions for \"Coco\" caused both animals unnecessary pain and discomfort. All medications, including\nsupplements, must be prescribed or approved by the attending veterinarian.\nCorrect by having these animals seen by a licensed veterinarian and following all recommendations including those\nregarding examination, diagnosis, treatment and future recheck examinations as needed. Additionally, the licensee\nmust maintain a record of these recommendations for APHIS officials.\nThe license was verbally instructed to have \"Baci\" and \"Coco\" examined by the veterinarian by Friday, 5/23/15, two\ndays after the inspection."
