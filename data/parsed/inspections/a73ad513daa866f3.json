The concrete floors in\nthese rooms have been covered/sealed with several layers of acrylic paint. In multiple areas in all three rooms bare\nconcrete was exposed in places where the paint had peeled away. Water was pooling in the damaged areas and\ncollecting in between separating layers of paint.\nStanding or pooling water can serve as reservoirs for microbial growth, contribute to excessive humidity levels and\ninhibit the benefits of cleaning and husbandry procedures. Facility personnel stated that the floors had been\nrepaired approximately one month ago. Alternative repair solutions may need to be reviewed.\n* Large gaps were noted at the horizontal junction of the walls and floor in the lab in Building 1. The gaps were\nvisible in multiple places especially near the front of the room. A vertical wall seam near the front of the room was\nalso noted to be separating.\n* The metal unistrut tracking used to support suspension of primary enclosures in Room C11 in Building 2 was\nnoted to have areas of excessive rust. The rusted metal was flaking and deteriorating when touched. Rusted, flaking\nmetal may compromise structural integrity and eventually jeopardize proper suspension of the enclosures and result\nin injury to the animals.\nAll animal housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to prevent injury to the animals and\nfacilitate required husbandry procedures. The above identified non-compliances should be repaired or replaced.\nCorrect by: July 15, 2015.\nThis inspection included regulated animals and related facilities.\nThe inspection and exit interview were conducted with the director of operations, other facility representatives and\nAPHIS personnel."
