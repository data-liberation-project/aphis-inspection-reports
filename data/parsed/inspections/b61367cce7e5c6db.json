      "narrative": "1) The single housed adult female Bull Terrier is exhibiting abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behavior.\nDuring the inspection on June 28, 2017, & June 29, 2017, this dog was observed spinning in circles repeatedly in a\nfast motion. The care takers were unaware of what care this dog has received from the last inspection. The care\ntakers stated during the previous inspections this dog was not able to exercise with other dogs due to its aggression\nwith other dogs. The licensee stated during the last inspection that he would place this dog in a new home. The\nlicensee now states this dog will be housed in a larger area of the kennel for more room and exercise, however\nthere is concern that she will have access to other dogs at the kennels. The licensee stated that this dog was seen\nby a veterinarian and just does this when he is approached, however there is no written documentation or treatment\nplan to address this issue available during this inspection.\nThis Bull Terrier needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnosis, the cause of this behavior and\ndevelopment of an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. There needs to be written documentation by\nthe Attending Veterinarian, recommendations regarding kennel space, exercise, enrichment and any other steps\nnecessary to address this abnormality. This shall be maintained by the licensee for review by APHIS Officials.\nAdditionally, the licensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of these recommendations for review\nduring inspections. This non compliance was cited during the February 7, 2017 inspection.\n2) During the February 7, 2017, inspection the adult female English Bulldog named Elizabeth (microchip\n#900085000072610) had an injury she received about two weeks prior by going under some damaged fencing with\nsharp edges. The wound was approximately 1/2'' deep and 3\u2019' to 4'' long and an inch wide is located at the left front\nrib area behind her shoulder appears to be healed. The wound now appears to be healed, however there was no\nwritten documentation available to show this dog was seen by the attending veterinarian as cited during the\nFebruary 7, 2017, inspection.\n3) During this inspection on June 28, 2017, and June 29, 2017, the adult French Bulldog named Madonna\n(microchip #9000085000072632) and an adult female French Bulldog name Rima had an an occurrence of diarrhea\nin their enclosures. Madonna was observed thin, dull coat, and ribs visible showing. The care takers were asked by\nVMO Mario Mercado how long they had diarrhea and they stated about 2 weeks off and on. The care takers stated\nthey normally just feed and clean the kennel, medical issues are cared for by the licensees spouse. The caretakers\nstated they told the licensee about the diarrhea and the licensee's spouse who usually visits on the weekends\ntreated these dogs. The licensee confirmed his wife was treating the dogs.. The written documentation provided\nafter the inspection show on March 17, 2017, Madonna was administered ivermectin each month but no day and\ndosage listed and pyrantel with no dosage listed. Ivermectin tubes of 1.87% paste for Horses with an expiration\ndate of November 2015, and multiple brands of anti parasite medications were available, several expired during the\ninspection. The licensee stated all the dogs were given pyrantel dewormer around the same date in March 2017.\nThe licensee was unaware of what ivermectin was provided monthly for all the dogs and no receipt purchasing\nivermectin was available. Expired ivermectin may not prevent these dogs from acquiring heart worm and if left\nuntreated can be fatal.\nTo ensure the health and welfare of these dogs at this kennel they need to be seen by a licensed veterinarian.\nThis facility has not provided adequate veterinary care for its dogs under this section 2.40(b)(2) during previous\ninspections on 11/24/14, 7/16/15, and 2/7/17. There must be adequate veterinary care program establish and\nmaintained, including the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries,\nand the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care; That the mechanism of direct and frequent\ncommunication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and\nwell-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian."

Although ambient temperatures must not rise about\n85 (deg) F for over 4 hours, French and English Bulldogs in general, especially pregnant bitches and older dog may\nneed lower temperatures to keep cool and comfortable.
