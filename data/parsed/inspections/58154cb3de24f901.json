An attendant is present but does not have\ncontrol of the animals and they are free to roam about, jump and climb on people. The injury occurred during an exhibition\nwhen a coatimundi bit a member of the public. All animals during public exhibition must be handled so there is minimal\nrisk of harm to the animal and to the public, with enough distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general\nviewing public to assure the safety of the animals and the public. The current method of handling these animals is not\nsufficient to prevent possible injury to the public.
