It was noted when GP #98 was examined during the inspection, that all of the animal(cid:25)'s toe nails were\nexcessively long when compared to the length of the toe nails of the other 3 GPs housed in the same room. The\nanimal moved normally and none of the toe nails were damaged. The GPs are regularly handled by facility\npersonnel whenever the primary enclosures are changed and according to the room log, the enclosure of GP #98\nhas been changed 3 times per week for at least the past month.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, all personnel involved in animal care should be appropriately trained in the\nproper handling and care for the species of animals that they care for. The excessive length of the toe nails of GP\n#98 should have been recognized by facility personnel at the time of direct handling of the GP during routine cage\nchanges and the toe nails trimmed accordingly. Excessively long nails can be associated with discomfort and can\nbe prone to injury.\nAlthough this item was corrected by facility personnel during the inspection by trimming the long toe nails of GP\n#98, the Registrant needs to ensure that all personnel involved in animal care are familiar with the proper care and\nhandling of the species of animals that they care for and are familiar with the normal physical and behavioral\ncharacteristics of those species so that any deviations from normal are promptly recognized and appropriately\naddressed.\nCorrect by 5/22/15."

On 9/3/14 a rabbit died while under general anesthesia for an IACUC approved research activity when the\nventilator abruptly malfunctioned. The rabbit experienced serious respiratory effects and died despite the\nimmediate efforts of the AV to resuscitate the animal.\nThe unexpected death of the rabbit during general anesthesia was reported to the IACUC by the investigator the\nfollowing day. As a result of being informed of the rabbit's unexpected death, the IACUC conducted an investigation\nand concluded that the failure of the ventilator was the result of: (1) the failure of veterinary staff to perform any\nroutine maintenance of the ventilator as recommended by the manufacturer since the unit was purchased in\nOctober 2008; and (2) a 24 volt power supply cord was used with the unit during the general anesthesia of the\nrabbit instead of the 12 volt power supply cord supplied by the manufacturer and the subsequent overvoltage likely\ndamaged components of the ventilator contributing to failure of the unit.\nPer this Section of the Regulations, the program of veterinary care at research facilities should include the\navailability of appropriate facilities and equipment to comply with the provision of adequate veterinary care to the\nanimals. The availability of appropriate equipment includes ensuring that any equipment required for the care and\nuse of the animals that are used in approved research activities is functioning properly, personnel are familiar with\nthe proper use and maintenance of the equipment, and the equipment is maintained and serviced according to the\nmanufacturer's recommendations to ensure that the equipment operates reliably and as expected.\nThe IACUC acted to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and USDA,\nand implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions included but\nwere not limited to requiring the performance of and documentation of all routine preventative maintenance of\nequipment as per manufacturer'(cid:25)s recommendations as well as the review of that documentation by the IACUC\nduring every semi-annual facility inspection, tethering the power supply cord that comes with all equipment to each\npiece of equipment, and providing all veterinary technical staff with additional training on the proper use and\nmaintenance of the new ventilator unit.\nThis item has been corrected."
