This area has been under a heat advisory from June 15, 2018\nto June 17, 2018 according to the National Weather Service. According to Ottumwaradio.com, the area is under a\nheat warning on the day of the inspection. The maximum outdoor temperature on the day of the inspection was 95\ndegrees F and occurred at approximately 3:55 pm according to weather underground.com and the previous 3 days\nhad high temperatures of 94 to 95 degrees F.\nThe facility has two sheltered housing buildings containing adult dogs and puppies. These are the only two\nstructures on the facility that house dogs and at the time of the inspection, the dogs had resided within the buildings\nall day.\nThe first building, housing approximately thirty-one adult dogs, has an ambient indoor temperature of 91 degrees F\nand a heat index up to 108.4 degrees F according to the Kestrel. The majority of the adult dogs are showing signs\nof heat stress such as open mouthed breathing, an increased respiration rate, and heavy panting with their tongues\nextended from their mouths.\nThe second building, housing approximately thirty adult dogs and forty puppies, has an ambient indoor temperature\nof 94 degrees F and a heat index up to 109.7 degrees F according to the Kestrel. The majority of the adult dogs are\nshowing signs of heat stress such as open mouthed breathing, increased respiration rate, and heavy panting with\ntheir tongues extended from their mouths. All the litters of puppies are spread out around their enclosures and one\nfour and a half week old puppy was observed to be panting and has an increased respiration rate.\nBoth buildings have windows or dog doors that are open and the second building has a fan running. The facility\nrepresentative stated that the animals are occasionally misted with water to help cool them. Excessive heat\ncombined with high humidity can have a dangerous or detrimental affect on the health and well-being of the adult\ndogs and puppies.\nThe sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to\nprotect the dogs from temperature or humidity extremes and to provide for their health and well-being.\nThe licensee must reduce the heat and humidity inside both buildings to a level that is comfortable for the dogs and\npuppies in order to protect their health and well-being.\nCorrection date: The temperature must be at a comfortable level for the animals inside both buildings by 5:00 pm\non June 19, 2018.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
