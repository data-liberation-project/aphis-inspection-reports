These\naccumulations around the water valves and water pipe expose the guinea pigs to potential disease infections with\nbacteria, fungi, and parasites. Water receptacles such as automatic water valves and water pipes must be kept\nclean and sanitized whenever dirty and at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning of the automatic water\nvalves and PVC water pipe can result in contamination of the guinea pigs in the same enclosure and located in\nlower enclosures from those above. Licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water valves and\nPVC water pipe sanitized when dirty, and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by January 14,\n2017.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner's wife."
