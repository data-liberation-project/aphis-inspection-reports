On observation of the dog's mouth, there\nwas a heavy build-up of yellowish brown material on the majority of the teeth. There was a whitish gray creamy\nmaterial observed at the gum line of the cheek teeth. The abnormal build-up of material on the dogs' teeth can\ncause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This dog's dental condition could be painful, may decrease\nthe dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health. The licensee must have this dog examined\nby a licensed veterinarian no later than June 27, 2015 in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and\nappropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must develop and follow an effective dental\ncare program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility."
