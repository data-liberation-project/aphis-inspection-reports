      "narrative": "During the inspection, thirteen macaques were identified with stereotypic behaviors during the inspection and had\nnot been recorded by the facility. These abnormal behaviors are defined in the facility standard operating\nprocedure. Because of the lack of identification of these stereotypies, the facility did not have any observation or\ntreatment plan listed in their medical records for these animals.\nThe abnormal behaviors included one animal with repetitive spinning (150105), nine animals with alopecia due to\naberrant grooming (160224, 151036, 151138, 133345, 151146, 150939, 160424, 140865, 150726), two animals\nwith fecal smearing (133099, 160127), and one with alopecia and fecal smearing (140949).\nBecause of the lack of identification of these issues and despite receiving standard care, these macaques did not\nreceive special consideration and care necessary according to the facility environmental enhancement plan.\nThe facility in consultation with a facility-designated veterinarian must assure that a system of observation of\nanimals is regularly conducted to identify animals with medical or special environmental enhancement needs.\nCareful observation and referral for special evaluation and treatment of these animals with consultation with the\nattending veterinarian or other designated veterinarian is required to assure optimal psychological and physical\nwell-being of these animals."
