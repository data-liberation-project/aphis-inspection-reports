The presence of mouse droppings indicate frequent rodent activity, which can lead to contamination of\nfood, water, and surfaces. Rodents may also spread disease which may affect the health of the gibbons. An\neffective pest control program should minimize or eliminate the rodent population to prevent the spread of disease\nand contamination. Improved pest control measures within the indoor gibbon enclosure must be established and\nmaintained to ensure the health of the animals.
