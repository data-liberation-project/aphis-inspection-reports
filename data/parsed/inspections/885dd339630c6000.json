There is crusty dark material along the lower eyelid. His upper back teeth on the right side are\nalso completely encased in a thick grey- white colored material. The canine teeth also have a build up of brown\nmaterial on them. This type of material is on both sides of the mouth, covering the teeth and the gums on both sides\nhave receded to expose tooth root. The right side of the muzzle below the eye appeared swollen, and there is also a\nfoul odor coming from his mouth. The licensee had not noticed the eye issues, swelling, nor the foul odor from the\nmouth until mentioned by the inspectors. She had not yet scheduled a dental cleaning but had noted the build up on\nthe teeth. The discharge coating the eye may be indicative of infection, injury or other medical condition. The build\nup of material on the teeth and foul odor may be indicative of dental disease or other medical condition. These\nconditions can be painful, cause stress, reduce nutrition intake and affect the overall health of the dog.
