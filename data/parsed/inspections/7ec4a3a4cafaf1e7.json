      "narrative": "On the October 14, 2015 inspection one sick black and white racing pig was noted in an enclosure by itself. The pig\nexhibited a slight whole body tremor, a wide based stance to the rear limbs and a stiff legged gait on the rear limbs.\nIn addition, the ridges of the spines were more prominent than on the other pigs. During today's inspection it was\nnoted that the pig is no longer at the facility. One facility staff person stated that the pig was returned to the person\nfrom whom it was acquired. A second person stated that they thought the pig had died. No veterinary treatment\nrecords were available for review. The owner was reached by phone and stated that a veterinarian had not been\nconsulted as the pig is a farm animal and that it was returned to the person from whom it was acquired. Attempts to\nreach the person who supplied the pig were made and were unsuccessful. The inspection report dated 10/14/15\nstated that a veterinarian needed to be consulted to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan for the pig. This was\nnot done. Adequate veterinary care requires that the veterinarian be involved in decisions regarding all sick and\ninjured animals in order to ensure the use of appropriate methods to diagnose and treat all diseases and injuries."
