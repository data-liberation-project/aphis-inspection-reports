The\nlicensee stated she was waiting for paint to dry before moving more dogs from the left side to the right side so\ncleaning and sanitization could be done without wetting the dogs.\nCleaning and sanitization of surfaces that are in contact with the dogs is necessary to prevent the accumulation of\ndirt, debris, excreta and other disease hazards. Hard surfaces the dogs come in contact with must be spot-cleaned\ndaily. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces within the housing facility are cleaned and sanitized once every\ntwo weeks or more often if needed for the health and well-being of the dogs.\nThis is a focused inspection to address the Direct non-compliant item listed under 3.1 (c) (3) on the January 19,\n2016 inspection report.\nExit briefing conducted with licensee."
