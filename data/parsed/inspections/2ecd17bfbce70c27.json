The deceased Rhabdomys pup was not handled as carefully as\npossible during cage transfer when animal care technicians did not thoroughly check the bedding of the dirty cage. This\nincident was voluntarily reported to USDA and corrective measures were implemented prior to this inspection, which\nincluded the retraining of technical staff on the cage change procedure and modifying the procedure for processing dirty\ncages. No additional incidents have occurred. To remain corrected from this date 7/15/25 forward.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.\n*END OF REPORT*\nn"
