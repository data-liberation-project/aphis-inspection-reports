The jesses attached to a leash broke and the kestrel flew to the top of a light pole. Multiple capture\nmethods were implemented over a 6-hour period, but the bird evaded capture with each attempt and flew away. Park\nRangers and a falconer set-up baited traps and searched for the kestrel for a week as witnesses reported seeing and\nhearing the bird. Despite these efforts, the kestrel was not recovered. At the time of inspection, it has been about 3 weeks\nsince the kestrel was seen or heard. Improper handling of animals increases the risk of escape. The facility must reassess\ntheir tethering process to ensure birds are handled as carefully as possible to minimize trauma and unnecessary\ndiscomfort during public exhibition. Correct by September 30, 2024.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.\nn"
