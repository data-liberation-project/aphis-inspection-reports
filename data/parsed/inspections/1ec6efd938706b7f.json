The 8 puppies together are required to have 3,042 square inches in space. The enclosure is short by 726\nsquare inches. Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their\nenclosures. It also minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread\nof disease. The licensee must ensure that all cages containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet\nthe minimum floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that cage.
