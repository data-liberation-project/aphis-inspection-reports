She was not placing her toe on the ground when she stood still and she did not use\nthe limb at all as she walked around the enclosure. The dog also had a tannish brown material obscuring her teeth\nthat extended up into the gum line on all of the upper teeth. The gums were reddened on the upper right side of the\nmouth.\n*****An adult female Yorkshire Terrier with microchip identification number 0A099030831 in building 9 had a\ntannish brown material on most of her teeth. This material obscured most of the teeth and extended up into the\ngum line. The gums were reddened on the upper right and left side of the mouth. There was a whitish gray creamy\ndischarge at the gum line of the lower right teeth. There was also an irregularly shaped mass of a whitish gray\nmaterial that extended approximately one-half inch along the lower left incisors and canine teeth. The material was\nsoft to the touch.\n***** A adult male Pomeranian with microchip identification number 941000013940744 in building 5 had a head tilt\nto the right and also had a tannish brown material obscuring his teeth that extended up into the gum line on all of\nthe upper teeth. The gums were reddened on the upper left side of the mouth.\n***** An adult female Pomeranian with microchip identification number 0A01555123 in building 5 was intermittently\nnon-weight bearing on his left rear limb. He was placing his toe on the ground when he stood still and he did not use\nthe limb intermittently as he walked around the enclosure.\n***** An adult male poodle with microchip number 985121003306294 in building 2 had a tannish brown material on\nmost of his teeth. This material obscured most of the teeth and extended up into the gum line. The gums were\nreddened on the upper right and left side of the mouth.\nThe licensee had not noticed any of these conditions prior to the inspection and these animals have not received\nany veterinary care.\nThe buildup of abnormal material on teeth either with or without a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact\nthe ability of the dogs to eat normally, and harm the health of the animals. Eye discharge, redness, crusting, and\nswelling can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. Limb\ninjuries can occur and may be painful. The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian\nin order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans. The outcome of these consultations must\nbe documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive\nadequate veterinary care at all times.\nTo be corrected by 3-29-14."
