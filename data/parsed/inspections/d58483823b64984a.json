The\nfence anchor pipe between pens 5 and 6 is heavily rusted and there are at least 3 small, corroded areas with holes and\nsharp edges that could injure animals. In two pens there were feed bunks where a support leg was partially missing and\nthe structure was unbalanced and rocking, with potential for an animal to get its foot injured.
