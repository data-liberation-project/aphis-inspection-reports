      "narrative": "In Pen #12, an adult, female, tri-colored guinea pig was observed to be laying laterally on her right side and made\nno attempts to stand as other guinea pigs rushed around her when approached by APHIS officials. The guinea pig\nappeared to be sunken into the shavings around her and did not attempt to rise when two juvenile guinea pigs\napproached her and attempted to nurse. The only movements observed by this guinea pig were several kicks of\nthe left hind leg and a few attempts to move her head. When the facility representative attempted to stand the\nguinea pig up, she reclined back into a lateral position.\nWhen asked about this guinea pig, the facility representative was previously unaware of her condition and had not\ncontacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) regarding this animal. Also, seven additional dead juvenile guinea pigs\nwere identified in Pens 17, 49, and 10, and an adult guinea pig was found deceased in Pen 4. The facility\nrepresentative was likewise unaware of the deceased guinea pigs in these pens prior to inspection.\nThe inability to stand or walk can be indicative of disease and/or injury which can be painful and affect the overal\nhealth of the animal. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals,\nworsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the condition is contagious. The licensee\nmust establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to prevent,\ncontrol, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries."
