Daily observations done that day and during the\nweek did not reveal any abnormalities with Paula. An animal caretaker explained that for approximately 6 months prior,\nPaula would not come down consistently for his morning training preferring instead to stay on a branch in the tall sweet\ngum tree. This behavior was expected and attributed to the onset of colder temperatures. On the many days that he did\nnot come down, daily observations consisted of glancing parts of him while up in the tree, sometimes 20 feet above\nground. This method did not allow for a complete assessment of Paula\u2019s health and the facility did not identify the\ncondition that was affecting him. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress\nin animals with such conditions. A rigorous daily observation of all animals must be done in order to properly assess their\nhealth and well-being."
