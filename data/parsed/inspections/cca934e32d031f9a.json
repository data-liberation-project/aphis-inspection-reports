Large wooden\nbranches were also seen in some areas propped against or pushing on the fencing of the enclosure.\n- The muntjac enclosures were heavily wooded and at least 2 large tree limbs in 2 separate enclosures could be seen\nbreaking from the tree and leaning into the enclosure. Many large tree branches could also be seen on the floor scattered\nthroughout the enclosures.\nThe discarded items in the enclosures could result in injury from the animals coming into contact with them and could\nprovide harboring space for rodents/pests thus increasing the risk of animal disease as well. The breaking and falling of\ntree branches into the enclosures could result in animal injury and could affect the structural integrity of the fencing\nmaking up the enclosures. Premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury. Accumulations of trash\nshall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
