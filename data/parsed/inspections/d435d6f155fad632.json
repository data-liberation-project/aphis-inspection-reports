      "narrative": "Female English bulldog \"Sabrina\" has discharge coming from both eyes. The discharge from the right eye has a\nyellowish color and is located mostly along the bottom eyelid and a strand of it was across the eye and attached to\nthe upper eye lid. A small amount of the yellow discharge is located on the hair of the upper eye lid. The discharge\nfrom the left eye is clear and is located mostly along the bottom eye lid. The hair around the top, bottom and the\noutside edge of the left eye is wet. The whites of both eyes are slightly reddened. Physical examination of the dog\nrevealed an area of thickened, crusty, dark colored scab-like material on the underside of her neck. Between the\ntoes of the left front foot there is a round, slightly reddened growth. The top of the growth has broken open and a\nsmall amount of blood is coming from the area.\nThe licensee has documentation that this dog was evaluated by a licensed veterinarian on July 26, 2016 for the\ncondition of the eyes. The vet had advised that the dog have eye surgery after her puppies were weaned. The\nlicensee stated that the puppies had been weaned at least two weeks prior to the inspection, but there was no\nappointment for surgery set and the dog has received no treatment from a licensed veterinarian for the eyes after\nthe initial evaluation in July. The licensee stated that she has self-treated the dog's eyes when she noticed the\ndischarge. This dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the abnormal foot growth or the skin\ncondition on the neck.\nFemale English bulldog \"Muffin\" was observed to be squinting her right eye and did not want to hold it open. Closer\nexamination of the eye revealed that the skin around the eye was extremely red and swollen. The white of the eye\nis also very reddened. There is a small amount of yellowish discharge located on the lower eye lid of the left eye.\nThis dog had received eye surgery in July and was evaluated again by a licensed veterinarian on September 19th\nfor an unrelated concern. There was no mention of the dog's eye condition by the veterinarian during the\nSeptember evaluation.\nPoor eye and skin health and abnormal growths could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. The above mentioned\ndogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment\nplan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.\nThe licensee contacted a licensed veterinarian and transported the dogs to the clinic immediately following the\ninspection.\nInspection and exit briefing was conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative."
