The man was noted hitting multiple\nwildebeest on the head and body with the flagged end of the pole. The wildebeest reacted by kicking out and running\naway from him. The man was observed hitting the animals from behind the swinging protection door (used for people to\nget out of the path of the animals).\n*The auction attendants at both ends of the ring moved the aoudad from one side of the ring to the other by yelling at\nthem and waving their arms and the sticks with flags at them. The aoudads reacted by running and jumping. One jumped\nover the six to seven foot high auctioneer stand into the area where the auctioneer staff were present. It took a couple of\npeople to safely capture the animal and remove it from the auctioneer stand.\nHitting and mishandling of animals causes behavioral stress, discomfort and can result in injury to the animals or the the\nhumans nearby. All animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause\ntrauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort."
