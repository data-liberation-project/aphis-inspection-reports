This is a source of\ncontamination to the enclosed birds. The feeders must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent this\nkind of accumulation. The feeders repaired with duct tape should be replaced with intact feeders.\n- In the small barn, plastic jug sections are being used to scoop feed from storage bins. One of these plastic jugs has a\nthick layer of dark, crusted debris covering the inner surface of the scoop.
