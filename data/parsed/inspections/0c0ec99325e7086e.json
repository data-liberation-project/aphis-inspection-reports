      "narrative": "There are three adult red foxes (a red and black male approximately 2 years old, a white and black female approximately\n3 years old, and a champagne colored male approximately 3 years old) are housed in a single enclosure. The group of\nred foxes demonstrated compatibility issues during today\u2019s inspection. The champagne colored male appeared to be thin\nindicated by his visible hip and shoulder bones along with an accentuated waist. The red and black male is displaying\ndominant behavior over the champagne by snarling and teeth bearing, vocalization, staring, chasing, food-guarding\nbehaviors and trapping the champagne male in a plastic animal travel carrier. At one point during inspection, inspectors\nwitnessed the red and black male jumping on top of the carrier, pawing at the roof, and staring down the champagne male\n(hiding in the carrier). Inspectors also witnessed the black and white female approach the champagne male while he was\nhiding in the carrier, snarl and growl at him and then walk away. The champagne male fox primarily stays inside the\nplastic animal travel carrier that was placed in the enclosure about 5 days ago after the licensee noticed the stressed\nbehavior of the older adult champagned colored male. When the champagne male briefly ventured out of the shelter, he\nkept his tail low to the ground, walked in a small, crouched position near the carrier. As soon as the red and black male\njumped onto the adjacent play structure and stood on higher ground, the champagne fox quickly ran back into the crate.\nThe Licensee indicated that she had observed these behaviors for about one month and had plans of re-homing the\nyounger red and black male fox. However, the re-homing process had not been initiated at the time of inspection.\nThe constant intimidation and dominant behavior displayed by the younger red and black male fox over the older\nchampagne male fox is leading to significant stress and discomfort among all animals contained within the enclosure. This\ncan lead to a decrease in food consumption, weight loss, psychological stress, and self-injurious coping behavior such as\npaw biting or overgrooming.\nCorrect by separating incompatible animals and housing them in enclosures that are far enough away that they do not\ninterfere with the health or wellbeing of each other. Additionally, all animals in this enclosure must be evaluated by a\nveterinarian to address all physical and behavioral issues.\nCorrect by 8 am on June 17, 2021.\nA complete routine inspection was conducted on 6/15/2021. This report is limited to the direct non-compliant items\nidentified on that inspection. The exit briefing for the items included on this report was conducted with the facility\nrepresentative on 6/16/2021.
