During the inspection I observed small children on the floor near this barrier where it is possible they or\nothers could become injured if they they went under this barrier and had contact with potential dangerous animals.\nAlthough the metal fencing barrier in front of the exhibit ring has a distance of 4', during this inspection I was able\ntouch the ring leaning in front of the barrier. The front barrier being to close was verbally discussed during a recent\nvisit. There were several roaming attendants available during the public exhibit, however there is not a minimal risk\nof harm to assure the safety of the public at these areas while exhibiting the tigers and chimpanzee. During public\nexhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public, with\nsufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of\nanimals and the public.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY: IMMEDIATELY.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Curator."
