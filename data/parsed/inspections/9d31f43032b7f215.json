According to the licensee, this macaque began\nto self-mutilate himself. He had a severe injury that required surgery by the attending vet, but he also bit himself in\nother locations that required antibiotics on and off until his death on 2/20/15. Medications had been prescribed by\nthe attending vet, but there was no documentation in the animals(cid:25) records that the medications were given to this\nmacaque. Medical records for medications and treatments prescribed by the attending vet, need to be currant,\naccurate and maintained to ensure that the animal is being provided adequate care. Again, there is no\ndocumentation on the licensees premise that the primate was brought to the vet, or what, or when treatments /\nmedications, were administered to this animal. This facility should have a system of health records that sufficiently\ndemonstrate that the animals on the premise are provided adequate care.\n***To Be Corrected By: Correct Immediately\n2.
