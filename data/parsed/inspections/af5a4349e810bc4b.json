Steps should be taken to\nensure that the fencing meets the requirements under 3.103 (c). Fencing should be at least six feet in height in\norder to deter trespassers, and the fence should be maintained so as to keep animals and unauthorized people\nfrom passing under or through the fence.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives."
