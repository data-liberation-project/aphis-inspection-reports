This employee also used a nonhuman primate that was noted to be visibly agitated prior to being moved\neven though the protocol states that animals that appear agitated will not be used until the following day. The\ncorrective actions included, but were not limited to, providing the employee with all six weeks of their required\ntraining and retraining the Principal Investigator and the staff on protocol adherence. Allowing personnel who are\nnot adequately trained or do not have sufficient instruction to perform their duties resulted in a human injury and\nwas distressful for the nonhuman primate. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel\ninvolved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.\nThe IACUC implemented appropriate corrective actions and no similar adverse events have occurred.\n***From August 2011 to December 2011, there were four instances of nonhuman primates escaping from their\nenclosures. During two of these escapes, the animals incurred injuries that required pain medications to be\nadministered. The facility determined that a single employee was responsible for the escapes and the employee\nwas retrained and reassigned. Allowing personnel who are not adequately trained or do not have sufficient\ninstruction to perform their duties resulted in pain and distress to the escaped nonhuman primates. It is the\nresponsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are\nqualified to perform their duties.\nThe IACUC implemented appropriate corrective actions and no further nonhuman primate escapes have occurred.\nThese items have been appropriately addressed by the facility.\nThe facility inspection and record review were conducted from 13 May 2014 through 16 May 2014.\nThe exit interview was conducted with the IACUC Chair, Attending Veterinarian, Regulatory Specialist, Compliance\nSpecialist, and Compliance Officer.\nAdditional Inspectors\nHammel Kurt, Veterinary Medical Officer"
