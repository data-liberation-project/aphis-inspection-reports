Evidently, this animal was not accounted for several days. When this happens, the facility needs to\ndevelop and establish a protocol for additional measures to be taken to achieve the goal of observing each animal daily.\nFailure to do so may result in delayed detection and treatment of health or well-being issues.

The\nfacility reported that a truck hauling a trailer containing two mares was being driven into the pasture occupied by the\nPrzewalski\u2019s Horses. According to facility staff, the stallion came running to the truck in response to the mares, suddenly\nmade a change in direction, and collided into the front of the truck. The attending veterinarian was immediately called and\nprovided treatment for the stallion. The Attending Veterinarian determined that the Przewalski\u2019s Horse fractured his right\nhind leg which required surgical treatment.\nPrzewalski\u2019s Horses are known to be reactive/flighty. Driving two mares into a pasture containing a stallion without\nconfining or restraining him was an unnecessary risk. Additionally, the driver of the truck failed to stop the truck or make\nmodifications to their route when noticing the stallion was overstimulated by the mares. This stallion was significantly\ninjured as a result of this unnecessary risk. Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible and in a manner\nthat does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort to the animals. To correct, the facility should\nreview transportation and animal introduction protocols, as well as train employees on proper implementation of such\nprotocols. Correct by: February 28, 2024."
