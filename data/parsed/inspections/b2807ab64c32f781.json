The temperature did not drop during the inspection. It topped off at 92\ndegrees about half way through the inspection and was 89 degrees at 7:40 PM. The temperature stayed above 85\ndegrees Fahrenheit in the kennel during the entire inspection. When I measured the temperature at 7:40 PM, I observed 4\npuppies in one enclosure to be sprawled out and scattered throughout the enclosure. They were not huddled up close to\neach other the way a litter of puppies would normally be observed. This behavior indicates the puppies were too hot and\nuncomfortable. The licensee must ensure the kennel temperature does not rise above and stay above 85 degrees\nFahrenheit for four consecutive hours when dogs are present. If there is any indication the temperature could stay above\n85 degrees Fahrenheit for an extended period of time, the licensee should take steps to lower the temperature. Correct\nstarting on 8/22/23."
