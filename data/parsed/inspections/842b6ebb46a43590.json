On 1/28/18, around 6:28pm, after being at a rest stop for approximately 45\nminutes, the registrants observed the puppy in obvious physical distress (his \u201ctummy seemed stiff\u201d, his gums were\npale and he refused to take water, according to the registrants records). They stated they had left the air\nconditioning on and had the windows open while at the rest stop. The registrants were just north of Lake City, FL at\nthat time, and they began trying to find an emergency veterinary clinic that was open on a Sunday night. The\nnearest emergency clinic was about 65 miles (45 minutes, according to the registrant) away. Instead of heading\ndirectly to the clinic, they tried to give various treatments (wetting the puppy down, offering water, administering\nlemon juice and attempting to give Benadryl, Gatorade and Pedialyte) and stopped to check the puppy every 10 to\n15 minutes. The puppy was found to be unresponsive and died at approximately 8:56pm on 1/28/18. It was\napproximately 2 hours from the time they found the puppy in distress to the time that it died. As soon as an animal is\nin obvious physical distress, veterinary care must be obtained at the closest available veterinary facility.\nThe puppy was taken to a vet for necropsy the following day. The necropsy revealed heat stroke as the likely cause\nof the death. Young canines do not have body temperature control completely developed and some breeds, like this\npuppy (a brachiocephalic breed), are already more susceptible to temperature changes and require more frequent\nand attentive monitoring.\nThe registrant must provide appropriate climatic conditions for the animals being transported. When obvious\nphysical distress is noted, the registrant must obtain veterinary care at the closest available veterinary clinic.\nAlso, the registrant did not have a health certificate for this puppy. Health certificates are important because it\nverifies that a licensed veterinarian has checked the animal and found that it is fit for transportation. No intermediate\nhandler or carrier shall transport in commerce any dog, unless the dog is accompanied by a health certificate\nexecuted and issued by a licensed veterinarian.\nCorrect by: from now forward."
