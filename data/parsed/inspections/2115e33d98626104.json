If staff believed Rico to be asleep based on him closing his eyes, petting was not allowed, but other guest\ninteractions continued (such as approaching and taking photographs).\nSix hours is the majority of a sloth\u2019s waking hours. Sloths in captivity sleep an average of 14 - 20 hours a day and are\noften motionless even when awake. Extended periods of time in constant view of the public increase the risk of stress and\nabnormal behavior.
