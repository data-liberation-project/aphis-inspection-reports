The records indicate that for this same group of 4 animals, the first middle ear fluid collection was\nconducted on 10/17, but analgesia was not administered on the second day post-procedure (10/19). No concerns of\nanimal health were noted on clinical observation of these animals by veterinary and lab staff on that date. Failure to\nprovide post-procedural care according to the protocol is a significant change regarding the care of animals in an ongoing\nactivity that was not reviewed by the committee.\nThe committee must ensure that all significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are\nreviewed and approved prior to implementation.\nTo be corrected by December 21st, 2022.\nThis inspection and exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
