      "narrative": "A female bulldog named Bubbles, MC# 0A0154478 was observed to have an interdigital cyst on her right front foot.\nThis area was raised, reddened and swollen and located between her most lateral toes on that foot. The dog did\nnot appear to be lame. The licensee was questioned about treatment and he stated that the veterinarian had told\nhim to clean it with soap and water and wait for it to pop. He also added that the veterinarian had said that the\ncondition was not painful. Documentation provided by the licensee for review by the inspectors gave detailed\ninstructions for treatment that had been written by the attending veterinarian. These instructions included washing\nthe area with iodine scrub and the administration of oral cephalexin to the dog. Neither of these medications were\non the premises. The licensee indicated to the inspectors that he was confused about the written instructions. The\nlicensee had not yet noticed the condition of this dog. The current time was approximately 3:00 PM and the\nappropriate medications were not on hand and the licensee did not understand the directions. Inderdigital cysts can\nbecome quite painful when not treated in an appropriate manner. Failure to treat this potentially painful condition in\nan appropriate manner could cause this dog to experience unnecessary suffering. The attending veterinarian'(cid:25)s\npreviously detailed treatment plan must be followed by the licensee and medications for treatment should be on\nhand for routine medical conditions. The licensee should contact the attending veterinarian for clarification of\nwritten directions that he does not understand. This dog requires treatment for her condition."
