The vet came out to look at the bear with instructions to keep\nand eye on the animal. Since the tooth has broken down further, the vet has not been contacted for further\nassessment. Broken canines can be very painful and lead to infections that are potentially life threatening. This bear\nshould be re-evaluated by the attending veterinarian to assess the condition of the tooth and jaw and determine a\ncourse of treatment.\n*** The bears are geriatric and obese with their front claws removed. The diet of these animals is not of nutritive\nvalue to maintain them in a healthy body condition. In addition to dog food, the bears are given left over food from\nthe club restaurant (pasta, breads, fries, and cooked meat products) which contributes to their excessive weight.\nAdditionally, according to the caretaker the bears are not fed more food during fall which is a period of hyperplasia\nfor them and therefore do not go down into a period of winter lethargy. Dietary issues in bears can contribute to\nmultiple health care problems and this diet should be evaluated by the attending vet to assure their dietary needs\nare being met and maintained in a manner that prevents injury and health issues.\n*** The Asiatic black bear was sitting down by the front side of the enclosure and was moving in a repetitive rocking\nmotion for extended periods of time throughout the inspection. This is an abnormal behavior pattern and can be due\nto the limited functionality of his enclosure, or potentially from pain from a broken tooth. This bear should be\nevaluated by the attending vet with appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries for this animal."
