      "narrative": "Multiple changes were made to protocol 20-013 by the investigator without notifying the attending veterinarian or the\nIACUC and allowing them to review the modifications. Protocol 20-013 was approved by the IACUC in June of 2020 and\nuses rabbits as a model to test the efficacy of drugs against chronic lung injuries. In the approved protocol, rabbits are\nanesthetized and an irritant is instilled into the trachea through a catheter to produce a chronic lung injury. Changes to the\nprotocol included:\n1) The protocol states that the rabbits will be continuously monitored post-operatively for at least four hours. It also states\nthat the animals will be monitored continuously until they completely recover and are returned to the cage and then\nobserved at hourly intervals until 5 pm and daily after that.\na. The following five rabbits have no documentation showing post-operative observation after instillation of the irritant into\nthe trachea: ID# 20-0543, 20-0547, 20-0541, 20-0545, 20-0542.\nb. The remaining five rabbits have no documentation of post-operative observation hourly until 5 pm after becoming\nsternal: ID# 20-0539, 20-0540, 20-0544, 20-0538, 20-0546.\nc. The following four rabbits have no documentation of consistent post-operative daily observation: ID# 20-0547, 20-0546,\n20-0541, 20-0545\n2) The protocol at one point indicates that rabbits will be treated post-operatively with an antibiotic (Baytril) under the skin\nonce a day for a total of 10 days. However, in two other parts of the protocol, it indicates that the antibiotic will be\nadministered twice a day for 10 days post-operatively. The following three rabbits did not receive antibiotics consistently in\naccordance with the approved protocol:\na. ID# 20-0547 underwent surgery on 9/16/20 and received antibiotics once a day on 9/16, 9/17, and 9/26. He received\nantibiotics twice a day on 9/21 thru 9/25. There was no record of antibiotic administration on 9/20.\nb. ID# 20-0546 underwent surgery on 9/16/20 and received antibiotics once a day on 9/16 and 9/20 but twice a day on\n9/21 and 9/23. However, there was no record of antibiotic administration from 9/17-9/20.\nc. ID# 20-0545 underwent surgery on 9/16/20 and received antibiotics once a day on 9/16, 9/17, and 9/26. He received\nantibiotics twice a day on 9/21 thru 9/25. There was no record of antibiotic administration on 9/20.\n3) The protocol states that intra-operative monitoring of animals (heart rate and temperature) will be performed. The\nfollowing animals have no vital signs recorded during the procedure: ID# 20-0543, 20-0539, 20-0547, 20-0540, 20-0544,\n20-0538, 20-0541, 20-0542.\n4) The protocol indicates that rabbits will be surgically prepped on the ventral neck prior to insertion of the intratracheal\ncatheter using a combination of 70% ethanol and betadine repeated twice. According to the internal review performed by\nthe facility, the investigator was only prepping the area with betadine.\nMaking changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC to perform adequate\noversight into the use of animals for medical research.\nPrior to the three rabbits used in June 2021, the PI submitted an amendment to remove the use of antibiotics, which was\nsubsequently approved by the IACUC. Correct by 9/16/21 by allowing the IACUC to review and either approve, require\nmodifications in, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing\nactivities."
