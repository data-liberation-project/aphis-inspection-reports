      "narrative": "- The following animals need to be seen by the attending veterinarian:\n-- Inside the large dairy barn-type building a 9 year old female Chihuahua (microchip #AVID 106638100)\nappeared to have a broken bottom jaw causing a crooked bite. The licensee stated that this was an old injury. Her\nteeth also had an excessive buildup of a dark brown, greenish material on the teeth extending up to the gum line.\nMost of the teeth could not be visualized. The gums were swollen and reddened. There was a yellow creamy\nmaterial along the gum line near both of the large cheek teeth on each side. The buildup of abnormal material on\nteeth with a discharge at the gum line and a crooked bottom jaw can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat\nnormally and harm the health of the animal.\n-- In a reefer type trailer a 1 year old red female Chi-Pin (microchip #900032002691343) had a 1cm round,\nred fleshy, moist mass in the corner of the right eye. This could be caused by infection, allergies, injury, irritation or\nother medical conditions that could be painful.\n-- In another reefer type trailer there was a red long haired male Dachshund (microchip #0A01565449) that\nhad hair loss on his ears, back, chest, and underneath his chest towards his belly. The skin was dry, crusty,\nscabbed and inflamed. The licensee stated that he had treated two other dogs previously for the same symptoms\nbut this particular dog hadn't been noticed. The licensee called the attending veterinarian during the inspection and\nscheduled an appointment for all of the dogs to be seen.\nThe licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.\nAdditional Inspectors\nCooper Natalie, Veterinary Medical Officer"
