The animals used by this facility should have been\nreported under Category D. Appropriate reporting shows that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee\n(IACUC) understands the pain categories, and is carefully considering ways to minimize pain and distress, and\nallows for appropriate regulatory oversight, both of which help to safeguard animal welfare.\nAn amended Annual Report should be submitted to USDA by 3/10/15.\nAn exit interview was conducted with a facility representative."
