The facility representative stated that the attending\nveterinarian previously debrided and treated the wound, and prescribed antibiotic treatment, which the facility\nadministered accordingly. The swelling and draining returned after completion of the prescribed treatment, but the facility\nowner did not communicate this to the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian told the inspectors that he\nexpected the facility to inform him if the problem did not resolve.\n-There is one white, adult female goat with an enlarged, right mammary gland that is reddened, with two wounds. One\nwound is quarter-sized and surrounded by crust,. A smaller, adjacent wound is linear and fresher in appearance. The\ngland swelling is significant enough to cause the teat to occasionally scrape on the ground as she walks. The facility was\naware of the goat's condition but did not notify the attending veterinarian.\nTimely reporting of unresolved or new conditions is important to prevent worsening of any problems and ensure proper\ncare. The facility must have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that\ntimely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the attending\nveterinarian. Additionally, the two animals listed above must be evaluated by a veterinarian to provide adequate\nveterinary care as required in section 2.40(b)(2). Ensure that they are treated in accordance with that veterinarian's\nrecommendations including any necessary follow-up treatments required.\nTo be corrected by 06/25/2021; the licensee was verbally provided with a correction deadline during the inspection."
