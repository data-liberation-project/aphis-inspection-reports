The gate for the cattle is attached by one hinge and a chain. This gate is leaning resulting in a gap between\nthe gate and the fence. The gate for the llama cannot be completely closed due to a build-up of dirt at the bottom of\nthe gate. This is creating a gap between the gate and the fence. Animals could be trapped in these gaps which can\ncause injury. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from\ninjury and to securely contain the animals.
