There were six 4-6week old pigs in room #2, and 1 in room #4\nthat had fluid filled swellings of their left ears. One of the pigs in room #2 also had a swollen left rear hock and was\nlimping, and 1 pig in room #4 had three of her four legs with multiple lumps/swelling on the right rear hock and both\nfront ankles along with the fluid filled ear swellings. In the second to last pen in the Pre-Shipment barn there was a\nmale pig approximately 25 weeks of age that had very large swellings on both sides of his neck and under the chin.\n.All animals observed during the inspection with the injuries appeared to be in good health and not in any obvious\npain, however there were signs of discomfort due to limping by those with the leg swellings and some head shaking\nfrom those with the swollen fluid filled ears. Due to the these injuries not being observed until during the inspection,\nthere had not been any treatment given or veterinarian contacted.\nIt is very important that any injuries or illnesses are observed as soon as possible in order to prevent a minor issue\nfrom becoming chronic and to decrease the time an animal is in any discomfort or pain. Daily observations of all\nanimals, especially in large populations (1000 pigs) as with this facility need to be conducted thoroughly.\nTo be corrected by: CORRECTED\nDuring the inspection the veterinarian had been contacted and all animals were treated, including all fluid filled ears\ndrained and treated, and medications provided under veterinary direction for those animals with leg swellings. All\nanimals are on the facilities treatment log to continue with daily treatment as needed and monitoring until the injuries\nare resolved under the direction of their veterinarian."
