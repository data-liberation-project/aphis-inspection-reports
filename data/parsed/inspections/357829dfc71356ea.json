      "narrative": "There is a white female goat with brown markings on its head that has a prominent swelling on the right side of its\nhead near the corner of its mouth. The swelling is about three inches in diameter. The goat is leaning its head\ntowards the right side and is consistently and vigorously shaking its head throughout the duration of the inspection.\nThe facility representative says they noticed the swelling several days ago, however the attending veterinarian had\nnot been contacted about the issue and no treatment had been provided for the animal. The swelling on the face\nmay be a sign of infection, injury, or other disease process. The shaking and leaning of the head by the animal are\nabnormal behaviors which likely indicate the animal is experiencing pain or discomfort.\nThe facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a\nveterinarian that can give an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for the problem cited above. The\nlicensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care. The program for\nproviding adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and\ntreat diseases and injuries.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nSnow William, Supervisory Program Specialist"
