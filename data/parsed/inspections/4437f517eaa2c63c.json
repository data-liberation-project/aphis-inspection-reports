This was a hand\nreared capuchin who has worn a smooth link waist chain most of her life. The waist chain has a 10-12 inch catch\nleash. Although the loose chain has not caused any known problems, the chain was observed to be disturbing to\nthe capuchin in that it is carrying the end of the chain with its tail. Because the length of the chain is causing\nunnecessary discomfort or may become entangled within the enclosure, it needs to be removed or shortened to the\nshortest length possible to still easily hand restrain the capuchin, but allow the capuchin to move freely without the\nchain altering her movements or becoming entangled. To be corrected by 8-8-14."
