The enclosure was repaired and no longer allowed for animal escape.\nThere are multiple areas in 3 outdoor enclosures that have sharp points. There are areas where the fence panels have\nbeen dug out and create sharp points underneath them. One area that had been dug out was repaired with a fence panel\nalong the ground. However, the panel flexes when pressure is applied and allows for sharp points and an approximately\n1-foot area that the animals foot could become entrapped. There is also an extra piece of fence panel laid against the dog\nshelter with multiple sharp points present.\nOne enclosure has an approximately 2 foot by 3-foot cave dug into the side of a hill by the dogs. The cave is large enough\nthat the animal can fit the majority of its body into it.\nPrimary enclosures that do not safely contain the animals can lead to animal escape that can expose the animals to injury\nor death. Sharp points on the ground or enclosure walls can injure the animals housed in the enclosure. Loose fence or\nfence panels on the ground can lead to limb or foot entrapment when stepped or jumped on by the dogs in the enclosure.\nLarge holes/caves can collapse when the dogs are digging in them and can lead to entrapment or injury.\nThe licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed so that they are structurally sound, are kept in good\nrepair, protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering."
