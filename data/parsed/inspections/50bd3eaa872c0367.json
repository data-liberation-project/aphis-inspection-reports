Miso was being bottle-fed by the licensee and exhibited for public interactions. The\nattending veterinarian was unaware that the otter had been obtained until she was presented to the veterinarian on\nDecember 2, 2025, for an illness examination. At that time, Miso was prescribed medication for what the veterinarian\nsuspected was \u201cpneumonia, possibly aspiration.\u201d Miso did not respond to treatment and died overnight. The attending\nveterinarian was not notified of the death until their office called five days later to check on the patient. The attending\nveterinarian stated they would have wanted further diagnostic testing, to include a necropsy, to help determine a cause\nand to address any potential husbandry issues. If the facility does not consult with or give the appropriate authority to the\nveterinarian, the health and well-being of the animals may be affected. Disease transmission, inadequate diet and/or\nhusbandry can occur from not consulting the attending veterinarian.

Oral antibiotics were given as per the prescription\nlabel, per the licensee. The eye ointment prescription states the ointment is to be applied \u201cto affected eyes every 12 hours\nfor 4-6 days, or until eyes look better and two more treatments after resolution of symptoms.\u201d Per the licensee, both the\noral antibiotics and eye ointment were given for 5 days (last dose was December 7, 2025). Upon inspection on December\n10, 2025, Kitten 1 still had black dried discharge around its right eye, to the side and below its eye, but above its nose.\nUpon consultation with the veterinarian, they did not think the right eye was resolved yet and that Kitten 1 should still be\ngetting the eye ointment applied.\n\u2022 None of the twelve cats have been receiving preventative heartworm medication as stated in the Program of Veterinary\nCare, per the licensee. During the inspection, the licensee was asked to show the inspector any medications given to the\nanimals, and no heartworm preventative medication was provided.\nMaintaining adequate programs of veterinary care, including following the prescription guidance and parasite prevention\nprotocols of the attending veterinarian, is necessary to ensure the use of appropriate methods to treat infections, prevent\ndiseases, and also protect the health of the animals.

Premises, including buildings and grounds, \nshall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate prescribed husbandry \npractices. \nCorrect by January 15, 2026.\n\n3.33(b) \n   \nClassification and separation. \nAt the time of inspection, chickens were observed within the primary outdoor enclosure of the guinea pigs. This enclosure \nwas open topped allowing the chickens to fly in. Co-mingling different species in the same enclosure can increase the risk \nof stress, disease hazards, and/or injury. The facility must ensure that guinea pigs are not housed in the same primary \nenclosure with any other species of animals. \nCorrected at the time of inspection, December 10, 2025, and shall remain corrected moving forward. \n3.150(e) \n   \nFacilities, general. \nThree unopened bags of bird feed were being stored on the floor under an outdoor roofed area, leaning against cabinetry \nthat had cleaning products on the countertop. Leaving the bags in this area could lead to contamination by chemicals or \npests. Supplies of food, including food supplements, bedding, and substrate must be stored in a manner that protects the \nsupplies from deterioration, spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and \naway from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. \nCorrect by: January 15, 2026. \n3.153(a)(1)(i) \n   \nPrimary enclosures. \nSharp points were found in an outdoor bird primary enclosure housing pigeons, a cockatoo, a yellow shouldered parrot, \nand quail. At a wooden beam below the roof of the enclosure, two screws were sticking out with their sharp tips pointing \nup and out approximately 1 to 2 inches in length. There were bird feces around this area demonstrating the birds are \nusing it as a perching area. Sharp points may cause injury and may lead to pain or discomfort to the animals. Primary \nenclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound. The primary \nenclosures must be kept in good repair and have no sharp points or edges that could injure the birds. \nCorrect by: January 15, 2026. \n3.154(b) \n   \nEnvironment enhancement to promote psychological well-being. \nUpon inspection, a dove and lovebird, while being housed indoors together, had no environmental enrichment provided as \nper the environmental enrichment plan. Their outdoor enclosure does have these items but due to the colder weather, per \nlicensee, the birds were brought inside. Other species of exhibited birds, turkeys and ducks, were not listed on the \nenvironmental enrichment plan. A lack of adequate environmental enrichment for these species may negatively affect \npsychological well-being and could result in abnormal behavior. The physical environment in the primary enclosures must \nbe enriched by materials or activities that would provide the birds with the means to express non-injurious species-typical \nactivities. With the attending veterinarian\u2019s oversight, the facility must implement species-appropriate environmental \nenrichments to meet the behavioral and psychological needs of all exhibited birds. \nCorrect by: February 15, 2026. \n3.154(c)(2)\n\nEnvironment enhancement to promote psychological well-being. \nA cockatoo was seen with feathers missing around the sides of its head. Per the licensee, this bird was acquired in this \ncondition, and it has not progressed. The enrichment plan should address this bird as a special consideration so a specific \nenrichment plan can be implemented to prevent any further feather plucking. Failure to document and implement a \nspecific enrichment plan for this bird with a history of abnormal behavior may result in psychological distress. The facility \nshall document and provide special attention regarding enhancement of the environment to promote psychological well-\nbeing for this cockatoo in accordance with the instructions of their attending veterinarian. \nCorrect by: February 15, 2026. \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. \n \n n",
