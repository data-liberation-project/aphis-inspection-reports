The perimeter fence has been constructed this way for several years and the ground has\nsettled causing the perimeter fence to sink. The licensee expressed interest in rebuilding this entire area. The\nenclosure containing the bobcats is fully enclosed with a top. Perimeter fencing must be constructed so that it\nprotects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it\nand having contact with the animals in the facility, and high enough to act as a second containment area for the\nenclosed animals. The licensee must ensure that all areas of perimeter fencing are at least 6 feet in height for the\nbobcat area or have the fencing and height approved through the Administrator.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative."
