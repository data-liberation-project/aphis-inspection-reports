There are 2 -3 sections of 6' stockade fence that are\npositioned between these three exhibits. There are also 3' split rail barrier fences behind the stockade fence that\nrun perpendicular to the 8' perimeter fence. However, there is an approximately 6' gap between the end of the\nstockade fence and the empty corn crib exhibit. And the 3' barrier fences behind the stockade fence are either in\ndisrepair or the gates were not closed or locked. This large gap, and the opened gates, could allow a member of the\ngeneral public direct access to the servals or leopard. To ensure the safety of the animals and the public this\nsituation will need to be addressed.\n***To Be Corrected By: August 2, 2018 COB for a temporary repair.\nAugust 18, 2018 for a permanent repair."
