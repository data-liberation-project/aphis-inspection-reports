This macaque was able to slide\nthe floor open due to the latches on the floor grate not being secured by a staff member during cleaning, per a facility\nrepresentative. The two macaques got into a short scuffle, were quickly separated, and then assessed with no injuries or\nbleeding observed. A more thorough exam was conducted the following day during a pre-planned sedation for routine\ncare. At that time, 117-18 was found to have a 2-centimeter-long laceration at her perineum requiring cleaning, suturing,\nand antibiotics.\nNot securing the two floor latches between the primary indoor enclosures during cleaning procedures allowed these two\nmacaques to interact, get into a fight resulting in an injury, and distress. Animals must be handled in a manner that does\nnot cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.\nCorrected prior to inspection."

An internal investigation found this had been occurring since September 28, 2022, after some changes to light\ncycles were initiated to facilitate some repairs and painting in other rooms.\nNot having the lights turn off did not provide for a diurnal light cycle and did not allow the animals housed indoors to be\nable to get away from constant lighting.
