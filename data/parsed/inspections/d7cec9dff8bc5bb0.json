I called the contact\nnumber again with the voicemail and left a message that I was on the premises and would like to conduct an\ninspection if anyone was available. I explained the importance of this inspection and that it was the third attempted\ninspection. At about 1:50 a family member pulled up and explained that she and the mother were unable to conduct\nan inspection at that time. I explained to the family member the importance of conducting the inspection and that\nsince they were unable to do so that this would be considered an attempted inspection. I let her know that she\nwould be receiving a report in the mail and gave her my business card if she had any further questions. I left the\nfacility at 2:00 pm.
