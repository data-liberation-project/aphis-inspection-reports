The following instances of the laboratory staff implementing significant changes in an\nongoing activity without prior review and approval by the IACUC and instances of the laboratory staff not following the\napproved protocol were identified. The deviations with the IACUC approved protocol were identified by the IACUC during\nthe November 2023 semi-annual facility inspection.\n1. According to the research facility\u2019s IACUC Acclimation Policy that investigators are to follow for all IACUC approved\nprotocols, the acclimation period for all non-rodents is a minimum of 7 days. Review of facility records for the 6 rabbits\ndelivered on 11/16/23 revealed that the 6 rabbits underwent a procedure requiring anesthesia on 11/17/23 (1 day of\nacclimation) and 1 rabbit delivered on 12/7/23 underwent a procedure requiring anesthesia on 12/12/23 (5 days of\nacclimation). Shortening of the acclimation period is a significant change regarding the use of animals in an ongoing\nactivity that was not reviewed or approved by the IACUC committee.\n2. Protocol states that two injections of the study compound will be administered to the rabbits. The first injection will be\nadministered on study day 0 and the second injection of the study compound will be administered three days later on\nstudy day 3. Review of the medical record of rabbit #448 revealed that the study day 0 injection was administered on\n12/29/23 and the second injection was administered 6 days later on 1/4/24. Doubling the time interval between study\ncompound injections is a significant change regarding the use of animals in an ongoing activity that was not reviewed or\napproved by the IACUC committee.\n3. Protocol states that the intra-articular injection will be performed under general anesthesia (acepromazine followed by\ninhalant agent). There was no documentation noted in the review of the medical records of 10 animals that the inhalant\nagent was administered during the injections as described in the approved protocol.\n4. Protocol states that laboratory staff will monitor the rabbits \u201c5 days per week until the prescribed study endpoint\u201d\nfollowing the intra-articular injections and following the major operative procedure. There was no documentation noted in\nthe review of the medical records of at least 10 animals that the monitoring of the animals was performed as described in\nthe approved protocol.\n5. Protocol states that rabbits undergoing a major operative procedure will receive antibiotics for 3 days post-operatively.\nThere was no documentation noted in the review of the medical records of 5 animals that underwent surgery that\nantibiotics were administered as described in the approved protocol.\n6. Protocol states that acepromazine will be administered prior to procedures either as the sole agent or in addition to an\ninhalant agent, and the protocol includes an approved range for the dose. The dose of acepromazine administered to the\nrabbits was not documented in the medical records and it could not be determined if the dose of the medication was as\ndescribed in the approved protocol.\n7. Protocol states that \u201cno more than 10 ml of blood at each bleeding\u201d. The volume of blood taken was not documented in\nthe medical records for the majority of the blood draws and it could not be determined if the volume of blood taken was as\ndescribed in the approved protocol.\nPer this Section, with respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications to\nsecure approval, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing\nactivities prior to implementation by the investigator. Principal investigators are to follow the IACUC approved proposals\nand any proposed changes shall be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementation. The IACUC needs to\naddress the deviations with the IACUC approved protocol that were identified for this proposal for animal use and ensure\nthat all significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are reviewed and approved prior to\nimplementation. Correct by 3/1/24.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.\n*END OF REPORT*\nn"
