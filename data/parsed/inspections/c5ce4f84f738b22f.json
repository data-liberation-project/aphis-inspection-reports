Once the staff accessed the room he was only\nable to locate one of the two ferrets. Ferret #15145 was not found and the facility has yet to discern how the animal\nescaped the room. The staff was trained to double check the enclosures with the understanding that they have the\npotential to not latch. During questioning the staff member mentioned that there could be a chance that the door\nwas not properly secured. There are other advantage points in which the animal could have escaped the secondary\ncontainment but not the primary containment.\nAnimals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or\nunnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar\nproblems from occurring in the future.\nThe facility has implemented additional enclosure locks on the cage to ensure they are secured once closed. Also\nthere have been other corrections implemented on the second containment. The facility self-reported the incident to\nAPHIS officials.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian."
