On the morning of July 7, 2024 it was discovered that a hole had been chewed through the\nfabric mess netting covering the enclosure and that the female porcupine was missing, but the adult male porcupine was\nunharmed. Zoo staff suspect that the female porcupine was likely predated upon by a wild animal, such as a fisher or pine\nmarten, as the porcupine, which was a rehabilitated animal, suffered from a neurological deficient and would not have\nbeen able to successfully climb and chew her way out of the enclosure. Failure to maintain enclosures that contain and\nprotect the animals securely increases the risk of injury or death to the animals. All enclosures must be constructed to\nsecurely contain the animals housed within and to prevent injury or harm to the animals. Corrected prior to the time of\ninspection. Immediately after the incident, zoo staff repaired the hole in the fabric mess and worked to secure a metal\nstyle mess to replace the fabric mess.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with Facility Representatives.\nn"
