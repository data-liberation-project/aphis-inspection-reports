Protocol 301514-06 states in the rationale that \"the total number of animals\nis the minimum needed to properly characterize responses related to Test Article administration and, thus, to meet\nexperimental objectives\". The number of animals for dosing is 37 males and 37 females. There is no explanation in\nthe protocol how these numbers were derived. For protocol 99014-113, the rationale states that \"the total number\nof animals is the minimum needed to properly characterize the effects of a high sugar high fat (HSHF) diet on\nvarious aspects of the metabolic syndrome in cynomolgus macaques and thus to meet the experimental objectives\".\nThe total number of animals to be used in year one is 60. Again, there is no explanation in the protocol how these\nnumbers were determined.\nIn protocol 96515-01, the rationale for number of animals states \"this is a pilot screening study to evaluate the\nresponse at three points on an estimated lethality profile. This study will be used to inform doses for a larger study\".\nThe total animals to be used will be 48. For protocol 26515-42, the rationale states that \"the total number of\nanimals (3 animals/sex/group at terminal and recovery necropsies) is the minimum needed to properly characterize\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and thus to meet experimental objectives\". The total number of animals\nto be used in year one is 54 males and 54 females. Neither protocol provides an explanation as to how these\nnumbers were derived.\nThe IACUC must ensure that all proposals to conduct an activity involving animals have an adequate rationale that\nexplains why these numbers are necessary in order to ensure that the minimum number of animals are utilized.\nIACUC approval of activities where an adequate rationale for numbers has not been provided could result in\nunnecessary animal use. Correct in these protocols, and all current active protocols at the time of the next review,\nand from this time forward in all new animal activity proposals."
