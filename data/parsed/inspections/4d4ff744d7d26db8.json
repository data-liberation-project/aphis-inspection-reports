Although one component of the sedative combination\nusually used was unavailable for purchase due to manufacturer backorder (butorphanol), the facility did not have a\nbackup restraint plan or seek an alternative method or sedation drug(s) from the attending veterinarian. Not only did the\nanimals remain together because separation could not be achieved without sedation, but the animals ultimately had\nanother altercation as detailed elsewhere in this report. Neither animal could be sedated to facilitate restraint for\nevaluation and timely provision of any required veterinary care for their injuries.\nFailure to have an available method to restrain and/or sedate animals when necessary prevented timely and thorough\nevaluation of the animals' injuries and their physical separation, which would have prevented the subsequent fighting\nincident between the two animals that again resulted in injuries.

The licensee must ensure that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible, as \ndetermined by observation. \nTO REMAIN CORRECTED FROM THE DATE OF THIS INSPECTION ON 03/26/2025 AND GOING FORWARD. \n3.9(a) \n   \nFeeding \nWhen asked about feeding protocols, facility staff told the inspector that wolf-dog hybrid animals are not fed on a daily \nbasis in an effort to approximate the feeding frequency of wolves in the wild, but there is no documentation to indicate the \nattending veterinarian's endorsement or justification of this practice in the interest of providing appropriate veterinary care \nor husbandry.  \nFailure to feed dogs at least once per day can result in discomfort from hunger, digestion abnormalities, illness from \nmalnutrition and heightened susceptibility to illness. The facility must ensure that all dogs and cats are fed at least once \neach day, except as otherwise might be required to provide adequate veterinary care, as deemed appropriate by the \nattending veterinarian. The food must be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the normal condition and \nweight of the animals, and appropriate for each individual's age and condition. \nTO BE CORRECTED BY 04/04/2025 \n3.9(b) \n   \nFeeding \nDuring the inspection, an adult female wolf-dog hybrid named \"Tippy\" (ID #347) was seen finishing a piece of meat placed \ndirectly on the ground without use of a food receptacle; staff confirmed that dishes are not always used for feeding the \nwolf-dog hybrids at the facility. \nFood receptacles help food remain palatable and protect it from contamination, as well as limit the amount of non-food \nand potentially harmful parasites or other pathogens an animal may inadvertently consume from eating directly off of the \nground. The facility must ensure that food receptacles are used and are readily accessible to all dogs, and located so as \nto minimize contamination by excreta and pests, and be protected from rain and snow. Feeding pans must either be made \nof a durable material that can be easily cleaned and sanitized or be disposable. Non-disposable food receptacles must be\n\nkept clean and sanitized in accordance with Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.11(b), which is achieved by using one of the \nmethods described in Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.11(b)(3). Disposable food receptacles must be discarded after a single \nuse. \nTO BE CORRECTED FROM THE DATE OF THIS INSPECTION ON 3/26/2025 AND GOING FORWARD \n3.10(a) \n   \nWatering \nWhen asked about watering practices, facility staff confirmed that the water provided in metal buckets to all of the wolf-\ndog hybrids housed outdoors does freeze when the temperature drops low enough and that the ice in the buckets is \nbroken when staff arrive in the morning. There is no mechanism to prevent freezing of the water, so these animals do not \nhave access to water until the staff corrects the problem on those days.  \n \nThere was a very small amount of uniformly brown, opaque water in the water bucket shared by adult wolf-dog hybrids \n\"Kiara\" (ID #274) and \"Kovu\" (ID# 273); a facility staff member corrected this during the inspection. \nThe water bucket shared by adult wolf-dog hybrids \"Sox\" (ID #255) and \"Gambit\" (ID #290) was empty, except for mud at \nthe bottom; a facility staff member corrected this during the inspection and the animals did not exhibit an abnormal level of \nthirst when given fresh water. \nFailure to provide a continuous supply of potable water can result in discomfort or illness from dehydration or \ncontaminated water, and inappetence. The facility must ensure that potable water is made continuously available to dogs, \nunless restricted by the attending veterinarian or excepted as provided in the transportation standards during transport. \nTO BE CORRECTED FROM THE DATE OF THIS INSPECTION ON 3/26/2025 \n3.11(b)(2) \n   \nCleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. \nThe inspector asked facility staff about frequency of sanitation for food and water receptacles and was told that water \nbuckets are only dumped, perhaps rinsed and then refilled, and that at least twice weekly sanitation of water and food \nreceptacles is not performed. \nFood and water in receptacles that are not appropriately cleaned and sanitized can contaminate food and water from the \npresence of harmful microorganisms and parasites, resulting in animal illness. The licensee must ensure that used \nprimary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs are sanitized at least once every two weeks (more often if \nnecessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards) using one of the \nmethods prescribed in Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.11(b)(3). \nTO BE CORRECTED FROM THE DATE OF THIS INSPECTION ON 03/26/2025 AND GOING FORWARD \n3.13(b)(2) \n   \nVeterinary care for dogs. \nThe facility had veterinary invoices but no veterinary records on hand for an adult female wolf-dog hybrid named \"Hela\" \n(ID #311) that sustained injuries to her right front paw and loss of a toe when bitten through a fence by another wolf-dog \nhybrid in an adjacent enclosure. \nVeterinary records contain information that is vital for the care of animals that present with injuries or illnesses. It is \nimportant to have the veterinary record on hand to ensure that caregivers know exactly how and when to provide follow\n\nup care to animals, including details for post-procedural care, drug administration and any other instructions and follow up \nvisits. This written information is very important to ensure that any follow up care provided to the animal is done according \nto the veterinarian's orders to help prevent unnecessary discomfort or harm to the animal and help ensure the best \noutcome. The licensee must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make these available for APHIS inspection; the \nrecords must include all of the information detailed in Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.13(b)(1-4). \nTO BE CORRECTED FROM THE DATE OF THIS INSPECTION ON 03/26/2025 AND GOING FORWARD \n \nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. \n \n n",
