They were not observed overnight. Per the facility representative that was present\nduring the reintroduction on May 5th, they observed instances of nipping, snarling, and teeth baring from Yuki which\nresulted in Iver giving Yuki space. They also observed Yuki lying down and Iver moving to a different part of the habitat\nresulting in no interactions. The wolfdogs were observed for approximately one hour inside the enclosure and\napproximately forty-five minutes from the next enclosure while working with a different animal. After this period, the\nwolfdogs were only within hearing distance and were checked every fifteen minutes. Per the facility representative, on the\nthird fifteen-minute check, Yuki was found with severe neck wounds and taken to the veterinarian.\nAccording to the facility representative, previous interactions between these two wolfdogs were generally playful. When\nasked about the differences in behavior between previous interactions and those seen during the reintroduction, it was\nstated that they thought Yuki may not have been feeling completely healed from the medical procedure that caused them\nto be separated. The attending veterinarian was not consulted prior to or during the reintroduction.\nAt the conclusion of the inspection, the facility could not provide documentation of the incident besides the report from\nYuki\u2019s visit the veterinarian. Staff present at the facility indicated that there was no other documentation.\nInadequate observation of animals that are being reintroduced to each other can lead to injury and even death. All dogs\nhoused in the same primary enclosure must be compatible, as determined by observation.\nTo be corrected from this day (7/3/2023) forward."
