These animals were observed with soiled\nareas on the legs and sides from the waste contaminated bedding. An enclosure containing 9 nilgai was observed\nwith a large accumulation of bedding material near the feed trough that was contaminated with fecal material.\nOutside, on the southwest area of this site, an enclosure containing 2 badgers was observed with the gravel strata\nreceding below the wire panel flooring. This has created a cleaning obstacle. This enclosure was observed with\nfecal waste, feed, mud, and other organic materials covering the floor area below the wire panel. A foul odor was\nnoticeable in close proximity to this enclosure.\nAll enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent soiling and contamination of the animals a nd to\nminimize disease and odor hazards. To be corrected by: 10/06/15\nThis inspection and exit interview was conducted with the owners by Curt McGruder-ACI."
