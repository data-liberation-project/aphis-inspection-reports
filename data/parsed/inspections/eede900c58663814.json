The following records were missing:\n*The acquisition and disposition record for the second spider monkey (facility representative stated she obtained\ntwo but then returned one that she was unable to sell)\n*The disposition record for the six hedgehogs present during the last routine inspection that the facility\nrepresentative states she no longer owns.\n*The disposition record for the marmosets present during the last inspection and not present during today's\ninspection.\n*The acquisition/disposition records for the animals being sold/exhibited during the Exotic Expo in Cowan, TN on\nMay 20, 2017.\nIt is important to keep accurate and complete records in order to trace the health and the ownership of animals. The\nacquisition and disposition records must be complete and include all the required information."

There is only one\nsmall portion of the current fencing that meets the perimeter fence requirements. The licensee stated that a\nvariance request was sent to the office approximately six months ago however inspectors checked with the office\nwhich has no records of receiving a variance request. The sheltered housing building requires a perimeter fence at\nleast six foot high which is at least three feet from the sheltered building or a variance approved by the\nadministrator. The administrator can approve a fence less than six feet high and less than three feet from the\nsheltered building. It is important for the protection of the nonhuman primates to restrict access of unwanted animals\nand unauthorized humans. Apply for a variance or construct a fence.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nBrunkhorst Susanne, Veterinary Medical Officer"
