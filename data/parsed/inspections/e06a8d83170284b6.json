The macaque was observed to pluck at the hair/skin in this area of his arms during the majority of\ntime he was observed during the inspection. The keeper in charge reports that they noticed the problem a couple of\ndays ago but a veterinarian has not been contacted regarding this problem. Self-trauma of the skin by any animal\ncan indicate parasites, skin infection, and a variety of other medical problems. In many animals, including\nnonhuman primates, self-trauma of the skin can also result from psychological stress. The animal listed above must\nbe examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate\ntreatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the\ncondition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
