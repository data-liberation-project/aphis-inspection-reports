Additionally, there was a thick buildup of excreta on\nseveral of the exercise wheels within these cages. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent\ncontamination of the animals contained and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of\nthe enclosures should be more frequent and effective to prevent the buildup of excreta.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility owner."
