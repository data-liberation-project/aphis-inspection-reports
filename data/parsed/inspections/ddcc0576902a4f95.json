The perimeter fence enclosing\nthe facility is less than eight feet for nearly the entire perimeter and some places are less than six feet in height. Other\nsections of perimeter fencing are inadequate because they are in poor repair and/or do not meet minimum height\nrequirements:\n\u2022 Along E. College Boulevard: The height of the chain link perimeter fence, including the top barbed wire strands,\nmeasures 80\u201d at its greatest height; the public entrance chain link gate measures 75.5\u201d in height and has a 6\u201d vertical gap\nbetween the post and gate and an 8\u201d gap beneath it. The wooden loading entrance gate at the NW corner (N. Atkinson\nAve. and E. College Blvd.) has a 9\u201d gap at the bottom, and the wooden fence adjacent to the gate has a 10\u201dX7\u201d gap at the\nbottom.\n\u2022 Along N. Atkinson Avenue: The wooden portions of the fence measure 7\u20194\u201d in height at the lowest point; the gate to the\nsouth lower parking lot has a gap at the right side that measures 11.5\u201d at its greatest width; the chain link portion of\nfencing east of the river gate is 5\u20196\u201d in height at its lowest point and 6\u20192\u201d at its maximum height.\n\u2022 Rear Perimeter Fence, Bordering Trailer Park: The chain link fencing at the corner post on N. Atkinson Ave. (near the\npoint where the city water ties into the pond) is in poor repair, with a 12\u201dX9\u201d hole at the topline where the metal has been\npulled downward; the height of this section of fencing ranges from 6\u20192\u201d at its lowest point to 6\u20198\u201d at its greatest height, up\nto the point of the newly constructed chain link fencing. Newly constructed chain link fencing sections have a vertical gap\nmeasuring 5\u201d-8\u201d in width at the point where the new post ties into the older section. The remainder of the rear perimeter\nfence separating the zoo from this residential area is in poor condition, with numerous places where trees have grown\nthrough the fence line and multiple areas where the top barbed wire strands are detached or missing at the top; there are\nlong spans of chain link patching along the bottom of the majority of this fence line, some of which are detached or\nsagging. There are multiple breaches at the bottom of the fence line where the fence is torn or pulled upward, resulting in\n4\u201d-12\u201d gaps. The integrity of the remainder of this fence line cannot be assessed due to tall, very dense and thorny, dead\nvegetation immediately inside the fence line.\n\u2022 Side Perimeter Fence, Bordering Open Lot or Residential Area on south side of river: The condition and heights of the\nperimeter fencing near the elk enclosure cannot be evaluated due to very tall, dense and thorny vegetation immediately\ninside the fence line; the weeds extend approximately 20\u2019-30\u2019 deep from the fence and are over 5\u2019 tall. The adjacent\nfence sections are similarly inaccessible, with weeds over 6\u2019 tall and piles of rubble/discarded materials preventing\ninspection.\n\u2022 Other Sections of Fencing: The fence line adjacent to the greenhouse measures 5\u20195\u201d at its minimum height and 6\u20198\u201d at\nits maximum height. The south side perimeter fencing bordering a residential trailer park measures 5\u20197\u201d at its minimum\nheight and ~6\u2019 at its maximum height; there are weeds (estimated to be ~8\u2019 in height) along this section that exceed the\nheight of the fence.\nThe fence is inadequate because it cannot serve as a secondary containment system for the animals housed in the facility\nand cannot prevent other animals and unauthorized persons from entering. The licensee must assess all perimeter\nfences at the facility for adequate height and structural integrity and modify the existing fence(s) or install a different\nperimeter fence or fences of at least 8 feet in height (for the dangerous species noted above), and at least 6 feet in height\n(for all other non-dangerous species inventoried at the time of this inspection). The perimeter fence(s) must be a\nminimum of three feet from the primary enclosures and constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by\nrestricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the\nanimals in the facility.\nTO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 30, 2022.\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nEnd Section"
