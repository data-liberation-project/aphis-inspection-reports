      "narrative": "In some the larger pens/exhibits, the enclosure fence line consists of a lower wall 4 to 8 feet in height, sometimes\ncovered by gunnite, topped with chain link attached to stanchions/uprights. There are several small areas (given\nthe amount of enclosure fence present) where the substrate (both gunnite and dirt) below the existing chain link\nfence has been eroded away (by natural and animal causes). In some areas the chain link fence has been\ndamaged or rolled up in a way that creates a hazard for the animals and has the potential to cause injury.\n*In Central Asia, there is damaged chainlink at the Gate to Dholes (Tiger gate). At the forage gate, the fence has\nbeen eroded away on the Eastern side and the NE corner, exposing the concrete footing for the fenceline.\n*In Asian Plains, there is a fence hole with a temporary patch of very rusty wire below Arabian Oryx and on the\nnorth end by the boma (rhino/gower), the fence is not secured to the retaining wall and the gap is filled with rocks.\nAt the south-east end, the fence is damaged and needs to be reinforced - it is separated from the supports.\n*In the White Lipped deer enclosure, lower corner near the Markhor pass through the chainlink fence was damaged\nand curling up, creating gaps underneath and areas where the animals could injure themselves. In the Markhor\npens, the chainlink used as tree wrap was loose and damaged, resulting in sharp points.\nCorrection date: 1 December, 2017\nIn S. Africa and the Bantang and Sambar permanent pens and Addax enclosure lower corner by the road, there\nwere areas where the height of the enclosure fence was not sufficient (less than 6 feet tall) for the animals due to\nthe build up of silt and dirt that was washed down by the rains. Correction date: 15 July, 2017\nIn the field exhibits, chicken wire has been attached on the exterior of the fence line as predator wire, and is mostly\nburied. Erosion and animal activity has exposed chicken wire in some areas, covering the gap between the concrete\nwall and the chain link. Chicken wire material, especially when rusty, is not appropriate and of sufficient strength to\nprevent entry of small noncollection animals into the enclosure. The exposed chicken wire used as predator wire\nwas in the Asian plains exhibit on the north east side fence across from the Rhino boma and at Blackbuck hill.\nCorrection date: 15 July, 2017\nIn off-exhibit holding, shipping pens (19) there is a large hole that has been dug in a corner. In pen 30/31, the wild\nAss has damaged the plastic inserts in to the chainlink and resulted in superficial wounds on his face. In the\nKlipspringer pen, the plywood has holes and splinters in the catch pen. The catch pen above White Lipped deer\nhas cribbed and splintered plywood. In permanent breeding pens, the Oryx have dug holes and under the fence,\ncreating sharp points and a hazardous area. In middle level Long Term Holding, there is a hole in the fence,\ndamage to the plastic fence inserts and damage to the shelter on the West end of the row. Correction date: 15 July,\n2017\nIn the VSE area, the research pen has an entire wall of rusty metal panels, and several pens have rusty latches and\nflat bars that fill the door gaps. The chainlink gate to the alleyway has damaged chainlink and the plywood in Pen 2\nis chewed and splintered. These pens were recently in use by covered species (Sitatunga and Common Eland)\nduring quarantine. Correction date: 1 December 17\nIn the Okapi barn and the Red River Hog yard, the hogs have rooted up the rhino lining on the floor and damaged\nthe dividing fence, creating sharp points where a variety of wire fencing materials have been utilized. The Okapi\nyards have several areas of chain link damage, especially in the upper yard. Correction date: 15 July 2017\nIn Tiger bedroom #4, there is damaged insulation around a pipe near the ceiling. The bench below the pipe that the\nanimal used to reach the insulation has been removed, but the insulation is still damaged and no longer in good\nrepair. A work order was submitted in Sep, 2016 and it has been noted during an internal animal care inspection as\nwell, so a correction is pending.\nIn the Dhole bedrooms, there is paint chipping off the concrete in several areas, and it is no longer in good repair.\nCorrection date: 15 July, 2017\nFacilities must be structurally sound, constructed with material that is an appropriate strength for the animals\ninvolved and shall be maintained in good repair."
