Furthermore, the second lame\nAoudad identified had not been noticed by the facility representative until it was brought to their attention.\nLameness is suggestive of pain and/or an underlying condition. Failure to appropriately identify and treat diseases can\nlead to prolonged suffering, infection, pain, and other veterinary care problems. In addition, failure to observe all animals\ndaily can result in deterioration of the animal's health, especially when limping has began and the initial onset is unknown.\nThe facility must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries."
