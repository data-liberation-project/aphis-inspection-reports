Additional clean, dry bedding is\nrequired when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower.\nThe licensee was verbally instructed to add adequate bedding to these shelters before the end of the day.\nThe licensee had bedding on hand to comply.\nThe inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee."
