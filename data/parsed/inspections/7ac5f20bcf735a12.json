The coyotes ran off and the student contacted the\nveterinarian. Upon arrival (within 30 minutes), the veterinarian determined three does were attacked with the following\noutcome: one doe was dead, one was severely injured and later euthanized, and the other was treated and recovered.\nThe rest of the goats were evaluated and moved to a safer pen. Failure of outdoor housing facilities to protect the animals\nfrom injury can negatively impact the health and well-being of the animals. The outdoor housing facilities must be\nstructurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The facility implemented corrective\nactions after the incident by keeping the animals in pens closer to the main facility/humans and purchasing two trained\ngoat-protecting dogs who now live with the goats full-time.\nCorrect by: August 10, 2023\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nn"
