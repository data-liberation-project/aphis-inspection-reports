A few of these dogs were co-housed and would continue the behavior around the other animals.\nThis is an abnormal behavior pattern for these animals and could be indicative of stress or another health issue.\nThe licensee has observed these behaviors and stated that they will stop when the dogs are allowed outside but\nbegin again when in the enclosure. The licensee has not communicated these abnormal behaviors with the vet to\naddress the issue. Daily observation of the animals should focus on their health and well- being which would include\ntheir psychological well- being. The attending vet needs to evaluate these animals for diagnosis of the cause of\nthese behaviors and develop an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue.
