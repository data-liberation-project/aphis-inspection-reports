The right eye protrudes from the socket more than\nthe left one and the eyelids do not fully close over the right eye when the dog blinks. The \u201cwhite\u201d of the right eye is\nred and there are prominent blood vessels visible there. There was a crust on the upper and lower lids surrounding\nthe right eye.\nAn adult female Chinese pug with tag number 21 has an abnormal right eye. The surface of the right eye (cornea) is\ndry and has a large area of cloudiness. The \u201cwhite\u201d of the eye has prominent blood vessels that are not present on\nthe left eye.\nEye problems can be a result of trauma, infection, and other medical problems. They can be painful for the dog and\nhave the potential to damage the eye. The licensee must have these dogs examined by a licensed veterinarian as\nsoon as possible in order to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issue cited above.\nThe outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation\nshould include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by\nthe veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar\nand/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.\nThere should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each\nanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and\nthe need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.\nThe licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a\ntimely manner by a veterinarian as part of the facility\u2019s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility use\nappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times.\nA female West Highland white terrier with tag number 61 and a Yorkshire terrier with tag number 30 had excessively\nlong nails that were causing their toes to be mal-positioned.
