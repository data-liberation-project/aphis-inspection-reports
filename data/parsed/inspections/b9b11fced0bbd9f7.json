This does not ensure that the attending\nveterinarian has been given authority to oversee the adequacy of adequate veterinary care and other aspects of\nanimal care provided. Additionally, the written Program of Veterinary Care that the licensee provided during the\ninspection did not include the alpaca, cow and prairie dog and lacked sufficient detail in several areas. The parasite\ncontrol programs for the species listed on page 3 and 4 did not provide the dosages, route of administration,\nfrequency and duration of treatment. The emergency care section on pages 2-4 did not clearly identify who would\nprovide emergency veterinary care including the emergency phone number of the attending veterinarian or the\nnames, contact information and duties performed by those providing husbandry care for the animals in the event\nthat the primary caretaker is unable to do so. Under the euthanasia section for pages 2-4, the method of euthanasia\nwas not listed, which must include product name, dosage and route of administration. An incomplete written\nProgram of Veterinary Care does not ensure that the attending veterinarian is aware and approves of all aspects of\nveterinary and husbandry care being provided to the animals. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian\nto develop a written Program of Veterinary Care and include the components listed above that are lacking from the\nwritten plan to ensure that it is complete and accurately reflects the veterinary care provided to the animals and that\nthe attending veterinarian has been given adequate authority over the veterinary care of the animals. Correct by\nNovember 25, 2016.\nThis inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner."
