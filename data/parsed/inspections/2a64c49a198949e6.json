After reviewing the IACUC meeting minutes from November 17,\n2022, and speaking with the facility representative, it was explained that the facility was experiencing some difficulty with\nthe air handler in the portion of the building housing the guinea pigs. The guinea pigs were subsequently moved to\nanother portion of the building using a different air handler. Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too hot may\nbe subject to heat stress which may negatively impact their health or cause discomfort. Indoor housing facilities for guinea\npigs must be sufficiently heated when necessary to protect the animals from the cold, and to provide for their health and\ncomfort.
