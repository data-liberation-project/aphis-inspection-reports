The\nreason for these procedures was reported to be for safety and handling reasons. De-clawing is a painful procedure\nand can potentially lead to chronic health problems when an animal gets older. Routine de-clawing and tooth\nremoval in wild carnivore species for any reason other than to treat a medical condition of the affected digit/tooth is\nno longer an accepted standard veterinary procedure. The facility must not have claws or teeth removed for\nhandling reasons. In the future, ensure that appropriate handling practices and enclosures are in place for wild\ncarnivores that don't require an animal to de-clawed.\nCorrect from this day forward.\nExit interview conducted with facility representative.\nAdditional Inspectors\nRanslem Corbin, Animal Care Inspector"
