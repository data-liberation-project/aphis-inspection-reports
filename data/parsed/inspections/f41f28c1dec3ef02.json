      "narrative": "The giraffe barn is not maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The indoor barn for the giraffes has a\nhanging exhaust fan cord located approximately 11 feet from the ground. The taller giraffe is approximately 12 feet tall\nwith its mouth located at about 11 feet. The shorter giraffe is approximately 11 feet tall. The cord is routed through the wall\nand the outlet isn\u2019t visible from inside the barn. The licensee states that the fan is not currently in use but has been\npowered on and used during warmer weather as recently as this past summer season (since the last inspection). While\nthe outlet itself is protected from the giraffes, the fan\u2019s electrical cord is hanging within reach of the giraffes. The cord is\nunprotected, risking chewing or pulling with the giraffe\u2019s long prehensile tongue (average length is 18-20 inches), and is\nnot secured against the wall, risking potential entanglement with their ossicones and/or head. Inspectors observed the\ntaller giraffe nibbling at the wooden boards separating the stalls in the barn. Per the licensee, the giraffes have been\nchewing on parts of the barn as evidenced by multiple chew marks along the length of the top of the wooden wall\nseparating the stalls, as well as the top of and sides of the sliding wooden gate. These chew marks highlight the oral\nexploratory nature of these giraffes. Unsecured and unprotected electrical cords within reach of the animal can cause\nentanglement, injury, or possibly electrocution to the animals. The housing facility must be maintained to protect the\nanimals from injury.\nCorrect by November 30, 2024\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\nThis is a continuation of the report for the routine inspection beginning 11/15/2024, and contains the remaining non-\ncompliances found during the inspection.
