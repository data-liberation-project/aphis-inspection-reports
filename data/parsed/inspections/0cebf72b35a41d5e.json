There was\nenough of this material present to obscure individual tooth identification on some teeth. The gums also appeared\nswollen and retracted from the teeth in those areas in contact with heavy plaque material.\nAnother male yorkie, identified as Bear (DOB 12-07-2010 ID #20), was similarly found to have thick, hard dark\nbrown debris/plaque material covering the majority of the upper cheek teeth and upper canine teeth. There was\nalso evidence of gum swelling and retraction of gums from the teeth in areas in contact with heavy debris/plaque\nbuildup.\nExcessive tartar buildup on teeth and dental disease may lead to discomfort, difficulty chewing and weight loss.\nThese conditions may further impact the overall health and comfort of animals. All animals listed above must be\nexamined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate\ntreatment plan is developed and followed.
