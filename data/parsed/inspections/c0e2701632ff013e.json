Female Baboon ID# 26876: Underwent 3 cesarian sections: twice on protocol #18-006 on 4/18/2019 and 1/10/2020,\nand once on protocol #21-003 on 6/17/2021.\n2.

The protocols\nindicate animals will be undergoing multiple major surgeries but do not provide a scientific justification nor have approval\nfrom the Administrator. These protocols, which have each been reviewed and approved by the IACUC, have spanned\nover 6 years. According to the facility, due to the multiple surgeries performed, the IACUC created a policy to limit the\nnumber of major operative procedures an individual animal can undergo to a maximum of six in the animal\u2019s life. The\nfacility has not sought or received approval from the Administrator for any of the animals that have undergone multiple\nmajor operative procedures on any of the protocols.\nAnimals that undergo major operative procedures and are recovered are subjected to stress, pain and discomfort.\nCorrect by the end of 9/15/2021 by not allowing any animal to undergo more than one major operative procedure from\nwhich the animal recovers, without a justified scientific reason by the principal investigator and/or receiving prior approval\nfrom the USDA Administrator."
