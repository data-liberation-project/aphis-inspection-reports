They risk stepping through\nand getting a broken leg, or catching themselves on the corners of the fencing, or possibly digging under the fence\nand exiting the enclosure.\nAll exposed fencing and holes in the ground around the perimeter of the enclosure should be filled in and covered\nin a manner that protects the dogs from injury, and prevents them from digging out of the enclosure through\ntunneling under the fencing.\nTo be corrected by: January 30, 2019"
