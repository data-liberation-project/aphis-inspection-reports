Little Cort, an approximately 6-year-old female Dachshund (m/c\n# 900217000257313) had excessive tartar build up on her canines, front teeth, and molars. On her right side her upper\ncanine and upper front teeth were approximately three quarters covered in a hard dark thick brown material. The gumline\non the upper canine was severely recessed with a thick grey creamy discharge. The bottom back teeth are almost\ncompletely covered in a hard dark thick brown material. The gumline slightly recessed with a thick grey creamy discharge.\nThe gums adjacent to the affected teeth are red and swollen. On the left side the upper canine is about three quarters\ncovered in a thick, dark brown material with the gum line being slightly recessed. The bottom back tooth is almost\ncompletely covered in a hard dark thick brown material.\nNellie, an approximately one-and-a-half-year-old female Pomeranian (m/c # 900215009873353 had excessive tartar build\nup on her molars and marginal buildup on her upper canines and front teeth. On her right side, her upper canine and front\nteeth had a moderate buildup of light brown material extending about halfway down the teeth. The back molar was\nencrusted in a thick tan brown like material. On her left side both canines had a moderate buildup of light brown material\ncovering about half the teeth. Both upper and lower back teeth were heavily encrusted in a thick tan, brown material. Her\ngums on both sides were severely red and swollen.\nPoor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to the animal and can lead to further health issues. These dogs must\nbe evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan.
