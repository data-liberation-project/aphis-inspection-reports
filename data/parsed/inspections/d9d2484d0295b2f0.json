The Dolphin Cove pool is at least 20 feet deep. Although the\ndolphins are rotated through the sections during the day, an animal in the large pool may not have access to shade\nwhen it desires to seek shade.\n- In the Aloha Discovery pool, where interactions with the public occur, there is not adequate shade at times when\nthere is little shade from nearby mountains and vegetation. The Aloha Discovery pool was repainted a darker blue in\nSpring 2015. Although a shade structure has been installed along the east side of this pool, the interactions occur in\nthe north end, where steps and benches are installed for guests to be situated during interactions.\nDirect sunlight can be uncomfortable for the animals and can adversely affect their health, especially eye health.\nAdditional steps should be taken to provide even more shade for marine mammals when they choose to seek\nshade, and when they are being asked to interact with the trainers / public, which involves holding their heads out of\nthe water, and looking up toward the sky. The facility should re-review shade for all marine mammal enclosures and\nensure that adequate shade is provided.\nThis issue was cited previously, with a past due correction date.
