      "narrative": "****Otis (m/c0071B72F7) a male fawn Pug, was very thin. His ribs, backbone, hip bones and shoulders were easily\nobserved and there was a very defined abdominal tuck. Both eyes are crusted with a dry discharge and previous\nveterinary notes stated that the dog was blind. The owner stated that the dog had lost weight before and was\ntreated with dewormer and different dog food and that was her plan now. There was no consultation with a\nveterinarian to establish a diagnosis or to confirm that this was the correct treatment for this dog. Eye conditions can\nbe uncomfortable or painful and the discharges can attract flies and cause the condition to worsen. Poor body\ncondition can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. The dog must be\nevaluated by a veterinarian within 2 days of this inspection, to know with certainty the problem and the correct\ntreatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended treatment and delivered treatments must be available to\nAPHIS officials.\nThe veterinarian was called during the inspection for an appointment for that same evening.\nCorrection date: 1 Oct, 2017\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative."
