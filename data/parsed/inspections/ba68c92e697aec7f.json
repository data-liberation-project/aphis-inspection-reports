Sloths need a variety of resting perches with a basking light provided so they can reach a temperature zone that\nis comfortable for them. Food and water should be provided in multiple locations and a central climbing structure with\nlimbs crossing the enclosure gives them options to choose what is most comfortable for them. The thin gauge wire can be\nuncomfortable for them to use for climbing and grasping and other options to reach the ground must be provided.\nHumidity should range from 60 to 80 percent for sloths as they are tropical animals. Substrate should be provided over\nthe entire floor for the sloth\u2019s safety and comfort. Failure to provide these things can cause behavioral stress, physical\nharm and unnecessary discomfort.
