On inspection, however, a single small ball is the only toy\navailable in the enclosure and the licensee shared that a partner bird has not been available for cohabitation since the\nprevious inspection in October, 2024. Failure to provide adequate, continuous enrichment of this highly intelligent, social\nspecies, especially when singly housed, may compromise psychological welfare.
