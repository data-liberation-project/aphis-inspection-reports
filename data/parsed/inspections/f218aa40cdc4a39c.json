There was a thin coating of crusty-flaky white debris overlaying the darkened skin.\nThere was a scab approx. 1/4 inch in diameter on the inside left ear near the tip. There were areas of hair loss and\nthickened skin on both the right and left inner and outer ear flaps.\nThere was a female King Charles Cavalier Spaniel (ID #200, blenheim/liver/white) that had a buildup of moist, brown\nmaterial in both inner ear canals and there was redness/inflammation to the skin surrounding the entrance to the inner ear\ncanal. There was a superficial scab on the margin of both inner ears.\nThe licensee was not aware of the ear problems in any of the regulated animals. The veterinarian had not been contacted\nfor proper diagnosis or treatment of the ear conditions prior to the inspection.\nBuilt up brown material in ears, hairloss, redness/inflammation, thickening, darkened skin, and scabbing can be possible\nsigns that there is a problem with the ears and the dogs are scratching and/or shaking their heads due to possible\ndiscomfort, itching and irritation. The lack of timely veterinary care can cause a treatable condition to become chronic and\nmore severe.\n-According to the monthly heartworm treatment documentation, all the dogs in the facility did not receive their monthly\nheartworm treatment in June, August and September of 2022 which is not following their program of vet care.\nThe lack of monthly heartworm treatments could make the dogs susceptible to contracting heartworm, and the program of\nvet care advises that heartworm treatments are given monthly.\nThe licensee must contact a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of any health issue on the regulated animals,\naccording to the AWA regulations and standards.
