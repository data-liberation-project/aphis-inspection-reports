      "narrative": "A young female sloth \"Malia\" died on 10/26/19. According to the veterinarian, the animal was reported to have\nfallen earlier that day from a climbing structure. Despite intensive care and initial success in reviving the animal, the\nsloth become unresponsive and was finally euthanized.\nThe animal was submitted for necropsy. The ultimate cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to\nthe head, most likely resulting from the fall. Additional significant findings included severe emaciation, indications of\nchronic stress, and older bruising to the body wall that was not associated with the current trauma nor the CPR\nused during treatment. The results were found to be consistent with mishandling, neglect and ignorance of animal\ncare. The licensee's lack of knowledge of the species led to the deteriorating health of the sloth, which may have\ncontributed to the animal's demise.\nAll licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the\nspecies they maintain."
