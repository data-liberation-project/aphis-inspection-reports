There were approximately 6 guinea pigs with wounds on the back.

The wounds varied in size from pinpoint to 2\ninches in length and some were scabbed or bleeding. The licensee was treating the wounds with a topical spray but it had\nexpired in 2022.\nMasses under the chin and wounds on the back can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall\nhealth and well-being of the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications.
