The mats covered approximately 1/3 of the hair on the back side of the dog's\nlegs from the rump down to the hocks. The dog apparently had loose stools at some point but the feces in the\nenclosure at the time of inspection appeared to have fairly normal consistency. The licensee was unaware that the\ndog had loose stools previously and had not noticed the fecal matter on the dog's hind end until the inspection.\nDried, fecal material in hair coats poses a health risk for the animals, especially since they tend to lick their hair to\ngroom themselves. The licensee must remove all the dried fecal material from this dog's coat and ensure that all\ndogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
