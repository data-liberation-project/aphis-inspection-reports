There is a depressed area on the neck approximately 0.75\"X0.24\" in area\nthat is yellow to tan in color with thick yellow material crusted over it. The animal does not bear weight on the right front\nlimb when walking; it actively turns to hide its wound, away from observers. The hamster hunches while sitting, with the\nright forelimb held inward and upward close to the chest; it exhibits squinting and holds its ears backward, with the\nmargins curled inward. The licensee stated that she treated the wound with Neosporin ointment and presented the tube to\nthe inspector. The tube was smudged with brown material and the expiration date reads 07/2019. There is no provision in\nthe Program of Veterinary care for the licensee to perform this treatment, and the license told the inspector she did not\nconsult with the veterinarian regarding the animal's condition. As the wound appeared significant and the animal\ndemonstrated signs of pain and lameness, the inspector requested the licensee call the veterinarian immediately for\ninstructions; the licensee also texted photos to the veterinary at that time. The veterinary clinic advised the licensee to\nbring the animal to the clinic in the morning.\nFailure to promptly seek and follow the advice of the attending veterinarian when animals are observed to be sick or\ninjured can result in their prolonged suffering and/or death.
