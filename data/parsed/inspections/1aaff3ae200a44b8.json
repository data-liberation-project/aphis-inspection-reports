There is a bare patch on the right hip towards the base of the tail that is approximately 1 inch by 2\ninches in size. The skin exposed is a normal pink in color with no visual scabs or injuries. Adjacent to this area of\nhair loss are two quarter-sized swollen hairless bumps along the spine that have a lumpy appearance and typical\npink skin color. Facility staff stated that the bare patch was observed about a week ago but the two quarter-sized\nraised lumps had not yet been observed. However, there is no written documentation noting observations for this\nanimal, facility staff have not communicated this health issue to the attending veterinarian and no veterinary care\nhas been administered.\nFailure to treat veterinary issues can lead to the condition worsening or cause pain, other negative health effects or\ndeath of the animal. This deer must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnoses, treatment and\nrecommended follow-up based on the attending veterinarian's instructions. Documentation must be maintained by\nthe licensee on any evaluations, diagnosis and treatment provided and be made available for review by the\ninspector upon request. Correct by May 27, 2015."

Facility staff stated that the bare patch was observed about a\nweek ago but the two quarter-sized raised lumps were identified by the inspector. There is no written documentation\nnoting observations for this animal and the condition has reportedly changed since the initial observation of the\nhealth issue by facility staff suggesting that daily observation, which would include assessing the health of the\nanimals, is not adequate. Also noted above, facility staff have not communicated this health issue to the attending\nveterinarian and therefore no veterinary care has been administered.\nLack of close daily observation of animals can lead to health issues not being identified and promptly communicated\nto the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided in a timely manner. This can lead\nto the condition worsening or cause pain, other negative effects or death of the animal. The licensee must develop\nand maintain a system of daily observation so that health issues can be identified, that frequent and direct\ncommunication of health issues to the attending veterinarian occurs and ensure that it is corrected in a timely\nmanner to provide for the health and wellbeing of the animals.
