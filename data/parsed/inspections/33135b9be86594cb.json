Following these procedures, the macaque was\ntransported to the imaging suit to test the fluoroscopy unit.

When\nthe laboratory personnel identified the incident, a report was immediately submitted to the IACUC.\n- In August 2023, laboratory personnel reported to the IACUC that a member of the laboratory completed animal work\nunder Protocol 803984, prior to approval. On February 15, 2023, the IACUC approved NCV assessments as a procedure\non Protocol 803984.

The technician left one lock off the front door of the enclosure. The cynomolgus macaque was able to open the\nfront door and climb out of the enclosure\n.\nThe enrichment technician exited the room and called the facility manager and behaviorist for assistance.
