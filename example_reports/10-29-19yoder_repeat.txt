2.126(b)                    REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at
11:30am-12:00pm on 29-OCT-19.
The inspector tried to make contact at the home and the facility.  The inspector called the number on file and left a
message for the Licensee.  The inspector honked their horn and waited in the driveway for 30 minutes before
leaving the premise.  The Licensee's wife called later in the day and confirmed that no one was available at the time
of the inspectors visit for inspection.
