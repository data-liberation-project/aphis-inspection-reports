3.80(a)(2)(9) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Surfaces inside the enclosures for non-human primates should be maintained so that they can be readily cleaned
and sanitized, and should be replaced or repaired when worn or soiled.
Whereas significant repairs and maintenance have been completed on non-human primate enclosures during the
last two years, the following were observed in non-human primate enclosures at the time of inspection:
A.) Lemurs - Wall in outside enclosure has an area with exposed construction paper and peeling stucco-like
material.

B.) Tamarinds - (cid:19) Paint missing from metal perches and grating.

C.) Squirrel Monkeys - Paint missing and possibly peeling from ceiling, metal perches, and grating.
D.) Siamang - Paint missing from metal surfaces in the indoor night-house enclosure.

E.) Chimpanzees (cid:19) Paint missing and peeling from metal grating walls of outdoor enclosure, and evidence of some
rust.
Non-human primates that are exposed to surfaces that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected due to
deterioration, or that are exposed to debris from peeling paint or decomposing surfaces, could suffer ill effects to
their health and well-being. Surfaces should be maintained in good repair, free of debris, and such that they can be
adequately cleaned and disinfected.

3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. Whereas some significant improvements have been made to the perimeter fence, it still does not meet the
requirements specified in 3.127 (d). Plans to improve the fence were postponed due to a delay in an expansion
project. The fence should be at least eight feet in height, due to the presence of animals defined as dangerous
animals, and it should prevent animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing secondary
containment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The following shortfalls were noted:

A.) There are portions of the fence that fall short of the six feet minimum height requirement, and other portions
that fall short of the eight feet minimum height requirement.

B.) There are still some gaps under the fence-line of five or more inches that could allow animals to pass under the
fence.

C.) There are some gates where gaps exist underneath or between the gates of five or more inches.

D.) There are places in the back elk/bison enclosure where there is debris or trees and bushed piled up against, or
encroaching on the fence, reducing its effective height.

E.) There are multiple locations where the fence is damaged, with fallen barbed-wire, missing structural support, or
missing fence boards.

F.) There is vertical bar fencing near with four inch gaps between the bars, which could allow animals to pass
through or under the fence. Additional there are two turn-styles with similar large gaps.

G.) The primary enclosure for the elk and bison, and the veterinary hospital do not have a perimeter fence.
These observations are examples of where the perimeter fence does not meet the standards specified. The fence
should consistently meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. This facility should have a
perimeter fence which adequately prevents people and animals from passing through or under the fence, and which
can also act as a secondary containment system for the animals on exhibit. This facility houses animals such as big
cats, bears, hyenas, and elephants, and therefore the perimeter fence should be at least eight feet in height, and it
should either fully enclose the whole premises, or the areas where these animals are housed, with a perimeter
fence measuring at least six feet in height for the other animals. There should be a separation of at least three feet
between the animals on exhibit and the perimeter fence, and it should preclude contact with people or animals. The
fence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here. Failure to
meet these standards could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.

An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative on 1/9/15.
