ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Bella the fox was euthanized on 10/18/2016 according to facility records. On 9/9/2016 staff reported that the fox
"Had trouble getting through doorway to inside cage." No subsequent daily observations were recorded after that
date until the date of euthanasia.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their well-being as well as direct and frequent communication with the
attending veterinarian regarding health issues are necessary to ensure that the animals at the facility receive timely
and adequate veterinary care. Documentation of health problems, communications with the attending veterinarian,
and treatment of those problems are necessary to ensure that the facility is providing appropriate monitoring and
treatment of sick and injured animals. A system should be in place to ensure that the facility keeps appropriate daily
observations of animal health problems and treatments.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
