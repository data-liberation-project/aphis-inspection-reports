2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
On 29-July-2022, this individual reached out to the inspector by phone about transporting approximately 18 dogs from a
USDA licensed facility to several rescues, which could not be named at the time of this call. After talking with the
inspector, it was determined, they need to be licensed as a class “B” license with USDA. They negotiate or arrange for the
purchase, sale, or transport of the animals in commerce. This individual stated they understood and would get licensed
before conducting regulated activity. They sent a text to the inspector shortly after this phone call stating, “Thank you for
explaining everything to me today. I’m definitely getting licensed.”

On 1-August-2022, the inspector found evidence that this individual had received 11 dogs from the USDA licensed facility
on 31-July-2022. The inspector visited the site but was unable to contact this individual at that time. Shortly after leaving
the site, the individual called the inspector, and the following information was collected from that phone call. They
transported 11 dogs; 2 dogs were approximately 10-12 weeks of age; 2 dogs were approximately 1 year old and 7 dogs
were approximately 6 years or older per this individual. The individual kept one older adult dog as a personal pet and
transported the other 10 to another person. This individual refused the inspector several times to provide any information
about the person who received the 10 dogs during phone calls on 1-August-2022 and 3-August-2022. The individual
stated that they understood what they did was wrong, but they are unwilling to get anyone else in trouble.


Failure to be licensed as a class “B” license does not ensure the animals were transported in an appropriate and humane
manner. It also does not ensure that APHIS officials can track the movement of animals involved in regulated activity.

The individual must become licensed with a class “B” license before conducting regulated activity.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
