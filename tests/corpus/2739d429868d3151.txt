Indoor housing facilities.
The lights were turned off and the blinds were closed in the cat room inside the house leaving the room and cats in the
dark. The licensee turned on one light when we entered the room but does not regularly open the blinds or have the lights
on during the day. Animal areas must be provided a regular diurnal light cycle of either natural or artificial light for the
wellbeing of the animals.

Correct by ensuring that either the lights are on during day light hours or natural sunlight can come into the room to
provide a normal light cycle for the health of the animals.

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two of the three outdoor cat enclosures are constructed with wood permeable to moisture and cannot be properly
cleaned or sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed wood. The enclosed shelter box and
wooden ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. The second enclosure with a corresponding shelter box and
resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed wood. Surfaces permeable to moisture cannot be


properly cleaned and/or sanitized as contaminated material can penetrate into the surfaces. In addition, these structures
and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they can be easily removed once they become worn or soiled.
Having surfaces in contact with the animals that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can expose the cats to
unnecessary disease hazards.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of materials
that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become
worn or soiled.
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Excreta is not being removed from the outdoor cat primary enclosures daily or frequently enough from the indoor cat
enclosures to reduce disease hazards and odors. All three outdoor cat enclosures, housing a total of 10 adult cats, have
large accumulations of excreta mixed in with the mulch and dirt floor. Most of the feces present are dry and did not occur
within the last 24 hours. Inside, there are three cat enclosures, housing 8 adult cats. All litter boxes had accumulations of
urine and feces. According to the licensee, the litter boxes were last dumped 4 days ago and are due to be completely
dumped again. However, upon entering the room, a strong odor of excrement was immediately detected by inspectors.
Excreta accumulation inside primary enclosures can lead to increased disease hazards or discomfort for the animals,
odors, and/or attract unwanted pests.
Correct by removing excreta daily from primary enclosures or as often as necessary to prevent the excessive
accumulation of feces, to prevent soiling of the cats in the primary enclosure, and to reduce disease hazards, insects,
pests, and odors.
3.11(b) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


Enclosures for the domestic cats outside are not being sanitized once every two weeks. The two, wooden, outdoor cat
enclosures have multiple surfaces such as the ladder ramps, surrounding wood of the hide box, walls, and shelves that
are discolored yellowish-brown and have accumulation of brown debris. The ceilings in the shelter boxes and enclosures
have collections of dust and fur. The plastic carriers and furniture within all three outdoor enclosures are covered in dirt
and discolored.
Infrequent and improper sanitation of primary enclosures exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors,
insects and pests. Adequate cleaning and sanitization are critical for eliminating disease risks.
Correct by sealing all wood surfaces, cleaning, and sanitizing all primary enclosures at least once every 2 weeks and
using one of the approved methods listed in 3.11(b)(3).
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Three fox enclosures remain in disrepair and continue to pose a risk of injury to the animals inside. Along the back fence
the wooden red fox enclosure, the fennec fox enclosure directly adjacent to the pig enclosure, and the kit fox enclosure
have gaps in the flooring that could cause an animal to injure themselves or become entrapped. The floors of the
enclosures are comprised of either wire mesh or concrete paving stones. In all of the enclosures, the dirt has eroded out
from underneath the flooring, leaving wire mesh exposed or causing the concrete pavers to shift, creating gaps in the
flooring. In the red fox enclosure, concrete pavers have shifted exposing cracks around 1-2” wide along the front of the
enclosure. In the fennec fox enclosure, along the left and right walls, the underlying dirt has shifted, causing the wire
bottom of the enclosure to become exposed. The wire mesh in the enclosure is approximately 1” x 1.5” and large enough
for a smaller paw to fall through. In the kit fox enclosure, the floor has eroded directly underneath the food and water dish,
leaving behind wire mesh suspended over a hole. At the time of inspection new leaves and pine needles were lying on top
of the mesh but the erosion underneath the flooring had not been fixed. The wire mesh in the kit fox enclosure is


approximately 1” x 1” and the exposed area is approximately 6-7” wide and 1.5’ long.
Flooring with gaps, exposed wire mesh with openings larger than the animal’s paw, and unstable cement pavers can
cause serious injuries and pose a risk of entrapment.
Correct by ensuring all enclosures are structurally sound and are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain the animals.
3.125(d) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Pieces of shredded tarp are present throughout the metal red fox enclosure. The foxes are actively pulling in the bottom of
plastic tarps that are hung along the side walls of their enclosure. Every tarp has shredded edges and long strands of
plastic strings are strewn throughout the enclosure.
Trash and debris inside primary enclosures can lead to increased risk of injury and illness from potential ingestion or
entrapment, and can also attract pests and vermin.
Correct by ensuring waste and debris is removed and disposed of from primary enclosures to minimize risk of injury,
illness and/or disease.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is an accumulation of feces present in all fox enclosures that is not being removed on a routine basis. The dirt floor
of each fox enclosure is comprised of a mix of dirt, feces, leaves, pine needles, fur, and mulch. The feces are difficult to
identify among the flooring but those found are dried completely and appear to have been present for a long time.
According to the licensee there is no set frequency that she cleans out the flooring of the fox enclosures and removes
waste. Typically all enclosures under go a “deep cleaning” and stripping about twice a year.
Large volumes of fecal matter and waste that animals cannot easily avoid in their primary enclosure can lead to soiling of


the animal and act as source of odor and serious disease hazards which are detrimental to the animal’s health.
Correct by removing excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained within and to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
