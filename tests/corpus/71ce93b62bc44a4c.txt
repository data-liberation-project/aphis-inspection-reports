2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On August 30, 2016 a visitor's finger was bitten by a raccoon on exhibit. The raccoon was humanely euthanized in
order to test it for rabies as a required precautionary measure for the injured person's health. Review of the exhibit
during inspection revealed that the primary enclosure of the raccoon could be touched from the public side of the
exhibit by reaching over the public barrier. Sufficient distance and barriers are necessary to prevent public contact
with animals and to decrease the risk of harm to the public and exhibited animals. For the safety of the animals and
the public, ensure that adequate barriers and distances are in place between exhibited animals and the general
viewing public.
Correction: Maintain correct from this date forward.
Note: The raccoon enclosure was not being used for animal exhibit during inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
