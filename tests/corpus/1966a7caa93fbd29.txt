FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* One elevated plywood resting platform was observe to be in a state of deterioration. An estimated one foot
circular hole exposing a jagged, splintered, roughened edge was observed. Two bobcats are in contact with the
affected platform located in outdoor housing. Deterioration of wood surfaces can affect the structural integrity of the
platform. Potential unsanitary conditions exists if any surface is not maintained on a regular basis. Splintered wood
if accidentally ingested could create a negative impact on the health of the animals. A roughened surface could
potentially harbor disease causing agents or debris which could create a negative impact on the health of the
animals. Surfaces in the animal enclosures should be maintained in good repair in order to facilitate appropriate
husbandry. The hole in the platform could cause potential injury if left uncovered. All surfaces must be maintained
on a regular basis. The licensee must ensure that all outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and hall
be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 11/6/17.
