Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were greater than 6 expired medications on the licensee’s medication shelf including one medication that expired in
2021. Expired medications include metoclopramide, multiple bottles of ivermectin, dewormer and a box of Heartguard.
There was also an open bottle of dewormer with flies on the mouth of the bottle, and loose pills on the table.

The medications that are expired are no longer an appropriate method to treat, prevent, or control diseases and parasites.

All expired medication should be removed so they are not inadvertently used on the animals.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Dog tag #10 “Betzy”, an adult female Shih Tzu, approx. 4 years of age, showed swelling under the jaw roughly the size of
a golf ball that was soft and pliable. The skin on right side, from approx. the neck to over her shoulder was reddened. On
the left lower side of this swelling there was a reddened wound like area. There were also some linear scabs on her left
chest. These issues were noticeable from outside the enclosure. The dog appeared bright, alert and responsive and did


not appear to be in any discomfort. This was not observed by the licensee prior to inspection.
Animals must be observed daily by a facility representative, and accurate and timely information on problems of animal
health should be conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Licensee needs to consult with the attending veterinarian or Program of veterinary care regarding this problem and follow
the guidance.

3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
There was rust found on the wire of approximately 5 primary enclosure doors, holding 10 dogs and the hinges on the
converted shed, holding 8 dogs.

Surfaces that the dogs come in contact with must be free from rust as it cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized.

These affected structures need to be corrected so that the dogs are in contact with surfaces that are rust free and able to
be sanitized.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


*The trailer structure that housed 29 adult and 33 juvenile dogs had built up waste under the enclosures, food scattered in
the grooves of the floor, and dirt and debris on the table used to prepare medications.

The premises must be kept clean and free of accumulated trash, waste and discarded matter. This is important to protect
the animals, facilitate proper husbandry and reduce or eliminate the breeding or living area for vermin.

*There was evidence of flies in the trailer structure based on flies noted in a water dish, on an open bottle of dewormer, a
cable holding the water hose, and multiple areas showing fly debris/excreta. No method of insect prevention was evident
at the time of inspection.

An effective program for control of insects is important to promote the health and well-being of the animals and to prevent
contamination.

The structure needs to be cleaned more frequently to prevent buildup of unused food, waste material, and dirt. A program
needs to be implemented to reduce or eliminate the flies and prevent other vermin.
