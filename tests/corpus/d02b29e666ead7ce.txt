2.131(d)(3)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility currently allows public interaction with big cat cubs aged 8-12 weeks old. The current procedure is to
allow small groups of park visitors to enter the enclosure with the cub, accompanied by 1 or 2 park attendants.
However, the attendants do not maintain any form of physical control over the cubs. Big cat cubs of this age are
able to move quickly and can inflict harm on nearby persons. On 22 October 2014 a park visitor interacting with an
uncontrolled 12 week old lion cub was bitten or scratched, and later sought medical attention for the injury.
Facilities that allow public interaction of cubs must have trained attendants present, and maintain physical control of
the animal to minimize the risk of harm to the cub and to members of the public.
Correct from this point forward.
This was a focused inspection pertaining to an official complaint.
