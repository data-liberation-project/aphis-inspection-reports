2.33(b)(5) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During a Semi-Annual Inspection in April 2019, IACUC members discovered guinea pigs used for Protocol GB that had a
surgical procedure performed two days prior. However, there were no or insufficient surgical and post-operative care
records, as required by protocol. There was no indication that one guinea pig received post-operative analgesics. The
IACUC reviewed records over a period of time for the research group and noted a lack of consistent daily observations of
the animals. The daily observation was not performed for one post-surgical guinea pig for two (2) days. On the
subsequent observation, the guinea was sick and was euthanized two (2) days later. The research group did not follow
established surgical recordkeeping requirements and post-operative care of the guinea pigs as outlined in the protocol
which may have led to unnecessary pain and distress. The facility must maintain programs of adequate veterinary care
that includes guidance on post procedural care to principal investigators and all personnel involved in the care of animals
to ensure pre- and post-surgical procedures are implemented to minimize distress and suffering of the guinea pigs.
Correction: The IACUC established and implemented an effective corrective action plan that included intensive training.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
