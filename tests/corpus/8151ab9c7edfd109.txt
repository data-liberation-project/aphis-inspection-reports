Within the outdoor housing facility there is a white male American Eskimo dog microchip (0A01722738) with injuries
to its muzzle and right ear that was caused by a recent dog fight. There is a laceration that is bleeding on the dog's
muzzle that is approximately 1 inch in length. The skin is pulled back enough to see the blood and underlying tissue.
The dog also has a tear or split on its right ear that is bleeding. From the tip of the ear the tear is approximately 1.25
inches in length. The licensee stated the dog was in a fight with a male Wheaten Terrier and were heard fighting
earlier.
The open wounds can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the
health and well being of the dog. The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate diagnosis
and treatment administrated and documented. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems,
diagnosis and treatments must be made available to the inspector upon request.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure; construction.
Within the outdoor housing facility there are two dog runs adjacent to each other, one containing three Wheaten
Terriers and the other containing three American Eskimo dogs. A male Wheaten Terrier and a male American
Eskimo dog were able to be in direct contact with each other and fight through the openings in the fence. The male
Wheaten Terrier caused injuries to the American Eskimo dog. Injuries or death can occur when non-compatible
dogs are able to be in contact with each other.
Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other
animals from entering.
