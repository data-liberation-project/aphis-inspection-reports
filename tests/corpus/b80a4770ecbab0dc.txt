Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, the licensee has 10 sugar gliders. There were 207 sugar gliders on the inventory at the last
inspection in 2019. The licensee stated most of the colony was sold or donated in early 2020 to ensure compliance with
county animal laws. There are no records of disposition for the animals. Records of animals sold or donated should be
maintained to facilitate the tracking of animals used in regulated activities. Accurate records that fully disclose the sales
and donations of animals must be kept and maintained by the licensee to facilitate the regulatory process and to ensure
compliance with the animal welfare regulations. The records must be updated to include the required information for
recordkeeping as outlined in the Animal Welfare regulations. Correct by June 7, 2021
