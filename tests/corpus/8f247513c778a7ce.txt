ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female bloodhound “Emily” (ID not obtained) was observed to be scratching around her ears and neck and shaking
her head while sitting down. On examination she had small red, raised bumps covering the inner and outer ear
flaps. Both ear canals were red, moist, inflamed and filled with brown, waxy discharge. The skin of the neck around
both ears was red, and inflamed with hair loss and patches of dark thickened skin.
Red, inflamed ears and skin can be painful, cause discomfort and lead to the spread of infection, affecting the
health and well-being of the dog. The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment
administered. The licensee called her attending veterinarian during the inspection and made an appointment for the
dog to be seen the following day (August 1, 2018).
This non-compliant item was corrected prior to the exit briefing. The dog listed above was evaluated by a
veterinarian and treated per the veterinarian's instructions.
This was a focused inspection. The full inspection could not be completed due to extenuating circumstances.
The inspection was conducted by Katie Steneroden with the facility representative.
The exit interview was conducted with the facility representative via phone by Heather Cole on August 1, 2018.
