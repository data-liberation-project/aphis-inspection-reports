3.80(a)(2)(iii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In July 2016 a macaque escaped from its primary enclosure and sustained traumatic injuries to its hand when it
interacted with another NHP that was contained inside another primary enclosure. The injured macaque was
promptly evaluated by the clinical veterinarian and underwent surgery to repair the wounds. The macaque healed
well from the injuries, and none of the other NHPs in the room were injured. It was determined that the NHP was
able to escape from its primary enclosure because personnel had failed to secure the side door of the enclosure
following cage change earlier in the day.
Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain
the non-human primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
The research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the event to
OLAW, and implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent recurrence including hands-on retraining of all
animal caretakers on the proper cage change procedure and the proper method of securing all of the locking
mechanisms of the enclosures. No additional incidents have occurred.
This item has been appropriately addressed by the research facility and it has been corrected.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 9/12/16 and 9/13/16. Exit interview held 9/13/16 on-site with facility representatives.
