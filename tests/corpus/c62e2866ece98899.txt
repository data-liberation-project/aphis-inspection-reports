2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, a seven year old female Yorkshire Terrier named Lizzy Sue (#78) has buildup of brown/tan
material, adhering to ¾ of the upper teeth. A brown male Dachshund (#52) has a buildup of brown/tan material
adhering to ¾ of the upper teeth. Dental issues can cause pain, lead to infection, and lead to pain when eating,
which can lead to inadequate calorie intake.
A white female Chihuahua, with no identification, has a lesion on the front left paw. The lesion is red and inflamed
with no hair. This can lead to infection due to inadequate veterinary care. The licensee must have these animals
evaluated by a veterinarian to correct the issues and provide documentation of completion. The licensee must
maintain a program of veterinary care in order to prevent, control and treat diseases and injuries.
