2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
(e) A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity
involving animals, must contain the following:
(2) A rationale for involving animals, and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers of animals to be
used;
*** The protocol (cid:28)R216(cid:29) does not provide an adequate explanation for the proposed number of animals to be used.
It states that no more than four animals will be purchased over the three year period, and that no more than eight
will be maintained under this protocol, but there is no explanation as to how these numbers were derived, or how
they relate to the data to be collected.
The IACUC is tasked with the responsibility of assuring that the PI has provided an adequate rationale for animal
use, including the numbers of animals to be used. Failure to assure that animal numbers are appropriate could
result in unnecessary animal use, which would be contrary to the goals of the Animal Welfare Act. Protocol
proposals should include a rationale for animal use that clearly and logically accounts for the proposed number of
animals to be used, by including factors such as how the numbers were generated, and why the numbers are
necessary and / or statistically significant.
To be corrected by 4/18/14.
This inspection occurred on 3/12/14 and 3/13/14. An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
