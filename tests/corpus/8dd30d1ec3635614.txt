Health certification and identification.
The licensee purchased two red handed tamarins on June 5, 2022 and transported them from Florida to Louisiana without

ensure that the animals are evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and are free of any infectious disease or physical
abnormality which would endanger the nonhuman primate, other animals or endanger public health. Dealers must not
transport any non human primates in commerce unless accompanied by a health certificate issued by a licensed
veterinarian no more than 10 days prior to the transport.

provisions which address the social needs, environmental enrichment, and psychological well being of the species


handled by the facility. The plan must be in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and under the

licensee must provide a developed plan approved by their attending veterinarian that addresses the nonhuman primate’s
social and environmental needs.
