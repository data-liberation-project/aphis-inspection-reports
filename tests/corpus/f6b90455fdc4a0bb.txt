CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection at EWR, there was one dog ,on airway bill # 125-4770 1614, that had originated from
London Heathrow, where the consignor did not provide any instructions for feeding during transit, nor did they
indicate the last time the animal was offered food.
Upon accepting an animal for transport, the carrier must ensure that the consignor has provided the required
information regarding feeding, specifically there must be a certification from the consignor in writing that the dog or
cat was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the carrier, to include the time and date the
animal was last fed and the specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for a 24-hour period. This
certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a manner that makes it easily
noticed and read. Instructions for no food are not acceptable unless directed by the attending veterinarian, in which
case this should be clearly visible on the certification.
Failure to ensure that this information is collected and attached to the carrier could be detrimental to the health and
well-being of the animal in transit.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
The dog, on airway bill # 125-4770 1614, had access to water, but there was no food receptacle securely attached
inside the dog's primary enclosure. Transporter must ensure that a food receptacle, in addition to a water
receptacle, is available and securely attached to the primary enclosure.
Failure to provide a food receptacle could be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animal in transit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
