2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The previous attending veterinarian (AV) employed by the former owner of the business had not been retained
under a formal arrangement when the business was bought by the new owner in late March 2018. Formerly, the AV
visited quarterly but the last documented regularly scheduled visit was on April 3, 2018. No new contract or new
attending veterinarian was employed or consulted for veterinary care thereafter. The previous AV was called in the
early morning of April 18, 2019 and confirmed that there was no existing current formal arrangement and stated that
it is the licensee’s responsibility to contact her to schedule regular visits and veterinary care.

Each dealer shall employ an AV under formal arrangements which shall include a written program of veterinary care
and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Ten male “Robo” hamsters were found to have large open wounds located behind their heads on the back of their
necks. They were all in the same holding bin containing 14 male Roborovskii hamsters. Facility representatives
said that this was just noticed yesterday but a veterinarian was not informed or called and no treatment
documentation or medications were presented when asked for during inspection.
Appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat injuries and diseases of animals must be utilized to
provide adequate veterinary care. A program of veterinary care must be in place to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries for the health and well-being of the animals housed in the facility and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Ensure employees are instructed to make daily observations
and report any and all animals that show signs of abnormal behavior, sickness, or injury to the attending
veterinarian to provide for their health and welfare requirements.
