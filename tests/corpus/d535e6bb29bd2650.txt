HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On January 6, 2015, an adult male siamang named "Brian" loosened and/or removed several hog rings which
secured the divider mesh in his outdoor exhibit from the frame. Brian was then able to push underneath the divider
mesh and attack the two adult male black lemurs (named "Buddy" and "Junior") in the adjacent outdoor exhibit area.
Both lemurs received significant trauma and were transported to the veterinary hospital for examination and
surgery. One male lemur named "Buddy" survived the siamang attack after surgery (amputation of half of his tail)
and treatment for multiple bite wound lacerations. The male lemur named "Junior" also had surgery and treatment
for his wounds, but died on January 10, 2015 due to complications from his injuries. "Buddy" has been moved to
another enclosure and it was stated that he will not be placed in the exhibit adjacent to the siamang exhibit.
The spacing (at approximately 12-15 inch intervals) and type of attachment device (hog rings) used to secure the
divider mesh to the frame in the outdoor exhibit area between these two different species of primates appears to
have been a factor this incident. The male siamang was able to loosen and/or remove several hog rings and push
underneath the divider mesh in order to attack the two lemurs in the adjacent exhibit. All enclosures housing
non-human primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species housed
inside them, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. This is a Critical Noncompliance
Item (NCI).
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel.
