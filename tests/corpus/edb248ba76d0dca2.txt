2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A 9-10 year old goat named (cid:28)Romeo(cid:29) has an emaciated body condition. The backbone is visible and there is no fat
cover felt over the spinous or transverse processes of the spine which are all easily grasped in the hand. There is a
hollow appearance to the flank area as the transverse processes create a (cid:28)shelf(cid:29) over the flank. The ribs and are
visible and the pelvic bones are prominent. The licensee states he takes the goat up to the garage for free choice
sweet feed daily. The goat was examined by the attending veterinarian (AV) for a thin body condition on 19 March
2016 but has not been examined since that time despite no improvement in the body condition. The licensee states
he has spoken with the AV since then and has had a fecal sample checked for parasites but does not have any
documentation regarding this. Thin or emaciated body condition indicates a medical problem and/or insufficient
nutrition.
To be corrected by: The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian by 29 July 2016 in order
to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* One goat crawled through the enclosure fence during the inspection and was loose on the facility property outside
of the animal enclosure. Animals who are not contained securely in the housing enclosure can be injured or lost.
* There is section of enclosure fencing that has separated from the fence post creating a gap. The gap is large
enough that it could entrap an animals(cid:25) head and could cause possible injury.
The facility must ensure that all housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. 3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* There is water running out of one of the water receptacles and has started to collect in the outdoor enclosure. The
standing water is brownish in color in places and there is green algae growing in some of it. Standing water and
mud can cause odors, attract pests, and may lead to an increase in disease transmission.
A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.
To be correct by, 2 August 2016.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* There is a perimeter fence around the enclosure housing the two camels. This perimeter fence measures at
different areas: 51 inches, 48 inches, 55 inches and 71 inches. In areas along the top of the fence, between the
posts, the top wire is sagging. The top wire of the perimeter fence is not fastened to the post in some areas. The
outdoor enclosure, housing the two camels, must have a perimeter fence at least six feet high (including all gates)
be a minimum distance of three feet from the primary enclosure fence, and not contain gaps for a person or animals
to go through or under the fence. As of the last inspection, this non-compliant item has not been corrected.
A perimeter fence will provide protection to the camels by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence also functions as a
secondary containment system for the camels in the facility. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high for
non-dangerous animals must be approved in writing by the APHIS administrator.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
* The barn, housing two camels, four goats, four llamas and one sheep, had an excessive accumulation of fecal
waste. This can cause strong odors, disease hazards and contamination risks for the animals.
* In the area the goats and sheep have excess too had a large pile of manure waste. The pile of waste was
approximately 3 feet long by 2 feet wide by 21/2 feet high.
The excessive accumulation of fecal waste must be removed more often or more frequently. This will preventcontamination, minimize disease hazards and odors for the animals.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
* The licensee brings a thin goat up to the garage so it can have free access to sweet feed without interference from
the other animals. The licensee stated that he leaves the goat unsecured and unattended in the garage to eat and
wander. The garage is storage for materials and equipment one would expect in a garage but could be hazardous
to animals if this area is to be also used for animal access (small engines, paint, chemicals, yard equipment, and
insulation). Access to these materials can cause injury to the animals.
* On the ground in various areas of the outdoor enclosure, there were strands of orange bale twine in the dirt on the
ground. Possible injury can be cause to the animals from chewing or ingesting the twine.
The licensee must ensure that the premises is kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Accumulated trash must be places in designated areas and cleaned as necessary to protect the health of the
animals.
