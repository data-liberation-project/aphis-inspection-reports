ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A labeled bottle of medication was observed in the medicine cabinet in the breeder building at the time of
inspection. This medication is used by the licensee periodically on the dogs. However this medication is not listed
on the Program of veterinary care. The licensee states that the attending veterinarian is aware that he uses this
medication at certain times for certain conditions on the dogs. The program of veterinary care must include all
medications kept at the facility and include instructions on how they are administered and during what conditions
they will be given. The program of veterinary care must be updated to include this medication.
