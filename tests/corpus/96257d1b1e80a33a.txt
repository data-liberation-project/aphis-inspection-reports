Housing facilities, general.
On Thursday, December 2nd, 2021, seven chimpanzees were involved in an escape from their primary enclosure.
Initially, three chimps were seen by staff on the roof of the indoor enclosure. Escape protocols were enacted, and staff
was secured in safe rooms and reported their safety status to the proper authorities. There was a total of seven chimps
that exited their containment during the incident. All chimpanzees were safely recovered via sedation or enticement into
their bedrooms without further sedation. The escape was determined by a breach in the skylight wire mesh panel in their
bedroom area that had not been secured appropriately. The sliding wire mesh panel can be locked or bolted shut below
the skylight cover and the mesh panels serve to secure the opening. Since the incident, it was determined that
maintenance staff did not place these bolts to protect the skylight cover from chimpanzee access. On Friday December
3rd, all skylight locking points were assessed and ensured their security.
Animals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Gaining outside
access could result in animal or human injury. Housing facilities for non human primates shall be structurally sound and
maintained to protect and contain the animals securely.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.


A 46 year old male chimpanzee, Midge, arrived to the facility in May 2019 and was introduced to a group of 12
chimpanzees over a total of 4 days between August 27 and September 9 2019. Midge responded well in his group until
August 2021 where animal care staff reported that he showed signs of diminished mobility. Veterinary staff determined it
was in his best interest to be temporarily single housed.

On August 16th, veterinary staff recommended that Midge continued to be single housed due to suspected aggression
from his group mates. While single housed, he was treated for his medical conditions and began to show clinical
improvement; however, he continued to be singly housed.

In October, the behavior team initiated the discussion of re-introducing Midge to his social group. The decision was not
unanimously supported by his animal care team due to aggression and compatibility concerns from his previous
groupmates. The behavior team made the final decision on re-introducing him to his former social group rather than
putting him into a new location or remaining singly housed.

The reintroduction took place over a 4 week span (October 18 – November 17th). Initially, the re introduction took place
without complications. Around November 12th, Midge began to show weakness and other signs of illness. The facility
teams began discussion of a contingency plan for Midge if necessary. On November 18th, there was aggressive
interaction directed at Midge from another groupmate that resulted in trauma. The next day, Midge succumbed to his
injuries and was found deceased in his enclosure.

Since this incident, the facility has been reviewing and revamping social introduction SOPs and evaluating the criteria for


separation of social groups. Compatibility of nonhuman primates must be determined in accordance with generally
accepted professional practices and observations under the direction of the attending veterinarian and be done so in a
manner that does not cause harm or discomfort to the animals. In the future, decisions for social dynamics must be under
the approval of the attending veterinarian.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Two chimpanzees (Huey a 31 year old male) and JoEllen (a 28 year old female) presented with acute signs of disease in
January 2022. Despite medical intervention, both animals expired within 24 hours of treatment. A necropsy was
performed on both animals and their deaths were attributable to infection with parasites via environmental contamination.

An analysis was performed in their enclosure that included soil and water sampling. The source of the parasites was
found in a muddy area that the chimpanzees have access to in their primary enclosure. The facility has since treated and
sanitized the area and made staff aware of adhering to strict biosecurity measures to prevent contamination. Areas such
as soil, gravel, sand and absorbent bedding must be properly sanitized to prevent disease and ensure the health and well
being of the animals.
