The IACUC approved an SOP that allowed for intermittent remote observation of the three hamsters. Due to the
pandemic, animal care staff were allowed to perform remote observation no more often than once every 48 hours. A dual

Correct by ensuring that daily in-person observation of each covered animal takes place from now on.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.

A follow-up discussion per telephone was held with the Research Regulatory Manager on 24 AUG 2022.
