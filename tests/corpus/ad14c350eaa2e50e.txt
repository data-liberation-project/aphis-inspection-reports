A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:05 PM on
12/03/2015. The inspector knocked on the front door of the residence several times and after no response called
the licensee. The licensee stated he was out of town and was unable to be present for an inspection. The licensee
also stated that an additional facility representative has been trained and authorized to be present during an
inspection process. However, this authorized person was not available at the time also.
