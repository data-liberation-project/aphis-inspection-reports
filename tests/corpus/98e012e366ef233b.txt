ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
According to the facility's records, November 26-30, 2015, the animal care staff did not conduct daily observations
on the hamsters being housed in the facility. On November 30th, it was observed that the animals did have
remaining food and water and there were no sick or injured animals. Daily observations of all animals should be
performed to properly assess the health and well-being of the animals. The facility conducted an investigation and
implemented corrective actions. The root cause was determined to be miscommunication between involved parties.
Since the implemented corrective actions have been in place there have not been any further incidents.
The facility reported the incident to the regulatory authorities as well as self-reported to USDA.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives on-site and via telephone.
Phone exit interview was conducted on October 26, 2016 with facility representative.
