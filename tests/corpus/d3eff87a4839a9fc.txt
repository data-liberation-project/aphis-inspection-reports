2.126(a)(1) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The facility owner refused to allow APHIS inspectors to conduct an inspection on 5 August 2021.

Shortly before inspectors arrived at the facility, the DOJ attorney attempted to contact the facility owner to ensure there
would be an adult present that could accompany inspectors through the facility. The facility owner had made it known on
social media that he was not in town. The facility owner informed the DOJ attorney that he was not available for an
inspection and that the inspectors would not be allowed to enter the premises to conduct an inspection.

Inspectors arrived at the facility at 12:04 PM on 5 August and attempted to make contact with a facility representative in
order to conduct an inspection of the facility. At approximately 2:00 pm a facility representative (owner’s adult son) came
out to speak with the inspectors. This representative made it clear that this was not a good time for an inspection as the
facility owner was in another state. He reiterated that the facility owner was refusing to allow him (the facility
representative) to accompany APHIS inspectors on an inspection. When inspectors asked the representative "are you
saying there is no way we can inspect today?”, he stated that the facility owner was not allowing him to accompany
inspectors for an inspection and that inspectors needed to schedule a day and time with the owner. Inspectors told the


representative that inspections must be unannounced. Inspectors also stated to the representative that a refusal to allow
inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act and will be cited on the inspection report.

Refusing to allow AHPIS inspectors access to inspect a facility prevents an assessment of the welfare of the animals at
the facility and prevents the Secretary from enforcing the Animal Welfare Act.

The facility owner must during business hours, allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business and inspect animals,
facilities, and records.

An exit interview was not conducted with the facility.
