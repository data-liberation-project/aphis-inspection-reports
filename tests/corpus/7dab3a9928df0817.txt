2.40(a)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, the Attending Veterinarian had visited the facility on 30 March 2022 to evaluate the tiger, but
was not allowed to and terminated the formal arrangement with the licensee. The current Program of Vet Care was
signed by the previous Attending Veterinarian and there has been no new formal arrangement with an Attending
Veterinarian, established by a regularly scheduled visit, written program and appropriate authority. Licensee reached out
to another vet, but does not have an Attending Veterinarian for the tigers present at the facility. A program of veterinary
care is essential for animal health and wellbeing. The veterinarian shall visit the premises and shall have the authority to
provide adequate veterinary care for those animals. Animals without adequate veterinary care may suffer from disease,
illness, malnutrition, or parasitism.

Correct by 3 June 2022 by establishing a program of veterinary care and following all instructions from the attending
veterinarian.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
