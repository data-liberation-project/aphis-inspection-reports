2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The facility lost five fawns this past year shortly after birth. According to the facility and attending veterinarian,
pathology results indicated that the fawns did not have adequate amounts of vitamin E in their diet, were emaciated
with high load of parasites. As the fawns would have been nursing, the vitamin E deficiency is with the female deer
who are receiving a grain produced for multiple hoof stock species not specialized for deer. The attending
veterinarian informed the facility they needed to add Vitamin E to the diet but the facility has not done so. The
facility needs to follow guidance for feeding required by the attending veterinarian to prevent future loss due to diet
deficiency.

3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
*** In the winter the refrigerator does not work to maintain adequate temperatures for perishable food items (ie, too
cold to defrost or freezing items). At the time of the inspection, raw chicken for the bobcat was again being thawed
in the food barn in a plastic bucket on the floor. There was a space heater next to the chicken to assist with the
thawing process. The current method of thawing food in the winter does not protect the meat from thawing in an
uneven manner. Thawing in this type of uncontrolled manner increases the chances of food spoilage and
contamination.
*** The facility has been transitioning the bear to a dry dog diet. Due to old age and dental issues, the bear is still
being offered left over restaurant food (donuts, muffins, pasta, bread and fries) to feed. These types of food are poor
nutritive value while containing excessive calories that contributes to the bear’s excessive weight. Obesity poses a
significant risk to the health of the animal and it is imperative that a diet that is nutritious and an appropriate quantity
is fed daily as directed by the attending veterinarian.
*** The diet prep area does not have running water in the winter. As a result, food prep items (knives, cutting
boards, bowls and food buckets) were left out with residual old food debris still on them. The manner of preparingand storing these food items leaves the potential for the food to become contaminated and hence not palatable,
wholesome or maintaining nutritive value for the overall health of the animals.
Licensee must ensure the food is wholesome, palatable and free from contamination.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** There is an accumulation of feces in the raccoon and the bear enclosure that needs to be removed. The piles of
feces in the bear enclosure cover both sides of the enclosure and do not enable the bear to move around freely
without having contact with the waste. Enclosures should be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animal and reduce odors and disease hazards.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
*** The facility currently employees one part time animal caretaker. There is no back up animal care employee who
is able to feed or care for the animals if this employee is unavailable to work. The work required to maintain
adequate husbandry and care of the animals is beyond the capacity of one part time employee as noted by the food
preparation and sanitation issues. The facility needs to ensure that a sufficient number of adequately trained
employees are in place to maintain a professional level of husbandry and care.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the board member in person and via phone. In addition, an
exit briefing was conducted with the animal caretaker via phone.
