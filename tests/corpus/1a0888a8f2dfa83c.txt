Exercise for dogs.
There was no written exercise plan available at time of inspection.

Exercise is important for the health and well-being of dogs and an exercise plan approved by the attending veterinarian
must be available to USDA officials at time of inspection.

Dealers, exhibitors, and research facilities must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with
the opportunity for exercise. In addition, the plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian. The plan must include
written standard procedures to be followed in providing the opportunity for exercise. The plan must be made available to
APHIS upon request.
