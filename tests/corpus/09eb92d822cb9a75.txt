HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the meat storage building the chest freezer that is being utilized for defrosting meat has insulation falling from
the top. When the employee opened the chest freezer an over-powering odor of rotting meat filled the room
causing the inspectors to step away. Dried blood was noticed along the bottom of the freezer and pieces of
insulation had fallen down from the top. The exposed insulation could fall onto the packages of meat being thawed
and possibly into the meat being fed to the animals.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage,
contamination,and vermin infestation.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In outdoor enclosure #9 (Indigo, Aramis), #13 (Outlaw, Reese), #14 (Cree, Denali) and #17 (Castiel, Tenali) the
wood shelters do not have wind/rain breaks at the entrance. Not providing a barrier from the elements in the form of
a wind and rain break can result in a dog becoming wet, uncomfortable and unable to maintain a safe body
temperature.
All dogs must be provided with shelter from the elements which includes wind and rain breaks at the entrance to
shelters.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.Outdoor enclosure #12 housing "Raja" and "Bella Raux" the plastic shelter (igloo) along the bottom below the
entrance is broken and the edges are chewed and worn. Because of the broken chewed area the top does not fit
on properly leaving a gap on the side of the shelter. Severely chewed and worn surfaces are no longer impervious
to moisture. These areas cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards for the dogs.
Outdoor enclosure #14 housing "Cree" and "Denali" the shelter in the front lockout area has many sections of the
wood that are excessively chewed and worn. Next to the dog shelter is a wood pallet standing up against the fence
with broken and worn boards. The pallet was removed from the enclosure during the time of inspection. Severely
chewed and worn surfaces are no longer impervious to moisture. These areas cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized which can lead to disease hazards for the dogs.
There are multiple enclosures in the outdoor facility that the wood on the dog shelters have not been sealed and are
not impervious to moisture. These dog shelters cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces in contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture. They must be maintained on a regular
basis and when they can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized they must be replaced when worn or soiled.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Enclosure #14 housing "Cree" and "Denali" the wood shelter has multiple areas where nail heads are protruding
outward. The animals could get caught on the nail heads and potentially cause an injury.
Enclosure # 13 housing "Outlaw" and "Reese" the wood shelter near the front of the enclosure has a large gap in
the roof. Employee stated that the roof slid backwards leaving the hole in the roof. If an animal jumps on the dog
shelter they could get caught in the opening and potentially become injured.
Primary enclosure must be kept in good repair so it protects the animals from injury.

FEEDING.
Inside the meat storage building the cutting board that is being utilized to cut and prepare the meat for the animalsis pitted, multiple knife cuts and the plastic cover is ripped/peeling leaving exposed wood. Meat residue, blood can
get into these areas which can cause bacteria growth. Because these areas cannot be properly cleaned the meat
being cut on this cutting board is being exposed to potentially harmful bacteria which poses a health risk to the
animals.
Food must be uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value.

chewed, ripped rough edges can harbor dirt, debris and prevent the proper cleaning and sanitizing which could
cause diseases or illness to the dogs.
Water receptacles must be able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or be replaced.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The plastic crates sitting next to each enclosure for transporting the animals are not properly labeled. They are not
clearly marked with the words "Live Animals" and with arrows or other marking to indicate the correct upright
position. One of the employees told the inspectors that a wolf-dog named "Ashima" is being transported to the
veterinarian today in a plastic crate that is not properly labeled. Appropriate marking is necessary for proper
handling of the transport crates to limit the potential for injury to the animals being transported.
All primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats not permanently affixed to the conveyance shall be
clearly marked on top and on one or more sides with the words "Live Animals" in letters at least 1 inch high and with
arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the enclosure.
