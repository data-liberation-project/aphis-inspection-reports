ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:20 am on
06-Mar-17.
The inspectors and IDALS representative arrived at the facility at 11:20 am and spoke to a household member who
did not know where the licensee currently was. The inspector called the licensee's phone number and left a
message. The inspectors waited 30 minutes and the licensee arrived, but due to a special circumstance, the
licensee was not going to be able to complete a full inspection of the facility. The inspectors then left the facility.
