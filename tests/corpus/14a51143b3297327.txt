2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) performed an evaluation of it's program for
humane care and use of animals and a facility walk-through on July 20, 2018, but did not submit a report to the
Institutional Official (IO) with the results of those evaluations.
The IACUC performed another program evaluation for the facility's humane care and use of animals and a facility
walk-through on January 9, 2019. For these evaluations, a report was submitted to the IO but did not contain the
signatures of a majority of the IACUC members.
Reports of semi-annual inspections and program evaluations must be submitted to the IO for review as well as be
signed by a majority of the IACUC members. Failure to submit reports to the IO or to have a majority of the IACUC
members sign these reports could have an adverse impact on animal health if minority views by IACUC members
are not expressed or if there is improper oversight to address any deficiencies identified in these evaluations.
Correct by including the majority of IACUC signatures on semi-annual reports that are then submitted to the IO.
Correct by July 31, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
