INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There was no IACUC meeting or semi-annual review and inspection conducted since the Fall 2014; It should have
been in April 2015.
IACUC review of program and facility is required by the regulations to occur at least every six months to ensure that
any problems are discovered and corrected in a timely manner. The facility representative said there will be a
meeting as soon as faculty returns, then it would be regularly scheduled thereafter.
The inspection was accompanied by a facility representative.
The exit briefing was by phone and email with the IACUC Chair.
