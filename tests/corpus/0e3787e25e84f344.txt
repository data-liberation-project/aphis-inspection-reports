Space. Insufficient space was being provided to at least 174 weanling guinea pigs in 11 enclosures. Enclosures measure
24 inches by 32 inches or 768 square inches of floor space. Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at
least 60 square inches of floor space each and guinea pigs weighing over 350 grams require at least 101 square inches
of floor space each. Eleven weanling enclosures had 13 or more guinea pigs in 768 square inches of floor space. This
size enclosure can not house more than12 weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams or more than 7 weanlings that
weigh over 350 grams.

Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, and can increase aggression in animals which can result in ear
chewing, bites, and other injuries from fighting. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are provided with at least the
minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent crowding, stress and discomfort. Correct by July 9, 2022.
