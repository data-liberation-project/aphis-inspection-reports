There is a yellow female Golden Retriever (#163) that has an open wound approximately 1 inch x 1/2 inch behind
the left ear that is weeping a red tinged watery fluid, the wound exposes the muscle beneath the skin. The wound
appears to be at least 3 days old as the edges of the wound have begun to heal. There is another wound on the
right rear leg approximately 1 inch long that appears to be bite marks that have also gone down to the muscle layer
below the skin. This wound has begun to scab over on parts of it, and open for the majority of the wound. A
veterinarian has not been consulted or wounds treated due to the injuries not being observed until during the
inspection .
Wounds left untreated due to not being found in a timely manner can become infected and cause unnecessary pain
or discomfort to the regulated animal.
The attending veterinarian should be consulted for appropriate treatment of the wounds.
