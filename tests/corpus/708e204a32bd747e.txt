FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a loose guinea pig observed on the floor during inspection that went to hide under a wooden enclosure.
The licensee said it and another one with it might be older, larger males. Some of the wooden enclosures in the
facility have fronts that are 7 inches high but with bedding in them make them about 6 inches high from the bedding
and not enough to contain guinea pigs. While still contained in a room, the loose guinea pigs might not have access
to food and water and if two aggressive animals get together they could injure each other. Ensure that enclosures
are built and maintained in a manner to safely contain the guinea pigs.
Correct enclosures by 9/14/19. (Note: the facility discussed plans to provide food and water to lure the loose guinea
pigs to an area that they can be safely caught).
Some of the wooden enclosures have older wire that is broken and so there is loose wire strands and some points
of wire exposed to the guinea pigs. One area of loose wire was corrected during inspection. Loose wire and points
could injure guinea pigs. Ensure that the wire areas and all surfaces in enclosures that guinea pigs touch are
smooth and free from sharp points.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The stacked wood enclosures have floors that are impervious to moisture, however the sides have areas that are
soaking up moisture and are soiled. Surfaces that soak up moisture are not impervious to moisture and cannot be
cleaned and sanitized well. Wood that soaks up moisture and stays soiled can house germs and cause guinea pigs
to get sick. To protect their health, ensure that surfaces that guinea pigs contact are maintained so that they are
impervious to moisture.

SANITATION.The 2 stacked enclosures along the walls had areas of thick buildup of soiled material with dry bedding on top,
especially in the back corners where it was difficult to see without a flashlight. Build-up of soiled material in
enclosures can increase harmful odors and can increase risk of sickness in guinea pigs. Ensure that all of the
enclosures are regularly cleaned and sanitized at least every 2 weeks but more often if a buildup of soiled material
is present.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives. Exit interview was conducted with the animal caretaker.
