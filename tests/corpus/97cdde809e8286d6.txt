2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Three dogs were not receiving appropriate care to prevent or treat disease and injury.
A male Corgi named Amos (#2693) has scars on the outer ear flaps of both ears. The licensee reports that this happened
when she was trying to get his ears to stand upright using self-adhering wrap and a cardboard tube. The licensee noted
that 2 days later the tips of the ears were cold. When she removed the bandages, there were sores present on the ears
from the bandage being too tight. Bandaging the ears was not in the Program of Vet Care but the licensee did seek
veterinary care to treat the injury to the ears. Using unapproved methods can lead to injury and be painful.
A female French Bulldog named Tia (#5873) has a hairless, reddish-purple, swollen lump on the skin in between the third
and fourth toes on the left front paw. The lump appears to be a cyst that has ruptured with a small amount of discharge.
The licensee had noticed the lump before it ruptured but was not sure how to treat it. Allowing conditions to progress
without treatment can lead to pain, infection, and other complications.
A male Corgi named Jojo (#5875) has several mats in his fur all over his body and the hair is greasy. The licensee was
aware of the mats but said it was just his fur type. Mats in fur can trap dirt and moisture, leading to skin disease.
When unapproved methods are used or conditions go untreated, injuries can occur and disease conditions can progress.


Correct from this day forward by using only approved and appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
and control diseases and injuries as instructed by the attending veterinarian.
3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
Several enclosures were not being maintained in good repair and posed a risk of injury to the animals housed in them. In
an outdoor enclosure containing 2 American Eskimo dogs, a male named Kevin (#87917) and a female named Snowflake
(#9973), the concrete was broken and uneven. There was brown cloudy liquid pooling in a large defect of the concrete.
On the east side of the building, the outdoor portion of 2 indoor-outdoor enclosures had rusted, pitted, and broken
corrugated metal, creating sharp, jagged points protruding into the enclosures. The enclosures house 2 female American
Eskimo dogs, Ivory Fox (#40244) and Snow Angel (#9968), both with litters of puppies.
In two indoor-outdoor wire enclosures on the East side of the building, the wire was rusted and broken, creating sharp
points and holes that could injure the dogs. There were sharp metal points protruding into the kennel containing one male
Yorkshire Terrier. A female pug, Cyndee, was housed in an enclosure with an entire line of broken wire, creating 2
defects, one measuring approximately 8" x 1" and the other measuring 4" x 2" in the outdoor portion of her kennel. The
door of her kennel was also heavily rusted and pitted.
In an indoor/outdoor wire enclosure on the east side of the building, containing a male poodle named Ralphie, the plastic
lining of the door leading to the exterior was broken, exposing rotten and jagged wood.
Crumbling, broken, and rusted enclosures can lead to lacerations, entrapment, and other injuries. When enclosures allow
water and waste to pool, it creates a disease hazard and attracts pests. Correct by 1/15/23 by ensuring housing facilities
are constructed in a structurally sound manner and kept in good repair as to protect the animals from injury.
3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.


Four outdoor enclosures had inadequate or wet and soiled bedding material. The 4 enclosures housed 2 Heelers, 4
Corgis, and 2 American Eskimos. There was a scant amount of wet and soiled cedar shavings in the shelters of each
enclosure. The low temperature the previous night was 48F with temperatures as low as 39F in the past 48 hours.
Without adequate dry bedding, dogs can have a hard time staying warm when temperatures drop, causing discomfort and
stress. Correct from this day forward by ensuring clean, dry, bedding material is available in the shelter of outdoor
enclosures if the ambient temperature is below 50F. Additional bedding must be added when the temperature drops
below 35F.
3.10(a)

Watering
Potable water was not continuously available to 3 dogs. A male French Bulldog, Willy Doo (#65122) had brownish yellow
discolored water with a large amount of fecal material in his only water bowl. Two nursing bitches, a pug named Dorkus
(#5869), and a poodle named Ellie (#74584) did not have continuous access to water. Both dogs had a litter of 5 puppies
and were housed with their litter in large wire crates in the licensee's bathroom. The licensee did not want the puppies to
drown or get wet from spilled water so she lets both dogs out to exercise, eat, and drink 3 times a day. If water is not
clean, dogs may refuse to drink and become thirsty and dehydrated, causing distress. Without continuous access to
water, nursing bitches can become thirsty, dehydrated and unable to produce enough milk to support their litter. Correct
by providing continuous access to potable water from this day forward.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Four enclosures were not being sanitized at an adequate frequency to prevent accumulation of dirt and debris. Four
French Bulldogs were singly housed in indoor-outdoor enclosures with cement floors and metal walls on the West side of
the building. The indoor portion of the enclosures were wet and had a build-up of dirt, hair, and filth on the cement floors


and caked in the corners with brown greasy streaks covering approximately 80% of the walls of the enclosures. The
licensee stated that she washes down outside to remove waste daily but had not cleaned the interior shelter recently. A
buildup of waste material and moisture can cause discomfort and serve as a source of potential disease transmission and
contamination to the dogs’ food, water, and body. Correct by 12/2/22 by sanitizing hard surfaces that the dogs come in
contact and continuing at an adequate frequency, not less than every 2 weeks, to prevent accumulation of filth.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
