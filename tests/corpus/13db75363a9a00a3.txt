2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The left eye of a 2.5 year old female shih tzu, microchip # 956000005336701, had blood vessels forming across the
cornea (neovascularization), reddening of the white of the eye (scleral injection), and a green/white discharge. The
cornea was cloudy. The hair around the eye was wet and crusty.
Untreated eye issues can lead to chronic pain and potential loss of vision. The licensee is responsible for observing
all animals at least daily to assess their health and well-being. Failure of the facility to observe this animal’s eye
issue and communicate the problem to the attending veterinarian can result in an ongoing medical problem
worsening. There must be a mechanism of direct communication with the attending veterinarian regarding animal
issues so that they can be addressed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
