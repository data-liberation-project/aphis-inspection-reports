2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities in protocol #15-6250A involving
groundhogs were not approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The protocol states that transport “will be via USDA-approved commercial carriers and CSU personnel will not do
the transport.” On or around April 13, 2016, protocol personnel utilized a rental commercial vehicle and transported
22 groundhogs from New York to the facility. The vehicle was not climate controlled.
The protocol further states that the animals would be housed at the facility. At the request of the principle
investigator, 8 groundhogs pups were removed from the facility by protocol personnel within approximately six days
of birth. These animals were transported by protocol personnel to and from their residences on a daily basis. Seven
of these eight groundhogs pups died, some of which died at one of the residences.
The IACUC was not made aware of these significant changes by the principle investigator.
Unapproved significant changes to the protocol could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal's
welfare at risk. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC
prior to implementing the changes.
2.33(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The facility did not perform adequate daily observations of a sheep and failed to identify her thin body condition and
rapid breathing.
During a walk-through of the sheep barn at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital on June 20, 2017, APHIS inspectors
discovered that a female sheep, ID KC02, appeared thin and was breathing rapidly. The sheep had undergone
surgery as part of a research protocol #17-7213A. There were three other sheep in the enclosure that had
undergone surgery as part of the same protocol; all of these sheep were breathing normally. There was anadditional 12 adult sheep in the neighboring pens of this sheep’s enclosure who were also breathing normally.
There is no documentation or record indicating that these clinical signs had been noticed or communicated to a
facility veterinarian prior to the APHIS inspection. As a result, veterinary care for the sheep had not been provided.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized and conveyed to a facility veterinarian in a timely manner so that appropriate methods can be
employed to ensure adequate care. The facility must conduct appropriate daily observations of all animals to ensure
that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the
attending veterinarian.
At the time of the inspection, a veterinarian examined the sheep and initiated treatment. Additional training of staff
has also been implemented by the facility.
To be corrected from this date forward.
A complete routine inspection was conducted from 06/20-06/23/17. This report is limited to the direct and critical
noncompliant items identified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items
will follow. Both the inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives on 06/23/17.
