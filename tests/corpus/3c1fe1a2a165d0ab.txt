2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. An adult brown and white guinea pig in pen 11 was
observed with a right front foot that was swollen and red especially between the first and second digits. The guinea
pig was observed to hold the leg up and was reluctant to place weight on it and was also licking and chewing at the
leg with some moderate redness and hair loss on the upper part of the leg. In addition, in pen 7 there was a tan and
white weanling with hair loss extending from behind the head to the rump especially on the left side and covering
about 70% of it's body. The licensee had not contacted his attending veterinarian and was not administering any
treatments.
Swollen feet can be painful and if caused by an infection, can worsen and spread to other parts of the body and
result in other health issues. Hair loss can be a sign of numerous infectious and non-infectious causes and requires
examination by a veterinarian and appropriate diagnostic testing to determine the underlying cause. Delays in
providing appropriate veterinary care for these conditions can result in worsening of the condition and potentially
spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an
appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

3.26(a) DIRECT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 52.9 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. There was a
wall heater but the licensee had set it to be around 55 degrees F because he thought that was the minimum
temperature required.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort
and predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Upon entry into the building housing the guinea pigs, the ammonia odor in the facility was enough to cause burning
of the eyes and nose of the APHIS Inspectors performing the inspection. No fans, vents, or doors were observed to
be open to allow proper ventilation of the room.
Buildings housing guinea pigs need to be adequately ventilated for the animals. Failure to do so can lead to
respiratory distress and other health issues. Correct by increasing ventilation into the room to remove the excessive
ammonia odor. Correct by January 11, 2020.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**The feeders in Pens 6 and 15 both had areas where the metal was worn down on the sides of the feeders and
had rusty, jagged edges. Since these worn sides were on the portion of the feeder that was on the inside of the
pen, the animals in these pens were directly exposed to these rusty, jagged edges when eating from the feeders.
**Four of the pens had separation of the bottom border of the wire mesh from the wooden frame of the guinea pig
enclosures. In Pen 3, this separation occurred on two sides of the enclosure with one of the gaps measuring 4in
between the wire and the frame. The gap on the other side of Pen 3 measured 1in as did the gaps between the
wire mesh and the frame in the other three pens this was observed in.
Enclosures and items within them, including feeders, must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. The
worn down feeders can cause injury to the guinea pigs or increase incidence of illness as these feeders cannot be
properly sanitized. The wire gaps in the enclosures can also cause injury by allowing the guinea pigs to escape or
fall from their enclosures. Correct by repairing/replacing the feeders and wire mesh attachments. Correct by
January 19, 2020.
3.30 REPEAT
WATERING.
There were 11 water bottles (approximately half) with an accumulation of green material coating the inside of the
water bottle. In addition, the PVC piping around the nipples was coated with a large amount of wet brown debris
both under the nipple and on the outside of the pipe which would be difficult for the animals to avoid stepping on or
contacting when they try to drink from the nipples.
Failure to clean and sanitize water containers can result in disease spread and reduced potability of the water which
can reduce water intake and negatively impact the health of the animals.
Water containers must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.3.31(a)(1) DIRECT
SANITATION.
Several of the guinea pig enclosures had portions of the pens that were mats of solid fecal material with no clean
bedding available. In Pen 8 housing 8 guinea pigs, the entire pen was a solid mat of feces with no clean bedding
available for the guinea pigs to stand on and several guinea pigs in the enclosure were observed with the hair and
skin on their legs completely wet and matted. Additionally, all of the guinea pig enclosures had spiderwebs present
on the inside of the enclosures, adhered to the ceiling of the enclosure as well as the wire mesh on the sides of the
enclosures. Debris and bedding were observed to be mixed in with these spiderwebs.
When asked about cleaning, the licensee stated that he was cleaning once a week but only sanitizing once a
month.
Enclosures need to be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal
material and sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks. Failure to do so can have a negative impact on
animal health through the increase in disease. Correct by cleaning all enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
accumulations of fecal material and spiderwebs and by sanitizing at least once every two weeks. Correct from this
day forward.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
In the building housing the guinea pigs, there were accumulations of wet brown/yellow debris observed on the walls
of the building, spiderwebs in corners and on shelving, and a build-up of wet grain and debris on the floor under the
sink. Areas of rust were seen on the ceiling and there was hay scattered all across the floor of the building.
Buildings and grounds need to be kept clean and in good repair. Failure to do so can have a negative impact on the
health of the animals by causing respiratory distress and other illnesses. Correct by cleaning the room, removing
the spiderwebs, and repairing areas of rust on the ceiling. Correct by January 29, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
