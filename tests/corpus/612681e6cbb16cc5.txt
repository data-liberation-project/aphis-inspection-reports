ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care remains incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of
veterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written
PVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended
treatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no
manufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding
frequency of administration the written PVC says (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) for the majority of the species. There is no guidance
elsewhere clarifying what (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) means. During this inspection, several drugs were found in various storage
areas (including ivermectin, gentamycin, LA-200, and Resflor Gold) that are not labeled for all of the species that
these drugs can potentially be used in. Additional guidance for the use of these drugs must be provided in the
written PVC for all species for which these drugs are intended to be used. A written program of veterinary care is
required when attending veterinarians are employed on a part time basis to ensure that the licensee and facility staff
understand the direction of the Attending Veterinarian and provide a mechanism by which APHIS Officials can
determine their compliance with those directions. Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these
topics does not ensure good welfare of the animals maintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to
failure to provide measures for prevention, control, and treatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending
veterinarian to ensure that complete guidance regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all
drugs listed for each species that are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written
program of veterinary care. At a minimum guidance must include species-specific directions for vaccination,
euthanasia, capture and restraint, and the prevention, control, and treatment of internal and external parasites.

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).DIRECT: There was a female Aoudad observed limping in the drive-through area near the water buffalo pond.
When standing she was toe-touching lame, and at the walk and run she appeared to be three-legged lame,
resistant to put any weight on the right forelimb. There is no written documentation that this animal has been
examined by a veterinarian or has received treatment for this condition. The farm manager stated that this animal
was observed to be limping on Saturday (4/23) by farm personnel and that he had talked to the attending
veterinarian about this animal. At the time of the inspection, treatment had not been administered to this animal.
Failure to provide adequate veterinary care to control and treat illness and injury results in prolonged animal pain
and suffering. Additionally, an animal limping on hilly, rocky terrain is at risk to further injure itself simply trying to
get around. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated according to his or her
instructions. Documentation of this exam and treatment must be maintained by the licensee and made available for
inspection by USDA officials.
Corrected at the time of exit interview, the farm manager treated the animal according to the phone conversation
instructions by the veterinarian.
*** The current program of veterinary care still authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for
(cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority
of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai,
Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. During this inspection, the Farm Manager stated that no changes to the written
Program of Veterinary Care have been made in regards to the use of this drug.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that providesadequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of
animals. This includes camels, sheep, goats, African porcupines, kangaroos, muntjac deer, and mini-zebu cattle,
and 4-horn sheep. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the walk through area of the zoo, the
production barn, the dairy barn, the Daughty barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to the public. There
are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the
entry gate. There are no attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures
and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to
reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public contact continues to be a problem at this facility and has
been documented on many previous inspections. Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public
interaction with these animals. Licensees must ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled
with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety
of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these animals or by ensuring
that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the safety of both the public
and the animals.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Guests are still allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendant is present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: deer,
antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry
gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding. This facility also has
horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows public feeding with an attendant present. During this
inspection, the Farm Manager stated that guidance to guests has not changed in regard to feeding from cars.
Allowing guests to feed from vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nordoes it provide a barrier or distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all
times during public contact.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The wooden walls for the indoor housing for an adult kangaroo and its Joey are wet along the bottom of the walls
near the floor. The Farm Manager stated that these 2 kangaroos are new to the facility and that the indoor area
was power washed before the animals were placed there. One corner of the enclosure is also moldy near the floor
and is in direct contact with both the adult and Joey. These wet/moldy areas are a potential disease risk to the
animals, especially the young kangaroo. The licensee must ensure that all animals are provided housing facilities
that allow them to remain dry and free of moldy conditions. Correct this by cleaning this area and providing all
animals a clean, dry housing facility.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The large heap of animal waste and bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals continue to
have access to this pile and have been observed on previous inspections browsing and lying in the pile. During
today(cid:25)s inspection, animals were observed browsing near the pile, but no additional spent bedding had been
recently added to the existing pile. The Farm Manager stated that currently spent bedding is being disposed of in
another area outside of the drive thru area. Animal contact with this waste pile has been a concern on many
previous inspections as this unnecessarily exposes the animals to potential disease transmission. Correct this by
completing the removal of this waste pile and dispose of all animal wastes properly.
