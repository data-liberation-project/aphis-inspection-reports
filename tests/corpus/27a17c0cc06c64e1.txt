ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(cid:28)"Peanut"(cid:29), a female Poodle (no identification) has a left eye that is a cloudy blue-white color with a raised red area
that has an indented center.
(cid:28)"Roxy(cid:29)", a female red Cocker Spaniel (no identification) eyes are both a cloudy blueish-grey color. The pupils are
unable to be viewed. The left eye also appears to have a white spider vein appearance to it. The right eye appears
to be squinting with a membrane-type tissue covering part of the eye.
(cid:28)"Sassy(cid:29)", a female Cocker Spaniel (no identification) has a left eye that is enlarged, bulging with a blue-grey color
to the eye.
Licensee removed a piece of matter around the eye which caused the surrounding area to start to bleed.
*The discoloration, squinting, enlargement, and bulging can be signs of disease or other health issue and indicate
pain.
Licensee had not noticed the eye issues and has not consulted or had the dogs evaluated by a veterinarian.
Licensee must consult with a veterinarian and have the dogs diagnosed and an appropriate treatment plan
administered/followed within the next three days (3/12/15- verbal instruction at exit interview). Documentation of
such visit/treatment plan must be available upon request by the inspector.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
An adult female poodle named "Peanut", an adult female cocker spaniel named "Sassy" and an adult female cocker
spaniel named "Roxy" do not have an official form of identification. Official identification is needed to ensure that
each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must
ensure that all dogs are officially identified by collar, tattoo or microchip.
3.1(f)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The northeast outdoor housing area containing five Golden Retrievers has a large pile of melting snow, dirt, debris
and feces combined within the outdoor runs. These semi- frozen piles are located in the front-half of the runs. The
dogs are able to stand and jump on the semi-solid pile of waste/debris. This allows the feet and legs of the dogs to
become wet and soiled with feces. The piles of waste material must be removed or collected in such a manner as to
prevent soiling of the dogs, reduce contamination and other disease risks to the dogs.
To be corrected by: March 12, 2015.
This routine inspection and exit conference were conducted on 3/09/15 with the licensee, ACI Angela Depoe, and a
Iowa State Trooper.
