3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
One enclosure, containing one adult dog, has dividing walls made of plastic. One wall has become detached and is
leaning into the adjacent enclosure. The detached wall has also exposed the sharp ends of screws which are located at
the level of the dog. Enclosure walls which are not secured could fail to contain the animal and direct contact with sharp
points could cause injuries.

One enclosure, containing an adult female Yorkshire terrier, has a heat lamp hanging down into the enclosure. The heat
lamp contains no protective guard, and the dog can come into direct contact with the glass bulb. Contact with the bulb
could cause burns to the dog or the glass could break which may result in injury.

Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in
good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from
entering. The licensee must alter the detached wall and sharp points in a manner that ensures the animal is securely and
safely contained in its enclosure. Additionally, the licensee must add a protective guard or alter the heat lamp in a
manner that eliminates the ability of the dog to come into direct contact with the glass bulb. The licensee must ensure
that all aspects of the housing facility are safe for the dogs at all times.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
