ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The licensee recently acquired a greater bush baby. This singly housed primate is housed in a location where he
cannot see or hear any other primates. The current environmental enrichment plan does not address any bush
babies.
A suitable primate enrichment plan shall be developed, written, and documented to address the social,
environmental, and special needs for this singly housed species of primate. This plan shall be developed in
consultation & approved by your attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The zebra is in a round pen for (at least) part of the daytime hours. There is no shelter structure in this enclosure.
The few pine trees that are near this enclosure do not cast a sufficient amount of shade or protection from the sun &
rain. The shade produced during the inspection was not even large enough to completely shade this young zebra.
Adequate & sufficient protection from the elements (sun & rain) shall be provided to any animal in this enclosure at
all times when present.
