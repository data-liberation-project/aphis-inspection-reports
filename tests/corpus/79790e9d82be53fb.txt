ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 am on
28-Dec-16.
** I arrived at the facility at 11:00 am and no one was present. I called the owner and left a message but there was
no response. An employee later stated that the owner was unavailable and that they were unauthorized to conduct
an inspection. I left the premises at 11:45 am.
