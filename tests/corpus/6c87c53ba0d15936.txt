2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility had acquired additional new species of animals but had not notified the Attending Veterinarian (AV) about their
arrival. The AV had not been provided the opportunity to update the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) and evaluate the
health status of the following animals after arrival prior to this inspection: white-faced capuchin, African crested
porcupines (3), Patagonian cavy. Not notifying the AV about new species and new animal additions prohibits the AV’s
ability to exercise their authority to provide appropriate veterinary care to new animals. Per the regulations, each exhibitor
shall assure that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Correct by 23November2022.
2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A Patagonian cavy on display had multiple crusty, bloody patches visible on its back and flanks during this inspection.
The facility reported that they were attempting to treat the wounds but had sought no veterinary care from their Attending
Veterinarian (AV) since its arrival about a month ago. Not allowing the AV to provide prompt, appropriate veterinary care
to injured animals compromises the health and well-being of the animals. Per the regulations, each exhibitor shall install


and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes: (2) the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by 23November2022.
2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility was conducting daily observations but had not notified the Attending Veterinarian (AV) about a Patagonian
cavy with multiple crusty, bloody patches visible on its back and flanks that was observed during this inspection. Per the
licensee, the animal arrived at the facility with significant wounds about a month prior to this inspection, which the facility
was trying to treat. Not communicating daily observations of issues significantly impacting animal health to the AV
compromises the ability of the AV to provide prompt, appropriate veterinary care to animals showing signs of disease or
injury. Per the regulations, each exhibitor shall install and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes:
(3) daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being; provided, however, that daily observation of
animals may be accomplished by someone other than the AV; and provided further, that a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health behavior and
well-being is conveyed to the AV. Correct by 23November2022.
3.78(e)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Barriers around the vervet, patas and capuchin non-human primate (NHP) enclosures were not sufficient to prevent the
public from having physical contact with the animals contained in the enclosures. The inspector was able to reach
over/through the present barriers to be within easy reach of the NHPs as they reached out. Not providing adequate
barriers between the public and NHPs puts both the public and the NHPs at risk of injury. Per the regulations, fixed public
exhibits housing NHPs must have a barrier between the primary enclosure and the public at any time the public is
present, in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the NHPs. Correct by 03December2022.


3.81

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The Primate Environmental Enrichment Program (PEEP) lacked sufficient information and detail. It contained no
information for the capuchin. No Attending Veterinarian (AV) exemption for the requirement that singly housed NHPs must
be able to see and hear NHPs of their own or compatible species was documented. The capuchin cannot see other
primates but can hear the vervet and patas monkeys around the corner. No signature by the AV was found. Not having an
up-to-date and adequate PEEP can result in compromise of the psychological well-being of NHPs. Per the regulations,
exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote
the psychological well-being of NHPs. Correct by 03December2022.
3.82(a)

Feeding.
Unfresh fruits and vegetables were noted on the floor in the shavings of the capuchin’s enclosure. The facility stated that
the food may have been present for up to a week. The food was wilted and dehydrated and could no longer be
considered wholesome for the animal. In addition, multiple flies were noted in this enclosure around the food. Allowing
food to remain in an enclosure past the point of wholesomeness provides for excessive fly activity, the potential for
disease transmission, and potential digestive distress for the animal. Per the regulations, the food must be clean,
wholesome and palatable to the animals. Correct by 23November2022.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The enclosure housing three African crested porcupines had exposed wire on the floor in multiple areas. Exposed wire
on the floor of an enclosure poses a significant paw entrapment risk. Per the regulations, the indoor and outdoor housing


facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by
25November2022.
3.130

Watering.
The capybara’s water bottle was coated in green algae. The water in the capybara’s pool was contaminated with leaves
and a layer of debris on the bottom. Not providing clean, potable water can have negative impacts on the health of the
animals. Per the regulations, potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the
animal. Correct by 23November2022.
