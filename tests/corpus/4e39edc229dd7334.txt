3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two doggy door flaps that have been chewed at the corners and a section of plastic wall covering in the
first pen(approx. 3inx3in) that has been chewed away exposing the bare wood beneath. Once surfaces that come in
contact with the regulated animals are chewed or in disrepair they must be repaired or replaced.
Chewed surfaces can not be cleaned and sanitized according to AWA regulations and standards.
The doggy door flaps and section of wall that has been chewed away need to be repaired and be able to be
cleaned and sanitized.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are 2 doggy doors that house 5 dachshunds that have a buildup of brown/black grime built up on the plastic
flaps on both sides. There is some buildup of dirt on the wall/insert area around the doors. While the dog area was
cleaned, it does not appear to be sanitized enough to prevent the buildup of brown grime on the surface of the door
flaps.
The buildup of dirt and grime on the wall and door flaps can be a source of bacteria and possible disease if it is not
cleaned often enough.
The surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as
often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime on the walls, floors, door flaps, inserts and food and
water bowls.To be corrected by: May 23, 2016
3.125 REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a section of angle iron(approx. 2ft long) that runs along the bottom of the guillotine door inside the liger
enclosure that has come loose and separated from the wall frame it was attached to. This loose angle iron is moved
by the feet of the large cats when they drag their foot over the surface, or step on it which provides a gap between
the two pieces of angle iron that hold the bottom of the door in place when it is closed. This could be a source of
possible injury .
Loose metal supports or structural pieces inside an enclosure can be a possible source of injury for the regulated
animals.
The angle iron support must be repaired or replaced
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
There is a tire that has been put into the liger enclosure for enrichment purposes that has been chewed apart to
where over 3/4 of one side of the tire has been chewed away and missing and is raged with large holes in the
remaining surface.
When tires are completely chewed and torn apart into pieces and not removed in a timely manner, the remaining
tire can be a possible health hazard if the small pieces are now able to be ingested. This could also be a potential
risk of injury by getting heads/body parts caught up in the areas with holes. When plastic, rubber or wooden
surfaces are excessively chewed, the item should be removed and replaced.
The excessively chewed up tire or any other items should be removed from the enclosure.
