2.40(a)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In April the facility saw symptoms of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHO) and rapid death of 72 of their rabbits within a
week. The remaining 5 rabbits were killed via gunshot. Euthanasia by gunshot was not an approved method of
euthanasia per the attending veterinarian. The licensee failed to contact their attending veterinarian to confirm RHO and
seek proper diagnosis, supportive care, and containment. It is the responsibility of the licensee to contact the attending
veterinarian so he/she can provide adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care
and use.

Watering.
In the fallow deer and goat enclosures, the plastic drinking bowls were dirty and had a green slimy film on the interior
sides and bottom. In deer water receptacles there were numerous small bugs swimming around. It is the responsibility of
the licensee to make sure all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the
animals.
