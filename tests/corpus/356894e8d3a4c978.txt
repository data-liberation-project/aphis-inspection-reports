2.4 Critical

Non-interference with APHIS officials.
On August 7th, USDA inspectors arrived at the facility to continue their second day of inspection. The lead USDA
inspector located the Office Manager to inform her of their presence and was promptly asked if she had brought a
supervisor with her. The Office Manager explained that she did not like the manner in which the lead USDA inspector had
treated her clients the previous day and did not believe she (the licensee) needed to comply with the regulations. The
Office Manager stated that until both USDA inspectors returned with a supervisor, they would need to leave the property.
The lead USDA inspector asked the Office Manager if she was refusing an inspection and she stated that she was
refusing it. USDA inspectors were unable to complete the inspection due to the interference from the Office Manager. A
licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse) or harass any APHIS official in the course of
carrying out his or her duties. Correct from this day forward.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On August 6th, discussions with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) for this facility revealed that she did not have experience
treating exotic species beyond small pocket pets such as guinea pigs and ferrets. After inspectors explained the role and
responsibilities of an attending veterinarian for USDA licensed facilities, the AV expressed concern over her ability and


availability to continue as the attending. The AV repeatedly said she was not comfortable treating exotic animals. Per her
explanation, she had not received training or had experience in the care and management of the various exotic species
present at the auction. She also commented that it would be unlikely she could be available to attend to veterinary care
needs for the entire duration of the auction (Tuesday-Sunday).
Furthermore, the AV was unsure of her responsibilities and role as the facility’s Attending Veterinarian. She explained that
the facility’s Office Manager had given her a blank Program of Veterinary Care and a Blue Book without further
explanation. Additionally, the Office Manager had not explained the AV’s role at the facility. Inspectors found that the AV
had not physically examined the animals in the “warm room” and most of the animals in the auction barn pens beyond a
few individual animals requiring health certificates. She was unaware she was allowed to do so.
During a walk through of the barn pens with the AV, a female camel was identified by inspectors as a concern due to the
presence of an open draining abscess on her right mammary gland. The Office Manager was contacted as well as the
owner of the camel. The owner of the camel requested that the AV treat her with an antibiotic, Draxxin. Inspectors
witnessed the AV admitting that she did not know the proper dosage for a camel. The owner of the camel instructed the
AV to dose the camel the same as a cow and provided her the animal’s approximate weight. The Office Manager also
approved of the suggestion by the camel owner. When inspectors requested that the temperature of the camel be taken
prior to receiving the antibiotic, the AV admitted that she did not have a thermometer and did not feel comfortable taking
the camel’s temperature. The Office Manager and owner offered to locate and provide a thermometer with the statement
that the AV would not have to do “any hands-on work” on the animal.
Inspectors were unable to review the program of veterinary care due to a refusal of inspection by the Office Manager on
August 7th. Lack of a valid program of veterinary care and an attending veterinarian with training and/or experience in the
care and management of the exotic species present at this auction puts animals at risk for improper treatment of disease


and injury. Additionally, it can lead to suffering and death. The licensee must have an attending veterinarian who shall
provide adequate veterinary care to its animals. The attending veterinarian must have received training and/or experience
in the care and management of the species being attended. Correct from this day forward.
2.40(b)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During the walk through of the auction barn pens, inspectors identified a female camel with an open draining abscess in
her right mammary gland. The Attending Veterinarian requested the presence of the Office Manager and the camel’s
owner to discuss the animal’s condition. After a treatment plan was suggested by the camel’s owner and the Office
Manager, inspectors requested that the animal’s temperature be taken. The AV admitted she did not have a thermometer
on hand or in her truck. The Office Manager and the camel’s owner both offered to locate and/or buy a thermometer for
the AV’s use however the camel’s antibiotic treatment would likely be given prior to taking its temperature. Failure to
provide the necessary equipment to diagnose and treat medical problems can contribute to the worsening health and
well-being of the animal. The licensee must make available any appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services
to facilitate proper veterinary care. Correct from this day forward.
2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The Attending Veterinarian had not examined any of the “warm room” animals and most of the hoof stock that had been
consigned at the time of inspection. During a walk through of the facility premises, inspectors identified several veterinary
concerns such as a porcupine exhibiting signs of heat stress, a female bison with superficial skin injuries inflicted by
conspecifics, and a male goat with an abnormal growth on its right jaw line. The auction staff had not identified any of the
veterinary care concerns inspectors identified and had not relayed them to the AV. Daily observations were not being
directly and frequently communicated to the AV. Medical problems must be identified and communicated to the Attending


Veterinarian so that a diagnosis can be determined, and treatment implemented. Failure to observe medical problems
and/or communicate those problems to the AV can result in prolonged pain, suffering, and even death. The auction staff
must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the AV so that
timely and accurate information on problems of health, behavior and well-being are conveyed. Correct from this day
forward.
2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On August 6th, USDA inspectors spoke with the facility’s Office Manager and requested the buyer information for the sale
of a sugar glider. The Office Manager refused stating she was not legally required to show buyer information. She asked
that she be shown the regulation that required it. USDA inspectors showed her the regulation requiring dealers to provide
buyer information. After reading the regulation the Officer Manager stated that she did not like nor agree with it and would
need to do further research on the matter. USDA inspectors were unable to request additional buyer information and
review the program of veterinary care due to the Office Manager’s refusal of inspection on August 7th.
The facility must ensure that all records are available upon request during the inspection to aid in the proper tracking of
regulated animals and ensure the health and well-being of the regulated animals. Correct from this day forward.
2.131(b)(1) Direct

Handling of animals.
During the walk through of the auction barn, inspectors observed a porcupine exhibiting signs of heat stress. The
porcupine was held in a metal dog crated with an increased respiratory rate. The temperature was approximately 86.3
degrees Fahrenheit at 12:30pm on August 6th. The animal had splayed itself flat on the bottom of the crate. The transport
crate did not contain a water receptacle. Inspectors requested that water be provided to the animal and that the Attending
Veterinarian be contacted. A later discussion with the AV revealed she had not been contacted concerning the porcupine


and had yet to see the animal. Inspectors requested that the AV join them to examine the animal. At approximately
4:30pm, the porcupine was observed from 10ft-15ft away (to rule out stress induced hyperventilation) with an increased
respiratory rate. A small pink bowl was present within the enclosure but did not contain water. The temperature was taken
again and found to be 83.0 degrees Fahrenheit. Inspectors requested that the animal be provided water once again, and
that a fan be placed on it. Additionally, they suggested moving the animal into the temperature controlled “warm room”
may be necessary. The AV agreed with the inspectors’ suggestions and instructed the auction employees to provide a fan
and water to the porcupine.
Animals that are subject to heat extremes may suffer from dehydration, stress and poor immune system function.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Corrected at the time of
inspection on August 6th.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, several pens in the auction barn required repairs to the wooden boards. There were two pens in
the baby bottle area with loose 2x4 wood boards at the back of the enclosures. The pens housed young goat kids, and
the boards posed an escape and entrapment risk. In a pen housing a female camel with sticker #2088, there was a rotten
wooden board with an exposed nail that posed a risk of injury. In two pens housing a group of approximately 10-15 goats,
the wood boards separating the animals had been broken allowing the animals to cross back and forth amongst the pens.
The indoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals. Correct by September 3rd, 2021.
3.130 Direct

Watering.


In an enclosure housing two Watusi cattle, the only water receptable was filled with discolored brown water that contained
feces, mud and old hay. The bottom of the receptable could not be visualized. Additionally, several enclosures housing 10
domestic cattle, 2 domestic cattle, 1 zedonk, 5 Highland cattle, and 2 Scimitar Oryx respectively did not have access to
water. Their pens contained empty or near empty water receptacles that did not offer enough water in relation to the
number of animals contained therein. Some of the animals were exhibiting signs of heat stress including increased
respiratory rates and foamy mouths. Inspectors requested that the water receptacles in those pens be refilled with water
as soon as possible (time of request approximately 10:30am on August 6th). It was not until 5:00pm on August 6th that
the auction staff showed the inspectors that the water receptacles had been filled.
Contaminated water can cause illness and be unpalatable to animals. All water receptacles must be kept clean and
sanitary. Additionally, if potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as
necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Frequency of water shall consider age, species, condition, size and
type of the animal. Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
A discussion with an auction employee revealed that the facility does not routinely clean the auction barn pens housing
the larger hoof stock. The auction contracts out the cleaning of the barn before and after each auction date. This auction,
sellers were allowed to consign their animals as early as Tuesday August 3rd. Animals that were consigned on Tuesday
could be held in pens with feces, urine and wet hay/straw for the next several days until their new owners remove them
from the premises. For example, two Watusi cattle that had been consigned on Thursday August 5th were residing in a
pen that had wet hay/straw mixed with feces, urine and mud. The auction employee confirmed it was possible the animals
would stay in that pen until the end of the weekend when they were consigned to their new buyers. Several pens housing
cattle and goats respectively contained floors with wet muddy straw intermixed with feces and did not allow the animals a


dry place to rest. Accumulation of excreta attracts pests and increases the likelihood of disease for the animals. Excreta
must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained
therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. Correct prior to the next auction.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The inspection of the auction barn pens revealed the presence of human trash (plastic drink bottles, food containers,
wrappers etc.) in the baby bottle pen area and perched amongst the other pens. The presence of these trash items poses
a risk of foreign body ingestion for the animals and also potentially attracts pests. Premises shall be kept clean and in
good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this
subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the
animals. Correct prior to the next auction.
3.133 Direct

Separation.
In an enclosure housing three bison, two males and one female, the female was observed by inspector to have fresh
superficial skin injuries. One of the larger males was observed pushing her and the smaller male around in their pen. The
pen was relatively small and did not provide the female the ability to separate herself from the two males. The inspectors
spoke with the auction employee as to the possibility of separating the female into her own pen or providing the group
with a larger pen. The auction employee said he would ask if they could be moved but inspectors were unable to follow up
on the outcome.
Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals shall not be housing near animals that
interfere with their health or cause them discomfort. Correct from this day forward.
3.36(e)(2)(i)



Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
At the time of inspection, the licensee had accepted a guinea pig travel cage that did not provide sufficient space for the
animal to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments. The travel cage was approximately 6 inches in
height, however, pink and blue bedding approximately 2 inches thick forced the guinea pig inside to lay flat under the
transport top. The animal was hunched over and could not stand up or sit up. The effective interior height of the primary
enclosures used to transport guinea pigs shall be at least 6 inches (for guinea pigs less than 500 grams) or 7 inches high
(for guinea pigs over 500 grams). Correct prior to the next auction.

This focused inspection was conducted with the facility representative.
