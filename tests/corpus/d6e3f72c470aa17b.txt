ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One goat who lives alone alongside the peccaries has overgrown rear claws. Several aoudads have overgrown
hooves. The foot claws of one aoudad are so long they are slipper like with the front of the claw in the air and one
claw appears to be growing sideways. Overgrown hooves can lead to abnormalities in the bones of the feet as they
can cause the toes to turn improperly. This can lead to lameness and be potentially painful. All animals needing
feet trimming need to have their hooves trimmed promptly and as frequently as necessary for foot health.
The two squirrel monkeys have severe hair loss and redness over their rear legs and most of their tails. One was
seen scratching excessively. Both monkeys are thin. They are around 25 years old and have access to indoor and
outdoor enclosures as weather permits. The attending veterinarian has not evaluated these animals to try and find
out the reason for the fur and weight loss. Because fur and weight loss can be a sign of an underlying medical
condition, these animals need to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian, and any medical conditions treated.
The 4 year old male lion appears to have incoordination in his rear legs. There is a slight swaying to his rear gait
and a swinging out of the legs as he moves. The hocks are abnormally dropped. Abnormal rear limb movements in
lions can be a sign of nutritional deficiencies, parasitic diseases, or other illnesses. The attending veterinarian
needs to evaluate this animal to diagnose any underlying disease and provide treatments.
Abnormal repetitive behaviors are observed for several animals. On the first day of inspection, one 14 year old male
American black bear walked the same small path repetitively for approximately two to three minutes. On the
second day of inspection, this bear was not seen to leave its den except for feeding. The other male bear in that
area was never seen out of its den during most of the two day inspection except for the feeding observed on the
second day. On several previous inspections this same bear was only seen in its den.
The young cougar exhibited abnormal pacing behavior during both inspection days. The same pacing pattern was
seen for several minutes both inspection days. The cougar was observed to show these behaviors from several
positions both within and out of the animal’s sight. Her behavior was recorded on day one at 15:35 and day two at
17:37.A male and a female hamadryas baboon housed in adjacent but separate enclosures both showed some repetitive
behaviors. On the first inspection day, the male was closed into his smaller enclosure and continuously circled. The
female is in estrus as evidenced by sexual swellings, and these animals are not paired to breed. On the second
day of inspection, the male baboon had access to the larger cage, but still repeatedly circled and made a figure
eight pacing pattern on the raised wooden boards at one end of the bigger enclosure. This pattern was only
interrupted when humans came into his line of sight, and resumed once they left his view. The female baboon
repetitively swayed back and forth on all fours in one spot on the floor of the enclosure for over 4 minutes. Then
she stopped momentarily, then resumed the swaying. Her behavior was recorded at two time periods (15:49 and
16:55).
Abnormal behavior patterns can be indicative of physical or psychological issues that may require medical treatment
or habitat/husbandry modification, and must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian in order to receive
appropriate treatment and management. Medical treatments, including routine care, should be documented.
The attending veterinarian came during the inspection and briefly looked at the lion, baboons, two bears and
squirrel monkeys. The cited veterinary care issues were outlined for the attending veterinarian.
Hoof trims need to be corrected by 6-2-17. All other items to be corrected by 6-16-17.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several animal enclosures have items in need of repair or replacement. These include: rotting boards under the
roof edge of the Patagonian cavies’ shelter with exposed nails; chewed boards at bottom edge of the Patagonian
cavies’ shelter; a metal feeder for peccaries with a hole at one end with rough edges; eroded boards at base of
peccaries shelter; loose boards hanging from roof in African crested porcupines’ enclosure; inadequately covered
gap in bison enclosure gate with pointed edges on piece of fencing; gap in gate leading to enclosure for exhibit
camel; wire points sticking out in the fox shift gate opening.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The space for each of 3 American black bears is insufficient to make normal postural and social adjustments for this
species. American black bears have large ranges in the wild, and require exercise which includes walking and
climbing. They also use pools of water to soak, play, and provide cooling. The enclosures for the two 14 year oldmales are two adjacent enclosures approximately 15 feet by 23 feet each(including the den), with a height of six feet
10 inches. Although the enclosures have a natural earth substrate to promote digging, and could be opened to
access additional space with increased height and a shallow water feature suitable for splashing, the access is
apportioned between each of the two bears and two tigers, and therefore limited. The bears have few provisions for
exercise, particularly regarding any substantive walking beyond about 5 or 6 strides in any direction, and no
provisions for climbing, other than on top of the den box, which provides little overhead space. One bear was
observed on top of his den box and when he was standing on it, his head and back were against the ceiling of the
covered enclosure. This same bear was observed to engage in repetitive pacing on the first day of inspection. On
the second day of inspection the other bear stood on its hind legs to scratch its back on a small metal pole.
Although he could stand, his posture was curved and he could not extend completely.
The female bear is housed in a similar enclosure, and unlike the two males, has access to both halves of the
enclosure, for a total enclosure size of about 30 feet by 23 feet (and two shift areas of approximately 12 feet by 12
feet), with a height of six feet 10 inches. . In addition to the same height restriction and lack of climbing provisions as
described above, this bear also lacks access to space with additional height and lacks a water feature. Because the
female bear is approximately 22 years old, provisions for varied exercise options that include water activities and
climbing are especially important in order to preserve muscle tone and joint function in this older animal, as well as
to preserve behavioral health.
The two cougar enclosures are also covered top enclosures with a height of approximately seven feet. While the
cats are able to rest on an elevated surface by jumping on top of their den boxes, there is insufficient height and no
provisions for substantive climbing in these enclosures. Climbing is a species typical activity that constitutes a
normal postural adjustment for cougars.
All of the enclosures need to be of adequate size to allow the contained animals to make all normal postural
adjustments. This includes space to walk, climb, and stretch to a completely extended upright position. The bear
enclosures also need to have water features for species typical exercise and thermoregulation.
To be corrected by 6-1-19.

FEEDING.
The felids at this facility receive assorted chicken parts and grocery meat with Oasis supplementation according to
the licensee. The licensee could not provide an attending veterinarian approved written feeding plan with specific
composition and amounts of food items or supplementation. One young adult male lion appears to be exhibiting
hind limb weakness and incoordination, which can be caused by a number of etiologic agents including dietary
malnutrition. The feeding plan for big cats needs to be documented and reviewed and approved by the attending
veterinarian. To be corrected by 6-16-17.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and curator.
