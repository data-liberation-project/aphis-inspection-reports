PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The wire mesh on the enclosure for the 15 rabbits is in poor repair. The mesh in several areas is broken and sharp
points exist. Pushed in wire mesh is accumulating fecal matter and the area under the enclosure has an excessive
buildup of fecal and food waste. The wood supports in the enclosure are excessively chewed and no longer
structurally sound. Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
rabbits from injury, to contain them, and to keep predators out.

FEEDING.
The feed trough for the goats and sheep was contaminated with excreta and the food was caked in the receptacle.
Food receptacles, if used, shall be sufficient in quantity and located so as to be accessible to all animals in the
enclosure and shall be placed so as to minimize contamination. Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary
at all times. If self-feeders are used, adequate measures shall be taken to prevent molding, contamination, and
deterioration or caking of food. This trough must cleaned properly and maintained so that the feed remains free from
contamination and deterioration.
There are two large blue drums that are used to hold feed for the goats and sheep in the feed storage area. These
two drums have no lids at time of this inspection. An abundance of flies were in and around the feed drums. Lids
must be in use to protect the feed from contamination and deterioration.

SANITATION.
The two pigs that are housed at the far right of the facility had no dry area to lie down on and the flooring wasexcessively wet and full of wet fecal material. The rubber mesh flooring holds the excreta and wet matter under the
mat and is unsanitary. The area smelled strongly of fecal matter and flies were abundant during the inspection.
This enclosure needs to be cleaned properly and kept clean so the animals have a clean dry area to lie down in.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There were hundreds of flies in the animals areas and the feed storage area. Only one fly catcher was in use at
time of this inspection and was full of dead flies. A more aggresive program for the control of flies needs to be
established and maintained.
