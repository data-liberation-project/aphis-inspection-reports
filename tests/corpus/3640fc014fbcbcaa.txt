NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
The licensee interfered with the inspection by failing to report the possession of a juvenile tiger. On inspection, the
licensee was asked multiple times in various ways about the presence of a juvenile tiger on the property that
included, but were not limited to: (cid:28)"Are there any young tigers on the premises?(cid:29)"; "(cid:28)Are there any other tigers on the
premises?(cid:29)"; "(cid:28)Have there been any new tigers brought to this facility in the last six months?"(cid:29); and "(cid:28)When was the
last time a new tiger was brought to the facility?"(cid:29). After each question the licensee replied that there were no other
tigers on the property and specifically no young or juvenile tigers. The licensee stated the last time young tigers
were on her property was back in October. The licensee failed to identify possession of a female juvenile tiger
named "Lilly" also known as Obie. When visiting with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) of the licensee off site, he
confirmed that his clinic treated an injured juvenile tiger on 12/2/2014 at the licensee(cid:25)s facility. Additionally, the AV
asked how the tiger was currently doing demonstrating that he was under the impression the juvenile tiger was still
on the licensee(cid:25)s property recovering from surgery. In order to confirm the presence of this tiger, the APHIS
inspectors returned to the property of the licensee to attempt to locate and inspect this animal. When the
information concerning the tiger was brought to the attention of the licensee, she did confirm that the tiger known as
(cid:28)Lilly(cid:29) was recently returned to her possession from another licensed facility, had been injured after its return, was
treated by the AV 12/2/14, and was still on the property. The licensee claimed that she had "(cid:28)forgotten"(cid:29) about this
tiger because it was housed in another enclosure on the property which was located away from where the other big
cats were housed, in order to minimize contamination and stress while the animal recovered from her injuries.
APHIS officials were led by the licensee to a building called (cid:28)"peacock house"(cid:29) that was located near some aviaries
and away from the other large carnivores. Throughout the duration of the entire inspection, the licensee led
inspectors past this area multiple times. This (cid:28)"peacock house(cid:29)" contained one female juvenile tiger. The APHIS
officials inspected the juvenile tiger and its enclosure. Additionally, during inspection the licensee was questioned
about a specific enclosure that has an adult male lion on one side and two adult tigers on the other. Since the
spacing in the fence was large enough (4in x 4in) for the adults tigers to possibly injury an animal in the enclosure
next to it, the licensee was asked if an animal or specifically a young tiger would ever be put into that specific
enclosure. She stated (cid:28)"Never"(cid:29). Later in the inspection, the licensee revealed Lilly, the female juvenile tiger
described above, was put inside that enclosure though reportedly it was only for "(cid:28)one hour"(cid:29) while staff was
cleaning the primary enclosure. The licensee(cid:25)s failure to inform inspectors about the presence and location of this
animal prevented its evaluation during the initial inspection process. Additionally, the most recent record ofacquisition for this tiger was not available at the time of inspection. The animal was only able to be inspected,
because its existence was confirmed by an outside source and only then did the licensee acknowledge its
presence. A licensee shall not interfere with any APHIS Official in the course of carrying out his or her duties.
Additionally, each exhibitor shall make all facilities, property and animals available for inspection by APHIS Officials
as required by section 2.126(a)(4). It is vital that all animals and animal facilities be inspected to evaluate the
licensee(cid:25)s adherence to the Animal Welfare Act and ensure the well-being of all covered animals. Failure to
accurately report what animals are on the property and where animals are located interferes with the inspector(cid:25)s
duties. Correct by accurately reporting the number and species of animals on the premises, location where the
animals are housed, and correctly answering all other questions asked by APHIS officials during the inspection
process. Correct this day forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The license did not have the most recent records of acquisition for the juvenile female tiger named Lilly. The
absence of acquisition records prevents the animal(cid:25)s movements to be tracked and verified. The licensee shall keep
and maintain all records of acquisition and disposition for all covered species.
The most recent acquisition record for Lilly the juvenile tiger was presented to inspectors at the time of exit. Correct
this day forward.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The enclosure containing the wolf-dog hybrid and one wolf uses two igloo-style dog houses to provide shelter.
Even though the enclosure has a solid roof, these igloos do not have a wind or rain break at the entrance, nor is the
neck of the igloo long enough to ensure that an animal residing inside is sufficiently protected from these elements.
Shelters in outdoor facilities must provide a wind or rain break at the entrance to protect the animals from the
elements. Correct by ensuring that the provided shelters offer protection from wind and rain sufficiently to prevent
the animal from exposure to these elements while inside the house in order to maintain comfort and body
temperature. Correct by 12/13/2014.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The enclosure containing the wolf-dog hybrid and one wolf uses two igloo-style dog houses to provide shelter. The
bedding contained within the dog-houses was a layer of leaves gathered from the ground where they had fallen
months ago; in one of the houses, a small amount of straw was present spilling out of the front of the igloo and none
was visible at the back of the igloo. The other igloo only had leaves. Additionally, the bedding which was present
was significantly wet from rain and soiled with mud and feces. Both the amount and condition of bedding isinsufficient given the temperature at the time of the inspection. The ambient temperature during the inspection was
38-39 degrees Fahrenheit according to readings from the ambient thermometer in the inspector(cid:25)s vehicle and recent
temperatures at night and on several days have been below 35 degrees F. The licensee must provide clean, dry
bedding when the ambient temperature is below 50F. Additional bedding is required when temperatures are below
50F. Failure to provide clean, dry bedding can lead to contamination of the animal, compromise the animal(cid:25)s ability
to keep warm, and pose disease risk if no alternative bedding is available for the animal to nestle in. Correct by
ensuring that adequate clean dry bedding is provided as required and that this bedding is changed or replaced as
often as necessary. Fresh, clean bedding was provided at the time of exit. Correct by 12/8/2014.
3.6(a)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The two igloo shelters in the wolf-dog hybrid enclosure have significant chew damage around the entrances, as well
as brown staining and a layer of grime on the top. The roughened surface created by the chew damage creates an
ideal surface for organic debris and bacteria to accumulate and are not able to be cleaned and sanitized properly.
Failure to repair these areas of damage or replace these shelters poses a risk of disease and contamination which
can negatively affect the animals contained therein. All surfaces of primary enclosures must be readily cleaned
and sanitized as required and must be replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by 12/12/2014.
3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
There is no documented exercise plan for the wolf-dog hybrid. The enclosure housing the dog is of sufficient size to
meet minimum space requirement to not require removal from the primary enclosure for exercise; however, no plan
has been approved by the attending veterinarian. Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate
plan according to their attending veterinarian to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. Correct by
developing a written exercise plan including standard procedures for providing exercise and having it approved by
the Attending Veterinarian. Additionally, this plan must be maintained by the licensee and provided to APHIS
officials on future inspections upon request. Correct by 12/15/2014.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The igloo dog houses provided in the wolf and wolf-dog hybrid enclosure both have dark staining and a layer of
brown film on the top and the sides. The licensee stated that these are power washed every 2 weeks, but no
sanitization protocol is being followed. Lack of cleaning and sanitization allows organic material and bacteria to
proliferate and contaminate the enclosure. Correct by cleaning and sanitizing primary enclosures at least once
every 2 weeks using one of the methods in section 3.11(b)(3), or as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of
dirt, debris, excreta, and other disease hazards. The shelters had been power-washed and sanitized with bleach at
time of exit. Continue to use cleaning and sanitization as often as necessary from this day forward.3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
The licensee stated that the wooden rabbit enclosures are cleaned with a power washer every 6 months and soiled
bedding is removed and replaced with new bedding every 2-3 days or as often as the licensee believes is
necessary. No sanitization protocol is followed currently. Also, the entrance to the sheltered portion of one of the
rabbit enclosures is significantly chewed on the edges. Failure to properly clean and sanitize primary enclosures
can allow bacteria to proliferate and therefore poses a risk of both disease and contamination to the animals
contained therein. Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures for rabbits are cleaned and sanitized at least once
every 30 days through one of the methods prescribed in section 3.56(b)(3) such as cleaning with an appropriate
detergent followed by the application of a safe, effective disinfectant solution . Additionally, all bedding must be
removed and replaced at least weekly or as often as necessary as required by section 3.56(a)(2). Wooden surfaces
that have significant chew damage cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and should be repaired or replaced to
facilitate adequate cleaning and sanitation. All rabbit enclosures had been cleaned and sanitized with an
appropriate disinfectant at the time of exit. Continue to follow proper cleaning and sanitization from this day
forward.
3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The adult female Sulawesi Crested Macaque enclosure has several sharp points from a section of wire mesh that
was cut to hang a water bottle on the outside. Surfaces in the housing facilities of non-human primates must be
free of jagged edges and sharp points that may injure the animals. Correct by ensuring that these sharp edges are
removed or made inaccessible to the animal so they do not protrude into the enclosure and pose a risk of injury to
the animal. Corrected at time of exit interview.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** A juvenile female tiger named Lilly was injured in its primary enclosure prior to inspection. The injury resulted in a
wound on the inside of the left front leg that required treatment by the attending veterinarian including multiple
sutures and the amputation of one toe. The licensee admitted that the tiger had been in at least two primary
enclosures while on her property. One enclosure, which the licensee stated that the tiger had only been in for a
short time was located between another enclosure housing an adult lion and a second enclosure housing one adult
tiger. The separation between the juvenile and adult tigers while in this enclosure consisted only of wire fencing with
holes approximately 4(cid:29)x4(cid:29). These holes are large enough to allow either the juvenile tiger to reach into the adults or
the adults to reach into the enclosure containing the juvenile which could have resulted in serious injury of the
juvenile tiger. According to the licensee, the tiger was actually injured earlier in the week while housed in the
enclosure known as the (cid:28)peacock house(cid:29) area. She stated that while in that area, its left front paw was caught inbetween metal piping used for the framework of the chain-link fencing and the chain-link fence itself. The licensee
stated that she believed the injury resulted from the tiger chewing on its own paw and leg in order to free itself.
According to the attending veterinarian and medical records, the left front leg was torn and a toenail was (cid:28)ripped off(cid:29).
The veterinarian sutured the wounds and provided antibiotics, fluids, and analgesics for the injuries. On inspection,
the juvenile tiger was bright, alert, and responsive. One toe (digit 3) from the left front leg had been amputated and
properly sutured closed, and the inside of the same leg was shaved. There was a 4-5 inch long cut in the shaved
area of the left front leg with multiple sutures along the cut. It is clear from the injuries sustained by this tiger that the
primary enclosure failed to adequately protect it from injury. Injuries not only decrease animal welfare, but those that
lead to disfigurement of the paw also may lead to chronic pain. Correct this day forward.
**The enclosure housing two adult white tigers had a hole underneath the metal chain link fencing of the primary
enclosure that measured 7 inches in depth and approximately 1 foot across. There is no underground fencing.
Holes underneath the primary enclosure fence line can not only result in an escape but also be a danger to the
animal if a foot, leg, or head gets trapped underneath the fence. The licensee said the tigers do dig sometimes and
gravel will be used to fill in the hole at the end of the day. The guillotine door used to permit access to others
sections of the enclosure was determined to be in disrepair and does not protect the two adult white tigers from
potential injury. The clip used to securely keep the metal guillotine door in the open position was broken and the
metal cable attached to the guillotine door was tied to the chain link fencing of the primary enclosure to keep the
door open. One tiger could easily cause the metal cable to become unraveled which could result in injury to the
other tiger. The weight of the metal door could easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an
animal. There is no counterweight or secondary mechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force.
The licensee untied the cable and closed the door. The licensee stated the guillotine door will be left in the down
position until the clip is repaired. Stone gravel was used to fill in the hole, and the clip for the guillotine door had
been replaced at time of exit. Continue to ensure primary enclosures are in good repair and protect the animals
from possible injuries.
**The enclosure of a young male kangaroo does not protect the animal from injury. There is a black electric cord
used to provide heat that is in reach of the kangaroo. Electric cords in reach of an animal represent both a risk of
entanglement and an electrical hazard which can cause burns or electrocution if the cord is chewed on. Additionally,
a wooden door on the inside of the enclosure is in disrepair and has sharp edges. The door has a missing wood
plank, but the nails used to attach the plank are still present. These nails protrude out approximately 1 inch and are
at the level of the animal. The nails and deteriorating, splintering wood are sharp objects in the enclosure that could
cause injury to an animal. The electric cord was fixed in a higher position, and the nails in the door had been bent
down to eliminate sharp protrusions. The wood of the door is still splintered and is slated to be replaced according
to the licensee. Correct by 12/13/2014.
** The enclosure with one adult fox has an area where feet could go through chain link fencing. The fox enclosure
has chain link fencing underneath the enclosure to prevent escape from digging; however, as water has been
dumped (daily) for cleaning purposes it has eroded the soil underneath the water bucket and surrounding area. Theeroded soil has created an area approximately 3 square feet surrounding the water bowl in which the foxes(cid:25) feet
easily pass through the chain link fencing to stand on the ground below. Since this area in surrounding the water
bowl, animals must walk over this area frequently in order to access water. Feet or legs can become injured if an
animal becomes entangled in the chain link fencing. Stone gravel was placed to fill in the hole underneath the
fencing at the time of exit. Correct by 12/10/2014.
**The plastic white igloo used in the young male grizzly bear(cid:25)s enclosure as a den is in disrepair. The entrance in
the igloo has been significantly chewed on and a 3 inch piece has been broken off at the entranceway. Objects in
the primary enclosure that are in disrepair are unable to be properly cleaned and may serve as a route to spread
infection to the bear in the enclosure. Correct by 12/25/2014.
**In the field comprising part of the primary enclosure for one donkey, 8 goats, and one sheep there is an
approximately 5 inch diameter white plastic pipe sticking out of the ground near a fence line that contains several
animals on the other side . The pipe has a jagged edge and rose approximately 6-7 inches out of the ground.
Animals were seen walking in the area of the pipe and the donkey was observed repeatedly running in this area as
it interacted with animals on the other side of the fence. The licensee stated the pipe was a clean out port for
drainage. As it is currently situated this pipe is a hazard to the animals in the enclosure. A foot could easily become
trapped or cut by the pipe and cause serious injury. Correct by 12/22/2014.
The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although an
8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, there were eight large mature trees within 3 feet of the
perimeter fence that had no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the perimeter
fence. Additionally, there were piles of building material and animal husbandry items leaned up against or near the
perimeter fence that could be used as elevated platform to jump over the perimeter fence. The presence of these
materials against the fencing effectively reduces the height of the perimeter fence. A substantial perimeter fence
that is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that
contain potentially dangerous animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event
of an accidental escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the
property and endangering public safety thereby placing the animal(cid:25)s life in jeopardy. Correct by removing all
building materials and other debris that are in close proximity to the perimeter fence and altering trees in a manner
to ensuring the perimeter fence can adequately function as a secondary containment system. Some but not all of
the items listed above were removed at the time of exit. Correct by 12/31/2014.3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Multiple loaves of bread found in the pantry had significant amounts of dark green to white material on the outside
surface of the bread and had the overall appearance of mold. Some loaves were more than 50 percent covered in
this material. All bread was wrapped in plastic. While no bread seen in any of the enclosures had the appearance of
mold growth, items stored in the pantry will be considered food for the intention of feeding to the animals.
Contaminated food items can be toxic and may harm animals if fed. The licensee must ensure that all food is
wholesome, palatable, free from contamination, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals
in good health. Correct by ensuring that any food items which are spoiled or otherwise contaminated are promptly
removed from food storage so that they do not contaminate remaining food supplies and by ensuring that all food
fed to animals is otherwise wholesome and palatable. All spoiled food had been removed at the time of exit.
Continue to remove moldy and other spoiled food from the main feed storage area from this day forward.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The enclosure containing the 2 red fox have plastic igloo shelters that are covered with urine, feces, dirt and grime.
The elevated perch the foxes utilize is positioned directly above the two igloos and the licensee stated that they will
sit on the perch and urinate/defecate and it drips on top of the igloos. The igloos must be cleaned and maintained
on a more frequent basis to ensure the animals can remain clean and to reduce disease hazards. The licensee
must ensure that all excreta is removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of
the animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors. Correct by ensuring that the primary enclosures for all
animals are cleaned as often as necessary. Shelters had been cleaned and sanitized at the time of exit. Continue
to follow proper protocols as often as necessary from this day forward.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
At least six rodent holes were noted throughout the facility, both inside and outside the animal enclosures.
Specifically, one very large hole, (approximately 6 inches in diameter) was found inside the black leopard enclosure
behind the den box. The licensee stated that she believed this hole may have been created by a groundhog,
whereas the smaller holes were created by rats that had been noted on the premises. The licensee has bait boxes
positioned in multiple locations on the property, and stated that poison was put down the holes in the past week, but
that new holes appear on a regular basis. The continued occurrence of new rat holes is an indicator that the current
methods used for pest control are insufficient. Wild animals, including mammalian pests, can carry and transmit
disease to animals maintained by the licensee. A safe and effective pest control program must be established and
maintained by the licensee to minimize the presence of mammalian pests, which pose a risk of disease to the
regulated animals. The licensee contacted a professional pest control consultant and has moved bait boxes andplaced poison according to their instructions. Continue to maintain an effective pest control program from this day
forward.
The inspection was conducted on 12/5/2014 with the facility president and a verbal exit interview pointing out all
areas of concern was conducted at that time. The formal exit interview and written report delivery was completed
on 12/8/2014 with the facility president.
