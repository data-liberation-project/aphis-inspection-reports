ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The juvenile male lion was been evaluated by the attending veterinarian for hind-end muscle wasting and ataxia in
April 2017, with the instructions to monitor for further progress. At the time of the inspection this animal showed
signs of decreased muscle mass in the hind-end. On the animals right hip there was a lesion that was 1 inch by 1
inch in size. The lesion was pink and moist that showed signs of tissue healing along the edges. Facility
representatives indicated that the lion had been injured by the adult female several weeks ago while feeding. When
watching the male lion move around the enclosure, he was limping and appeared ataxic especially after jumping
onto the platform. The veterinarian was not contacted to re-evaluate this animal after he has continued to decline or
after the injury.
Appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be utilized. This male lion
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of assessment, treatment, and plan for the animal
shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.
Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on 20 October 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
