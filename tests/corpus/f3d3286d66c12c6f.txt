FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In the Giraffe Barn there was only one working fluorescent light above the feed trough. There was another
fluorescent fixture mounted on the center interior roof of the barn but the bulbs were non-functional. Very little
outdoor light can be seen from within the barn. The giraffe is confined to the barn when the outside temperature is
too cold, which could potentially last multiple days depending on the weather. In a barn this size, the current
amount of lighting is not sufficient. This lack of light could potentially affect the giraffe's mental and physical
well-being. It also hampers the ability of facility personnel to properly clean the area, and to adequately evaluate
the giraffe.
This affects one giraffe.
Indoor housing facilities shall have ample lighting, by natural or artificial means, or both, of good quality, distribution,
and duration as appropriate for the species involved. Such lighting shall be uniformly distributed and of sufficient
intensity to permit routine inspection and cleaning. Lighting of primary enclosures shall be designed to protect the
animals from excessive illumination.
