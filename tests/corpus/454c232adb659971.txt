3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The dogs that were in the North Pens with the excessively rusted metal divider panel that was cited from last
inspection were moved to different runs. However, the other divider cited has not been repaired or replaced, and
dogs are still being housed in this run. During this inspection, one additional divider currently being used was found
rusted at the bottom. The rusted area was exposed due to the shifting of the substrate since last inspection. This
divider is rusted to the point of having a jagged edge.
Excessive rust prevents proper cleaning and sanitization, causing possible disease hazards, and can affect
structural strength.
The licensee must repair the rusted areas or replace the panels. The licensee must create and follow a program of
maintenance to ensure that all surfaces are free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization, and affects the structural strength, as part of the facility’s regular plan.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A doghouse in the West Pens is still chewed on the top section of the entrance. Several other doghouses now have
edges that are also chewed and roughened.
Chewed and roughened surfaces are difficult to properly clean and sanitize, creating disease hazards.
These surfaces must be repaired or replaced to ensure proper cleaning and sanitization. The licensee must
develop and follow a regular maintenance program that ensures all surfaces including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, are repaired or
replaced when worn or soiled as part of the facility’s regular plan.3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the Sheltered Building, there is still grime and uneaten food in the wash-down gutters. Most of the inside of
the doggie doors in both the Sheltered Building and the Whelping Building also have a build-up of a greasy brown
material on their surfaces. In the outdoor housing area, many of the runs still have an excessive build-up of feces.
When asked, a facility representative stated that it was last Thursday since the runs were last raked, which was five
days before this inspection. In addition, in the Whelping Building, two enclosures have still have rubber mats that
have an extreme amount of dirt and grime ground into them.
Dirt, grime, and fecal buildup create disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces and all other surfaces to which the dogs are exposed are
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with subpart 3.11 (b) to prevent the accumulation of excreta and
reduce disease hazards. If removable surfaces such as rubber mats cannot be sufficiently cleaned and sanitized,
they must be replaced. Floors made of dirt, sand, gravel, or other similar materials must be raked or spot-cleaned
with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta.
3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Many of the dogs housed outdoors still had little to no bedding in their doghouses at the time of inspection.
Although there was some bedding scattered in many of the runs indicating the dogs had pulled it out of the
doghouses, fresh bedding had not been added. One dog had recently been shaved completely down. His
doghouse had only a small amount of bedding around the outer edges, and it did not even cover the floor. The time
of inspection was between 1:00 to 2:30 pm, and the recorded temperature in the region at 2:53 pm according to
wunderground.com was 41 degrees Fahrenheit, with sustained winds of 19 mph from the North, resulting in a wind
chill of 30.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Maximum wind gusts were reported at a speed of 47 mph. The minimum
temperature recorded in the region on the previous night was 18 degrees Fahrenheit, with a wind chill of 14 degrees
Fahrenheit.

Having little or no bedding in low temperatures can cause major stress and discomfort, and affect the health and
well-being of the animals.
The licensee must continuously monitor the temperature to ensure that all dogs are provided with clean, dry,
bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and ensure additional clean, drybedding is provided when the temperature is 35 degrees or lower.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was still a bird’s nest on one side above the upper enclosures in the outdoor portion of the Sheltered Building.
Although no dogs were present in the upper enclosures, they were present in the lower enclosures. This nest was
removed during the inspection.
Pests and vermin create disease hazards to the dogs.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of insects, external parasites, and bird
and mammal pests, to promote the health and well-being of the animals and to reduce contamination by pests in all
animal areas as part of the facility’s regular plan.
3.12
EMPLOYEES.
The number of repeat non-compliances cited during this inspection indicates the facility does not have enough
employees to carry out proper husbandry standards.
Each person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations must have enough employees to carry out the level of
husbandry practices and care required in this subpart.
The licensee must acquire employee(s) to help with cleaning, maintenance and husbandry practices to maintain the
health and well-being of the animals in the facility. The acquired employees must be supervised by an individual
who has the knowledge, background, and experience in proper husbandry and care of the dogs, and to supervise
others. The employer must ensure that these employees can perform to these standards.
To be corrected by April 13, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility's representatives.Additional Inspectors
