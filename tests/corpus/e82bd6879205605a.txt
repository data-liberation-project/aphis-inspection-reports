HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The concrete floor in the "mouse" building needs to be repaired. In the center primate enclosure a low spot has
developed in the concrete flooring where water stands after the floor has been cleaned. The concrete has
degraded in this area to the underlying gravelly surface which is so rough and uneven that the water cannot be
swept or squeeged away. The concrete has turned black in this area and does not respond to bleach indicating that
the flooring can no longer be sanitized as requred. Regular sanitization of indoor surfaces with which the primates
come into contact is an important part of the disease control program. The area of the flooring that has become
degraded must be repaired so that it can be properly cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 22 June 2014.
An exit interview was conducted with the owners.
