3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On 5/2/22, facility employees discovered that two adult male white-tailed deer (tags #500 and #19) were dead in their
enclosure. Employees found a freshly dug hole beneath the fence along the edge of the enclosure along with a fresh paw
print and hairs consistent with a coyote or similar predator, so facility personnel concluded that the two bucks had died
from predation. The facility promptly repaired the hole beneath the fence and no additional incidents of predation have
been identified on the property since that time. Animals that die from predation suffer from stress and pain. Correct by
today, 8/10/22, by ensuring that enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals. This item was corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, and the exit interview was conducted with the Attending
Veterinarian, the IACUC chair, and the Director of Research Compliance and Security.
