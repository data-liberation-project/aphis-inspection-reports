Facilities, general.
On December 14, 2021, seven donkeys escaped from their enclosure in the middle of the night. One male, research
donkey, #1856, escaped the enclosure, walked to the road, and was struck by a vehicle resulting in the animal's death.
It is important for regulated facilities to provide appropriate animal housing to prevent escape and possible injury to the
animals.
The facility must be constructed and maintained as appropriate for the animals involved to protect them from injury and to
contain the animals. During the inspection, the facility constructed an additional gate on the barn to prevent escapes in
the future, and the IACUC is further investigating the situation.
Correct by December 29, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
