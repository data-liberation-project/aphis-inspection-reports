3.106(b)(3)

Water quality.
Review of water quality records denoted missing entries for coliform counts. The intermittent pattern of missing test
results first occurred in January 2020, recurring sporadically in February 2020, April 2020, May 2020, and April 2021.
When asked if the results could be retrieved from a backup log, the facility representative stated results are only entered
in the electronic database upon receipt.
Routine water sampling and testing is essential to uphold water quality standards. Doing so identifies quality control
problems in a timely manner to prevent conditions that are harmful to the animals that inhabit the pools. Water in all pools
shall be sampled and tested for coliform counts at least weekly to maintain water quality standards.
