*** A Shitzu/Maltese identified as # 93300012012 “Willy” was heavily matted over 90% of his body. The heavy
matted fur in the anal region was trapping fecal material making it difficult for the dog to continue to defecate.
Heavily matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing potential skin irritations and can be painful.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There was a young single puppy in a sheltered run with its dam. The dam would leave the puppy to go outside and
the metal shift door would not close all the way resulting in drafts coming into the sheltered area. The puppy did not
have a working heat lamp and with temperatures in the 50’s direct air drafts on this puppy could jeopardize its
health as it was visibly shivering. In an adjacent enclosure another two young puppies were also next to the shift
door where drafts were coming into the enclosure and these puppies were curled next to each other for warmth.
The facility needs to address these whelping areas by minimizing drafts.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Housekeeping inside the sheltered building needs to be addressed at this facility. There is a shelf area over anenclosure that is holding lamp bulbs, clippers, cleaning supplies and there is an accumulation of dead flies on the
shelf, on the floor and around the mini fridge. An effective program for pest control must also address the dead
pests’ removal to continue to reduce disease hazards. Additionally there were multiple empty enclosures that were
dirty and had not been cleaned contributing to poor housekeeping conditions. These areas need to be addressed to
facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control.
