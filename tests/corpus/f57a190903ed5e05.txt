3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
This inspection focused on the perimeter fence and efforts to deter predators.

Whereas the facility’s efforts to reinforce and improve the enclosure and perimeter fencing are apparent, some deficits in
the perimeter fencing were found at the time of inspection:
- A large hole that measured approximately 14” x 24” where a seam had pulled open behind the Hill livestock enclosure,
near Vista;
- Some gaps under the fencing measuring up to 7 inches, including one with evidence of animal traffic under the fence;
- A remote gate in part of the fencing that extends behind and above the rhino / red river hog area was found to be
unlocked and open, and was difficult to close due to an accumulation of soil, suggesting it had been open for some time;
- One creek area had a large opening underneath the fence in need of reinforcement near the southwest corner of the
perimeter;
- A tree has fallen on the fence, creating an easy pathway for people or animals to pass through, near Franz Valley Road.
Failure to maintain the perimeter fencing in good repair can allow people or animals to access the facility, putting the
exhibit animals at risk.



The facility must ensure that the perimeter fencing is maintained in good repair at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
