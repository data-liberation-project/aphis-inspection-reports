HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This facility allows public feeding of adult tigers. The public stands behind a 4 foot barrier fence that is
approximately 36 inches from the primary enclosure housing the adult tiger. The public then is permitted to place a
metal pole, designed with blunt point on the end to hold meat, into the enclosure and allow the tiger to eat it.
During this inspection, one adult female member of the public was noticed reaching over the barrier fence towards
the primary enclosure fence. A handler is present during this public feeding to place the piece of meat onto the
pole. This method of public feeding of adult tigers is not being done as carefully as possible as there is potential for
public contact with an adult tiger should the public reach over the barrier fence or get pulled by the tiger should the
animal grab the pole. Additionally, there is potential of harm to the tiger from being poked by the pole, perhaps
inadvertently, from an untrained member of the public. Correct this by ensuring handling of animals, including this
public feeding, is done as carefully as possible to not cause physical harm to the animals or public.
Correct from this day forward

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The show ring consists of 11-foot high chain link panels with a decorative arch that tops each panel, adding
approximately 12 additional inches of height to the panel. The entire ring is topped with a shade tarp held down to
the enclosure panels with rubber straps. During the show, four tigers sat on pedestals ranging from five feet, three
feet, and 1.5-2 feet tall. These pedestals are placed immediately next to the enclosure wall panels. Even though
the tigers are not in the ring unsupervised, the ring is structurally inadequate to contain the tigers or act as a
sufficient barrier between the animals and the public. Two handlers were in the show ring during this performance
with the 4 tigers. On several occasions, both handlers were noted on the far side of the ring from one tiger perched
on the 5 foot pedestal. If that tiger were motivated, it could potentially climb or jump out of the enclosure. The
public was located immediately outside of a barrier fence around the performance ring. Correct this by ensuring
that there is a sufficient barrier or distance between the public and the animals at all times to ensure the safety of
both the animals and the public. Correct by August 1, 2019.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Seven tigers are housed in enclosures which measure 4 feet high by 8 feet square. 3 tigers are housed alone in 3
enclosures and 4 are housed in groups of 2 with shift doors opened to make their enclosures 16 feet square.
However, these enclosures do not allow the animals to make normal postural behaviors such as stretching to their
full vertical height or to sit in a fully erect posture. The licensee stated that the tigers are allowed access to the
performance ring one time each morning for approximately 20 minutes, and then also when they are performing.
During the performance observed by inspectors today, only 4 of the tigers were outside of their enclosures for the
duration of the approximately 30-minute performance, the other 3 were not offered time outside of their enclosures.
The owner stated this was for safety concerns with livestock animals nearby. The owner stated that they left their
home faciility earler this month and will be on the road until October. The owner also stated that at their home site,
tigers are let into a larger enclosure with a pool every day. The temporary housing enclosures used while on travel
do not allow the animals to perform their normal postural adjustments, including stretching vertically and sitting fully
erect. Correct by ensuring that the animals have adequate space to perform normal postural adjustments and
freedom of movement.
