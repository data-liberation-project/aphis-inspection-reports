CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the cat building, there are six adult cats that have access to multiple litter boxes. The cats are choosing to use
just one of the litter boxes and the box is filled with a large amount of cat waste and very little clean space in this
box is available. The facility representative stated that the litter boxes are cleaned every other day. An excessive
amount of waste can have a negative impact on the health of the cats as well as create strong odors and ammonia
buildup.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent excessive accumulation of feces
and food waste, to prevent soiling of the animals, and to reduce disease hazards, pests and odors.. The facility
must remove all the waste from the litter boxes daily to ensure that there is no accumulation of waste and to support
the health of the cats.
To be corrected by: From this day forward litter boxes must have waste removed every day.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Each dog enclosure contains an access door that allows the dogs to go outdoors. At least six of these access
doors have a thick, dark buildup of dirt and organic material on their surfaces. At least six adult dogs use these
access doors. The buildup of dirt and organic material could have a negative impact on the health of the animals.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2
weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease
hazards. The facility must clean and sanitize the access doors at least once every 2 weeks and more often if
necessary to eliminate the buildup of dirt and to support the health of the dogs.
