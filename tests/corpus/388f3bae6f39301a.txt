HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
-Rainforest of the Americas Exhibit- Jaguars: The jaguars are housed in a primary enclosure consisting of a steel
mesh with a public barrier fence approximately 15 to 20 ft. in distance from this enclosure. In front of this barrier is a
resting bench, and at time of inspection, 3 to 5 children were observed standing on it. The location of this bench
diminishes the effectiveness of the public barrier as it is possible for a member of the public to easily step over the
barrier fence and have access to the primary enclosure. The mesh openings of this primary enclosure are large
enough to place fingers through and pose the risk of public contact with the animals.
To be corrected by September 1, 2015
-Tiger exhibit: The public barrier present at the front of this exhibit is approximately 4ft. in overall height with
approximately the lower 1 to 1.5 ft. consisting of concrete block in several sections. Several members of the public,
including children and a young teen, were observed standing on the concrete block sections during inspection. The
overall effectiveness of the public barrier fence is reduced due to the public being able to step up on this lower
concrete portion of the barrier, and subsequently posing a risk of accidental public contact with the animals.
To be corrected by January 15, 2016
Sufficient distance and/or barriers must exist between the animals inside the enclosures and persons outside so as
to prevent physical contact between animals and the public. A sufficient and effective public barrier system to
assure the safety of the animals and the public must be in place.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On July 2, 2015, two cotton-top tamarins were found missing from their open exhibit. They were housed on an
island-like peninsula in the tapir exhibit located in the Rainforest of the Americas exhibit; however, the design of this
enclosure allows several areas or access points which would permit entry of un-authorized animals. According to a
facility representative, the remains of one tamarin was found, and despite repeated extensive searches of the
surrounding areas and hillsides, no evidence of the second animal has been found and it is now presumed dead.
The facility representative stated footage from the cameras in the area showed a bobcat carrying off one tamarin,
heading in the direction of where the remains were found. The facility representative stated they have spotted abobcat, but have been unsuccessful in capturing it. The remaining animals in the Rainforest of the Americas exhibit,
including non-human primates and other mammals, are in closed enclosures and/or are brought in at night. The
facility has been actively trying to contain the bobcat and have sought and secured professional help. Increased
surveillance in this area after hours has been implemented.
Given that the bobcat is still loose, the facility cannot exclude the possibility of other animals being at risk. Failure to
appropriately construct and/or design animal housing facilities which prohibit entry of unauthorized animals poses
risks or hazards to all animals at this facility. Housing facilities for non-human primates must protect the animals
from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. A system should be in place and
maintained to ensure this.
To be corrected from this day forward
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
