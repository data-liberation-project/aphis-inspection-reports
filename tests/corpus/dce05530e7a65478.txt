** The outdoor enclosure for the sheep had several items in it that could potentially injure the animals. Along the
fencing there were areas with old cow panels with pointy ends and barbed wire intertwined in the fence. Any items
that can possibly injury the animals within their primary enclosure must be removed. Correct by 8/8/2015.
The exit briefing was conducted with the Interim University Veterinarian.
