HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
2.131(b)(1)
Fifteen puppies, many of which were medium to large breeds, on one transport vehicle were displaying signs of
excessive thirst. Three of the enclosures contained 4 puppies and one contained 3 puppies. The truck attendant
was in the process of watering the animals inside the truck and had not yet reached these puppies. Once provided
water, the puppies were observed drinking continuously, in some cases for up to 2 minutes without stopping. The
puppies were pushing each other to get to the water and they were all trying to fit their heads into the water
containers to drink; however, they could not all access the water at the same time because the containers were
small, holding about 1-2 cups of water each. As one puppy would raise its head, another would push its face into
the container to drink. The puppies quickly depleted the water. Four Blue Heeler puppies in one enclosure were
observed licking the empty receptacle and chewing on the sides until a second serving of water was provided of
which they also drank completely. An inadequate supply of water can result in unnecessary discomfort and physical
harm. The registrant was verbally instructed to ensure that all dogs are provided with an adequate supply of water
as frequently as necessary to ensure their comfort and well-being from this point forward. TO BE CORRECTED

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
3.14(e)(1)
There were two enclosures, each containing 4 puppies, on the (cid:28)West Route(cid:29) transport vehicle in which the puppies
were not provided adequate space. The puppies in these enclosures did not have enough space for all puppies to
lie down in a normal position or turn around without contacting the other puppies in the enclosure. When all the
puppies were lying down, there was no visible open floor space in the enclosures. Without adequate space these
puppies cannot make normal postural adjustments which are crucial to their health and well-being. Primary
enclosures used to transport dogs must provide adequate space for each animal to turn about normally while
standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6/4/2015
