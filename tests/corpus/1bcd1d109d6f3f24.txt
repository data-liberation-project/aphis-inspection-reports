2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Changes regarding the use of animals in protocol #18-021, involving nonhuman primates, were not approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The protocol was approved for the use of six nonhuman
primates, which were going to be placed on a different study following the completion of this particular protocol. The
study director did not notify the IACUC of a protocol change, in which the six nonhuman primates were euthanized.
After the IACUC learned of the protocol deviation, the committee retroactively passed an amendment, approving the
euthanasia.
Unapproved significant changes to a protocol can result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animals'
welfare at risk. Unapproved changes also prevent the IACUC from having the proper authority to assure the proper
care and use of animals in research projects.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review and
approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or withhold approval of proposed significant changes
regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.
To be corrected from this date forward.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on June 19-20 and the exit interview was conducted with
facility representatives on June 21st.
