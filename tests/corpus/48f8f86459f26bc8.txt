2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:50 pm on
01/19/2016.
Inspector attempted to contact the licensee at both home telephone and cell phone numbers on file. Contact
information was provided by the facility on 2-6-14 along with optimal time for inspection of after 4:00 pm. Calls were
made at 3:51 pm to the cell phone and a message was left, and at 3:53 pm to the house phone that had no answer.
APHIS inspector then waited until 4:20 pm when the house phone was called again, without an answer. The cell
phone on file was called again at 4:21 pm and a second message left. The inspector then waited until 4:30 pm
before leaving the facility. This facility has a gate across the driveway entrance that does not allow access to the
house.
Failure to allow APHIS officials to complete an unannounced inspection does not satisfy the requirements of the
Animal Welfare Act and makes it impossible to determine if the facility is in compliance with the Act and its
regulations.
Correct this by ensuring adequate availability is provided to allow for unannounced inspections in the future.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
