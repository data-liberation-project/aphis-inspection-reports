ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:05 pm on
30-Aug-16. In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I knocked on the door, honk the vehicle horn and call the phone
number provided.
This attempt will be sent regular mail.
