2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The report to the Institutional Official (IO) dated Oct 29, 2014 for the semi-annual inspection which had taken place
in September 2014 did not distinguish in the facility inspection findings between significant and minor deficiencies.
The IACUC is responsible for ensuring that the semi-annual reports submitted to the IO are first reviewed and
signed by a majority of the members, include any minority views, identify any departures from the Animal Welfare
Act and state the reasons, distinguish significant from minor deficiencies, and contain a plan and schedule with
dates of correction for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct this item from this point forward.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In October 2014, it was reported to the IACUC that study personal conducted procedures on several nile rats under
protocol #14005 that involved multiple intracardiac blood collections taken under anesthesia at times 0, 30, and at
60 minutes followed by euthanasia while only a single intracardiac blood collection under anesthesia prior to
euthanasia was approved by the IACUC. This increase in blood collections has the potential to adversely affect the
animals. The principal investigator must ensure that a proposal to make a significant change in an ongoing activity
involving animals contains a complete description of the proposed use. The facility has addressed this issue with
several corrective actions, one of which is the activity is no longer being conducted, and another is further training of
the study personnel.
This item has been addressed by the IACUC.

An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
