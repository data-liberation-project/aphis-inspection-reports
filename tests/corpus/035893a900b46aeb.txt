3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
On April 28, 2022 the adult, female elk known as "Patty" sustained injuries from entanglement in the primary enclosure
fence while being herded into a separate holding pen for safety purposes. The pen the animals were herded into had a
section of missing panel, which the keepers did not realize was missing, as they believed it had been recently repaired.
"Patty" was following the male elk, "Garrett" through the opening created by the missing panel when she ensnared her left
hind leg in the edge of the paneling below the missing section; when the animal jerked her leg free, it resulted in a badly
fractured limb. One of the contracted veterinarians responded to the scene immediately afterward and confirmed that the
left cannon bone was irreparably shattered. "Patty" was sedated and then euthanized on site by the veterinarian. The
panel was welded in place immediately following the incident to create a secure enclosure.
Primary enclosures that are not able to contain animals safely and securely, pose a risk of injury to animals and humans.
The facility must ensure that all enclosures and fences are constructed as appropriate for the animals involved, and that
they are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
