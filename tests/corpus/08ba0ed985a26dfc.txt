Facilities, general.
Multiple small areas areas associated with seams along the metal lining on the wall of the goat pen were rusted and
peeling up away from the wall, creating roughened edges with the potential for goats to rub against and pull apart further.
If the metal wall liners are not kept in good repair, there is a potential for animal injury. The facility must ensure that the
facility is structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
