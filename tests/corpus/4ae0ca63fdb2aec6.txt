HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection today, the inspector noticed that the public (adults and children) were petting and feeding
animals without any employee/attendant present. There is a barrier present between the public and the non-human
primates but not for any of the other species present including a zebra, camels, llamas, alpacas, goats, sheep, pigs,
fallow deer, kangaroo, zebu, rabbits, cavy, and prairie dogs. The only attendant noted present at the exhibit was the
cashier who does not have a direct line of sight on any of the animals. To prevent injury to the public and the
animals and to ensure proper human-animal interactions/feeding, an attendant must be present. The facility shall
ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant is present at all times
during periods of public contact. Correct immediately.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the start of this inspection (11:30am), three enclosure pens (one housing one dromedary camels, one housingthree llamas including a young baby and one housing three alpacas including a young baby) did not have any
shade. The animals did not currently show any obvious signs of heat related issues. The pens are located at the
edge of a three sided roofed structure and will be in the shade in the afternoons. Due to the angle of the sun the
animals are not able to get out of the sun until mid afternoon. Temperatures today was already 86 deg F (Kestral) at
11:30 am. Adequate shade is necessary to provide protection from sunlight and to help prevent overheating stress
especially for the young animals. Correct by ensuring that all animals have sufficient shade to protect themselves
from direct sunlight at all times.
