2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(c)(1) during public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
During public drive through, hoof stock (llama, yak, fallow deer, zebra) are sticking their heads into car windows.
This creates the potential for direct animal contact with the public and possible animal bites. Animals must not have
direct contact with the public without being under the control of park personnel. A program/procedure must be in
place to ensure there is no unsupervised contact with animals and park visitors. This is needed to comply with
USDA regulations and to protect the safety of the public and park animals.

2.131(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(2) a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.
Although there is a park patrol procedure in place, it needs to be modified to create a regular and visible presence
to the visiting public. This patrol should not be implemented on an as needed procedure, but as patrol for the entire
time the park is open. This in needed to comply with USDA regulations and to enforce park rules on animal contact,
traffic control, and public feeding.Correct by: August/15/2014
Note:
Public feeding of the animals is allowed in the park and within USDA regulations. USDA realizes this additional food
is more of a "snack" and not the animals(cid:25) daily diet. However, it is strongly advised that a gradual transition to a
more species appropriate snack be implemented. Suggest vegetables, grain, forage, etc. This snack food should be
approved by the attending veterinarian and park administration. This transition should be started as soon as
possible.
