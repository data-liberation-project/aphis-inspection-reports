2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dogs #577, and #576 are Soft-coated Wheaton females. Both dogs have tartar accumulation on the canines and
cheek teeth. The PVC addresses dogs with this level of periodontal disease, and requires hand scaling and dental
spray, or, as an alternative, chlorhexidine in the water supply. The licensee has not yet initiated any prevention or
treatment for dental disease. The attending veterinarian is due for the kennel walk-through at the end of this month.
The PVC says the Attending Veterinarian will grade all the dogs and prescribe treatment, if necessary. Failure to
prevent and treat periodontal disease can result in infection, dental pain, loss of teeth, and damage to the overall
health of the animal. Correct by having these two dogs, and all dogs with dental disease, examined by the
attending veterinarian, and follow the treatment protocol prescribed by the attending veterinarian in the Program of
Veterinary Care. Maintain documentation that this was accomplished and present it to APHIS officials when
requested. Correct by August 31, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with owner.
