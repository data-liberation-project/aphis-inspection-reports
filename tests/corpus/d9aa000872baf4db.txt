RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was no Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand available for the inspector to review at the time of

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is a bank of light switches on the left wall at the rear of the main floor of the building. This room serves as the
primary enclosure for all animals. The plastic electrical faceplates of two of these switches are broken, resulting in
approximately 2"-3" holes in the wall through which wiring can be seen. The cats have unrestricted access to the
area with the damaged fixtures. Animals could be injured by coming in contact with electrical wiring. Primary
enclosures for dogs and cats must be kept in good repair.
All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by November 20th, 2018, or the applicant will forfeit
the application fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. CONDUCTING REGULATED ACTIVITIES WITHOUT A
VALID USDA LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE ACT.
This pre-license inspection and exit interview were conducted on site with the facility owner.
