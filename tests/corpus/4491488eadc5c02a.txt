ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A Cocker spaniel # 147 has a build up of tarter on the teeth, and the gums are red and irritated. The facility has a
plan for dental care in the program of vet care, but this dog has not been identified as needing dental care despite
the condition of the mouth. This dog needs to be assessed by the attending veterinarian for treatment. Dental
disease can cause pain and health issues in dogs and should be addressed in a timely manner for the comfort and
health of the dog.
*** A Bichon # 238 had matted fur around the feet, ears and anal region. There was fecal debris caught in the fur
around the anus. Matted fur pulls and separated from the skin and can cause painful skin irritations. This dog needs
to be groomed for the comfort and well being of the animal. Grooming is considered preventative care and needs to
be done on a routine basis prior to matting of this degree.
*** A Pekingese # 128 was wearing a chain collar that was rusted. There was a considerable amount of hair loss
around the neck where the chain was. In addition, there was large areas of matted fur behind the ears. This dog
needs to be groomed for the comfort and well being of the animal. Grooming is considered preventative care and
needs to be done on a routine basis prior to matting of this degree.
The two matted dogs identified were groomed by the end of the inspection.
