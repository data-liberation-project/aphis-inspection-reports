This health problem on this animal was not observed or identified before the time of inspection. The daily
observation of the animals can be conducted by the veterinarian or by the licensee, as long as any changes in
animal health are communicated to the veterinarian.
The failure to observe the animals daily can lead to health problems that are not identified or treated in a timely
manner. Untreated health problems can affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The licensee must observe each animal on a daily basis. If changes in animal health are noticed, these changes
should be documented and must be treated by following the PVC. If the PVC does not describe the treatment forthe specific condition, the veterinarian needs to be consulted so that the health conditions can be diagnosed and a
treatment plan started if necessary.
Records of sick or injured animals should be kept and must be available to Aphis officials at the time of the
inspection.
