2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The registrant utilizes, but does not own, hoofstock that are housed at other not-owned off-site locations. The
IACUC does not perform site visits to these locations. The IACUC minutes that were reviewed indicated that "all
members were given a tour of the facility". There are no written records of what areas or rooms were inspected, if
they were in compliance or not, whether these non compliances (if any) were classified as a significant deficiency or
a minor deficiency, and a plan and schedule for correction if applicable. There are no check lists or other guidance
materials for the IACUC members to use during these site inspections as a basis to determine compliance.
The IACUC members shall visit all animal facilities and study areas every 6 months using title 9, chapter I,
subchapter A-Animal Welfare as a basis for that evaluation, and shall develop guidance to its members as to what
shall be included in these reviews. A check list might be beneficial to all of the IACUC members to use during these
site visits to determine the facility's compliance with the Animal Welfare Act's standards & regulations.
