REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
There were two dogs (sulkies) and a litter of kittens that were sold to a pet store in Indiana in 2013 by the applicant
while they were unlicensed by the USDA/AC to conduct regulated activity. During the sale of the animals to the pet
store the applicant had over 3 breeding females and required a license in order to sell the dogs or cats to a retail pet
store.
A USDA license is required by people conducting regulated activities in order to provide proper management, care
and traceability of all regulated animals.
Any person planning to operate as a dealer or wants to sell dogs or cats to a retail pet store when they have over 4
breeding females must have a license to conduct the regulated activity.
