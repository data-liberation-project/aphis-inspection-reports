3.14(c)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Upon inspection, the carrier had not obtained certification statements with the required information for the dog
transported. Receipt of feeding and watering instructions for each animal received is imperative, as well as confirmation
that food and potable water were offered within four hours prior to transport. Doing so addresses the animals’ needs
during transit, as well as aids in their comfort and wellbeing.
Carries and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport unless the consignor certifies in writing to the
carrier or intermediate handler that the dog or cat was offered food and water within four hours preceding delivery to the
carrier or intermediate handler. Instructions provided must be in compliance with 3.17 and provide the required
information for each dog and cat.

3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
At the time of inspection, the dog crate did not have the words "LIVE ANIMALS" on the top or sides in letters at least one
inch in height, as required. Additionally, there were no arrows to denote the upright position of the crate during transport.


Failure to properly label crates used to transfer live animals could result in injury to the animals, along with mishandling by
transport personnel.
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or more
sides with the words ``LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with arrows or other markings to
indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure, in order to help ensure proper handling by transportation
personnel.
