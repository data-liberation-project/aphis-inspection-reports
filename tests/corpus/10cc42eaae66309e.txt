ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the inspection several medications, analgesics,& euthanasia agents were found in various locations
throughout the facility. In reviewing the drug logs it was noticed that a PI (or other employee) used ketamine 4
months after its expiration and knew it was expired. This person recorded the date of administration as well as the
expiration of the drug into the records. The Telazole cocktail that is being used was administered 4 months after it
was reconstituted. The manufacture indicates that this drug must be used with 2 weeks after it is reconstituted if
kept under refrigeration and 4 days if left at room temperature. Euthanasia agents were also administered after its
expiration date. All procedures where these drugs or agents were being used were non survival surgeries.
The use of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be
acceptable veterinary practice and is not consistent with adequate veterinary care as required by the regulations
promulgated under the Animal Welfare Act. The facility should either dispose of all such materials or segregate
them in an appropriately labeled, physically separate location from non-expired medical materials.
For acute terminal procedures, where an animal is put under anesthesia, the research is carried out (surgery or
testing of a compound) and the animal is euthanized without ever waking up, medical materials may be used
beyond
their (cid:28)to be used by(cid:29) date if such materials use does not adversely affect the animal(cid:25)s wellbeing or compromise the
validity of the scientific study. Anesthesia, analgesia, emergency drugs and euthanasia drugs that are
within their expiration dates are required for all such procedures. Facilities allowing the use of expired medical
materials in acute terminal procedures should have a policy covering the use of such materials and/or require
investigators to describe in their animal activity proposals the intended use of expired materials.
