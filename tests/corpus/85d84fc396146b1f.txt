2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 on
17-Aug-17.
The licensee's wife stated that she was not able to accompany inspection due to other obligations. Without
availability for inspection, the regulatory process is impossible. The licensee must ensure a knowledgeable facility
representative is available to accompany APHIS inspection during normal business hours.
Correct from this time forward.
