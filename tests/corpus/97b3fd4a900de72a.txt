ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several expired bottles of medications and dewormers were identified during this inspection. These
pharmaceuticals were stored in an unused freezer adjacent to the non-human primate and kitchen areas. The
expired products were co-mingled with the unexpired medical inventory.
The following expired products were noted:
1) Pyrantel suspension labeled for use in non-human primates and small animals expiration date 4/3/2014
2) Prazi/Pyrantel suspension expiration date 9/23/2014
3) Enrofloxacin suspension expiration date 8/20/2014
4) Ivermectin labeled for use in bears expiration date 6/15/2014
5) Pyrantel suspension labeled for use in primates and small animals expiration date 10/22/2015
6) Trimethoprim suspension labeled for use in a kangaroo expiration date 6/15/2015
The use of expired medical products does not meet the standards for acceptable veterinary care. Medicine and
dewormers that have expired may lose potency and become ineffective for treatment and control of illness and
disease and inappropriate for use in preventative care.
Correct by: The expired products were discarded and removed from the inventory during this inspection.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The capybara enclosure contains a pool that is not in use and has been covered with plywood sheets. One of the
plywood sheets has two corners that are excessively chewed with a resulting gap exposing the interior of the pool
on one corner. The chewed edges of the wood are rough and splintered and one side is curled and elevated off the
side of the pool.Splintered wood can cause injury to the animal and continued deterioration of the pool covering will result in a gap
large enough for the animal to fall in the pool. Outdoor housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury. This non-compliance was previously identified on the inspection conducted on
October 5, 2015 and is identified on inspection report #20161330580195.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with APHIS personnel M. Moore and B. Irwin and the licensee.
