2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete disposition records. Required information for disposition records were missing for one
African serval, two ring-tailed lemurs, two Patagonia cavies, two kinkajous, one raccoon, three armadillos, one goat, and
twenty-six rabbits.
Acquisition and disposition records, including offspring born at the facility, are necessary to accurately track animals being
used in regulated activities. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition/disposition of all animals
that fully and correctly disclose the required information.
Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring
born on premise, are necessary to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care
and use. The applicant shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition of all animals that fully and correctly

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The newly-added drive-through park is not enclosed by a perimeter fence. Upon expansion at the facility, the drive-
through park now utilizes its perimeter fencing as its primary enclosure fencing for the animals housed in this area of the


park.
Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
going through it or under it, permitting contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Non-dangerous animals
housed in outdoor facilities require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around their enclosure and must be at least 3-feet away
from any enclosures or buildings.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by March 10th, 2023, or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
