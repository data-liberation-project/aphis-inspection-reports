3.81(a)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
On February 28, 2019 a male chimpanzee named “Jude" sustained a large injury on his right leg by another male
chimpanzee named "Capone" when they fought through a metal mesh panel. These two chimpanzees have a
known history of incompatibility and according to facility management, they were not to be housed together or
anywhere that would allow access to one another. This incompatibility was not addressed in the facility’s plan for
environmental enrichment. Housing incompatible animals together in a manner that allows access to each other can
lead to serious injury and/or psychological distress for the animals.
Nonhuman primates may not be housed with other primates unless they are compatible. Compatibility of nonhuman
primates must be determined in accordance with generally accepted professional practices and actual observations,
as directed by the attending veterinarian, to ensure that the nonhuman primates are in fact compatible.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
