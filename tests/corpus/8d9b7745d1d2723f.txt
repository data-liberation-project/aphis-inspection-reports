2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee has official identification tags for all of the dogs in the facility but they are affixed to the enclosures
rather than on the dogs' necks by means of a collar. Proper identification is required in order to ensure that each
animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record-keeping requirements. The licensee must
identify all dogs on the premises by either an official tag affixed to the animal's neck by means of a collar, legible
tatto, or microchip.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One shelter structure in an outdoor enclosure housing one dog does not have an adequate wind and rain break at
the entrance. Failure to provide a barrier from the elements can result in a dog that becomes wet and
uncomfortable. In some weather, a dog that does not have a barrier from the elements is unable to maintain a safe
body temperature. All dogs must be provided with shelter from the elements which includes wind and rain breaks at
the entrance to shelter structures. To be corrected by 9 March 2014.
This a facility inspection only. The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
