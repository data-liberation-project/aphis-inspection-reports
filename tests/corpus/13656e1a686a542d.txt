Housing facilities, general.
A new feed room was built and it has mouse baits in use, however a live mouse was seen going into a hole inside the
feed room and mouse droppings were seen on the room's floor. There were two areas in the walls where mice could get
into the feed room and the feed was stored against the walls. Rodents such as mice can contaminate feed and increase
disease hazards for the dogs. Ensure effective mouse control is in place, that the feed room is repaired so that rodents
cannot enter it and maintain the supplies of food away from walls to allow regular cleaning around the supplies.
