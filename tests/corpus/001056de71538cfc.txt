2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While reviewing records it was noted that the written program of veterinary care was not complete. A bat-eared
fox was acquired in 2015 however the program of veterinary care was not completed to include a schedule of
vaccinations for the fox. The program of veterinary care should reflect the appropriate vaccinations for the animals
on hand. The program of veterinary care should be updated to accurately reflect the vaccination and parasite
program for the animals. Lack of a complete program of veterinary care does not ensure that proper veterinary care
is being provided in accordance with currently accepted veterinary medical standards.
