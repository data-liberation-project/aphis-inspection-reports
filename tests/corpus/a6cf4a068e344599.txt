2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 9/13/18, Zoey the ~6 month old female zebra fell out of the livestock trailer and was dragged until the vehicle
could come to a stop. The truck and trailer were traveling along the interstate when the rear door swung open. The
other animals (3 ponies, 1 juvenile camel) remained in the trailer and were not injured. The licensee reported that
the locking rod-latch mechanism had not been engaged on the rear door and that only the non-secure latch was
used to hold the door shut by the employee. The zebra was transported immediately to the attending veterinarian
where she remained. The zebra suffered extensive scrapes and injuries along her left side especially on her left
forearm between her carpus and elbow, her left lower abdomen ( > 12 inch diameter), her left flank and hind limb
between knee and hip ( > 20 inch diameter). These injuries resulted in extensive skin slough and damage to
underlying muscles and tissue. She was euthanized on 9/26/18 due to the extensive wounds and poor prognosis.
The trailer was examined and the locking rod latch was found to be difficult to engage but was in working order and
could be placed in the locked and secured configuration by the inspector.
Animals must be handled as carefully as possible and in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm. All
safety features and latches on trailers must be engaged to ensure safe and careful handling of the animals
contained within to prevent trauma or physical harm.
Corrected by the time of inspection. Employee has been retrained on safe handling and transportation. A new
trailer has been purchased.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
