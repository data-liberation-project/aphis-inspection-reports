3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Twenty-six outdoor runs connected to the shelter buildings have an accumulation of feces and urine frozen to the
cement affecting 83 dogs. At least nine runs have the fencing wrapped in a plastic tarp material to help block wind.
The runs covered in tarps do not make the surfaces the dogs come into contact with easily accessible in order to
clean properly. As a result the licensee stated the runs are cleaned about once every two weeks and the runs not
covered in tarps more frequently. The runs must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least every two weeks to
reduce disease hazards and odors. When weather permits the licensee must clean and sanitize the outdoor runs
connected to the shelter buildings.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
