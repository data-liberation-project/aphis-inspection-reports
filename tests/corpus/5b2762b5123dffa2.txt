Item Miscellaneous 2.38 b 1 iv Access and inspection to records and property
On June 7, 2016 an inspection was attempted at the DMI site in Partlow Virginia (91-R-0069). The facility did not
have a representative available to assist the USDA VMO with an official inspection. A phone call was made to the
attending veterinarian with a message left for her. An additional phone call was made to the owner of the company
on the west coast. He explained this site may no longer be used .
The facility needs to notify the USDA of any change in status of sites, locations as well as insure personnel are
available to assist in official inspections.
