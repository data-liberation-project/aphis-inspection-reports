ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:15AM on

The licensee had just started a farm tour with 3 school groups but was able to give me her days and times of
availability.
