SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the facilities new addition there was no heat. The add on sheltered building, housing approximately 20 medium
size dogs, did not have a heat source for the sheltered part of the building. The ambient temperature inside the
building was 42 degrees F, with outdoor temperatures falling. There was no bedding in the enclosures and the
attending veterinarian was not aware these dogs where housed at outdoor temperatures. Housing dogs in facilities
without protection from temperature extremes can harm the dogs. The licensee must ensure the sheltered part of
the facility does not fall below 50 degrees F.
