Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Bichon (official identification #89) was bit by another dog on 19-April-2022. There are 2 bite wounds on her
upper left rear leg approximately 1/4-1/2 inch in diameter. The wounds appear to be pink in color and moist. The area has
been clipped of hair and cleaned but there was a small piece of wood shavings present in the top bite wound. The facility

separated her for medical treatment on 19-April-2022 and gave a penicillin injection of 0.5cc on 19-April, 20-April, 21-
April, and 22-April. The penicillin is currently not being stored at the appropriate temperature that is listed on the label.
The bottle does not state for the use of dogs or provide a dose and frequency that the medicine should be given to dogs.
The dog is also being treated with a "Purishield" wound spray twice a day and an oral supplements "Stress Drops" and
"Restore" twice a day. The facility does not have a written treatment plan for bite wounds that is approved and signed by a
licensed veterinarian and they have not contacted the veterinarian about this dog.

Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being can be discussed and a treatment plan can be made. The facility
must communicate any animal health concerns with their attending veterinarian so that an effective treatment plan can be
put in place.

This dog must be seen by a licensed veterinarian by end of business 29-April-2022 and create an effective treatment
plan.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
