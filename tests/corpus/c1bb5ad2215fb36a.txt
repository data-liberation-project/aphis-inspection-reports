Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian (AV) does not have appropriate authority over the veterinary care of the animals at the facility.
The facility has a large quantity of medications stored in the refrigerator and on a shelf that are for the animals. All the
medications are labeled in Russian and many appear to be expired. The vaccination records for the vaccines
administered to the cats on site contains stickers from the vaccine vial, all labeled in Russian, with the marking “FELV”
which typically stands for Feline Leukemia Virus. Additionally, an orange male Maine Coon cat (Microchip #
900215000814886) was found during inspection with an eye issue.
While speaking with the attending veterinarian by phone, she confirmed that she was aware of the issue with the male
Maine Coon, but the licensee never showed up for an appointment earlier this week. After discussing the large quantity of
medications in the facility, the AV agreed that she was aware they had medications on the premises, but she does not
know what they are. Frequently the licensee will bring animals in for veterinary opinions and when the AV recommends a
medication, the licensee will decline purchasing them stating that they already have them at home. The program of
veterinary care has specified recommended vaccinations for both the dogs and cats including Rabies and feline distemper
for the cats. According to the AV, the cats only receive a rabies vaccination from her, she believes the rest are performed
at the facility but has never seen them.
Failure to ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority over the veterinary care of the animals does not

satisfy the requirement of the AWA and its regulations and can lead to unnecessary pain and suffering of the animals.
Correct by ensuring the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority over the veterinary care of the animals.

A Maine Coon cat with an eye issue has not been provided adequate veterinary care and treatment. On inspection, an
orange male Maine Coon cat (Microchip # 900215000814886) was identified with an irritated left eye. He held the eyelid
partially shut with the third eyelid membrane beginning to cover the eye. Yellow, opaque discharge is present around the
eye and the surrounding skin is pink and inflamed. The facility representative indicated that the cat has an appointment
with the attending veterinarian (AV) the following day.
Upon consultation with the AV, the licensee had sent a picture of the eye and discussed bringing the cat in for surgery.
The surgical appointment was scheduled for earlier this week, but the licensee never showed up. The AV stated that she
felt the eye needs to be examined.
Failure to use appropriate methods to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries can lead to further medical problems and
unnecessary pain and suffering by the animal.
Correct by having the cat evaluated by a veterinarian and follow all prescribed treatment recommendations.
