2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete and does not reflect the actual preventative
care practices currently utilized by the facility.
The PVC states that “dogs should have a heartworm negative test prior to or at the time of arrival, then heartworm
preventative monthly.” The PVC also states “deworming upon arrival for cats and dogs, then twice yearly.”
According to facility representatives, the dogs and cats do not receive any preventative medications for parasite
control, and that heartworm preventative and deworming medications are not administered to the dogs and cats.
Under the section pertaining to “pigs, sheep, horses, rats,” the PVC only lists the vaccinations that are to be given to
horses. There are no vaccinations listed for the pigs or sheep (or rats). According to facility representatives, the
facility vaccinates both the sheep and pigs annually.
There are two cows at the facility, however this species is not listed on the PVC.
The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending veterinarian establishing standards of care
for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The
facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at the facility and regularly
scheduled visits to the premises.

***The attending veterinarian (AV) prescribed Meloxicam for “Simone,” a female, Gottingen mix, pig for her arthritis.
The details on the bottle indicate the Meloxicam was provided March 6, 2017 and the veterinarian's instructions
indicate that she be given “one tablet once daily.” According to facility representatives, “Simone” still receives the
Meloxicam. The “animal medication log” provided by the facility indicates that Simone was administered one tablet
of the Meloxicam in the morning of 04/30. There are no additional entries in the log indicating that “Simone” hasreceived her prescribed daily dose of medication since that date. The facility was unable to provide any additional
documentation pertaining to the delivery of her daily medication.
***The attending veterinarian (AV) prescribed Meloxicam for “Jewel,” an adult, female sheep. The details on the
bottle indicate that the Meloxicam was provided March 17, 2017 and the veterinarian's instructions indicate that she
be given “9 tablets on day 1, then give 4 ½ tablets once daily as needed for pain.” According to facility
representatives, “Jewel” is still being administered the Meloxicam. The “animal medication log” provided by the
facility indicates that “Jewel” was given 4 ½ tablets of the Meloxicam on 04/29 and 04/30. There are no additional
entries in the log indicating that she has received her prescribed daily dose of medication since that date. The
facility was unable to provide any additional documentation regarding the delivery of her daily medication.
Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead to
prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care problems. The applicant must use appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Any change by the applicant to prescribed treatments
should be discussed and approved with their veterinarian.
Veterinary and behavioral observations and evaluations by the veterinarian and facility staff must be documented
and readily available to APHIS upon request and include sufficient detail to demonstrate the provision of adequate
veterinary care.
The licensee must provide documentation of entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list
when the medication is administered to the animals. There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to
document the health status and condition of the animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current
issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care
prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are observed daily and provided with
adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The
program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The metal wire fencing in an enclosure containing three adult, female pigs was in disrepair. The bottom portion of
the wire fencing attached to a metal gate contained sharp points which could injure the animals. Additionally, there
were gaps in the wire in which the animals could become entrapped.***The metal wire fencing in an enclosure containing three adult male alpacas was in disrepair. A portion of the wire
fencing attached to a metal gate and a segment of the wooden fencing contained sharp points which pointed into
the enclosure.
All enclosures must be structurally sound and kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or
gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. A system of timely
identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.

WATERING.
***There was a buildup of slimy, green-brown debris on the interior surfaces of the water receptacle in the enclosure
containing three adult, female pigs. There was also a thick layer of dirt and other debris on the bottom of the water
receptacle.
Animals must be provided with clean, potable water to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration. Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. They should be
cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
