2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Inspectors reviewed records pertaining to an incident involving the transport of a yearling male Rhesus Macaque.
On the morning of 16 September 2012, this animal was found to be in need of veterinary care due to being (cid:28)poor
and weak(cid:29). The animal was loaded into a transport cage and placed into a vehicle for transport to the Department of
Veterinary Medicine. No accompanying movement paperwork or cage identification was used to identify the cage as
being occupied. The facility's SOP for transport states that animals shall not be transported without appropriate
paperwork. Two additional animals were placed in the same vehicle for transport. The two additional animals were
unloaded on arrival at the Department of Veterinary Medicine; however, this animal was inadvertently left inside the
transport vehicle, and was not discovered until the following day between 8:00-8:30 am. Upon discovery he was
dehydrated and in need of immediate medical attention. Although he received veterinary care, he did not recover
from his condition, and was found dead at approximately 7:15 on 18 September 2012. Since this animal was left
unattended in a vehicle for approximately twenty two hours, he was not handled in a manner which prevented
physical harm or unnecessary discomfort, which likely contributed to his death. The licensee must ensure that all
animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible, and in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort at all times.
