2.132(d) CRITICAL
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
In August 2018 the licensee purchased one opossum from an unlicensed source in which she knowingly knew the
unlicensed source did not currently hold a valid USDA license and that he was required to do so. The licensee was
educated about purchasing animals from unlicensed sources during the prelicense process in 2016. Purchasing
animals from unlicensed sources does not allow for inspection to ensure their health and well-being. Ensure that
animals are not obtained from unlicensed sources that are required to be licensed. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection was conducted with the licensee and the facility's attending veterinarian.
The exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
