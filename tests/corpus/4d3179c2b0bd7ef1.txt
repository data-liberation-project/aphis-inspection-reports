*****At time of inspection the self feeders in the outdoor kennel area have rusted to the point of not being able to be
properly cleaned and sanitized. These feeders need to be replaced with feeders which can be properly cleaned and
sanitized at least once every two weeks. The ability to properly clean and sanitize items within the kennel such as
feeders helps to reduce disease within the kennel which keeps the animals in the kennel healthy.
