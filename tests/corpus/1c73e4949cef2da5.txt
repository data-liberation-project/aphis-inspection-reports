Classification and separation.
Inside My Big Back Yard area, four rabbits are housed in the same outdoor enclosure with a chicken. Housing rabbits
with other species could result in injury, stress and/or a negative impact on the health of either animal due to potential
transmission of disease. Ensure rabbits are not housed in the same primary enclosure with another species unless
require for scientific reasons. Corrected at time of inspection

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Vice President of Animal Care.
