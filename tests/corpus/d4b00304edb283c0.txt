3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The main guinea pig enclosure has an excessive accumulation of excreta mixed in with the bedding. There are no areas
in the enclosure that will allow the guinea pigs to remain free from contact with the excreta. Excess accumulations of
excreta increase the risk of disease hazards which may allow the guinea pigs to become ill. The enclosure shall be
cleaned more frequently to prevent such accumulations and provide for the health and well being of the guinea pigs.

Primary enclosures.
The heat lamp provided for the ring-tailed lemur is located in close proximity to the enclosure and at a level that could
allow the lemur to reach through and potentially become injured by the heat. Measures shall be applied to prevent the
lemur's ability to make direct contact with the heat source.
