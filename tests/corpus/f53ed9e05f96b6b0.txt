3.58(a)
CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Section 3.58(a) Classification and separation: The three rabbits were housed in the same primary enclosure with six
chickens. The birds and their feces are a potential source of bacteria and parasites that may cause the rabbits to
become ill. Rabbits must not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals. The
rabbits and chickens must be in separate enclosures. The licensee began preparations to house the rabbits in their
own enclosure during the inspection.
