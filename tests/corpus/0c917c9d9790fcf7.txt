2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1855 on
19-Dec-17. I knocked on the door and now on answered. I attempted to contact the owner by calling two different
phone numbers I had on file and both numbers had been disconnected. I waited thirty minutes and then left.
End of report.
