2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has no written program of veterinary care approved by the attending veterinarian. A part-time attending
veterinarian is employed by the facility and visits the site monthly. A written program of veterinary care is necessary
to ensure that the facility staff understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian in regards to the care and
use of the animals. A program of veterinary care must be written and this program must be approved by the
attending veterinarian as part of the formal arrangement between the facility and the attending veterinarian.

2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is one goat at the facility being treated for diarrhea with a dewormer and an antibiotic. This goat has been
separated from the rest of the herd and is in a heavily bedded stall with easy access to food and water. While there
is recognition and treatment of this disease by the facility, there is no written program of veterinarian care approved
by the attending veterinarian to give guidance for treating the disease in this case, and the attending veterinarian
was not consulted on how to appropriately diagnose and treat this case. Failure to consult the attending
veterinarian or have written procedures to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases can result in misdiagnosis
and mistreatment of animal diseases and injuries. This goat must be examined and treated by a licensed
veterinarian.
