3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The facility contains interior surfaces of housing facilities with excessive rust. There are at least 2 support poles for
chain link fences for 3 enclosures that have rusted and have broken in half. These support poles are located
between enclosures housing a total of 3 adult dogs. One of the rusted and broken support poles is at the bottom of
the fence line separating 2 adult dogs, one male Golden Retriever and one female Golden Retriever. The chain link
fence has also become detached from the support pole in this location leaving a large gap between the fence and
support pole separating the two enclosures. This gap was large enough that the adult male dog was observed
pushing on the fence and sticking his head through this broken area of the fence and into the enclosure housing the
female dog next to his enclosure. The licensee must ensure that the interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in
contact with the dogs is free of excessive rust that affects the structural strength of the surface or that prevents the
required cleaning and sanitization of the surface. To be corrected by: April 10, 2019.
