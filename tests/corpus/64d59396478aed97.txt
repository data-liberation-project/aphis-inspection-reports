2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On the afternoon of 2 April 2014, a male black bear named " Crybaby " was found injured with a single 4-8 inch long
laceration located on his lower back. The attending veterinarian arrived that afternoon for initial treatment, which
included suturing the wound. On 5 April, the facility discovered the wound had dehisced. On 14 April the wound was
open and bleeding heavily per facility personnel. The facility contacted the veterinarian and it was decided that
euthanasia was the appropriate choice. The attending veterinarian arrived at the facility in the late afternoon of 15
April and the bear was euthanized.
The attending veterinarian physically observed this animal twice throughout the length of the treatment period, once
on the date of the original injury (2 April) and again on the date of euthanasia (15 April). When the sutures dehisced,
the licensee re-sutured the wound closed. The attending veterinarian did not re-evaluate the injury during this time.
When the sutures dehisced a second time the veterinarian was called to euthanize the animal. When an animal
does not adequately recover from an injury or respond to treatment, there must be timely and appropriate follow up
examination by the attending veterinarian so as to evaluate the health and welfare of the animal. Documentation of
the veterinarian(cid:25)'s follow-up evaluation or treatment shall be documented.
This was a focused inspection following an official complaint on an injured black bear. Inspection and exit interview
conducted with facility personnel.
