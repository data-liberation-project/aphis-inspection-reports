2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
No written program of veterinary care was available for review, and the licensee stated that he did not have one. A
written program of veterinary care describes the prescribed program of care that the attending veterinarian has approved,
and instructs the licensee in approved practices. The licensee must ensure that a written program of veterinary care is
maintained and available for review at the time of inspection.
