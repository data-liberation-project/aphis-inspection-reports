ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One dog was identified during this inspection in need of veterinary care. There was a female Yorkie/Bichon (tag #
0411) with an intermittent non-weight bearing lameness on the right front leg. Digit 4 on the right paw was bent.
Owner recently hair clipped and nail trimmed the dog and did not note any abnormalities or injuries at that time. He
said that the dog probably pulled the nail recently. This dog needs to be examined by the attending veterinarian for
diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the examinations and treatments must be maintained for future review
by APHIS officials. Correct by Oct. 8, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Owner.
