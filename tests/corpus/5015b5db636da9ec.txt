2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On the morning of February 10th, 2021, the facility allowed two members of the public (a local reporter and cameraman)
to enter into an adult female bear enclosure for a news reel. During this public interaction, the licensee was present with a
bottle of honey and treats. She allowed both individuals to feed the bottle of honey to the female bear and allowed the
cameraman to pet the animal on its head. At no time was there a physical barrier present or a physical method of
constraint strong enough to protect the public members from harm. At approximately 12 weeks of age, dangerous animals
such as bears become too big, too fast and too strong to be used for public contact. During public exhibition, any animal
must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
Correct prior to the next public interaction.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
A portion of the facility’s perimeter fence is less than 8ft in height. USDA inspectors identified a section of the perimeter
fence on the east side of the property composed of a wire cattle fence with two additional barbed wire strands above that.
Inspectors measured the highest section of the eastern fence as approximately 6ft in height; however, most of the fence


in that area was overgrown with shrubbery and plant life. The integrity of the perimeter fence could not be evaluated in
some sections due to the plant overgrowth. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
Correct by June 30th, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and additional family members.
