2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The sheep have overgrown wool coats. The facility representative stated the animals were overdue to be sheared.
This condition can lead to overheating and discomfort to the animals, especially during the hot summer months.
There were no visible signs of heat stress during the inspection.
A system should be in place to ensure the sheep receive appropriate preventive care, i.e. sheering, as needed, to
minimize the risk of overheating and discomfort of the animals.

3.55 REPEAT
WATERING.
There is a moderate algae build up in the rabbit’s water receptacles. All water receptacles should be sanitized when
dirty.
All receptacles are to be sanitized at least once every two weeks. A system to monitor the cleaning and sanitizing
of the water receptacles should be in place.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the cattle area there are two pole panels with broken or missing bars that could potentially injure the animals. For
the health and well-being of the animals, the fence panels need to repaired or replaced.
The pig pen area has a dirt floor next to a concrete slab. The dirt has been rooted out by the pigs, and as a result,
the concrete now has jagged edges. There is potential for a pig to become injured.
The facility should create a monitoring system to insure that all outdoor housing facilities are structurally sound andmaintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The ground in front of the cattle water trough is muddy and there is a depression in the ground created by the cattle.
As a result, the water doesn’t drain out of the area when the trough is cleaned and the animals have to stand in this
muddy area to get to the water troughs. This situation can potentially cause leg and feet problems.
A system to monitor the filling of the troughs, and/or a suitable method to eliminate the excess water, needs to be
initiated.

FEEDING.
In the cattle area, a salt block was observed in the ground and was contaminated with fecal waste material from the
cows. The salt block should be accessible to all the animals in the enclosure and shall be placed so as to minimize
its contamination.
A system should be in place to ensure the cattle are fed in a manner that minimizes contamination.
Corrected during the inspection.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is a mild to moderate amount flies present in the various animal areas. The cattle area has the greatest
amount of flies. Although the facility has fly traps available, many of them are expired.
The presence of flies may increase disease hazards in animal areas.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects should be maintained to ensure the health and well-being of
the animals.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility owner
