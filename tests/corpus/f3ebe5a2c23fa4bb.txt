3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There was a moderate amount of rabbit hair adhered to the mesh of several of the rabbit cages and to the gate to
the cavy pen. It was explained that the hair is routinely removed, and that this had last been done about a month
ago. Primary enclosures should be kept reasonably free of hair, excreta and other debris by periodic cleaning for
the health and comfort of the animal. Fine hair can also attract dirt and dust which may harbor pathogens that can
cause illness in animals.
