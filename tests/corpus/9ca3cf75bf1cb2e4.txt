2.4 CRITICAL
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
The licensee conducted himself in a threatening manner throughout the inspection that interfered with USDA
officials to conduct a complete inspection. Additionally, he did not allow inspectors to take pictures, which is a
crucial part in carrying out their duties, adding to inspection interference.
Throughout the duration of the routine inspection, inspectors experienced argumentative, sarcastic, intimidating,
harassing, and aggressive behavior with the licensee. His body language demonstrated an increase in agitation
with every observation made by inspectors – he stood cross armed, quivered his lip, and he continuously wrung the
neck of a drinking bottle. Inspectors felt too intimidated to take pictures of noncompliances observed, concerned his
anger would grow further. The inspectors discussed their findings and justifications for citations with the licensee.
After complaining that none of the animals were injured and said the citations were unwarranted, he stated he would
appeal the citations. The home inspector stated that she would need to take pictures of the noncompliances. The
licensee abruptly stated, “No, your inspection is over.” The home inspector stated that she could see he was visibly
upset and promptly left the facility.
A licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS official in the
course of carrying out his or her duties.
Correct: From this day forward, licensee shall not interfere or intimidate any APHIS official in the course of carrying
out their duties.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
A wolf-dog hybrid was acquired since the last inspection, and there was no acquisition paperwork for that animal.
Acquisition and disposition paperwork allow for a licensee to have trace-ability for their animals and legitimizes
ownership. Each exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly discloseinformation concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise in his possession.
Correct: from this day forward.
2.126(a)(5)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee did not allow the inspectors to take photographs of noncompliances after he said he would appeal the
citations. When told photographs would be necessary to take, he responded "No, your inspection is over."
Photographs are necessary to enforce the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and regulations. Exhibitors shall
allow APHIS officials to document, by the taking of photographs and other means, conditions and areas of
noncompliance.
Correct: from this day forward.
3.80(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Within a primary enclosure holding 6 ring tailed lemurs, a wooden ladder suspended between a den and enrichment
structures had splintering wood extending about 3-4 inches in length on the underside, and had an uneven chunk of
wood missing on the top side, about 2 inches by 4 inches. Jagged edges were appreciated. The ladder appeared
to be utilized by the lemurs often, as two lemurs were on the ladder when the observation was made.
Housing structures in disrepair could cause harm to animals if not well maintained. Primary enclosures for
nonhuman primates must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the nonhuman primates.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple big cat enclosures were observed to be in various states of disrepair: an enclosure housing two cougars
had a broken 2x4 wooden plank extending from the top of the enclosure over the den. A primary enclosure holding
a caracal and a lynx had a worn (darkened, discolored, beginning to splinter) wooden platform with two screws
exposed about 2 inches. The serval enclosure had worn (darkened, discolored, beginning to splinter) and bowing
wood being used for platforms. Bowing wood was also appreciated at the top of the enclosure. A primary
enclosure holding a lion and tiger had worn (darkened, discolored, beginning to splinter) wood at the corner of aden, and three screws were exposed about 2 inches. A primary enclosure holding a Geoffrey's cat had worn
(darkened, discolored, beginning to splinter) wood being used for a platform.
Wearing wood and poorly maintained structures for animal enclosures can cause injury to the animals if not
regularly maintained. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
A full exit interview was not conducted with the licensee.
