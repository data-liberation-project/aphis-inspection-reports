3.51(c)

Facilities, indoor.
Indoor housing facilities for rabbits shall have ample light, by natural or artificial means, or both, of good quality and well
distributed. The current enclosure for the 2 rabbits is in a room without windows. The available light during this
inspection was on a motion sensor and only activated when a person was in the room. The rabbits were without any type
of light for most of the day. A normal light cycle is required for all animals to maintain a normal circadian rhythm and
therefore good health.

The rabbits need to be provided with a regular light and dark cycle.
