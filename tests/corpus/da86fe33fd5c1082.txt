2.33(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The facility does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC), as is required since they no longer have a full-time
veterinarian - where the attending veterinarian (AV) is now a consultant. The PVC serves to list general routine protocols
and measures the AV will utilize while caring for the animals. Each research facility must employ an AV under formal
arrangements, where in the case of a consulting AV, the formal arrangements must include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the research facility.

2.33(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
A female rabbit housed in cage number 3, in Barn 9, has sores on both of its hocks. The animal is not currently under any
form of treatment for the condition, the attending veterinarian is unaware of the issue for this animal, and daily
observations has already been performed. The sores are approximately the size of a quarter in diameter with hair loss,
ulceration, redness, and inflammation, where the inflammation and hair loss extend just below the ulcerated areas as well.
When sitting upright in a normal sitting position, while bearing weight on her hocks, she constantly shifts back and forth


between the two back limbs in discomfort. The cage she is housed in is made of metal with no other substrates between
the animal and the metal. Daily observations serve as a key function in assessing the health and well-being of the
animals. As such, when conditions go unnoticed, it contributes to worsening of said condition and further discomfort and
stress for that animal. The facility must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include daily
observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Furthermore, if daily observations are performed by
someone other than the attending veterinarian, a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.

Facilities, general.
Barn # 3, the largest of the rabbit barns which houses approximately 360 rabbits, has a strong ammonia odor upon
entering the building. The odor is so strong that it caused burning of the inspectors’ eyes and nasal irritation. Improper
disposal of waste can be injurious to the health and well-being of the animals contained therein. Provisions must be made
for the removal and disposal of animal wastes to minimize odors and disease hazards.
