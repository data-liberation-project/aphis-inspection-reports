2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. There was a black and white adult female in Pen 12 that appeared
lethargic with sunken eyes and heavy breathing. The guinea pig was moving very little but when she did move she was
dragging the back end. Upon further examination, the animal had a swollen fleshy tubular shaped tissue protruding from
the back end. The back end and underside of the belly were coated with a moist fluid with bedding and other debris
adhered. The licensee stated she had noticed the animal appeared a little slow the day before but had not contacted the
attending veterinarian. The Program of Veterinary Care was reviewed and did not address the specific condition.
The attending veterinarian was contacted and agreed the licensee should have contacted her to have the condition
addressed.
Swollen tissue protruding from the back end can cause pain and discomfort, can become infected and can lead to a
worsening condition if not addressed in a timely manner.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate this animal and determine an appropriate plan
for diagnosis and treatment.

3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The licensee described the procedure for cleaning and sanitizing the guinea pig pens involves removing the bedding,
rinsing with water, and applying a disinfectant. The facility is not utilizing a cleaning step such as using soap or detergent.
Failure to clean surfaces with a detergent to remove organic material before sanitizing can result in the disinfectant not
being effective.
The guinea pig enclosures must be cleaned by washing soiled surfaces with a detergent solution before applying an
effective disinfectant.
