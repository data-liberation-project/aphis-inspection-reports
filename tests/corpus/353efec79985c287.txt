Facilities, indoor.
Interior Surfaces. The front wooden wall by the ladder in the guinea pig room is still not sealed or covered with an
impervious surface. Indoor surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can absorb moisture and liquids, retain odors,
and do not allow for adequate cleaning and sanitization of room surfaces. Licensee must ensure that room surfaces are
impervious to moisture so that they can be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized, won't retain odors, and can not be absorbed
into surface material. Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is still a buildup of brown roughed scale and staining on the solid plastic sides and floors of guinea pig enclosures.
In addition, there were several guinea pig enclosures with an excessive amount of feces and dirty bedding. Inadequate
cleaning and sanitization can expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral
infections. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of organic material, excreta, and
soiled bedding. In addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
