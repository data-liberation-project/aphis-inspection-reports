2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection, the Park Supervisor informed me that a child was bitten by a skunk a couple of months ago.
The skunks have since been removed from the enclosure. Skunks can carry disease that can be transmitted to
humans. An adequate public barrier needs to be put in place to prevent the public from being able to touch the
skunks.
Correct prior to placing anymore skunks on exhibit.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
End of report.
