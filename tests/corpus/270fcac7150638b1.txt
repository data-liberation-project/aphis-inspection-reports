HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are holes in the dirt floor of four enclosures: One enclosure on the north side of the facility has a hole under
the wooden enclosure divider leaving a gap between the divider and the ground. There is one enclosure on the east
side of the facility with a hole that undermines the cement apron in front of the shelter structure. This enclosure
houses one young puppy in addition to the adult. There are two outdoor portions of the sheltered building with holes
undermining the cement or a support beam, creating a gap. Holes under fences and structures can cause injury to
dogs who try to crawl in the space between the fence/structure and the ground. Holes under fences can also allow
dogs to escape the enclosure or other animals to gain access to the enclosure.
***
There is an exposed screw head (about 1 inch in length) at head level in the outdoor enclosure housing a female
lab and her puppies. There are two exposed nail heads (also at least one inch in length) just above head level in the
indoor portion of one of the sheltered enclosures.
***
The licensee must maintain the facility in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals
securely.
