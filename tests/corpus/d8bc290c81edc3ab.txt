PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The primary enclosure (pet taxi type cage) housing one chinchilla was noted to have duct tape placed over many of
the ventilation openings on the outside of the enclosure. Viewing the area of the openings on the walls from the
inside it was noted that damage had been done to the plastic housing in-between the ventilation openings leaving
large holes/openings and some sharp plastic edges. If the tape comes loose the chinchilla could attempt to escape
from the enclosure possibly injuring itself on the sharp edges. The missing sections of plastic also affect the
structural strength of the enclosure and the presence of the duct tape has a negative effect on air flow. The
structural strength of primary enclosures used to transport live animals must be sufficient to contain the animals and
to withstand the normal rigor of transportation. Correct from this day forward.
3.137(c)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The primary enclosure (pet taxi type enclosure) used to house a Patagonian cavy during transport and at an
educational exhibition event was too small to comfortably house the cavy. The enclosure was too small and not tall
enough. The enclosure was not tall/high enough as the cavy could neither sit normally nor stand up without
hunching over. The enclosure was not long enough for the cavy to lie down or wide enough to turn around
comfortably. Primary enclosures used to transport animals shall be large enough to ensure that each animal
contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments. Correct from
this day forward.
3.137(d)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
During the exhibit of a Patagonian cavy the facility representative stated that the cavy was wet. The cavy's feet and
lower legs appeared wet. The solid floor of the primary enclosure (pet taxi type enclosure) housing the cavy during
transport and while at the exhibit site was noted to be wet with urine. A very small amount of straw was noted
bunched in the back of the enclosure but it was too small in quantity and not absorbent enough to absorb/cover allthe excreta. Lack of sufficient clean absorbent litter can lead to leakage and discomfort to and wetting of the
animals. Primary enclosures with a solid bottom shall contain clean litter of a suitable absorbent material which is
safe and nontoxic and in sufficient quantity to absorb and cover excreta. Correct from this day forward.
Inspection conducted at Pinkerton Park in Franklin TN.
Exit conducted with facility representative.
