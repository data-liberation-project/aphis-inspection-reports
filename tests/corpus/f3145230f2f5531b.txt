ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
12-Jun-18. The licensee's wife was home, but does not have sufficient knowledge or access to all the pertinent
records for inspection. The licensee was not reachable by phone at the time of the attempted inspection.
Without access to conduct an inspection, the regulatory process is impossible. Licensees must ensure a
knowledgeable facility representative is available during normal business hours. Correct from this time forward.
