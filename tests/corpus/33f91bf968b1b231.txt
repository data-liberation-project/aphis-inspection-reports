2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are three goats that need to have their hooves trimmed. The hooves are in various stages of overgrowth
primarily of the hind feet. The one llama has overgrown toenails on the right rear foot. The pig has overgrown
toenails on both front feet which is beginning to cause the digits to be in an abnormal position. If left uncorrected,
overgrown toenails and hooves could eventually cause joint or foot problems. To avoid future problems a regular
program of trimming needs to be maintained, with trimming occurring on an as frequent basis as is necessary to
maintain a normal hoof and foot posture. Correct by November 30, 2016 and then continuously.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
