2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** The facility allowed the public to feed the tigers, on one occasion the public barrier gate was opened to allow the
public to feed the tiger using metal tongs. The opening of the barrier gate and the use of the metal tongs puts the
public at risk. The use of the metal tongs also put the animal at risk by possible injury from the metal tongs. There
must be sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general public to assure the safety of the
animal and the public. The facility has discontinued this practice. No further correction needed.
3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The lemur enclosure had a metal support at the bottom of the enclosure in front of the den box that has holes
rusted through the surface, the same metal support was rusted through towards the outside corner of the enclosure.
The rusted support can not be properly cleaned and sanitized and may affect the structural strength of the
enclosure. The metal support must be repaired. All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of excessive rust that
prevents required cleaning or affects the structural strength of the surface. To be corrected by: 02-14-15.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The toys in the non-human primates enclosures and the cement floor in lemur enclosures had green growth on
the surfaces. The growth of organic material on the hard surfaces indicate that the surfaces are not being properly
cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces in contact with the animals that are not properly cleaned and sanitized can be a
disease hazard. The hard surfaces in contact with the non-human primates must be sanitized to remove the organic
material, reduce disease hazards and provide for the health and well-being of the animals. The facility must
establish a cleaning and sanitizing schedule to ensure that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized on a routine basis
to reduce disease hazards and to meet generally accepted husbandry practices. All hard surfaces that come into
contact with non-human primates must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized on a routine basis. To be corrected by:
01-21-15.3.78(d)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
** The rhesus and bonnet macaque and the lemur outdoor enclosures did not have a 6 foot perimeter fence around
the enclosures. All outdoor non-human primate enclosures must be enclosed by a 6 foot high perimeter fence. The
fence must be constructed in a manner so that it restricts unauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs,
skunks, and raccoons from going through it or under it and having contact with the non-human primates. The facility
must enclose the outdoor non-human primates housing by a 6 foot perimeter fence to protect the non-human
primates. To be corrected by: 04-14-15.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
** The food bowl in the raccoon enclosure was soiled to the point that the inside and outside of the bowl was
covered in a brown residue, this can be a disease hazard. The food bowl must be cleaned and sanitized. All food
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary at all times. To be corrected by: 01-14-15.
3.130
WATERING.
** The gray fox enclosure contained a water bowl that must be cleaned. The inside and outside of the bowl had a
brown residue on the surface and yellowish water inside of the bowl, this can be a disease hazard. All water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary. To be corrected by: 01-14-15.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
** The gray fox enclosure and the lioness enclosures had an excessive accumulation of feces in the enclosures that
must be removed. The feces in the lioness enclosure lined one side of the enclosure. Excessive accumulation of
feces can be a disease disease hazard and contribute to pest and odors. The enclosures must be cleaned and
maintained. The facility must establish a cleaning schedule to ensure that all enclosures are kept clean to reduce
disease hazards and reduce odors. To be corrected by: 01-14-15.
