ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
( b)(2)
*****At time of inspection the Plan of Veterinary Care under Section II Dogs and Cats A pertaining to Vaccinations
had none listed.
The PVC was updated on 2/11/15 but the vaccination section was left blank. This needs to be readdressed with the
attending veterinarian and this section updated to reflect the vaccinations each animal will receive and the
frequency of administration. These vaccinations will continue to help in the well-being and good health of the
animals in question.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
( c )
*****At time of inspection the previous itinerary provided by the licensee dated 3/18/15 had all animals that were at
that time out on exhibit to be returning to the home facility by April of this year. No itinerary showing exhibition dates
after that time has been received by the regional office of AC as of the date of this inspection. At time of inspection
two groups of animals were out away from the facility being exhibited. The licensee needs to provide USDA, AC
with a current itinerary showing all dates of exhibition, locations and animals being exhibited. If the animals are not
going to be back at the home facility following the last dates listed a new itinerary needs to be forwarded or it is
assumed that the animals have returned to the home facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) (1) ( i )
***** At time of inspection the spider monkey cage on the inside had many areas where the metal had become
rusted and was preventing the ability to properly clean and sanitize this cage. This rusted metal needs to be
covered with a material which enables proper cleaning and sanitizing or must be replaced.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(b)
***** At time of inspection the building which the spider monkeys are located in is cluttered with items that are not
related to the daily equipment required for the husbandry needs of the non-human primates. These include items
such as a tractor, hay, pipe, 55 gallon barrel, horse equipment just to name a few. animal areas inside of the
housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, or stored material. All items
not essential to the required husbandry of the non-human primates need to be removed from the building and the
building kept neat and clutter free or the non-human primates need to be housed in an area separate from the daily
operations being carried out for the rest of the facility.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
( c )
***** At time of inspection the lighting provided to the indoor area of the sheltered housing facility for non-human
primates failed to provide enough light to permit routine inspection and cleaning of the facility, and observation of
the non-human primates. Lighting must be uniformly diffused throughout animal facilities and provide sufficient
illumination to aid in maintaining good housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, adequate inspection of the
animals, and for the well-being of he animals.To be corrected by: 7/15/15

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a)
***** At time of inspection the following areas within the tiger enclosures and in the construction of the enclosures
need to be repaired or replaced to prevent injury, to contain the animals safely and keep the enclosures and
housing in good repair and structurally sound.
1. The tiger housing units are constructed with concrete block and mortar walls, angle iron framed top with plywood
or plywood covered material for roofs. The floors are concrete and have been covered inside by a pallet and
plywood construction covered with straw or a hay bedding material. These floors have rotted to the point that
portions of the plywood is missing and allows for the potential of injury to a tigers paws and leg if one passes
through these rotted and missing wood areas and becomes trapped. these wooden floors need to be repaired or
replaced to prevent injury and make them structurally sound.
2. One of these roofs of the tigers housing units has a section of the material covering the plywood which is
damaged and needs to be replaced.
3. The roof of the tiger enclosure is covered with steel wire panels and a portion with steel metal used for roofs and
sidewalls construction. The panels on the west side of the roof have been attached to the support pipe and
framework of the enclosure with various size clamps to insure it is attached. The panels on the east side of the roof
have not. They are simply laying on the pipe roof supports and framework for the sidewalls and overlap one anotheras it is constructed out of various sizes of panel. Within the enclosure are various climbing structures which allows
for the potential for escape. this section and all sections of the roof need to be attached properly to all wall sections,
roof support pipes and one panel to the other to minimize the potential for escape from the enclosure.
4. There are various areas of the metal used in the construction of the tiger enclosures which are rusted and can
affect the metals structural integrity if not prevented from continuing to rust.

SANITATION.
(c)
***** At time of inspection in the immediate area of the tiger housing and enclosures were a variety of materials not
in use for the daily husbandry practices of these animals. these consisted of a pile of used brick with grass up
through the pile. There was metal roofing material one sheet which was not being used as well as one which had
just blown off of the roof structure recently. Assorted pipe, a two legged wooden table tipped on its side an unused
dog house and other miscellaneous items. These items all need to be stored away from this animal area as they
provide areas for snakes, mice, field rats and other unwanted animals to hide which can potentially cause disease
or injury to the tigers in these enclosures.
