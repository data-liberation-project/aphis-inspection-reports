ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The environment enhancement plan to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates must be
updated for changes in the social grouping for three non-human primates. The environment enhance plan currently
states that all primates are housed in a least pairs. Three non-human primates including a male black-handed
spider monkey, a female brown capuchin, and a female white throated capuchin are currently single housed for a
variety of reasons. The environment enhancement plan must be updated to address the social changes for these
three non-human primates. The plan should include the reasons for these non-human primates for being single
housed, attempts to introduce them to other non-human primates, additional enrichment, and that they are housed
adjacent to other non-human primates. Correct by July 28, 2017.
