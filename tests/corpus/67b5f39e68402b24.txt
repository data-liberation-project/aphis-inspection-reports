FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There was a ten-month-old male tiger housed in an open top enclosure constructed with 4.5" x 4.5", high-tensile,
stainless steel squares. The enclosure was 12 feet high with no kick-in or hot wire. Tigers have been known to
scale fences constructed by this design and therefore this animal is not considered securely containd in its
enclosure.
** Primary enclosures must be of sound design to contain the species housed within in order to assure public safety
and protect the animals.
*** The licensee must ensure the tiger is housed in an enclosure that will be contain the animal securely.
