Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A large portion of the sika deer have overgrown hooves. Two alpacas were observed with incisors that need to be
trimmed. The white alpaca with long teeth also has long toes. Overgrown hooves can lead to secondary issues such as
arthritis and discomfort. Overgrown teeth can result in injuries to lips and gums and can interfere with eating. Trim the
teeth and toes of the white alpaca and the teeth of the brown alpaca. Trim the feet of all other domestic hoof stock that
are in need. Consult with the attending veterinarian to develop a plan for addressing the sika deer hooves and the white
tail deer hooves if needed.

Sanitation.
The sika deer were being bothered by biting flies when they left the back of their pen to approach the area where public
feeding was allowed. Flies were swarming their legs and they were stamping in response to the irritation. A safe and
effective means of pest control must be provided for these animals to minimize the discomfort caused to them by these
pests.
