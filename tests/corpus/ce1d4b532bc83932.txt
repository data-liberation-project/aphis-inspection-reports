FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the pasture known as the "Oat Field" there are two separate fencelines in disrepair. One section of fence, near
the entrance gate on the south side of the field, is leaning sharply and has numerous broken and loose pieces of
barbed wire. The second fenceline is an older section of fence which runs along a treeline in the middle of the
northern side of the field. This fenceline is no longer standing, but is mainly just lengths of wire lying on the ground
and attached to the accompanying treeline. Neither of these fencelines serves as an effective barrier at this point,
and both are actually a potential source of entrapment and injury to any animals which have access to them. These
fences need to be removed or repaired so that they are functional and safe.
