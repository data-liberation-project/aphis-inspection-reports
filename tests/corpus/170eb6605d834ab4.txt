REGISTRATION.
The facility's registration certificate was due for renewal on 17 October 2016 but has not been renewed. Animal
Care must be updated every 3 years by the completion and filing of a new registration form which will be provided
by the AC Regional Director. At the time of the inspection, the animal facilities were under renovation and therefore
no regulated activity has occurred since the time re-registration was due.
Updated registrations are critical so that regulatory oversight, including scheduling of inspections, can be
maintained to assure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
The registration must be updated prior to resuming any regulated activity.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
