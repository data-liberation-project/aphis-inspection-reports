ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A tube of triple antibiotic cream was found in a bat housing space with expiration date of 03/15. Personnel that work
with the bats indicated that the cream was not being used on the current study but that it had been used for
treatment of brown bats that arrived in October 2015. The use of expired medications is not an appropriate method
of treatment and could either be in-effective or cause adverse reactions. The expired medication was disposed of
during inspection.
Correction: Ensure that expired medications are not used.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 7/13/2015 a female ferret was found to have died when she was able to get her head caught in her cage unit.
Mechanical failure of a latch was reported to be a factor in the incident. Mechanical failure of enclosures can lead to
injury or death of animals. The facility must ensure that primary enclosures are maintained in good repair to protect
animals from injury.
Note: The facility unit recognized this incident and reported it to the overseeing ACUC and OLAW. Measures have
been taken by the facility to prevent further occurrences.
Correction: Ensure corrective measures are followed.
This was a routine inspection of the animals and their facilities at CALS, SVM and SMPH conducted on 4/26
through 4/28/2016. The exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on 4/28/2016 by VMO Welch and
VMO Barksdale.
