HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A wooden board between the male and female baboon has been ripped along part of its surface by the male
baboon. A two by four support board under the den box for the male baboon is also chewed and torn. Because
these wood structures can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized, they need to be replaced.
To be corrected by 8-19-14.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Part of the chain link is broken and loose from the bottom frame on a large gate leading from the shelter area into
the pasture for two zebras, the Barbados sheep herd, and a fallow deer herd. There are also some protruding nail
heads along the chain link fence line where there are missing boards from a secondary "rub" fence. These
structures need to be repaired or replaced to prevent potential injury.
A thick wooden board between the serval enclosure and a chicken enclosure is rotting at the top leaving holes
which if they get bigger could allow the cat to reach through the fence. This board needs to be replaced.
To be corrected by 8-5-14.
