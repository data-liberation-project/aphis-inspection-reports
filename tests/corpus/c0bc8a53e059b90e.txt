ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1200 PM on
11-JUL-17.
Inspectors arrived at the facility (which was closed to the public) and spoke to an adult male, who advised us to call
the authorized persons on the license. We attempted to call both authorized persons listed and left messages at
both numbers. The adult male is a member of the family and had access to the animal facility, but not the records
and wanted to get permission to conduct the inspection from the licensees by phone. After multiple attempts to call
(by both parties) and waiting for a call back from either of the licensees, no contact was made with the licensees
and the adult male needed to leave the facility and we left the property at 1 PM.
Additional Inspectors
Rosendale Marcy, Veterinary Medical Officer
