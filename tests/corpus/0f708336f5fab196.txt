2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In the goat and sheep enclosure there is one large, white, adult goat that has an overgrown inner claw on the right hind
foot.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful to the animal. A program of
veterinary care that includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries shall be
established and maintained.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records of acquisition for 1 Nubian goat and 2 cashmere goats are not complete. On these records, the complete
name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired is missing. The vehicle’s license number and
state and the driver’s license number and state are missing from all records of acquisition, which includes 3 Nubian goats,
2 cashmere goats, 2 Jacob sheep, and 1 alpaca.
Complete and accurate records are necessary to facilitate tracking of the animals and compliance with other aspects of
the AWA. Acquisition records must contain the name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired. If


the animals were obtained from someone who is not licensed or registered with the USDA, then the acquisition record
must contain the vehicle license number and State, and the driver’s license number and State of the person.

Facilities, general.
In the enclosure housing 6 alpaca and 1 llama, the interior of the wooden shelter has four exposed screws with the sharp
point protruding towards the animals. The second shelter has two exposed nails protruding on the outside along the
bottom. Along the ceiling of this same shelter, there is a broken piece of chain link fence with a sharp point protruding
down towards the animals. A third shelter is in disrepair with bowing wooden beams and ripped tarps hanging into the
shelter. On the back right corner of the enclosure, the wire fencing has multiple sharp points protruding into the enclosure.
Along the back side of the enclosure, the dirt has eroded away from the base of the fence, leaving holes in the ground
and exposed beams inside the enclosure.
In the enclosure housing 2 Highland cattle, there are multiple long wires with sharp points protruding into the front of the
enclosure near the feed trough. The fencing at the back of the enclosure is falling outward and is almost parallel to the
ground. Within this same area, there are multiple pieces of wood and tire creating an uneven surface. The dirt outside the
falling fence slopes down steeply with broken corral panels littering the ground.
The fence that separates the alpaca/llama enclosure and the Highland cattle enclosure is no longer upright and is leaning
into the alpaca/llama enclosure.
Along the front of the enclosure housing 12 goats and 3 sheep, the base of the chain link fence that was previously buried
is uncovered, leaving exposed sharp points. The two wooden shelters in the enclosure have broken wood edges on the
front and the corrugated metal roof has a torn piece creating a sharp point. An old water trough in the enclosure has sharp
plastic points where the bottom has cracked in multiple places.
Sharp points, debris, and holes in the ground can cause injury to the animals. Falling fences cannot adequately contain


the animals. All enclosures shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.

Watering.
The only available water receptacle in the enclosure housing 6 alpaca and 1 llama contains green brown water with a
dark layer of debris coating the bottom.
The only available water receptacle in the enclosure housing 2 Highland cattle has a large amount of hay and ice floating
on the top and the water inside is greenish brown in color. The bottom of the receptacle cannot be observed due to water
color and debris.
The only available water receptacle in the enclosure housing 5 reindeer contains green brown water and the bottom of the
receptacle cannot be observed due to the color of the water.
The only available water receptacle in the enclosure housing 12 goats and 3 sheep has a layer of green brown debris and
hay coating the bottom.
Dirty water receptacles can lead to disease and be harmful to the animals. All water receptacles must be kept clean and
sanitary.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 11 NOVEMBER 2020.
3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
In the enclosure housing 6 alpaca and 1 llama, there is not adequate shelter for all animals in the enclosure. The height of
the three shelters does not allow the llama to walk or stand upright when inside any of them which could prevent the llama
from using it. One of the three shelters is in disrepair and does not offer sufficient protection from inclement weather. The
two functional shelters present in the enclosure are not large enough for all 7 animals to utilize them at the same time.


Shelter from the elements prevents discomfort and offers protection. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local
climatic conditions shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
In the shed containing grain and minerals for the animals, there are rodent droppings around food bins and stored bags of
feed. Multiple mouse traps are set up inside the shed; however, they are not effective as evidenced by the rodent
droppings.
Rodents can spread disease and contaminate food intended for animals. A safe and effective program of pest control
must be established and maintained to mitigate the effects of mammalian pests.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 11 NOVEMBER 2020.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
In the enclosure housing 6 alpaca and 1 llama, there is an excess accumulation of feces that surrounds the feed troughs
and covers approximately 30% of the enclosure. Feces have accumulated within and behind the shelters. The licensee
stated that the enclosure is cleaned 2-3 times per year.
Excessive accumulation of animal waste can increase the risk of disease and lead to contamination of the animal. Excreta
shall be removed from the enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize
disease hazards.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted on 29 October 2020 with a facility representative. An exit interview was
conducted via telephone on 2 November 2020 with the licensee.
