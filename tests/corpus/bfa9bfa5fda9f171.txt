2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult black and brown female Yorkie identified by microchip number (462E47633B) has a problem with its right
eye. The eye is cloudy in appearance with a blue-gray color. There is also a clear moist discharge coming from the
affected eye. The fur around the eye is wet and matted. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems
including infection, trauma, etc and can be painful.
The dog also has a thick buildup of dark brown material covering most of the teeth. At least two of the four teeth
remaining are loose. The buildup of abnormal material on the surface of the teeth and loose teeth can be painful,
impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal. The facility representative states that
this dog has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.
The licensee must have the animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
*The dog listed above received veterinary care at the time of inspection.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure; construction.
There is an outdoor wire enclosure attached to the green sheltered housing facility that has broken wire flooring.
The metal support rod under the floor is not fastened securely. There are two black Schnauzers in the affected
enclosure. The broken coated wire flooring is creating sharp points the dogs can come in contact with and affecting
the strength of the enclosure.
An enclosure on the opposite side of the building containing two dogs has bent and broken wires on the front of the
fencing. The broken wires are creating sharp points and an opening large enough the dogs could put the front of
their heads through.
The potential for injury exists if the dogs come in contact with the sharp points or get caught in the openings created
by the broken wires. The licensee must ensure all enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury
and contain the animals securely at all times. To be corrected by February 1, 2016.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
The green sheltered housing facility has areas around the outside dogs doors that has been excessively chewed
and scratched. The wood surface is severely damaged and no longer impervious to moisture. The front wire fencing
on the outdoor runs and the metal frames, that are not plastic coated, are rusty and in disrepair. The small green
housing facility containing American Eskimo dogs has wooden surfaces in the shelter structures that are chewed
and worn. Two metal feeders that are rusty and pitted were being used by at least four dogs. The facility
representative replaced the feeders with clean red plastic feeders during the inspection.
The chewed edges create rough pitted surfaces that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. The rough surfaces
can harbor dirt, bacteria and other health hazards. The feeders need to be replaced and/or repaired so that the
surfaces are smooth and can be properly sanitized.
All surfaces must be constructed and maintained in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitizing or be
replaced when worn or soiled to reduce disease hazards and contribute to the health and well being of the animals.
