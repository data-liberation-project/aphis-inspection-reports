*** The whelping room needs to be addressed. There are several enclosures that are empty but still have feeders
with food in them and the box needs to be cleaned. These feeders with food had evidence of mice feces and empty
enclosures with food promote breeding and living areas for pests.
*** Some of the walls of the whelping boxes with dogs have a layer of grime that needs to be wiped down and
additionally some of the feeders need to be cleaned more frequently. These areas need to be kept clean to promote
good housekeeping practices.
*** The main kennel building needs to have the area underneath the wood enclosures cleaned out. There is an
accumulation of miscellaneous tools and items that need to be removed to keep the area in good repair and reduce
living areas for pests.
