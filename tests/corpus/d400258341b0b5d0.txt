ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The white-tailed deer had a reddish gash with hair loss on the left side of her chest approximately 2 inches long by
1/2 inch wide. According to the licensee the deer was injured about 2 or 3 weeks ago and was being treated by
caretaker with a ointment (name of ointment unknown by licensee). The were no observation or treatment records
maintained by the caretaker. The attending veterinarian was consulted on April 10, 2018 and he examined and
treated the deer with an antibiotic.
The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not list standardized treatment protocols for the facility to treat
common conditions and injuries. When animals are identified as needing care, the facility must consult the attending
veterinarian in a timely manner. Failure to observe sick or injured animals and to communicate these conditions to
the attending veterinarian will lead to failure to deliver adequate veterinary care to the animals.
All animals must be observed daily to access the health and well-being so that problems of animal health can be
addressed by the attending veterinarian. Correct by performing effective daily observations of all animals and
communicating with the attending veterinarian in a timely manner when there are problems with animal health,
behavior, and well-being. Correct from this day forward.
