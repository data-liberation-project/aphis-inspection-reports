ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown female rabbit was not using her right rear leg when hopping around through the enclosure. Upon
examination of the rabbit, a quarter sized lump was noticed on the right side of the body. The licensee had not
observed the lump or the limp prior to inspection. Not thoroughly observing all the animals on a daily basis does not
ensure that veterinary care issues will be immediately recognized and reported to the Attending Veterinarian.
Observations must be conducted on a daily basis. Any health issues identified during daily observations should
either be reported to the Attending Veterinarian or the licensee must refer to the Program of Veterinary Care for any
treatments written up and approved by the Attending Veterinarian. Correct immediately.
3.53(c)(3) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One primary enclosure containing six rabbits was too small for the rabbits it contained. The licensee estimated the
individual rabbit weights to be 3 lbs on average. For six rabbits they would need a total space of 9 square feet. The
enclosure measured 4 feet by 2 feet for a total of 8 square feet. The enclosure is short by 1 square foot. Cage
space requirements ensure that the rabbits have enough room to move about freely within their enclosures. It
minimizes the rabbits from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures containing rabbits have enough floor space to meet the minimum floor
space requirements for the number of and the size of the rabbits in that enclosure.
3.130 DIRECT
WATERING.
During inspection of a goat, sheep, llama, and alpaca enclosure I observed the water containers to be either empty
or frozen over with ice. I asked the licensee how often she gives the animals in that enclosure fresh water and she
stated she fills the water up every day and a half. Near the end of the inspection I observed the licensee giving the
animals in that enclosure fresh water. Many of the animals in the enclosure crowded the watering container and
multiple animals were observed to be getting water or trying to get their heads in to get water for over a minute. Not
providing water on a more regular basis doesn't ensure the health and well-being of the animals. Water must be
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. Correct immediately.Note: The licensee was providing water to all the animals prior to the end of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
