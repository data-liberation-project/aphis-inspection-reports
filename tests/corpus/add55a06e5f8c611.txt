INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has not had a meeting since October 3, 2016. Currently there is no unaffiliated member on the IACUC.
The unaffiliated member left the IACUC in January 2017. The lack of an unaffiliated IACUC member in IACUC
meetings and semi-annuals means that there is a lack of general community interest being represented on the
committee regarding proper care and treatment of animals at the facility. The IACUC, when conducting business
required under the Animal Welfare Act, shall include at least one member unaffiliated with the facility.
Correct by August 20 2017.
2.31(b)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Currently there are four members of the IACUC that are from the VMT unit. Having four members from this unit and
the one other member from the Biology department does not allow for the animal care and usage to be adequately
assessed for the university. Having the majority of the IACUC from one department may cause future issues when
submitting and approving protocols, because multiple users of that protocol may present at the meeting and
potentially could cause quorum issues when voting.
Per this Section of the Regulations, if the Committee consists of more than three members, not more than three
shall be from the same administrative unit of the facility. A properly constituted IACUC is important and is required in
order to assess a research facility's animal program, animal facilities, and procedures to ensure
compliance with the AWA and Regulations

2.31(c)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has not been reviewing the facility's program for humane care and use of animals at least once every
six months. The last facility review was conducted on October 3, 2016, at that time a program review was not
completed. Regular reviews are necessary to ensure IACUC oversight of the facility's program for humane care and
use of animals. The IACUC shall review the facility's program for humane care and use of animals at least onceevery six months.
Correct by August 20, 2017.
2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An inspection of the facility's animal facilities has not been conducted within the past six months. The most recent
inspection was conducted in October 3, 2016. Animal facility inspection by the IACUC ensures optimal animal
welfare by identifying, prioritizing, and making plans for correcting areas which may contribute to animal harm or
disease. The IACUC must inspect, at least once every six months, all of the facility's animal use areas including
housing and study areas.

2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC completed facility inspections on October 3, 2016. No completed semi-annual evaluation reports have been
sent to the Institutional Official. It is important to involve the Institutional Official in the IACUC's evaluations of the
research facility and to inform them of the status of the facility's programs to allow the Institutional Official to follow
up on correction of significant deficiencies. This ensures that appropriate authority can be exercised by the
Institutional Official when needed to support the facility's continued humane care and use of animals. The IACUC
must prepare reports based on the facility program review and inspection, update them every six months, submit
them to the Institutional Official in a timely fashion, and have them available for inspection by APHIS officials.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the inspection, all six anesthesia machines were found to be past the servicing date. The machines were last
serviced in March 2014 and were due to be serviced in March 2015. There were no documented adverse events
related to the overdue service date. When alerted that the machines were out of date, the IACUC chair stated
machines would be immediately serviced and that the committee would ensure proper servicing dates for all
machines are being observed by all study directors and animal care staff. There were also several medications in
the "crash box" that were expired. These items were immediately removed from the area by the LaboratoryManager. The last facility review by the IACUC was on October 3, 2016, the lack of semi-annual program and
facility reviews may contribute to these items being out of date. The use of expired drugs and anesthesia machines
that are past servicing is not consistent with adequate veterinary care. Medications are not guaranteed to be
effective and/or safe past their expiration dates. Correct by establishing a program of veterinary care that allows for
the availability of appropriate equipment, including medications, to provide adequate veterinary care.
Correct by July 21, 2017.
The inspection was conducted with the Laboratory Manager and the IACUC Chair.
The exit briefing was conducted with the IACUC Chair.
