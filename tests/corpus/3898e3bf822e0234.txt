Facilities, general.
Several of the animal enclosures and/or their shelters are in disrepair.
-The Siberian lynx enclosure contains an excessively rusted metal fence post. The fence post is adjacent to the shift door
and has rusted to the point where it has sharp edges exposed to the animals. The animals could potentially injure
themselves on the sharp edges. Repair or replace the post.
To be corrected: 8-1-21
-The raccoon enclosure has a section of one by two inch wire fencing that is no longer attached to the wood. The
unattached ends of the wire are sharp and exposed to the animal. The affected section of fence is located directly under

the keeper’s lock out door. Sharp points could potentially injure the animal. Repair or replace this section of fence.
To be corrected: 7-15-12
-The second raccoon enclosure contains a den box with excessively chewed, sharp wood at the entrance. The sharp
wood is exposed to the animal and could potentially injure it. Repair or replace the affected area of the den box.
To be corrected: 7-15-21
-Inside the Baby Barn, the stall used as night quarters for the two calves has a metal fence wire that has broken and is
pointing inward towards the animals. The animals could potentially injure themselves on wire. Repair or replace this
section of fence.
To be corrected: 7-8-12
-The African porcupine enclosure contains a section of buried, metal fence that has been dug up by the animals. The
fence ends are exposed to the animals and could potentially injure them. The animals have already dug under the buried
fence and could potentially escape from the enclosure if they continue to dig. Additionally, the wood shelter has been
excessively chewed by the animals. Two large holes are present on two separate sides of the shelter. Assure the
animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

-The capybara’s enclosure fence has a gap beneath it. The gap, approximately two feet wide by 5 inches deep, is
adjacent to the animal’s shelter. The gap could allow unauthorized animals to gain access into the enclosure. Repair or
replace this area.
To be corrected: 7-8-21
-In the enclosure containing the 12 goats, 2 sheep, and 2 calves, the roof of the large blue shelter is in disrepair. Three
areas of the roof are missing shingles and/or plywood. The goats have access to the roof of the shelter via wood ramps.
The animals could potentially injure themsleves on these areas of the roof. Repair or replace the affected areas of the

roof.
To be corrected: 7-8-21
-In the wolves’ lock out building, the wood dividing wall is partially unattached to the wood posts. The gap between the
wall and the post was approximately four inches wide. This section of wall could potentially injure the animals if it
becomes completely unattached and falls on the animals. Assure the animals' shelter is structurally sound and
maintained in good repair.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
A raccoon is housed in an enclosure without a complete perimeter fence. The animal was moved into the enclosure since
the last inspection. The raccoon enclosure is located outside of the perimeter fence and adjacent to the entrance gate.
The facility’s perimeter fence runs along the back of the enclosure but does not surround it on the other sides. The lack of
a perimeter fence may allow unauthorized animals to gain access to the raccoon and/or its enclosure. Assure the
raccoon is housed in an enclosure that is surrounded by a perimeter fence. The perimeter fence must be six feet tall and
the enclosure must be located at least three feet away from the fence.
To be corrected: 7-22-21

The perimeter fence, adjacent to this raccoon’s enclosure, is in disrepair. The perimeter fence is approximately eight feet
tall and comprised of woven wire. The damaged section of fence has bent downward and is approximately four feet tall.
Damaged perimeter fences may allow unauthorized animals to gain access into the perimeter. Repair or replace this
section of fence and assure it is maintained in good repair.
To be corrected: 8-1-21


There is a gap, approximately six-inches wide, between the perimeter fence and the access gate. This gate is located
between the woodchuck and raccoon enclosures. The gap may allow unauthorized animals to enter the perimeter.
Repair or replace the gate to eliminate the gap and assure the perimeter fence is maintained in good repair.
