ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medication used to treat the dogs at the facility have gone past its labeled expiration date. The
recorded expiration date on one 500 ml bottle of Sterile Saline was 08/15. This medication is intermingled with
other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired
medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable
veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and
expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as
anticipated. The expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain, distress due to
mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms or unexpected side effects. Failure to properly label medications or other
medical products as being expired and storing them with unexpired medical materials could lead to the unintentional
use on regulated animals. The licensee must either dispose of all such expired medical drugs and materials or
segregate them in an appropriately labeled, physically separate location from non-expired medical drugs and
materials. Correct by 06/23/17.

animals maintained at the facility. Hedgehogs, Guinea Pigs, Hamsters, Ferrets and Chinchilla's were not listed on
the current program of veterinary care. When the program of vet care is not completely filled out on how the
licensee provides for the health and well-being of all animals on the premise, it is not considered to be adequate
veterinary care. An accurate written program of veterinary care is important for the care of the animals and ensures
clear and accurate communication between the facility and the attending vet. The licensee, in coordination with the
attending veterinarian, must provide more specific information on the type of products used at the facility and the
frequency of use. The licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care is updated with current preventive
practices to ensure that all animals are provided adequate veterinary care. Correct by 6/ 30/17.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the interior wood wall of two enclosures. Six
dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in shelter housing. The affected area covers approximately 40
percent of the enclosure wood wall. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and
other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or
health risks. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the risk of disease
hazards for the dogs. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces which any dog comes in contact with must be spot cleaned on
a daily basis and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b) of this sub part to prevent accumulation of excreta and
reduce disease hazards. Correct by 6/20/17.

and 15 percent of the interior enclosure wall. Fifteen dogs are in contact with the above affected areas which is
located on the interior of the south sheltered building. The accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust create an
unsanitary living condition that could impact the health and well-being of the dogs. It indicates a potential living area
for other pests that are housed with the dogs. The licensee must ensure that premises where housing facilities are
located, including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals
from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this sub part and to reduce or eliminate breeding and
living areas for rodents, other pests and vermin. Correct by 6/30/17.

impact the health and well-being of the guinea pigs. It indicates a potential living area for other pests that are
housed with the guinea pigs. The licensee must ensure that premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean
and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set
forth in this sub part. Correct by 6/30/17.
