FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In the room containing the animals (hedgehogs, sugar gliders, pigmy possum, guinea pigs, chinchillas and a ferret)
there was a loud ammonia-like smell. There needs to be more ventilation to minimize the smell. Indoor housing
facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means to provide for the health and to prevent
discomfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either by means of windows,
doors, vents, fans, or air-conditioning and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture
condensation. Correct by 4/16/2015.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the treasurer.
