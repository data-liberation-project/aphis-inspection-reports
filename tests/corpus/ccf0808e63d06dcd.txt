RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing required information on acquisition, disposition, or transportation were not
available for review at the time of the inspection. There were no required records available on the recent acquisition
of three juvenile male pigs and the transfer/donation of an adult female pig. The licensee shall make, keep, and
maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose information on animals purchased or otherwise
acquired, owned, held, or leased. Also, records are required when animals are transported, sold, euthanized, or
otherwise disposed. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal at the facility's premises. The
Record of Animals on Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or Transport of Animals
(APHIS Form 7020) are forms which may be used by the facility to keep and maintain the information required by
federal regulations. The licensee needs to obtain/document the required information on the recently acquired and
transported animals as soon as possible.
