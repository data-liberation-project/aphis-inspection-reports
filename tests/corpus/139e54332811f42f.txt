FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure with the two domestic pigs is excessively muddy throughout half the enclosure. Their shelter and an
area behind it are dry, but for the rest they are walking in deep mud. It last rained almost a week ago. These pigs
are heavy and have dug up the ground making it more muddy. A new enclosure is being built with plans to move
them into it. All enclosures need to rapidly eliminate excess water. To be corrected by 2-8-16.
