3.53(c)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Three primary enclosures housing three adult rabbits in each enclosure did not provide the minimum amount of floor
space as required. Each of these nine rabbits weighed approximately 5-7 lbs; therefore each of these enclosures
should provide a minimum floor space of 9sq.ft. (3sq.ft per rabbit weighing 4.4-8.8lbs). Enclosure measurements
are as followed:
-1.67ft. X 2ft. = 3.34sq.ft.
-2.83ft. X 2ft. = 5.66sq.ft.
-3ft. X 2 ft. = 6sq. ft.
Enclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals being
maintained within them. A sufficient amount of floor space for rabbits is necessary in order to ensure that they have
enough space to make normal postural adjustments and adequate freedom of movement. The facility should ensure
that the cages housing their rabbits meet the required minimum floor space set forth in the regulations.
Licensee reduced the number of rabbits housed in each of these cages and made the necessary adjustments by
relocating rabbits to appropriately sized cages with sufficient floor space.
Corrected during inspection.

WATERING.
At least two rubber-type water receptacles in the rabbit enclosures had heavy wearing with roughened edges along
the tops with an accumulation of dirt and debris. All water receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty or shall be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. A system should be in place to ensure water receptacles are cleaned as
required or replaced as needed.
