***The walls and areas around the heaters had a buildup of cobwebs and dust material. Buildup of cobwebs and
dust around the heaters and walls can be a fire risk and does not provide for the safety and health of the animals in
the building. At all times maintain the walls and areas around heaters free from excessive cobwebs and dust
build-up.
***The area for storing feed and bedding was very cluttered. There was trash scattered around and unopened bags
of bedding were no longer stacked on the pallets but were scattered around. A cluttered feed and bedding storage
area does not ensure the safety and health of the animals because scattered trash and clutter gives areas for
unwanted vermin (such as rats/mice/insects) to hide and could lead to contamination of feed and bedding. At all
times the facility must maintain buildings and grounds free from accumulations of trash and free from clutter.
Note: The facility had corrected these non-compliant items prior to the exit interview.
