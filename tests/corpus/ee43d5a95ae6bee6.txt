REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This focused inspection was in response to a sanitation complaint received 12/28/2018, during the government
shutdown. The business owner admitted exhibiting covered animals to the public in spite of not completing the
licensing process. We discussed the need to start the licensing process over from the beginning and not exhibiting
covered animals until a valid license is in place.
A valid license is required to exhibit covered animals.
Correct by *not exhibiting* any covered animals until completing the licensing process.
