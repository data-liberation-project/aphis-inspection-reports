ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:35 AM on
25-JUN-19.
The Inspector arrived at the facility and called all known telephone numbers in our database. There was no answer,
therefore messages were left on voicemail. The Inspector waited 30 minutes outside of the closed gate then left the
premises.
