PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Several rabbits were obtained since the last inspection. Two small lion head rabbits are housed together in a plastic
enclosure with a floor space of 1.8 square feet, part of which is occupied with a food bowl. Each rabbit under 4.4
pounds is to be provided a minimum of 1.5 square feet of floor space, so these rabbits need 3 square feet of floor
space if they are to be housed together. To be corrected by 2-13-15.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
