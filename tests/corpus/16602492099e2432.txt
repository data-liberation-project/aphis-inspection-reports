RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of acquisitions are incomplete. Each individual record consists of a list of sellers names (sometimes only
the first name is given), the numbers of animals and dollar amounts. There is no date on the record and addresses
are not available to the inspector.
The inspector must be able to determine whether sales meet the regulatory requirements but cannot do so with the
present system. All required information must be provided for all future acquisitions and completed records for the
existing acquisitions must be provided within 30 days. (May 30, 2014) The updated records may be faxed, emailed
or mailed to the inspector.

SANITATION.
There is a strong ammonia odor in the animal room due to excessive fecal material build-up under the rabbit cages.
Cleaning must occur frequently enough to avoid odors for the comfort and health of the animals being housed there.
The enclosures must be cleaned before the end of the day.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
