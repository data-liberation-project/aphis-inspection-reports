MISCELLANEOUS.
A facility representative was not available to allow access at 11:00 on 03/02/2016.
Another faculty member indicated that the IACUC chair was out of the office for a week as it was the University's
spring break week. No one else would have access to the IACUC records needed for inspection. Additionally, the
animal caretaker would not be in until the afternoon.
Research facilities must allow APHIS officials access during regular business hours to examine records and inspect
facilities and animals as necessary to enforce the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct from this time forward.
