Primary enclosures.
There are two feeders in Gorilla holding that have broken concrete above the feeders creating sharp edges where food
enters the primary enclosure. The facility had placed a work order in to have the area repaired over a year ago, but the
project was moved down in urgency. The system of identifying and making repairs for animal primary enclosures should
be reevaluated to ensure that when these issues are identified they are placed at an appropriate priority level for
completion. These sections of concrete must be maintained in good repair to keep the area structurally sound and safe for
the animals.
