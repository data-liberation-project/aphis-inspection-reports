Records: Carriers and intermediate handlers.
The registrant could not provide a health certificate for one of the animals transported. Health certificates are necessary to
ensure that a veterinarian has examined the animal within 10 days prior to delivery of the animal for transportation to
verify that the animal is free of any infectious disease or physical abnormality which would endanger the animal or other
animals or public health. The registrant shall keep and maintain a copy of the health certificate for each dog, cat, or
nonhuman primate that is transported.

transported within a primary enclosure that meets the AWA regulations and standards.

Care in transit.
At time of inspection the registrant provided documentation of a service offered noted a "dog walks". This service is an
option provided by the registrant upon request. As advised by the registrant, the animal transported would be removed
from it's primary enclosure to take a walk outside of the conveyance. On one of the "potty walks" the registrant advised
that a Great Dane "slipped" the restraints and ran off. The Great Dane was struck by a car in a nearby parking lot and was
rushed to an emergency veterinary clinic for care by the individual that struck the dog. The animal succumbed to the

injuries sustained from being struck by a car. The removal of an animal from it's primary enclosure may result in escape.
The registrant shall ensure the only time an animal is removed from it's primary enclosure is only during cleaning of the
enclosure. The animal shall be moved to another acceptable enclosure in order to clean the primary enclosure during
transit.
