FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the large dog runs in McCoy have damage to the gates. The wire mesh has been bent and pulled away
from the bottom rail of the gate. The worst of the enclosures are unoccupied, and have exposed wire ends. These
runs must not be used until repairs have been completed. The two occupied runs do have a lesser degree of
damage, but require repair as well.
Goats held for teaching in the large animal barn are in stalls intended for larger animals. The vertical bar
construction of the enclosures has been supplemented with wire mesh to keep the animals inside the enclosure.
The mesh on the stall fronts is light-guage welded wire. The goats have been abusing the wire mesh, bending the
metal and causing broken welds. Stalls R5 and R6 are the most affected, and sharp ends are exposed in R5.
Exposed wire points pose a risk of injury to the animals in the enclosures. The enclosures must be frequently
inspected and repaired as necessary to ensure the animals stay safely inside the enclosure.
Correct the dog runs before next use. Correct the goat enclosures by May 31, 2014.
The inspection was conducted on May 14-15, 2014, and was accompanied by the Attending Veterinarian and facility
personnel.
The exit briefing was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian and the IACUC Coordinator.
