3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
A male wolf named Koa was in its primary enclosure when it received an injury that removed a portion of the tail. The staff
quickly identified the injury and Koa was taken to the Veterinarian, where the rest of the tail was surgically removed.
During the inspection Koa was observed to have recovered.

While Koa was in his primary enclosure, he received a serious injury to the tail. Housing facilities must be maintained to
protect the animals from injury that can occur.

A routine review of the enclosure must occur to identify potential areas or items that can cause injury to the animals and
measures taken to correct these.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
