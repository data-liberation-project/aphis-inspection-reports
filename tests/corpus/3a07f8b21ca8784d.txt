2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This is a search inspection.
(cid:9)
*The facility submitted an application for an Animal Welfare Act license in May 2015. The inspector contacted the
owners several times including a prelicense phone call on 7-7-15 and an in person search visit on 1-13-16 after the
inspector noticed that facebook posts showed animal exhibition being conducted at the facility. The facility has not
yet started the prelicense inspection process. The inspector has obtained auction records which show that the
facility sold one male coatimundi, one prairie dog, three hedgehogs, 4 chinchillas and several hamsters at the May
6, 2016 Triple W Alternative Livestock Auction in Cookeville, TN without a valid license.
*A valid license is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal
Welfare Act and Regulations.
*The facility needs to obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities to include exhibition of animals and
selling exotic mammals covered under the Animal Welfare Act.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
An exit briefing was conducted with the undersigned owner.
