3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the main building there was a weaned litter of five Golden Retriever puppies that were in an enclosure with a
portion of the floor being slatted concrete. The feet and legs of at least three of the puppies were seen slipping
through the slats as they walked.
Floors that allow feet to pass through can cause injury to the animal. The enclosures must have floors that are
constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet from injury and if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow
the dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.
