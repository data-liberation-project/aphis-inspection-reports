Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult Boer goat was observed to have overgrown hooves. Workers were in the process of doing hoof trims on the
animals at the time of inspection, but the hooves were already overgrown and beginning to crack and curl. The
representative acknowledged the hooves had not been trimmed as planned. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can
cause gait abnormalities and lameness issues which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of
preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof care in a timely manner.

Facilities, indoor.
Under one of the shelters in the pen housing the herd of 36 fallow deer of mixed sexes and ages, there is a patch of mud,
~2-3 inches deep, that extends outward ~5 feet from the only source of water. The animals in this pen must walk through
the mud to reach the water to drink. The facility representative states that the mud patch was caused by a leak that
began a couple of days ago in the piping for the mister system. The representative stopped the leaking and called
workers to remove the mud and add sand during the inspection.
Standing water and mud can cause animals discomfort, promote skin and hoof problems, and encourage the growth of


pathogens. The licensee must provide a suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water or otherwise prevent the
situation where the animals have no dry surfaces on which to walk to reach food and water. Any methods for correcting
drainage shall comply with applicable Federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to pollution control or the
protection of the environment.
