2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female beagle (“Lemon Beagle”, microchip #900032002940915) has a buildup of brown/yellow tartar on the teeth.
The majority of the surface of all the upper and lower canine teeth, as well as, the upper front teeth are covered in
the tartar. The tartar on the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth is extremely thick and is encasing the
entire surface of the teeth. The gums have become moderately reddened. The licensee presented documentation
that the attending veterinarian had been at the facility on April 12, 2017 to evaluate the facility and animals, but
there is no documentation from the attending veterinarian concerning the condition of this dog’s teeth.
Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues.
This beagle must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Female beagle (No ID) identified under 2.40 (b)(2) on the last full inspection of the facility is no longer at the facility.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
