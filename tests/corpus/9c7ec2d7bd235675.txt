3.3(e)(1)(iii)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** Several enclosures in the kennel using wood surfaces are no longer impervious to moisture. These areas
include whelping boxes or interior boxes in the main kennel, or wooden frames and doors for the outodoor
enclosures. These sections of wood need to be addressed to make the surfaces in contact with the animals
impervious to moisture for cleaning and sanitation purposes.
*** In addition, several sections of the wire mesh flooring is no longer coated wire, and the exposed wire is showing
signs of rust. Rust does not allow the area to be sanitized properly and these areas of rusted wire need to be
addressed.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The main kennel is not being sanitized on a routine basis of every two weeks as evidence by the build up of hair
and feces when mats were pulled back or items in the boxes were moved. In the whelping room, the floors
underneath the carpets were dirty and not being cleaned. The schedule of cleaning for the facility needs to be
addressed and enclosures cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks to prevent an accumulation of dirt,
debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Housekeeping needs to be addressed in multiple areas of the kennel. The whelping room has an accumulation
of dead flies on the window ledges which should be removed. Several enclosures were empty but still had food in
feeders which can be an attractant to pests. Several enclosures were empty but still dirty and need to be cleaned to
reduce odors in the kennel. There was an accumulation of weeds underneath the outdoor section of enclosures that
need to be controlled to reduce living areas for pests. Premises where housing facilities are located must be kept
clean and in good repair to protect the animals and to facilitate good husbandry practices.
