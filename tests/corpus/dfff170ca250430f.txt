Two enclosures have chewed plastic siding with wood exposed above the indoor doggie door and one enclosure
has chew siding in the lower left corner of the inside wall with wood exposed. All walls and surfaces in contact with
the dogs must be impervious to moisture. The chewed siding with exposed wood must be repaired so that the
surfaces are impervious so that they can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected. Correct by March 6, 2018.
