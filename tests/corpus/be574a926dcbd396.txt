All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty.
Almost all water bottles were clean and a new water system has been installed, however 4 water bottles had a dark
layer of algae on the inside. Water bottles must be sanitized when dirty. Water bottles must be cleaned at least
every two weeks or as often as needed to maintain them clean. Dirty water bottles can cause many animals to get
sick and doesn't provide for their well-being.
Clean water bottles as a routine practice, minimally every 2 weeks but more often if they are dirty.
