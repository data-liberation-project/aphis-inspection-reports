ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A bottle of "Liver 7 Injection" with an expiration date of "Nov. 13" was located on a shelf in the keeper room of the
black-footed ferret building. According to the curator and the treatment log on this animal's enclosure this
medication is used on a daily basis for the black-footed ferret. The usage of expired medications on regulated
animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care.
The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could
be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated.
The pot-bellied pig, (cid:28)"Flower"(cid:29) is housed in the quarantine building for treatment of a broken nail. The left and right
rear outer toe nails are overgrown and curling inward. The junction of the nail and the skin on the left outer nail is
rough and has a dried dark colored discharge . According to the keeper records, "Flower" was seen by the
veterinarian on 4 June 2015 for concern of her left hind leg and the record notes states (cid:28)"On closer inspection the
longest nail is severely broken near the base."(cid:29) The recommendation from the veterinarian at that time, according to
the keeper notes was amputation of the nail. The veterinarian left antibiotics (Ditrim 960) with directions on the label
to give 2 tablets twice a day for the first 3 days and 2 tablets once a day thereafter. The bottle did not note how
many tablets were dispensed. The facility had the empty bottle and verbally reports that all the medication was
given but does not have written documentation to support that the medication was given as directed.
As of the morning of the inspection 17 June 2015, the nail had still not been addressed by the veterinarian beyond
the initial exam on 4 June 2015. The curator reports that the pig has been eating well but she believes the pig has
been limping. During the inspection, the pig was lying on the floor of the stall and stood when prompted but
appeared reluctant to take more than a couple of steps. There are no notes in the keeper records to document
whether the pig was limping or was walking well during the time between 4 June 2015 and today's inspection.
According to the curator there was no pain relief medication prescribed for this pig. The veterinarian did report to the
facility at the conclusion of this inspection to address the pig(cid:25)'s toe.
Failure to address medical issues can cause pain to the animal. This licensee must use appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries in a timely manner.
2.40(b)(3) REPEATATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Regarding the unresolved medical condition citation of the pot-bellied pig on this report, there are no records
documenting the ongoing condition and comfort of the pig, the administration of medication, or communication of
this information to the attending veterinarian during the time between 4 June 2015 and the time of the inspection.
On a previous inspection, APHIS inspectors cited the lack of documentation of daily observation of medical health of
non-human primates and communication of that information to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. Daily
observation and direct, frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the heath and care of
the animals. Lack of communication of ongoing problems might result in a delay of treatment if severity of the
problem is not known by the veterinarian. The licensee must establish as part of the program of veterinary care a
plan of daily observation and a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An enclosure immediately adjacent to the other deer enclosures was recently opened up for use by the deer. There
is not a barrier between the viewing public and this enclosure fence. A lack of a public barrier could result in contact
between the public and animals. During public exhibition, there must be sufficient distance or barriers present
between the animals and public so as to assure the safety of the animals and the public. Correct by 17 July 2015.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a gap of approximately 6 inches in height and 8 inches in length under the perimeter fence located in the
northeast portion of the perimeter fence.
Gaps in the perimeter fence may not restrict animals and unauthorized persons from entering the facility. The
perimeter fence must be constructed so it serves as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility
as well as restrict animals and unauthorized animals from entering.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and Dr. Margaret Shaver,
VMO.
The animal cited for need of veterinary care during the March 16, 2015 inspection has received veterinary attention.
