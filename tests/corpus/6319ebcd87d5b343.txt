ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30pm on
14-NOV-16.
This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals. The inspector rang the doorbell, honked and called the licensee's phone.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
To be corrected immediately.
