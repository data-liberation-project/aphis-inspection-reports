HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A sheltered building, housing 8 dogs, had a floor, like wooden sub-floor, for the walkway of the housing facility that
appeared to have an accumulation of dust/dirt on it. Only one side of the facility housed dogs. Located directly
across the walkway from the occupied dog enclosures were partially constructed enclosures which were
unoccupied. There was an excessive amount of black shaving-like material on the unoccupied side of the facility
including on the walkway of the building. According to the licensee the black shavings were from construction of the
enclosures. Additional housing facility surfaces, including the windowsill, appeared to have an accumulation of
dust/dirt. There were also some dust-filled cobwebs along the ceiling and the corners of the window. There were
several items, not all used for the husbandry of the animals, inside the housing facility laying above the dog
enclosures.
The floor of the walkway inside of another sheltered building, housing an adult dog and her puppy, had several
square feet of exposed wooden sub-floor. Most of this portion of the floor was at the entrance of the facility; other
parts of the floor had a tile down over the sub-floor. The floor also appeared to have some accumulation of gravel
and dust on the floor.
The condition and site of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter to facilitate the required husbandry
practices and to decrease the risk of disease and/or injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the housing
facilities are kept neat and free of accumulations of trash, waste material, junk and other discarded items at all
times. To be corrected by: May 22, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
