2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Great Dane (“Chelsea, microchip # 7E10227518) has an emaciated body condition. The hips, backbone,
ribs and shoulder blades are prominent and easily seen beneath the hair coat and there is little body fat covering
the animal. The facility representative stated that the dog has always been a thin animal and a litter of seven
puppies was weaned from her the day before. The facility representative had noticed the dog’s condition and is
feeding her puppy food, but this dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for her body condition.
An emaciated body condition could be an indicator of an underlying health issue. This dog must be evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure containing three dogs there is a large roll of unused woven wire lying on the ground. In this same
enclosure there is a tube sticking up out of the ground and three long non-functioning electrical wires are coming out
of the tube and lying across the ground. The roll of wire and electrical wires could cause injury to the dogs should
they come into contact with them or become entangled in them.
Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from injury. The licensee must remove the roll of wire and
electrical wires from the enclosure or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the dogs.
