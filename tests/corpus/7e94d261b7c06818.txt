***There is several days accumulation of food waste (banana peels), used food bowls and feces in the shavings on the
ground in the large capuchin enclosure. Excreta and food waste must be removed daily from the enclosures to prevent
accumulations, prevent the nonhuman primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
***The large water receptacle attached to the side of the capuchin enclosure has a build up of a dark grimy substance on
the outside. When opened the inside of the container is discolored and the water darkened and slightly cloudy. Currently
the waterer is washed monthly which is insufficient to keep it adequately cleaned. The waterer shall be cleaned and
sanitized at least every two weeks to protect the water from contamination.
