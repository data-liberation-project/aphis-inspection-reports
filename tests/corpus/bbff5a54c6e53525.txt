2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Adult female corgi named Cookie (chip 2350256) has very long toenails. The nails were long enough to cause the toes to
shift slightly to the side. Excessively long toenails can alter a dog's gait and stance. As part of the facility's program of
veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of toenail maintenance to ensure that dogs have toenails
that are not excessively long. This dog's toenails were trimmed at the time of inspection.
3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
The row of three enclosures at the south end of the facility have metal that is rusting to the point that it is deteriorating and
flaking in places. There are also 2 shelter structure doors with interior surfaces in contact with the dogs that are not able
to be cleaned and sanitized either due to chewed and splintered or unfinished wood. Surfaces that are unable to be
readily cleaned and sanitized can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that the surfaces of
housing facilities be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized,
or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected 19 August 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
