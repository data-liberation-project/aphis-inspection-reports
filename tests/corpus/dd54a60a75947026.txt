3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
The following items are in need of repair and/or replacement:

1. The wooden trim, that is adjacent to the ramp leading up to the shelter entrance, has detached from the wall and is no
longer secured.

2. An interior wooden support post, just inside of the shelter door opening, is rotted and dangling.

3. The wood trim, above the space storing bales of straw, has deteriorated and is no longer present.

The detached wooden trim of the shelter entrance and rotted interior wood post could injure the wolf hybrids upon
entering or exiting the shelter building. The detached trim for the wolf enclosure and above the straw storage building
should be secured, and the rotted wooden support post replaced to keep the buildings in good repair.

According to the facility representative and the owner, on January 7, 2021, a wolf hybrid escaped from the fenced
backyard and was on the loose for several days. The wolf hybrid was found unharmed and it was picked up by a facility
representative. The fencing of the backyard failed to contain the wolf hybrid thus allowing escape. Facilities must be
constructed in such a way that will contain wolf hybrids securely.

TO BE CORRECTED BY: FACILITY PLACED THE ESCAPED WOLF HYBRID IN A MORE SECURE ENCLOSURE
UPON ITS RETURN.
3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Dig guards are exposed in most of the wolf hybrid enclosures. Some of these exposed, metal dig guards have protruding
sharp points that may cause injuries. Exposed points on the dig guards should be repaired and/or removed and the
exposed dig guards significantly covered to protect the wolf hybrids from injury.
