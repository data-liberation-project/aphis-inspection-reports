PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a)(2)(x)
The flooring in the interior and exterior of the sheltered building is constructed of a large, galvanized expanded
metal. There were 6 weaned puppies in the exterior of the second enclosure that were observed with their feet and
legs falling through the floor of the enclosure. There were also multiple litters of un-weaned puppies housed inside
the building on the same flooring. The licensee covered a portion of their enclosures with carpet squares. However,
there is nothing to prevent these young puppies from moving to the uncovered portion of the enclosure where their
feet and legs can fall through the openings in the flooring. The openings in the flooring are approximately 1" wide at
the widest part of the opening. Young animals that are not provided adequate support can result in the inability to
learn a proper gait and has the potential to cause injury. The licensee shall provide enclosures that have flooring
that does not allow the feet and legs of the animals to pass through any openings in the floor. TO BE CORRECTED
