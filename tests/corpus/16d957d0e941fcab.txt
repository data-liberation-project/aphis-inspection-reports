SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are four juvenile dogs being housed together in enclosure #22 in the large sheltered building. The indoor
portion of this sheltered building is not large enough to provide adequate shelter from the elements at all times to all
of the animals in this enclosure. Failure to provide adequate shelter from the elements can result in dogs that
become wet and uncomfortable. In some weather, dogs that do not have shelter from the elements may be unable
to maintain a safe body temperature. All dogs must be provided with shelter structures that are large enough to
allow each animal to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner and to turn about freely. Correct by 27 Sept. 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
