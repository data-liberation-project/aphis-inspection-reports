NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
On 12/15/2014 at approximately 12:45pm I was at the facility's site address to conduct a routine unannounced
inspection. A person present at the facility reported that the registrant no longer operates or transports animals
from this location. The phone number provided to Animal Care no longer has messaging service and nobody
answered. Registrants must promptly (within 10days) notify Animal Care in any change of address, contact
information, or changes in operation status.
Registrant must update APHIS Animal Care officials on address and operation status by December 29, 2014.
An inspection and exit interview could not be conducted due to unknown location of the registrant and new facility
address.
