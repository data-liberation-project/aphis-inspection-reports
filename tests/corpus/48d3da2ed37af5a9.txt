2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
At the time of inspection, the facility informed the inspectors of an incident, on 9/29/20, in which a nonhuman primate on
study accidentally had test article administered into it’s lungs rather than it’s stomach. Although a staff veterinarian and
RVT were able to examine the animal almost immediately after the incident, the animal was not able to be saved. The
facility has taken appropriate action to prevent recurrence.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
