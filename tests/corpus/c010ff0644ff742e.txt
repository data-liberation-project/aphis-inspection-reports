3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The large barn available for the llama and goats had holes in the siding on the uphill side which were large enough
to allow an animals head to pass through. These holes need to be repaired to assure the animals are not trapped
and injured. The facility also had an old gate and pieces of fencing laying on the ground outside the enclosures. Any
materials that could cause entrapment or injury need to be removed from animal areas.
An Exit interview was conducted with facility Director.
