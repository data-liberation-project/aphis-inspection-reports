Sanitation.
* Bird droppings were observed accumulating on top of five sheltered housing units. The affected areas are located in
the outdoor barn housing six skunks, three ground hogs and one ferret. The facility has no current effective pest
prevention program in place. No means to control or eliminate the birds were viewed during the inspection. Lack of an
effective program that controls birds can create unsanitary conditions and lead to potential health risks. Bird feces may
contain pathogens that could adversely impact animal health. The licensee must have a safe and effective program for
the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct by
