2.40(b)(2) Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care
There were 6 adult dogs (listed below) that had matted unkempt hair coats. Unkempt hair coats can cause
discomfort to the animals. Long facial hair and facial mats can affect the dogs eye sight and may lead to eye
conditions. Heavy, tight matting may cause a tugging sensation which often results in irritation, scratching and other
skin disorders. The licensee shall provide adequate veterinary care which includes routine grooming. A proactive
approach should be used so that animals do not develop mats. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 10/13/14

3.1 (a) Structure; construction
There were multiple areas of the kennel in need of repair. The 1st and 3rd enclosures on the bottom right side had
long splits in the coated wire flooring. The wire had broken leaving an opening that the dogs feet and legs could be
caught in. Additionally, there were at least 2 enclosures on the lower left side of the facility that had broken coated
wire divider panels that the dogs could stick their feet and legs under to the adjacent enclosure. These broken
sections of the enclosures allow potential for injury or escape. The licensee shall ensure that the enclosures of the
facility are kept in good repair, that they protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict
other animals from entering. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 10/22/2014This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
