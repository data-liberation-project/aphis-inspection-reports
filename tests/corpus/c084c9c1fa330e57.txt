3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- An outdoor enclosure housing a single male baboon has an excessive accumulation of waste, food, hair, and other
debris. This is a potential source of contamination to this animal.
- The indoor areas of three sheltered enclosures, each housing a single primate, have an excessive buildup of
grime and waste. Catch pans beneath the enclosure floors are full of old food and other waste. Wooden boards
inside the enclosures are dirty and are not sealed to repel fluids. Waste and contamination buildup is a potential
risk to enclosed animals. The pens need to be cleaned more frequently and thoroughly. Wooden surfaces should
either be sealed to allow proper cleaning and sanitizing, or replaced when worn and dirty.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- One enclosure housing a single adult lion is an open topped cage, with fence heights approximately 10 feet.
There are short kick-ins on the fence. Cage fences of this height may not be sufficient to adequately contain adult
big cats. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing adult big cats are constructed and maintained to
adequately contain the animals. The licensee has made progress on constructing cage coverings for all big cats,
and only the lion enclosure still does not meet standards.
- The middle bobcat enclosure has a single wire, several inches long, protruding into the pen next to a transfer
chute door. The wire is right about head level for the enclosed animal and is a source of potential injury, especially
given the location next to a door the animal uses regularly to move between two pens. This wire must be removed
as soon as possible. There are other exposed points within the enclosure that need to be addressed also.
- The black bear enclosure has multiple exposed sections of wire on the ground. These are intended to prevent the
animal from digging. However, when exposed they are a potential source of injury or entrapment. The facility must
cover these exposed areas with soil or another appropriate substrate, and must ensure the wire sections remain
adequately covered.
