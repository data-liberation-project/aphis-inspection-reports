PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rabbits were in a primary enclosure that measured 23 inches by 23 inches which calculates to 3.67 square feet
of floor space, which is not adequate enclosure space to properly maintain the four rabbits. Based on the minimum
floor space for individual rabbits weighing up to 4.4 lbs, each rabbit must have at least 1.5 square feet of enclosure
floor space, minus any space taken up by water or food receptacles. Insufficient space for the rabbits may cause
stress and fighting which can be hazardous to the health and well-being of the animals. Therefore, for 4 rabbits
there must be given a minimum floor space of 6 square feet total. The rabbits must be housed in enclosures that
meet the minimum standards of space for their health and well-being.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are no additional shelters in the rhesus macaque exhibit enclosure. Although the licensee stated that she
places the nonhuman primates in an alternate shelter when there is a rain event or during the night, the inspectors
were unable to examine the enclosure because it was not present. The canopy and tarps alone are not sufficient to
protect the nonhuman prmates from the elements such as wind and rain. The canopy with tarps attached to the
side is not adequate because the canopy has large gaps and the tarp on the side does not meet the roofline so
there is a large gap there also which will allow wind and rain to enter. In addition, the plastic tarps were observed
to be detached at the bottom and blowing during the inspection. Exposure to the elements and wetting from rain
may cause discomfort and distress to the nonhuman primates. Outdoor housing facilities for nonhuman primates
must provide adequate shelter from the elements at all times. It must provide protection from the sun, rain, wind,
and cold, and from any weather conditions that may occur to ensure the safety, health and welfare of the animals.
To be corrected immediately.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The primary enclosure for the ringtail lemurs measures 2 feet by 16 inches which calculates to 2.67 square feet.
The enclosure for the ringtail lemurs (cid:28)group 2(cid:29) does not meet the standards required in this section for primaryenclosures. Insufficient space for nonhuman primates may cause stress and fighting which may be hazardous to
the health and well-being of the ringtail lemurs. Primary enclosures and shelters that meet the standards set forth in
the Animal Welfare Act must be provided for the nonhuman primates.

WATERING.
The water receptacle in the enclosure for the goats, and cows which were housed with a pony, and three waterfowl
was dirty. Drinking dirty, contaminated water may cause the animals to become ill. Water receptacles must be kept
clean and sanitized to provide clean potable water to the animals at all times.
Corrected during inspection.
