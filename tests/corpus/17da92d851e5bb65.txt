Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the transport crates were in need of attention. The “Live Animal” labels and
Arrow decals were either missing or partially visible. All primary enclosures used to transport guinea pigs / hamsters shall
be clearly marked on top and one or more of the sides with the words “Live Animals” in letters not less than 1” in height.
There also needs to be arrows to indicate the correct upright position. To ensure the safety of the animals, these labels
need to be added to each of the enclosures.

Primary conveyances (motor vehicle, rail, air, and marine).
While inspecting the van, it was noted that the side door could not be open. It was apparent that the animal crates were
leaning up against the door. If the side door was opened the crates could possibly fall out. Enclosures should be
positioned in the transport vehicle in such a manner that in an emergency the animals can be removed as soon as
possible. This situation only allows for the crates to be removed via the back door. This situation will need to be
addressed.

Handling.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the crates had shifted during transit. There were crates that had slid into the
middle of the van. There were also crates that had slipped off the crates below them. This resulted in crates partially
hanging off the crates below them and other crates blocking some of the ventilation openings. Animal enclosures shall not
be stacked in a manner which may reasonably be expected to result in their falling. This situation will need to be
addressed.
