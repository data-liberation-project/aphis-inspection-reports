HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure
In four of the hutch style enclosures, affecting 5 dogs, there is a gap (varying in width from approximately 2 - 5
inches) in between the breezeway and the outdoor floor area. These gaps are large enough that the dogs feet or
legs could fall through causing injury to the dogs. The licensee must repair these sections of the enclosures and
ensure that all enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely
at all times.

3.4(b)(2)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shade
One of the dogs in an outdoor enclosure pulled down the shade structure used to cover four enclosures, affecting 8
dogs. In two other outdoor enclosures, affecting 5 dogs, there was no shade provided to protect them from the
direct rays of the sun during the midday hours. Access to a shaded area is necessary for the dogs to be able to
receive relief from the direct rays of the sun at all times during the daylight hours. The licensee must provide these
enclosures with a shade structure and ensure that all dogs have access to a shaded area at all times during the
daylight hours.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter
In an outdoor enclosure there is a shelter that is not tall enough or large enough for two dogs. The shelter provided
must be large enough that the dogs can sit, stand, lie down and turn about freely and to provide them with a place
to comfortably escape the extremes of weather. The licensee must provide these two dogs with a shelter, and
ensure that all dogs are provided with a shelter, that is large enough to allow the dogs to sit, stand, lie down and
turn about freely at all times. To be corrected by: 17 April 2015

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Construction
There are two enclosures, affecting three dogs, that have been chewed and can no longer be properly cleaned and
sanitized. Some of the chewed areas contained embedded dirt and grime. The licensee must repair or replace
these shelters and ensure that all shelters are maintained so that they can be properly cleaned and sanitized.
