Facilities, general.
While conducting this inspection it was noted that the south west corner of the deer enclosure is in need of attention. A
tree had fallen onto the chain link fence. The tree has been removed but the fencing is bent down by at least 1'. To ensure
the integrity of the fencing and to prevent unwanted animals from entering the enclosure, this fencing will need to be
repaired. All fencing needs to be kept in good repair and maintained structurally sound.
