2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is a small area on the left side of the bobcat lockout that does not have a barrier to prevent the public from
gaining access to the exhibit.
The public can walk unimpeded back to this area. This lack of a complete public barrier to the exhibit does not
minimize the risk of harm to the animal or to the public.

This is a focused inspection limited to the reinspection of all non compliant items identified on the last inspection, as
well as the animal exhibits/areas of those non compliances.
Acquisition, disposition, & animal death records since the last inspection were also reviewed.
The exit interview was conducted with the facility veterinarian and the Deputy Director of Animal Care.
