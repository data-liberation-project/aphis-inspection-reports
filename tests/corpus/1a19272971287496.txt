2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Several of the Bichon's have long nails that need to be trimmed and some matting along their legs. Long nails
can pose a hazard to the dog if they get caught in the wire mesh. These nails need to be trimmed on a routine basis
to prevent this issue. In addition, matted fur pulls and separates from the skin and can be painful and cause skin
irritations. These dogs need to have these mats trimmed out and groomed more frequently to prevent this issue.
*** A shitzu # 32 needs to be seen by the vet to evaluate the right eye which is blue in color with an upper eye lid
that is red and swollen. Contacting the vet is considered an appropriate method to diagnose and treat injuries or
conditions for the animal and provide a treatment plan if necessary.
