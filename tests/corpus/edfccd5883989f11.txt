FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The screen on an outside door to the rabbit room was broken and had been repaired with tape. There is a hole in
the screen that may allow insects or other pests to enter the room. The damaged screen had been reported but had
not yet been repaired. The facility must be kept in good repair to prevent entrance of other animals into the room.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
A strong odor of ammonia was noted upon entry into the rabbit room . The odor caused irritation to eye/nose of both
USDA inspectors and may cause the same irritation to the animals airways.There is concern that the ventilation
system may not be adequate for the number of animals ( 65 rabbits ) and the size of the room . A method must be
developed to prevent a build up of ammonia to provide for the health and comfort of the animals.
