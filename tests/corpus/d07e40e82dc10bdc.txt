ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The older male wallaby housed alone inside is thin and has a rough hair coat.
The pelvis of this animal is readily apparent despite the ruffled hair coat and demonstrates poor body condition.
There is hair loss on the top of his noses with scabs on the bald area above the nostrils. There is hair loss on the
digits on the left foot. On the outer digit this hair loss extends from the tip to halfway up the foot and on the middle
digit the hair loss extends from the tip to the second knuckle. There is also hair loss on the digits on the left
forepaw. On the top outer side of the left forepaw this hair loss extends up past the wrist to the lower foreleg. All of
these areas of hair loss have several small darkly colored scabs which are indicative of rubbing or scratching the
skin. Although scratching behavior was not observed during the inspection, the alert behavior shown by this animal
makes it unlikely to show that behavior while the inspector is present.

The facility personnel had separated out this wallaby to house alone and feed separate from the other wallabies.
This wallaby does not appear healthy. The wallaby has not been seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for
his current condition. Each exhibitor must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that
include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the
availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Correct by having the wallaby seen by the attending
veterinarian and following the recommendations of the veterinarian. Correct by March 21, 2015.
3.80(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.80(a)(2)(i) Primary enclosure: The enclosure housing one ring-tailed lemur has the wire mesh screening
fraying and detaching from the front of the right wall of the indoor area of the enclosure. The frayed detached areas
of screening create sharp points and edges that could injure the lemur. Enclosures must be maintained so they
have no sharp points or edges. Correct by replacing, removing or repairing the wire mesh screen attached to the
walls of the lemur enclosure. Correct by March 25, 2015.3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81 Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being: The two marmosets are still not
included in the facility plan for environment enhancement. The plan for environment enhancement is to promote
psychological well-being of the non-human primates and must be in accordance with currently accepted
professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides and as directed by the
attending veterinarian. Correct by adding the marmosets to the facility plan for environment enhancement to ensure
their well-being and have the plan approved by the attending veterinarian.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
3.131(a) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(a) Cleaning of enclosures: Most of the ground in the shelter for the enclosure housing one young
male alpaca is wet from urine. There is an accumulation of feces at the entrance. The only dry areas of the shelter
are along the walls. There is no bedding inside the shelter to provide the animal a dry place to lie down. During the
night the alpaca is confined inside the shelter, but there are clean areas inside the enclosure accessible during the
day. Urine and feces smell and may be a source of bacteria to cause illness. Lying on wet ground may cause the
alpaca discomfort and result in illness. Excreta must be removed from enclosures, including shelters, as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. During
the inspection the shelter was cleaned and fresh straw placed inside. Correct by maintaining enclosure shelters
clean and dry for the comfort and health of the animals.

An exit briefing was conducted with the animal caretaker.
