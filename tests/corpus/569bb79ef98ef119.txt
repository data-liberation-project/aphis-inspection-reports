SANITATION.
The floor around and under the primary enclosures had an excessive amount of old litter, hay, and food stuffs.
There was also a pile about 24" by 12" of old food/bedding pellets on the floor by the primary heating unit. The
floor area needs to be kept clean to facilitate sanitation of primary enclosures and to prevent the possible
introduction of molds/mildew or pests. There needs to be a regular schedule of general housekeeping in place and
being followed.
