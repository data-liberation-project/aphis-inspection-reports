2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility is currently allowing some of the goats, sheep, deer, and a cow to use the fenced parking lot area as an
enclosure by allowing free access to this area. The area presents several hazards for the animals. The motor
vehicles present a risk of running over, or striking the animals when they are moving, and also the risk of leaking
fluids, such as antifreeze, which is palatable and lethal to animals. Additionally the area includes some discarded
items, such as a roll of wire fencing and sheets of corrugated metal, which have sharp surfaces and an
entanglement risk, and bags of trash in plastic bags which could be torn open and ingested by the animals.
Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical
harm. Handling the animals in this manner - allowing them access to this parking area which was not intended as an
animal enclosure, puts the animals at risk of trauma or physical harm. The facility should ensure that the animals
are handled in a manner which protects them from harm, and this includes safe surroundings in their enclosures.
To be corrected by 8/15/18.
