CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The kennel consists of one sheltered building which is divided into two areas. In the adult housing area there is an
accumulation of spider webs with dead insects on the windows and walls. There is spilt food in the enclosures and
central walk way floor. There are accumulations of flies through out the building including the empty enclosures.
The dealer does have a fly bait jar which is half full. Premises where housing facilities are located, including
buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to
facilitate husbandry practices, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and
to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
