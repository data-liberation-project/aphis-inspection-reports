Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. In Pen 16R there was an adult brown and white guinea
pig with the right eye held closed and a thick yellow discharge was visible inside and around the eye. In the same pen, an
adult tri-color guinea pig was observed with the left eye held closed and a thick yellow discharge was visible inside and
around the eye. The right eye of this guinea pig also was held partially closed. The margins of the right eye were slightly
red and swollen and yellow discharge was visible inside and around the eye. The licensee had not observed the health
conditions in these animals and had not contacted the attending veterinarian or administered any treatments. The
Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided treatment options.
Eye abnormalities can affect the vision, can be indicative of disease or injury, can be painful, and affect the overall health
and well-being of the animal.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the Attending Veterinarian to
evaluate the animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.


There was a broken pane of glass in the garage door in the building housing the guinea pigs resulting in an opening
approximately 4 x 9 inches in size.
Failure to maintain the building in good repair can allow birds, pests, or insects to enter the facility and cause injury or
spread diseases to the guinea pigs.
The guinea pig housing facility must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to restrict the entrance of other animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
