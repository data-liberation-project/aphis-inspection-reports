ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 300pm on
02/03/2016.
I arrived at facility, honked horn, called and left a message that I was there and would wait for 30 minutes. After 1
hour the licensee called and advised they were far from the facility and would not be able to make it back for an
inspection. They advised that Wednesday is still the best day for inspections, except for this one.
