3.15(a)(9)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
This inspection was conducted at completion of a scheduled stop in Dickson, TN. The enclosures used to transport the
dogs all had a solid, leak-proof bottom. Litter was provided in the form of a towel/blanket or sheets of paper (similar to ink
free newsprint). Two enclosures, each housing one dog, were noted with a wet bundle of the paper in the enclosure and
no remaining clean litter. Several other enclosures were noted with minimal supply of the paper litter which would not be
enough to absorb and cover excreta especially for the large breed dogs. Enough clean litter is necessary to absorb and
cover excreta so the dogs do not get contaminated. The primary enclosures for dogs with solid bottoms must contain
enough safe, nontoxic absorbent litter material to absorb and cover excreta.
The enclosures for the two dogs with the wet paper litter were corrected during the inspection. Correct by 11/29/21.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
