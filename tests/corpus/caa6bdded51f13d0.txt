2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
There were no attendants visible throughout the majority of the facility when the public was present. When the executive
director was asked about the lack of attendants, she stated that they were probably still doing chores.

A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods
of public contact.

Attendants that have knowledge, experience and that can be identified as attendants must be present at all times when
the public is allowed to have contact with the animals to ensure the safety of the public, and the animals.

3.53(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The metal pipes that make up the vertical supports for the rabbit enclosures are severely rusted. There are two pipes that
have disintegrated at the bottom, and are held up by blocks of wood. When the executive director was asked about these
rabbit enclosures and their supports the director stated "That metal is gone. When we're so close to moving there's no

way we can get new cages in here."

Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain
them, and to keep predators out.

The structural supports for these enclosures must be maintained in good repair to ensure the stability of the stacked rabbit
enclosures and protect the rabbits from injury by the stacked enclosures falling.
3.56(b)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
At least 50 percent of the approximately 45 rabbit enclosures have rusted areas on the urine guards, access doors, and/or
an accumulation of urine scale.

Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(3) of
this section.

Remove, replace, or repair the rusted urine guards, and doors so that they can be properly sanitized to prevent odor and
disease hazards. The urine scale must be removed prior to sanitizing these enclosures as it is a porous surface and
cannot be sanitized properly.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
One of the fence panels for the 2 calves with calf huts is only affixed to the post at the bottom. There is a gap
approximately 6" with no pressure against it, and approximately 2' when gently pulled.


The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

The animal facilities must be maintained in good repair to prevent entanglement in the fence that may cause injury to the
animals contained.
3.125(d)

Facilities, general.
-There is a very large pile of manure that is overflowing its containment area. This manure is what has been removed
from the pens, but is close proximity to the cow pens, and approximately 20 yards from the main barn. There is liquid
coming from the manure pile and puddling around it. This manure pile is also surrounding an electrical post.
-There is a large pile of manure and muck that measures approximately 6' by 3' by 3' tall in the enclosure of the 6 Boer
goats. When the executive director was asked about the manure pile in the Boer goat enclosure she stated "It's so labor
intensive, and we can't get rid of the manure pile anyway."

Provision shall be made for the removal and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, trash and
debris. Disposal facilities shall be so provided and operated as to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease
hazards.

The manure piles must be removed to prevent contamination of the animals, reduce odors, and disease hazards.

3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The 2 Yucatan pigs, and the approximately 15 pygmy goats that are housed together have shelters that are wet with
excessive muck and mud in them. It has rained or snowed 5 of the seven days prior to inspection.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

Shelter with clean, dry, bedding must be offered to these animals to prevent discomfort of the animals and to offer
protection from the elements.
3.127(c) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The majority of the outdoor enclosures have excessive mud in them. This includes a pen with 3 adult sheep, a pen with a
single, male, angora goat, a pen with 2 Yucatan pigs, a pen with approximately 15 pygmy goats, a pen with 3 adult
production pigs, the enclosure for 2 calves with calf huts, a pen in the front of the facility where approximately 15 yearling
goats are kept during the day, and a pen housing 6 Boer goats, the pen housing 4 adult cows. Numerous animals were
noted to have mud up there legs, and several were noted to have mud on their bellies.

A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.


A method to eliminate excess water must be provided to allow all animals access to food, water and shelter without
having to walk through a deep layer of mud, to prevent contamination of the animals by urine and feces in the mud, and to
reduce the risk of disease and odor.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
An enclosure housing 3 adult sheep has a large accumulation of bedding and manure that measures approximately 10".
An enclosure of approximately 10 goats inside the barn has an accumulation of bedding and manure that measures
approximately 10". An enclosure housing 6 Boer goats has excessive feces on the wooden platforms.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animal enclosed, reduce disease
hazards, and reduce odors.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The front pasture for the sheep has a fence panel lying down in it, and a stack of approximately 8-10 boards.

Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated
areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.


Animal areas must be kept clean to prevent injury to the animals by possible foot entanglement in the fencing laying on
the ground.
3.132 Repeat

Employees.
The number of basic husbandry citations, and the lack of a sufficient number of attendants when the public is present
shows that there is a lack of employees/volunteers. When the executive was asked where the attendants were she stated
"they are probably still doing chores".

A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.

A sufficient number of employees/volunteers must be utilized to maintain professionally acceptable levels of husbandry,
and to ensure both the animals and the public are kept safe during times of public contact with the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted the executive director.
