ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, brown Shih-Tzu male named "Cash" and identified by microchip number (981020011083312) has a left
eye with an abnormal appearance. Most of the eye is cloudy with a blue-gray color. There is a watery discharge and
a small perforation visible near the center of the eye. The licensee had not noticed the eye prior to inspection.
The abnormal appearance of the eye could be an indication of injury, infection, or other medical issues. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. Documentation should be available for all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended
treatment must be part of the documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times.
