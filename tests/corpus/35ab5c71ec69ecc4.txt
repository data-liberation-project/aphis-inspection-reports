2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of of 90 adult guinea pigs, 50 weanlings, and
12 newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records of the number of adults, weanlings,
and newborns present for the last few months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health
of the caviary by identifying guinea pig additions and losses by death or decreasing numbers of animals born or animals
kept for replacements. The licensee must maintain records on the number of guinea pigs held, owned, births, deaths, and
sold. Correct by April 15, 2022.
3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The 5 weanling guinea pig enclosures have bare wood on the sides. All guinea pig enclosures must be constructed of
smooth materials that are substantially impervious to moisture and liquids. Wood surfaces that are not maintained and
kept sealed will allow the absorption of fluids and make it difficult to properly clean and sanitized. Licensee must ensure
that wood surfaces are resealed when worn or replaced with a material that is impervious to moisture and liquids. Correct
