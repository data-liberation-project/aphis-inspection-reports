ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** The right eye of an adult brown and black Beagle ( Tag #185 ) was cloudy in appearance. The white area
covered more than one-half of the eye. This could be due to an infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical
conditions. The licensee stated that this was the first time the eye had been noticed. Eye problems can be painful
causing discomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog. The attending veterinarian had not been
consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. This Beagle also had a coating of dark
brown matter on the cheek teeth on both sides of his mouth extending up into the gum line. There was a dark red
line on the junction of the teeth and gum. The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum
tissue and tooth structures, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and potentially harm the health
of the animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request.

****One chocolate Cocker Spaniel (Tag# 341) had a large amount of a milky green crusty discharge around both
eyes. The left eye had a white cloudy appearance in the center of the eye, covering almost one-half of the eye.
The licensee stated that he had just picked up this dog over the past weekend and had not notice the condition.
Eye problems can be painful causing discomfort and can worsen quickly when not properly treated. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
****There was no record of inventory present on puppies less than 16 weeks of age at the facility. There were 99
puppies that had no identification on or near them. Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal'sidentity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements for inventory, disposition,
transport, and healthcare documentation. The owner must identify all live regulated animals and assure that records
are kept at all times. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure that every puppy's identity can be
known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The licensee must maintain complete and
accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces
****Seven self-feeders in the outdoor enclosures were excessively rusted and pitted and the metal was flaking off.
Two feeders had rusted through, causing holes and jagged edges in the food tray part of the feeder. The dogs'
food is in direct contact with these excessively rusted surfaces. The licensee must ensure that any surfaces that
come in contact with the dogs are free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles.
****Multiple raised enclosures had wind and rain breaks,the back walls of the enclosure and inside of the enclosure
unit covered in dirt, grease and other excreta. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of
excreta and other disease hazards. Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential contamination,
soiling or caking of the hair coat or disease risks if the area is not kept clean. The licensee must ensure that all
surfaces are cleaned and sanitized once every two weeks or more often if needed.
