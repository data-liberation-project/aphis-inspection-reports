3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
-- In an experimental chamber used for olfaction studies for eight, adult male and female dogs at the facility (ID #D187,
C446, D211, D446, D296, C575, C612, D436), the walls of the room have unsealed concrete in multiple areas that begins
at the floor and extends upward ~2-5". Those unsealed surfaces are covered with a brownish material, indicating that
they cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized. There is also a crack in the floor of the chamber room that extends the width
of the room.
-- In one of the kennel rooms housing six of the eight adult, male and female dogs, there are areas of the indoor runs that
have exposed, unsealed concrete where the epoxy paint has been worn or chipped away.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized, creating the potential for harboring
microorganisms that can pose a disease risk for the dogs. Absorption of water via cracks or other unsealed areas can
also undermine the structural integrity of surfaces, causing them to fail and potentially injure an animal. Surfaces of
indoor housing facilities, including floors and walls, must be impervious to moisture. The licensee must ensure that
affected surfaces are sealed or painted in a manner that makes them impervious to moisture, and ensure that all surfaces
are appropriately maintained at all times in order to support the health and well-being of the animals.
