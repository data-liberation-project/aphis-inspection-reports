Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 53.3 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. Although there was a
wall heater, it was not turned on and there were several roof vents open. The ambient outdoor temperature according to
the National Weather Service at the time of inspection (10:30am) was 41 degrees F. The predicted overnight low
temperature is 27 degrees F.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

Sanitation.
There was a large accumulation of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor of the facility next to the stacks of
guinea pig pens. The licensee had recently cleaned the enclosures but had not yet removed the discarded material.
There were several spiderwebs between the ceiling and the upper level of guinea pig pens and around the outside of the
feeders and watering pipes.


The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
