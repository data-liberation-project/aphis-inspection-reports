Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Thirteen IACUC meetings minutes were provided to USDA since the last inspection on November 13, 2020. Of those
thirteen meetings, eleven had IACUC activity requiring a quorum for voting to occur, where the Attending Veterinarian was
only in attendance for two of those eleven meetings and the nonaffiliated member has only attended four of those eleven
meetings. Representation from the veterinarian, who has direct and delegated program responsibilities for activities
involving animals, and the nonaffiliated member, who represents the general community interests, is vital to having a fully
functioning IACUC. A veterinarian and a nonaffiliated member shall be regularly attending members of IACUC functions
so the IACUC can perform its mandate of assessing the research facility’s animal program, facilities, and procedures.
