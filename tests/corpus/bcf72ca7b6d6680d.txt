PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The hutch that housed four rabbits was in need of repair. There was 6 in x 6 in white coated piece of wire mesh on
the wire floor of the hutch. However, this 6 in x 6 in piece of wire was detached from the primary flooring. There
were now small gaps between this piece and the primary flooring. To ensure that the rabbits feet and legs are
protected from injury, this area should be repaired.

3.53(c)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At the time of this inspection 2 rabbit hutches were being used to house 10 rabbits in one and 9 rabbits in the other.
The hutches were 66" x 26" which measures out to be ~ 12 sq feet. The rabbits being housed were in the 4.4 lbs -
8.8 lbs range. Therefore, each rabbit needs to be given 3 sq ft of floor space. These two hutches were obviously too
small for the number of animals that they were housing. This situation will need to be addressed.

with green algae. The water bottles should be sanitized to prevent build up of algae and debris.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wood wall between the chicken and pig enclosures is in need of repair. The wall was constructed of three ply
wood sheets. The middle panel had damage to the bottom left side. This area was approximately one foot long
and had jagged edges. To ensure that the animals are not injured, or further damage the wood paneling and
escape the primary enclosure, this area will need to be addressed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During this inspection, the grain was being housed in a newly constructed barn. Several of the bags were left open
