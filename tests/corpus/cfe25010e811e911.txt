Facilities, general.
In an enclosure for one elk, there is a broken metal gate between two pasture areas. The broken gate has multiple bars
with sharp, rusted edges that are sticking into the opening. Parts of the broken gate are also laying on the ground. The
inspector witnessed the elk walking over this debris and passing through the opening while maneuvering around the
broken bars still attached to the fence. Additionally, there are multiple sharp wire points from the fencing that are sticking
into the enclosure.
Sharp points and debris on the ground can cause injury to the animals. All enclosures shall be structurally sound and shall
be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected by October 7, 2022.

Watering.
In an enclosure for one elk, the only water receptacle available contains dark green water and plant debris. The sides and
bottom of the receptacle cannot be seen through the discolored water.
Failure to maintain a clean water receptacle can lead to water that becomes contaminated and an animal that is reluctant


to drink as often as it normally would. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary.
To be corrected by September 19, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
