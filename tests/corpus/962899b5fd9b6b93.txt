FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the spotted Hyena's enclosure, there is a section of the fence that is loose and needs to be stretched and
securely fastened to the surrounding support poles. At the top of the fence there are two sections where the barbed
wire of the kick in is loose and drooping. There is an additional area of the perimeter fence where it is bent and
looks as if something could be jumping or climbing on it. This area is a potential source of ingress or egress and
must be repaired.
All fencing in every section of the park must be maintained at all times in order to safely contain and prevent injury
and/or entrapment to the enclosed animals.
In the area of the drive through next to the medical building there was an outside enclosure inhabited by a female
pot belly pig that looked pregnant. She escaped from her previous enclosure with other pigs by going through a
hole in the fence. The enclosure where she currently is does not contain a shelter from the elements. This hole inthe fence is a potential source of injury and/or entrapment for any animals that might traverse it. This section of
fencing needs repair and shelter from the elements provided for the female pig wherever she is contained.
All fencing in every section of the park must be maintained at all times in order to safely contain and prevent injury
and/or entrapment to the enclosed animals.
Hole in pig fence repaired at time of inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
