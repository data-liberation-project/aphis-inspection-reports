2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
This was a focused inspection for veterinary care on the animals from the July 8, 2021 report.
***According to the attending veterinarian's records from the July 12, 2021 examination, temperature, humidity and
ventilation of the indoor marmoset building were to be addressed according to specific directions by the veterinarian. The
humidity ranges were not to be below 57% and not above 65%. Ventilation were described to be air exchanges of 10-15
per hour. At the time of the inspection, the humidity (via Kestrel 4000) ranged from 48.6% to 53.2%. The licensee stated
that she had purchased hygrometers, yet they had not been placed in the building. To address the ventilation the licensee
stated that there was a plan to move the remaining six marmosets in this building (Canton Building) to another building
within the next few days. There were no other plans to address the lack of ventilation. Instructions that are received from
the licensed veterinarian that are not followed can worsen conditions. The licensee must address the humidity and
ventilation as instructed by the attending veterinarian as required and follow veterinarian's recommendations as directed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
