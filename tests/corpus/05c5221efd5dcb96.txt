2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection, it was observed that several animals are in need of immediate veterinary care.
***A male Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that was irregular in shape, approximately 4
inches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth was covered with flies.
The licensee was still unable to provide documentation of a physical exam, diagnosis, or treatment plan provided by
the attending veterinarian. The licensee periodically applies fly spray to the area.
***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, has cloudy yellow liquid draining from her left year and it is drying up and
covering her inner ear. A facility representative stated that she has called and emailed (this email was shown to the
VMO) her veterinarian about the ear discharge that she noticed 5 days ago. During the inspection, the facility
representative was able to make an appointment with her veterinarian for August 21, 2017. The fox still has hair
loss over the knuckles of all four feet and has excessively long nails that need to be trimmed.
***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS
inspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing. The facility
representative provided documentation showing that the veterinarian had examined and treated the goat on March
9, 2017. The licensee stated that the veterinarian had rechecked the goat on March 16, 2017, however did not have
any documentation regarding that visit. The goat is still not weight-bearing during the inspection conducted today on
August 8, 2017. The goat was rechecked on May 27, 2017 by the veterinarian and it was his recommendation that
1) more diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2) if the facility
representatives do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the animal. The
veterinarian stated in his report that the animal did not appear to be in pain and the NAIDS used previously provided
no improvement.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility.The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plans for the problems cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the
inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests, and the
outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate
veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries. The licensee is required to follow the guidance of their attending veterinarian.
A complete routine inspection was conducted on August 17, 2017. This report is limited to the direct non-compliant
items identified on the inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect non-compliant items and one
critical non-compliant item will follow.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives on August 17, 2017.
