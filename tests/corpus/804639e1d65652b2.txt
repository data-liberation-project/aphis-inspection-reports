FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Since the last inspection, a lynx and Asian clawed otters have been housed at the facility in outdoor enclosures.
There is no perimeter fence around the property or the enclosures. A perimeter fence prevents unwanted animals
and unauthorized persons from passing through, over, or under it to gain access to animals in enclosures. The
perimeter fence can also serves as secondary containment should an animal escape from its enclosure. An
appropriately constructed perimeter fence, at least 8 feet in height must be constructed around the lynx enclosure.
Additionally, an appropriately constructed perimeter fence, at least 6 feet in height, must be constructed around the
Asian clawed otters. The perimeter fences must also extend a sufficient distance from the outside of the primary
enclosure, at least 3 feet, to restrict direct contact of the public and unwanted animals with the animals within the
enclosures. Alternatively, an 8 foot fence can be constructed around the property that will encompass the Asian
clawed otter and lynx enclosures. Correct by March 30, 2018
