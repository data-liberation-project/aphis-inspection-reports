One of the shelters for five ibex has a wooden board floor. In one corner of this small shed, two boards are partially
missing, leaving large holes, which are big enough for an ibex leg to go through the floor. All structures need to be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by 7-22-19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director.
