3.14(b)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The floor of the trailer where the dogs are housed is made of wood. The licensee said that the manufacturer
claimed it would be waterproof, however inspectors had the licensee splash some water on the floor and later in the
inspection the water was looked at. The water had partially soaked into the wood and when the excess water was
wiped off, there was a wet spot of water soaked into the wood. This is indicative that the floor surface is not
impervious to moisture and cannot be adequately sanitized. Unsealed wood that is not impervious to moisture
cannot be sanitized according to AWA regulations and standards required in 3.11(b)(3) and create a source for
bacteria. The licensee must make the floor surfaces that the dogs contact impervious to moisture so that it can be
properly sanitized.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
In the trailer, the licensees have a wolf, a lynx, two mountain lion cubs(8 wks), and a bear that the licensee reports
is seven months old. The licensees said that these animals are not used in animal acts at the current event and the
licensees say that these animals have been in their trailer enclosures at all times for this event. They advised that
they have not let the animals out of their primary enclosure during this event for exercise. The enclosures for these
animals allow only minimal postural adjustment, however do not provide sufficient space for regular exercise or
species specific postural adjustments. No opportunity for regular exercise does not provide animals with adequate
freedom of movement and can lead to animals’ debilitation and behavioral problems caused by stress from
restricted movement. Licensees must provide these animals with opportunities for regular exercise and normal
species postural adjustments for these animals in a secure area for a reasonable amount of time at least once daily.

Inspection and exit interview was conducted with licensees at the Illinois State Fairgrounds in Springfield, IL by
VMO Welch and ACI Houser.
NOTE: A copy of “Policy 6: Space and Exercise Requirements for Traveling Exhibitors” and March 2016 TechNote “Handling and Husbandry of Neonatal Nondomestic Cats” was left with the licensee.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 18, 2016.
