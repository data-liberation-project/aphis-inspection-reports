FEEDING.
Several of the metal food receptacles located inside of the guinea pig enclosures were rusty in areas. One of which
was noted to have rust in direct contact with the food. Rust is neither palatable nor is rusted metal readily
sanitizable. Food receptacles must be kept cleaned and sanitized for the health of the animals. The facility has
implemented a plan to correct this item.
To correct from this point forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives at the time of inspection.
