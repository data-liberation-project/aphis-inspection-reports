HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ringtail lemur enclosure has two out of the three locking mechanisms on the entrance door which are not
working. The latch where a padlock was used is lacking the hook so it is unable to be padlocked. The door is
accessible to the public and could easily be opened. This enclosure is in need of repair to keep the animal securely
contained.
