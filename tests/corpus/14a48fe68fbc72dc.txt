* Dug holes were observed in the dirt ground floor in one enclosure and next to the enclosure gate in another
enclosure. Two dogs are in contact with the affected areas which are located in outdoor housing. The holes were
estimated to be one foot wide by six inched deep. This affects the ability of enclosure fencing to contain the dogs
securely. It could lead to potential injury affecting the safety and health of the dog. The licensee must keep
facilities in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely at all times.
