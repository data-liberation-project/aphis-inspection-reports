ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0925 on
03/02/2016.
Optimal inspection time was until 11 am Monday through Friday. From the front gate, I called the cell number and
the main phone number at approximately 0925. I received no response. I waited at least 1/2 hour for a response.
Then, I left.
