2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 76 adult and 3 newborn guinea pigs were
counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults, weanlings, or newborns
present for the last few months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary
by indicating losses by deaths or deceases in the number of animals born, and to track animals being used in regulated
activities to ensure their humane care and use. The facility must maintain records containing the required information
which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.
