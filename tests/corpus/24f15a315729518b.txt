Black Leopard: this geriatric animal has age related health issues, including ataxia and skin problems. Records
available at time of inspection indicated the animal was seen by the attending veterinarian in January and April
2014. However, there is no documented evaluation of the animal by the attending veterinarian for the April 2014
visit. Documentation available during inspection is necessary to ensure this geriatric animal is receiving appropriate
care for chronic conditions.
