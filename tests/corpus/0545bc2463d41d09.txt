2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult, female, black and white Jacob sheep was missing approximately one-third of her wool. Multiple patches
of wool were missing over her chest, her armpit area, both sides of her belly, her outer thighs, and around her tail
head. Due to the lack of wool, her skin was visible in those areas, especially on the lower portion of her belly and
thighs. There were two scabs visible in the area of the right flank. The licensee stated that every year the goats in
the enclosure chew the wool off of one of the sheep, as they try to eat bits of alfalfa that fall into the fleece. At the
time of inspection, APHIS inspector did not observe this behavior from any of the goats. The licensee was aware of
the wool loss, however the sheep had not been separated from the other animals, nor had the attending
veterinarian been notified about the sheep’s condition.
Wool loss can be an indication of health issues, including parasitism, infection, and nutritional deficiencies. The
licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the licensee must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the
animals at the facility. The licensee was notified verbally that she must have the sheep examined by a veterinarian
to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans to address the issue cited above.
The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by
the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care
shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Wool loss can also be an indication of bullying or incompatibility with the other animals in the enclosure. Animals
housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere
with their health or cause them discomfort.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
