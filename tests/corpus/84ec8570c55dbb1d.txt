ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The adult female Capybara has excessive hair loss on approximately 50 percent of its body and head. The skin on
the abdomen, chest and inside of the legs was reddened and inflamed and the Capybara was observed itching. The
licensee stated that the Capybara itches itself by rubbing along the fencing in its enclosure. No communication with
the attending veterinarian regarding this skin condition has occurred and no veterinary care has been provided.
Medical conditions affecting the skin can negatively affect the health and comfort of the animal or cause further
serious health conditions. The Capybara must be examined by the attending veterinarian to determine diagnosis
and prescribe treatment. Documentation must be maintained by the licensee on veterinary examinations, diagnosis,
treatment prescribed and be available upon request during subsequent inspections. Correct by October 8, 2015.

SANITATION.
Pest control.
Numerous flies were observed throughout the Capybaras(cid:25) pen. The flies were congregated around a plastic bin of
fruit and other produce in the enclosure. The flies were excessive and flying into the adjacent enclosure next to the
Capybaras which contained Kangaroos and Wallabies. There was no pest control in place to deal with the
excessive amount of flies in the pen. Pests, such as flies, can carry disease or parasites, which can cause an
animal to become sick or even die. Flies can also bite, which can be irritable. A pest control plan must be
developed and implemented to control the number of flies in the pen. Correct by October 8, 2015.
