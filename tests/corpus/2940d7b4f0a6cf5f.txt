ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
In the office area, a single ring tailed lemur is being held. There are no other nonhuman primates within visual or
auditory distance. The cage was empty of any type of enrichment, and the animal displayed repetitive pacing
consistently while inspectors were present. Singly housed primates need special consideration for enrichment and
must be accounted for on the facility enrichment plan. The facility must ensure adequate enrichment is present for
this animal.
Corrected during the inspection
