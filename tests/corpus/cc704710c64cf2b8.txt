2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Brown and Black Yorkshire Terrier id# 4910517A21 was observed standing on three legs and holding her
right front paw off the ground. She was unable to stand or walk normally. Upon examining the dog an
approximately one inch diameter mass or swelling was noticed on the top of the right front foot. The area was
swollen around the top of her foot and down between the toes. Lameness is a clear sign of injury or discomfort, and
must be addressed with proper veterinary care. The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than
12 November 2014 and a record of the examination and treatment protocol retained for their animal health records.

3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the whelping building, the top of the sheltered portions of the enclosures are composed of wire grate. On multiple
enclosures housing puppies, there was a build-up of dirt, hair and cobwebs. The dust and hair is accumulating on
the wire and on the heating lamps. This is a clear indication of inadequate cleaning and sanitation. Accumulation of
dirt, debris, and grime increases the risk of contamination to animals kept within the enclosures. The tops of the
enclosures must be routinely cleaned and all the dirt and debris removed to protect the health and well-being of the
dogs. Owner must ensure that all areas around the dogs are cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to
maintain proper husbandry standards.

3.3(d)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
In enclosure number 7 D there are three adult Labradors. The indoor shelter area provided for the dogs is not large
enough for each of the dogs to comfortably make normal postural adjustments, including sitting, standing and lying
down in a normal manner. Inadequate space could potentially lead to conflict between the animals, resulting in
stress to the animals or the possibility of physical injury. Owner must ensure that all the dogs in each enclosure
have adequate space to sit, stand and lie in a normal manner and turn about freely. Owner must correct by 11-11-2014
