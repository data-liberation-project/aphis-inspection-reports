Food and water requirements.
On 2/16/2021 the CDC personnel at SFO informed this inspector that they looked at five dogs (one adult French Bulldog
and four German Shepherds under 6 months of age) that had been checked as baggage by a passenger arriving at SFO
on Turkish Air flight # 0079 from Istanbul, via flight # 1082 from Belgrade, with passenger ticket # 2352434355577.

The crates did not have food and water receptacles attached inside, as required. Failure to ensure that animals being
transported have food and water receptacles can put the welfare of the animals at risk, as they cannot easily be watered
or fed.

The airline must ensure that all requirements under the Animal Welfare Act regulations are met when accepting animals
for transport as baggage or cargo.

This inspection information was provided as described. The exit interview was conducted with cargo personnel at the
Turkish Airlines cargo office at SFO on 3/3/2021.
