3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
The facility found on 2/18/21 a ferret kit was found to have got its leg caught in an area of the enclosure. Upon discovery,
it received prompt veterinary attention and was humanely euthanized. It was found to have had a talus fracture. The
facility found the enclosure that it got its leg caught in had a bowed enclosure floor with enough space for a kit leg to get
caught in. To prevent further occurrences the facility reports it has removed all affected floor components from inventory.
Enclosures with bowed floors can cause injury as occurred this incident. Ensure that enclosures are maintained in good
repair to protect animals from injury and to contain them.

On 8/2/2021 the facility found a jill had given birth to two kits in the incorrect housing. An administrative error was found
to be the cause of standard weaned ferret housing being used rather than a singly-housed solid bottom housing for the
pregnant ferret. Two ferret kits were found dead prior to her being moved to another enclosure and two more were born
and found dead in the correct enclosure, and one more lived, although the cause of the deaths is unknown. The standard
housing was inappropriate for a pregnant ferret. The facility has taken steps to ensure that pregnant ferrets are correctly
housed to prevent any further incidents.



Correction: Ensure corrective actions are followed and continued.
