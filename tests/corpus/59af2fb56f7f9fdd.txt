2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records are still not complete. Licensee is now keeping track of deaths, but there was no listing of births or a
weanling count to keep track of offspring. Sale records did not include a complete name and address of the buyer.
Records must be kept and maintained on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program,
document changes in ownership, and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that
records on animal births are kept and maintained and that all sale record include a complete name and address of
the buyer.
Remains uncorrected.

WATERING.
There were accumulations of brown debris below the automatic water valves in the 32 enclosures on the right side
of the building. These accumulations around the water valves exposes the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards
with bacterial, fungi, and parasites. Water receptacles such as automatic water delivery lines and drain lines must
be cleaned and sanitized whenever dirty, and sanitized at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning of the
automatic water valves and drain lines can result in contamination of the guinea pigs in the same enclosure.
Licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep water valves and drain lines clean when dirty, and must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
Correct by October 3, 2015.
3.31 REPEAT
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are still not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations
of feces, dirty bedding and debris. Majority of the enclosures have accumulations of feces, dirty and wet bedding
and debris. The cleaning process (method and frequency) utilitized is not effective in removing this accumulation.
Licensee stated that he cleans and sanitizes enclosures every 2 weeks. A more frequent cleaning program isnecessary to prevent an accumulation of feces, dirty and wet bedding, and debris. Ineffective cleaning and
sanitation exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary
enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of feces, soiled bedding, and debris and must
be sanitized once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are kept clean and sanitized at least once
every 2 weeks.
Remains uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
