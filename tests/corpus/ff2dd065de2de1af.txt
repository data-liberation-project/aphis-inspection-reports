2.31(d)(1)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
IACUC approved protocol#001 did not provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to
determine that alternatives were not available for the procedures that may cause more than momentary pain or distress to
the animals in the protocol. Whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more than
momentary pain or distress to the animals, the IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has considered
alternatives to those procedures and the principal investigator has provided a written narrative description of the methods
and sources they used to determine that alternatives were not available. This requirement ensures that all procedures
contained in the protocol minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals. The IACUC needs to ensure all protocols
that are submitted that contain any procedure that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the
animals are in compliance with this section of the regulations.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
