PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two rabbits were housed together in a 37x 18 inch enclosure, providing 646 square inches or 4.48 sq ft. When
asked, the licensee approximated the weights of the rabbits at 6-8 pounds. The regulation requires 3 ft square of
space for each rabbit within the weight range of 4.4-8.8 lbs, therefore a total of 6 sq ft of space is required as the
minimum amount of floor space for two rabbits of this size.
Enclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the animals being maintained there. A sufficient
amount of floor space for rabbits is necessary in order to ensure that the animals have enough space to make
normal postural adjustments and adequate freedom of movement. The facility should ensure that the cages housing
their rabbits meet the required minimum floor space set forth in the regulations.
