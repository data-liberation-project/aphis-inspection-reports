HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The solid flooring in five stack cage units do not cover the entire enclosure flooring. There is an estimated one
to three inch gap that could allow animal waste, urine, litter box filler or spilled food to fall into the enclosure below.
Five cats are in contact with the affected enclosure flooring gap area which is located in indoor housing. Unsanitary
conditions exist affecting the health and well-being of the cats. The potential disease or health risks exist when
anything from one enclosure falls into another enclosure. The licensee must provide for the regular and frequent
collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease
risks. Correct by 4/30/19.
The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 4/16/19 were conducted with the licensee.
