ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to two dogs with eye issues. There is a 7yr old Female Shihtzu
#168 (blk/wht) that had a brown crusty buildup around the rims of both eyes. The right eye was cloudy in
appearance and had a green mucus in the corners. There was an older male Pekingese #103 (bro/wht) that had a
cloudy spot in the middle of his right eye. The eye appeared to have a more pointed look to it, causing the eye to
look like it bulged from the socket more than the left eye. The eyes of both dogs had not been observed until the
inspection.
It is important that a veterinarian is contacted as soon as any eye or health issues are observed in order to prevent
a treatable condition from becoming chronic and to decrease any pain or discomfort for the regulated animal.
The licensee must contact the veterinarian as soon as they observe any medical issues that need proper diagnosis
and treatment.
The licensee contacted the veterinarian during the inspection and will be coming to the site the next day.

3.8(b)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
There are eight (6 ft X 1.75 ft) primary enclosures that house three dogs approximately 22 inches in length, each.
Currently the enclosures are 10.5 square feet, and each dog of 22 inches requires a minimum 5.44 square feet
each. This would require a primary enclosure of 16.31 square feet needed to accommodate 3 dogs of that size.
It is important that when housing dogs in compatible groups that are in primary enclosures that are to be their living
quarters and exercise area that each dog has their minimum space requirement met. If the dogs are kept in areas
that are too small there can be compatibility issues and other stresses and health/behavioral issues that can result.
The licensee needs to decrease the number of dogs in the primary enclosures that are currently housing 3 dogs
each, down to the appropriate number for that size enclosure according to each dogs length.
