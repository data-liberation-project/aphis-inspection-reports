Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Three dogs were extremely thin, but their condition had not been recognized by the facility or communicated to the
attending veterinarian.
An adult male black Labrador dog “Preston” (microchip #956000012520826, age 1 year 10 months) was very thin. When
viewed from the back and side, the ribs, backbone and hip bones were clearly visible. In addition, an abdominal tuck and
prominent waist were observed. There was muscle loss in the forehead area. This dog’s medical record shows no new
entries since 05/26/22. This dog is not included in the facility’s list of dogs who are given a supplemental feeding in the
evening, and the employee who does supplemental feedings confirmed this dog is not on the list to receive additional
food. According to facility records, the dog has lost 3.8 lbs since October: the facility document “December weights”, this
dog weighed 63.4 lbs, and on 10/30/22, the document “October weights” shows this dog weighed 67.2 lbs.
An adult female Weimaraner dog “Star” (microchip # 98112004242291) is very thin. When viewed from the back and side,
the ribs, backbone and hip bones were clearly visible. In addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent waist were observed.
This dog’s medical record does not list a recent inspection with last entries for a dental prophylaxis treatment with a
complete blood count and serum biochemistry on June 17, 2022. This dog is not included in the facility’s list of dogs who
are supposed to receive supplemental feeding in the evening, and the employee who does supplemental feedings


confirmed this dog is not on the list to receive additional food. This dog weighed 44.4 lbs according to the facility’s weight
log dates 10/30/22. On the document “December weights” this dog is reported as 43 lbs.
An 11-year-old adult female Vizsla dog “Shakira” (Microchip # 985112005668912) is very thin. When viewed from the
back and side, the ribs, backbone and hip bones were clearly visible. In addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent waist
were observed. This dog’s medical record that the dog was last seen by the Attending Veterinarian in October 2022 for a
lump on the hind leg. This dog is not included in the facility’s list of dogs who are supposed to receive a second,
supplemental feeding in the evening, and the employee who does supplemental feedings confirmed this dog is not on the
list to receive additional food. Recent weight logs from the facility show that this dog has remained at around 40 lbs for the
past few months, but this dog has lost a large amount of muscle mass since the previous inspection.
Dogs who are severely underweight may suffer from hunger, stress, discomfort resting on hard surfaces, difficulty
maintaining body temperature, and poor absorption of vitamins. Dogs who are losing weight or losing muscle mass may
have serious underlying health conditions such as parasites or cancer, which can cause the animal to experience
discomfort or disfunction of body systems.

Correct by providing adequate veterinary care to ensure proper nutrition, body weight, and body condition for all dogs,
including the timely identification of dogs losing body weight, prompt communication with the AV, and follow-up with the
attending veterinarian when dogs do not improve after treatments or interventions.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
A 10-year-old male German Short Hair Pointer dog (“Rugby” microchip # 885122003819948) was in a dog fight on
10/24/2022, which caused a wound on the left side of the lower back/kidney area. According to a facility employee, the
fight occurred when the dog was placed in an exercise yard with another dog. “Rugby” received prompt medical attention


including sutures, placement of a drain in the wound, and antibiotic therapy. A second procedure was performed on
11/02/22 to clean up the wound and a second course of antibiotics was prescribed. At the time of the inspection, an
approximately 4-inch long by 0.75 inch wide pink and brown hairless area was visible where the wound had been.
Dogs who are physically harmed by other dogs experience pain and distress, and may become infected. Injuries inflected
by one animal upon another may cause pain, stress, debility, or death.
The facility must ensure that dogs handled in a manner that does not result in physical harm, and that dogs in the same
pen or enclosure are compatible with one another. Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(ix) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Many outdoor areas of sheltered (indoor/outdoor) kennels have concrete floors that are cracked. In Building One, on the
side of the building closest to the road, every outdoor run had a cracked floor of various widths. Two of these cracks were
also associated with chipping of the concrete such that the underlying non-sealed rock aggregate was exposed. In
Building 3, on the right side, every outdoor run had a cracked floor. Due to a reported unavailability of materials which has
resolved, repairs have been made to 11 affected kennels with continue repairs in progress and planned. Cracks in the
floor and unsealed areas resulting from them may harbor organic material, parasites or germs that can be harmful to the
dogs, and can be difficult to clean and sanitize. Correct by maintaining surfaces, including floors, that can be properly
cleaned and sanitized.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the kennel manager and a consultant affiliated with the registrant.
