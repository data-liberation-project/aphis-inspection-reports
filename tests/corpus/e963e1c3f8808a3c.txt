ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1030 on
02-Feb-17.
Upon arrival I made contact with the licensee's brother. He stated that the licensee was not home and would not
return until later in the day.
