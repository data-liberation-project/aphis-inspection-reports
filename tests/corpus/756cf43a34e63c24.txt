SANITATION.
There are several piles of building materials and discarded items such as a tarp and an empty bleach bottle close to
the hippo and camel exhibits . These piles may serve as a habitat for pests such as snakes and rats which may
harm the animals. Accumulations of trash must be properly discarded and building materials stored well away from
animal exhibits to prevent a pest problem and provide for proper husbandry. CORRECT BY : 8-20-17
