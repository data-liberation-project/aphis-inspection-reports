WATERING.
In the pen housing the three fallow deer, one calf, one pig, five goats, nine sheep, and two llamas, there is a single
blue plastic tub that is used as the only source of water in the pen. Upon inspection, it was found that this tub was
devoid of water and instead had a mixture of ice and wet hay in the bottom of the tub. The sides of the inside of the
tub had a green-black coating, consistent with dried algae. Once notified of the condition of the tub by the APHIS
official, the licensee immediately cleaned the tub and filled it with fresh water.
In the pen housing the two patagonian cavys, there is a orange plastic bucket used as the sole source of water in
the pen. However, upon inspection, there is approximately one inch of solid ice on top of the water within the
bucket. A cavy was observed trying to drink from the bucket but was unable to do so. When this was observed by
the APHIS official and licensee, the licensee immediately removed the ice covering the water.
Water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals and all water receptacles
are to kept clean and sanitary. Failure to do so can have a negative impact on animal health, such as dehydration
or potential contamination of the water being consumed. Correct by ensuring that water receptacles are kept clean
and water is provided as often as needed. Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
