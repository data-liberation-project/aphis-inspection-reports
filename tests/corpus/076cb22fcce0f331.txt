2.38(f)(1) REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
On August 9, 2014 a non-human primate (NHP) was injured while being restrained for treatment of a clinical
condition. The NHP, a six year old male macaque, was left on a restraint board in a treatment room during
intravenous fluid administration. At some point during treatment the animal chewed through tape restraining his
upper body to the board leaving his legs taped to the board. The animal's partially restrained condition was noticed
on a video monitor and he was captured by veterinary staff. The animal was found to have a broken leg, was
treated, and recovered from the fracture. Facility staff stated that restrained NHPs are supposed to have their
restraints checked every 15 minutes, however staff are not required to document restraint checks. In this case a
treatment document showed that the animal was restrained at approximately 10:30 hours, checked at 12:45 hours,
and was found partially restrained at 2:30 hours. It is unclear if, or when, the restraints were checked between 12:45
and 2:30 hours.

Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar
problems from occurring in the future.
Previously to have been corrected immediately.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
