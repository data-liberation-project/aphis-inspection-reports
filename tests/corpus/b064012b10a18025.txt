Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Golden retriever (tag #801, ear tattoo #101, microchip #990000005953800) had a surgical procedure performed
on her abdomen, but the inspector is unable to determine if the procedure is compliant with the requirements to provide
the animal with adequate veterinary care.

The dog was sold by the licensee through an auction on August 20th. The individual who purchased the animal
transported it to a licensed veterinarian the next morning after noticing the dog had an incision in its abdomen that was
reddened and inflamed. Two licensed veterinarians examined the dog and found it to have an abdominal incision that
was 5 to 8 days old which was sutured with fishing line. Both veterinarians concluded that due to the appearance of the
incision along with the inappropriate suturing material, that this procedure had not been performed by a licensed
veterinarian and appeared to be done by someone who had no skill in surgery. The veterinarians also diagnosed the dog
with pyometra resulting in the animal being spayed.

The inspector spoke with an individual who attended the auction and was present when this dog was sold. The individual
said that during the sale of this dog a question was asked about the dog having a c-section scar on her abdomen and the
licensee responded that the dog was bred and stated, "We removed her uterus, implanted it, and put it back in". When

the inspector asked the licensee about this statement, he said it was a lie.

The inspector requested medical records and information from the licensee's kennel manager concerning this dog, but the
manager had no records for this animal. The licensee also told the inspector numerous different stories pertaining to this
dog, which were often contradictory such as the dog had a c-section in June, then decided he didn’t know when the dog
had last whelped, then said the dog had a c-section around July 18th, but then stated at the auction that the dog was
bred. The licensee also told the inspector many times that he didn’t know who performed the surgical procedure on the
animal, but then said the attending veterinarian had done a c-section. The inspector contacted the licensee's attending
veterinarian requesting any medical records and information in regard to this dog, but the inspector received no reply.

The failure to provide accurate information has interfered in the ability of the inspector to determine exactly when the
medical procedure was performed, if the procedure was performed by a qualified individual and if the procedure and
materials used were appropriate in regard to providing adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure that all medical procedures are performed by qualified personnel and all methods and materials used are
appropriate to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

A vial of rabies vaccine was found in a cabinet in the sheltered housing building. The label on the rabies vaccines states
that it should be stored at 35-46 degrees F. The temperature in the sheltered housing building is 72 degree F according
to the inspectors Kestrel. Failure to store vaccines at the required temperatures may interfere with their effectiveness,
which could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.


Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must store the rabies vaccine and all other medical products at the required temperatures in order to support the health
and well-being of the dogs.

The following medical products are located in the sheltered housing building or Whelping building, but they are not
documented on the Program of Veterinary Care and there are no instructions from the attending veterinarian concerning
their use in dogs:

o Spectrogard for use in pigs
o Lamb & Kid colostrum powder
o Equispaz paste for use in horses
o Oxytocin for use in horses, sows, cows and ewes
o A clear plastic bottle which has no label containing a dark colored liquid thought to be iodine

The facility representative is not sure if these products are supposed to be used for the dogs or not. The off-label use of
medical products could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs if not first approved by the
attending veterinarian and used per the attending veterinarian’s directions.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure the above mentioned products are approved for use by the attending veterinarian along with instructions for
their use in dogs in order to protect the dogs' health and well-being.


The facility has been using Ivomec-pour on to treat sixteen puppies for external parasites. The Ivomec-pour on expired in
April 2020. Expired products may lose their effectiveness which could have a negative impact on the health and well-
being of the dogs.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure the Ivomec-pour and all other products used for the dogs is current and not expired in order to support the
health and well-being of the dogs.

On July 29, 2021, the licensee gave ownership of approximately 340 dogs located at an unlicensed facility to a USDA
licensed broker. The licensee has never provided the inspectors with disposition forms for these dogs.


Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required information
concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under
his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of. The licensee must provide the
required acquisition information for the 27 above mentioned dogs on APHIS form 7005. The licensee must complete
APHIS form 7006 for the 340 dogs. The licensee must ensure all required paperwork is created, maintained, and
accurate at all times.
2.75(a)(1)(vi) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee uses a tag number or ear tattoo number as the official form of identification on APHIS form 7005. The
licensee sold four hundred and eighty-eight dogs through an auction, as well as five dogs to a private individual, but
documented a microchip as the official form of identification on APHIS form 7006 rather than the tag or ear tattoo number.
None of these microchip numbers have been added to APHIS form 7005, therefore, the inspector is unable to determine if
these dogs are actually on any of the licensee's APHIS form 7005s and cannot confirm their acquisition information.

The following puppies were sold by the licensee through an auction, but their acquisition information could not be
presented to the inspectors. The facility representative confirmed that the identification number documented on APHIS
form 7006 is not the same number that is documented on the puppy cage cards or on APHIS form 7005, therefore, the
acquisition information could not be determined.

A total of 11 adult dogs and 21 puppies were sold by the licensee through an auction which had no official form of
identification on APHIS form 7006.

Failure to document the proper identification number on required documents interferes with APHIS officials ability to
identify animals and trace their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records that fully disclose the official identification number of each animal.
The licensee must ensure that the correct official identification number is recorded on all required paperwork for each dog.
2.75(a)(1)(vii)(C) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.

The licensee provided the inspectors with APHIS form 7006 containing the information for all the dogs sold through an
auction. Approximately three-hundred and sixty dogs are missing the age or date of birth on APHIS form 7006. The age
or date of birth is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals.

Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and correctly disclose the age or date of birth. The licensee
must ensure the age or date of birth is documented on all required paperwork including APHIS form 7006.
3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The storage closet in the sheltered housing building contains items used for the dogs. There is a large amount of
unidentifiable dark colored material on the floor beneath the water pipe. The closet also has a large number of spider
webs hanging from the ceiling and walls and attached to the items used for the dogs. Many of the spider webs have
pieces of insulation attached to them.

The dark colored material and spider webs could collect dust, dirt and disease causing agents.

Housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste
material, junk, weeds, and other discarded materials. The licensee must remove the dark colored material and spider
webs from the storage closest in order to reduce the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.
3.1(c)(1)(ii) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
In two enclosures, containing an approximate total of one adult dog and seven puppies, the metal self feeders are
attached to the gates by metal wire. The sharp ends of the metal wire are located at the level of the dogs who could

come into direct contact with them each time the animal consumes food from the feeder. The inspectors observed the
puppies in each enclosure coming into direct contact with the sharp ends of the wires. The sharp points were seen
touching the puppies' faces, necks, bodies and feet.

One outdoor enclosure, containing thirteen puppies, has a broken piece of chain link fencing. The broken piece is located
at the bottom of the fence and the metal is bent inwards at the level of the puppies.

In one shelter, accessed by two adult Corgis, the sharp ends of screws have penetrated through the shelter wall and are
located at the level of the dogs.

One enclosure, containing two adult Boston terriers, have access to a metal strip that has detached from a post and bent
outward creating a sharp point at the level of the dogs.

Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.

Housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must alter the sharp points in a manner
that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all
times.
3.1(f) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The waste from the sheltered building and covered outdoor enclosures runs through a concrete drain in the floor that
disposes of the waste directly outside the building. A large pool of feces, hair, urine and other waste material has

collected on the immediate outside of the building.

Drains and drainage areas that are not properly maintained could result in a buildup of waste that could attract pests,
create odors, soil animals, and increase the risk of disease hazards.

Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must alter all the drains in a manner that
moves the pool of waste away from the exterior of the sheltered building. The licensee must ensure that all drains are
working properly at all times.

One trash can in the sheltered housing building has no lid. Open trash could attract pests such as flies and mice which
could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The licensee must add a tightly fitted lid to the trash can and ensure the lid is in
place at all times.
3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The ambient temperature for the area has fallen below 50 degrees F and the following dogs have no bedding in their
shelters:

o one adult husky

o one adult lab mix and one adult Australian shepherd mix
o three adult poodles
o two adult corgis
o two adult Boston terriers
o two adult Golden retrievers
o six puppies

In addition, two adult huskies have bedding material in their shelter which is wet, dirty, compacted into thick layers and
contains a strong smell of mold.

Failure to provide the dogs with clean, dry bedding material when temperatures are below 50 degrees F does not ensure
the animals can remain comfortable during cold temperatures which could have a negative impact of their health and well-
being.

Shelters in outdoor housing facilities must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 °F.
The licensee must ensure that each shelter contains clean, dry bedding material whenever the temperature is below 50
degrees F.

To be corrected by: From this day forward
3.4(c) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.

In one outdoor enclosure, containing thirteen puppies, there is a large wooden board running along the base of the chain
link fence to stop the dogs from digging into the adjacent enclosure. The board is not impervious to moisture and the
puppies have direct contact with it. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized which can increase the risk of disease towards the animals.

Building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture. The licensee must
ensure that building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor facilities are impervious to moisture. The licensee must
ensure that the wooden board and any other surfaces in contact with the puppies are impervious to moisture in order to
allow proper cleaning and sanitizing to occur.
3.9(b) Repeat

Feeding
Three adult dogs have an excessive amount of wood shavings mixed into their food. The dogs cannot consume the food
without potentially consuming the wood shavings.

Six adult dogs have an excessive amount of wood shavings covering their food. A thick layer of shavings are piled on top
of the feed and the dog's cannot consume the food without first penetrating the layer of shavings.

Contaminated food may interfere with a dog's desire to eat and its ability to receive adequate nutrition which could result
in poor body condition, illness, and other serious health issues.

Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination. Measures must be taken to prevent molding, caking

and deterioration of the feed. The licensee must remove all contaminates from the feeders and ensure the dogs are
provided with clean and uncontaminated food at all times.
3.11(d) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Within the sheltered housing building there are two storage cabinets and one storage closet which have a heavy
accumulation of rodent feces. No forms of pest control for rodents were observed inside the sheltered building. Failure to
control pests such as rodents could cause contamination of food sources, as well as raise the risk of disease hazards.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective plan to control the mice and the
licensee must ensure that all pest control programs are effective at all times.
3.12 Repeat

Employees
APHIS officials identified sixteen NCIs during the inspection. The facility currently has approximately 3 staff members
including the licensee to provide care for over 262 dogs. The facility does not have enough employees to maintain
compliance. Failure to have a sufficient number of employees to maintain the facility in compliance with the Animal
Welfare Act could have a serious impact on the health and well-being of the animals.

Each person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations maintaining dogs must have enough employees to carry out the
level of husbandry practices and care required. The licensee must ensure he has a sufficient number of employees to
maintain the facility and dogs in a state of compliance at all times.
3.13(a)(2)


Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility's Program of Veterinary Care states that the puppies will be examined by the attending veterinarian on a bi-
monthly schedule. The facility representative confirmed that the puppies are not being examined by the attending
veterinarian on a bi-monthly basis. Failure to have the puppies examined according to the frequency documented in the
Program of Veterinary Care could delay the identification and treatment of serious medical concerns.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care that is developed, documented in writing, and signed
by the attending veterinarian and includes a complete head to tail exam of each dog by the attending veterinarian. The
licensee must ensure that each puppy is examined by the attending veterinarian at the frequency documented in the
Program of Veterinary Care in order to support the animals' health and well-being.

To be corrected by: From this day forward
3.13(a)(3) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. The section for parasites states:

Ectoparasites: 10% weekly- Frontline spray
Bloodparasites: 10% every other monthly
Intestinal parasites: 10% every other monthly (fen/benmetro and Toltazurl)

The facility representative was not sure what the statement for ectoparasites is supposed to mean and he has not been
using Frontline spray. The facility representative did not know what the blood parasite and intestinal parasite statements

are supposed to mean.

The sections for blood parasites does not define the plan for sampling and treatment. The section for intestinal parasites
does not define the plan for sampling and the plan for treatment of adult dogs and puppies.

An incomplete Program of Veterinary Care does not ensure that prevention and treatment of parasites is conducted
appropriately which could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian that includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas,
worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm). The licensee must define in writing a complete plan for sampling and treatment
of ectoparasites, blood parasites and intestinal parasites.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility was unable to present any medical records for the following animals:

Female Golden retriever (tag #801, ear tattoo #101, microchip #990000005953800) underwent a surgical procedure
before she was sold. The facility was not able to present the inspectors with any medical records concerning this dog.

Three Bichon puppies (DOB 07/22/2021) have no medical records documenting the vaccinations and deworming they
have received.


Six puppies (tag # 526, 533, 548, 501, 890, and 983) have no medical records documenting the vaccinations and
deworming they have received.

Samoyed puppy (Dam #14) has no medical records documenting the vaccinations and deworming it has received.

Eight puppies (tag #538, 539, 545, 506, 544, 556, 469, and 551) have no medical records documenting the vaccinations
and deworming they have received.

Four Pomsky puppies (tag #261, 462, 620, and 559) have no medical records documenting the vaccinations and
deworming they have received.

Failure to create and maintain medical records interferes in the ability of APHIS officials to determine if the animals are
receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must keep copies of medical records containing the required information and make the records available for
APHIS inspection. The licensee must ensure that complete medical records are created and maintained for all
procedures, treatments and administration of medical products for each dog.

To be corrected by: From this day forward
3.13(b)(1) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.

The licensee uses cage cards to document when and what type of vaccinations and deworming the puppies receive while
at the facility. The licensee sold approximately eight-three puppies between the age of 8 weeks and 16 weeks through an
auction. The inspectors received APHIS form 7006 which listed each of these puppies along with an official identification
number. The inspectors requested the cage cards for these puppies in order to review the vaccinations and deworming
that had been administered to the puppies, but the facility representative confirmed that the identification numbers on the
cage cards and APHIS form 7006 do not match, therefore, the inspectors were unable to verify if the puppies had ever
received any vaccinations and deworming.

Medical records and other documents which lack proper animal identification interferes in the ability of APHIS officials to
determine if an animal has received adequate veterinary care including treatments or preventatives for serious and
potentially deadly diseases and parasites.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. These
records must include the identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s
breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all documents, including cage cards and APHIS form 7006, contain
the proper identification number in order to allow APHIS officials to determine which animal the paperwork belongs to.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee was treating 16 golden retriever puppies for fleas with Ivomec pour-on. The facility representative stated that
he mixes the Ivomec pour-on with rubbing alcohol and does not have an exact dosage for applying it to the animals. The
facility representative presented written instructions for the Ivomec pour-on that has been approved by the Attending
Veterinarian, but the instructions do not include a dosage or the approval for the product to be mixed with rubbing alcohol.

An incomplete treatment plan does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. Should a
problem be identified, these records must include the date and a description of the problem, examination findings, test
results, the plan for treatment and care as well as any treatment procedures performed. The licensee must ensure the
plan to use the Ivomec pour-on is complete with all necessary details and the licensee. The licensee must ensure that all
treatment plans are fully and completely documented at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
