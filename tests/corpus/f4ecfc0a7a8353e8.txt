3.11(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The food receptacles have been sanitized once since the last inspection in May. Several of the feeders were
dirty with one having caked wet food that was turning moldy. There is a layer of grime underneath the lip many of
the feeders. These feeders should be sanitized at least once every two weeks to prevent this accumulation of dirt
and debris. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee at the end of the inspection.
