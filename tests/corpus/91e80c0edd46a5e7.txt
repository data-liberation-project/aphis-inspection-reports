2.1(b)(2)(i) Repeat

Requirements and application
The maximum number of animals authorized for the licensee's USDA license is 100, but they currently have 198 dogs.

The USDA license authorizes a specific number of animals to ensure the facility is capable of providing care for that
number of animals.

A licensee must obtain a new license before any change resulting in more than the authorized number of animals on hand
at any single point in time during the period of licensure. The licensee must maintain no more than the maximum number
of animals that their USDA license allows.
2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee documents the acquisition information for puppies born at the facility on a cage card. A litter of
Bernadoodle/Poodle puppies born on 3-June-2022 to Bernerdoodle dam #2980219 had an inaccurate number of puppies
on the cage card. When the inspectors asked about the number of puppies, the licensee looked for the 2 missing puppies
and assumes he may have miscounted the litter by 2 female puppies. The licensee also states the dam may have eaten
the puppies if they died in the enclosure but insists he miscounted the number of puppies. Acquisition records of animals

born at the premises must be accurate and kept up to date to ensure proper identification and allow APHIS officials to
track the animal's movement.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the acquisition information
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or
her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include
any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must accurately
count all puppies when assigning the official identification numbers to each dog on cage cards and keep them updated
when each dog is transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of.
3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Several maintenance issues were identified throughout the outdoor housing facility that pose an injury risk to the dogs.

There are 4 outdoor enclosures containing a total of 13 adult dogs that had numerous sharp points present on the
fencing. Two of those enclosures had sharp points present from the small gauge wire that is used to attach the fencing to
posts. The wire was twisted and had exposed sharp points present at the dogs level. The licensee did repair these sharp
points at the time of inspection. The other two enclosures has several sharp points present from the livestock fence
panels that are broken. Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.

One enclosure containing 4 adult dogs has an electric wire is running along the base and an insulator (plastic piece used
to hold the electric fence in place) has been chewed on by the dogs. This poses a risk of electrocution which can cause
physical harm, pain or discomfort to the dog.


In an outdoor enclosure containing 4 adult dogs, the fencing around the dog shelter has become loose and created a gap.
The gap is large enough for a dog's head or leg to fit in and potentially cause injury to the dogs. The licensee fixed the
gap at the time of inspection.

Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in
good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. The licensee must remove the sharp points and ensure the
dogs do not chew on the electric wire insulators in order to protect the dogs from injury. The licensee must maintain all
enclosures in good repair and ensure that the housing conditions are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.1(e) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
In the food storage room, there are two pallets of dog food and one pallet of wood shaving bedding being stored against
the walls of the room. There is approximately one handful of dog kibble present on the floor between the wall and one
pallet of food. There is also cobwebs present in the same space as the spilled dog kibble.
Food and bedding stored against walls does not allow for cleaning around the pallets of supplies. Spilled food that has not
been cleaned up may attract vermin to the feed storage room and cause the supplies to become contaminated. The
licensee must store food and bedding away from the walls enough to allow for cleaning around the food and bedding
supplies.
3.8

Exercise for dogs.
The licensee's exercise plan was not available for inspection.


A complete exercise plan that has been approved by the attending veterinarian is important to ensure the dogs are
receiving adequate space and exercise to support their health and well-being.

The licensee must have an appropriate plan in writing, approved by the attending veterinarian, that provides all dogs with
the opportunity to exercise.

To be corrected by: 20-June-2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
