The licensee was called twice on the phone number of record between 4:15 p.m. and 4:25 p.m. Contact was not
made and a message could not be left because the voicemail was full. The licensee was called at her place of
employment at 4:30 p.m. and this inspector was told by a third party that the call would be returned momentarily. At
4:55 p.m. no return call had been received and a second call was made to her place of employment. This inspector
was advised by a third party that the licensee was no longer there. At 5:20 p.m. no contact was made with any
person at the facility. The inspector waited in the area until 6 p.m.
