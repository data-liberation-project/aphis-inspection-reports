RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records are not being kept for offspring born of any animal while in the facility's possession. Specifically, deaths are
not being recorded. Each enclosure needs to be identified and the animals accurately tracked to assure that
disease processes are identified early and to allow productive communication with the attending veterinarian. This
will facilitate timely and appropriate treatment of the animals. Correct: this point forward.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
