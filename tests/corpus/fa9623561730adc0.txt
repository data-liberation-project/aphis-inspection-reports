ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The attending veterinarian has not been given the appropriate authority by the research facility to ensure that
adequate veterinary care is provided to the animals. The attending veterinarian's instructions on animal care to
include the use of deworming medications have not been followed. In addition, instructions on disease prevention
to include biosecurity and the separation of newly acquired animals have not been followed. The attending
veterinarian also advised the facility to have three animal care staff to facilitate appropriate care. Finally, the
attending veterinarian has not recently visited the facility in order to oversee the adequacy of all other aspects of
animal care and use. Without appropriate authority for the attending veterinarian, animal care and disease
prevention is compromised leading to significant animal health issues and undue pain and suffering.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The attending veterinarian is not a voting member of the IACUC. And although the IACUC has a veterinarian on the
committee, he is not affiliated with the research facility. The attending veterinarian's function on the committee is to
provide expertise in the care and use of the animals. The input of the attending veterinarian is critical to prevent
inappropriate procedures and to ensure that any pain, distress or discomfort to the animals is avoided or minimized.

2.33(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Based on the numerous medical ailments and severe health issues observed in the goats on this inspection, the
research facility does not have an adequate number of staff to provide care for the animals. In addition, based onthe extremely poor state of sanitation of the goat/sheep barn and the repairs needed for barn and the outdoor
shelters in the pasture, the research facility does not have adequate staffing for cleaning and maintenance. The
facility also lacks bedding for the animals and the appropriate equipment to remove the manure of 46 animals.
Although the facility has a power washer, someone had come and taken it to use at a facility elsewhere when the
staff wanted to used it to clean the restraint and bleeding area. Equipment for cleaning and disinfection must be
available at all times. Finally, the facility lacks a separate enclosure to house ill animals to facilitate their care and
prevent the spread of disease.
Lack of adequate staffing, equipment, and facilities has adversely affected the care and well-being of the animals,
prevented proper biosecurity, and has led to severe discomfort and pain and suffering in these animals.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
**Non-Direct NCI** Expired medications were found in the refrigerator during the inspection. These included a
bottle of Panacur (expiration 11-2015) and a bottle of Cydectin (expiration 3-2015).
Expired medications should not be used in the treatment of regulated animals as they may have lost potency or do
not function as intended. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the methods utilized in the prevention
and treatment of diseases or injuries are in accordance with established standard veterinary practices.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
**Non-Direct NCI** The research facility must perform daily observations of all animals to assess their health and
well-being. According to the USDA inspection conducted on 9/10/14, the animal inventory indicated the facility had
60 goats and 5 sheep. For the USDA inspection on 11/20/14, the animal inventory showed the facility had 43 goats
and 5 sheep. Based on the facility records for 02/13/15, they had 46 goats and 5 sheep. On today's inspection,
they had 42 goats and 4 sheep. The facility cannot account for the animals that are missing nor explain the
discrepancy in the number of animals.
The facility must perform daily observations which includes keeping track of the animals and what happens to them,
and have the documentation available for review by APHIS officials. In addition, a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior,and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**The goat/sheep barn is a very large structure divided into several different areas: sleeping, hay feeding, and grain
feeding areas. The barn had a large sliding door on the south side that is now missing. There are also broken and
missing boards, and boards with holes along the sides of the structure. This has allowed rain and wind to enter the
facility contributing to the extremely wet conditions within the barn. In addition, the concrete walkway on the north
side of barn slopes sharply towards the structure, so that as it rains the water runs down the walkway directly into
the hay feeding area for the animals. The adjacent barn north of the goat/sheep barn functions as a fence for the
walkway, and it has broken and damaged boards. There is also a support pole in the sleeping area of the barn that
has a metal wrap around at the base that is rusted.
**The roof of the goat/sheep barn is composed of metal panels. The panels on the eastern side of the roof are
rusted away allowing precipitation to fall inside of the barn below, thus soaking the feeding and sleeping areas for
the animals.
Poor maintenance of the goat/sheep barn has resulted in extremely wet conditions inside the structure. This has
contributed to the numerous and severe health issues seen in the goats, and resulted in pain and discomfort for
these animals.
**The outdoor shelters have boards that have fallen from the structures and are lying on the ground. There is also a
broken picnic table next to one of the shelters that is now just loose boards with nails. The boards contain nails that
are protruding upward, are easily accessed by the animals, and can cause injury.
**There are missing and damaged tiles on the roofs of the outdoor shelters. This compromises the ability of the
structure to provide adequate shelter and shade.
**Areas of wire fencing in the pasture are loose and have fallen down. This compromises the strength of the
fencing and animals could become entangled in the wire.
**The ladder that leads to the hay storage on the top of the barn is missing a rung. This compromises the ability of
both employees and APHIS officials to safely access the hay storage area.

SEPARATION.
One of the goats (animal #28) is particularly combative with the other animals and was reported by staff to have
caused numerous injuries in the other goats. Personnel described the goat as ramming the other animals and lifting
them into the air. In addition, this goat has horns while others do not, allowing for more injuries. Animals shall not
be housed with other animals if they are not compatible, as they can cause injury, interfere with feeding or cause
them discomfort. Any animals that are not compatible must not be housed in the same enclosure.
