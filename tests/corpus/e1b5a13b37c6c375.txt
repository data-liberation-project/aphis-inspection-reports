ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 10 year old white male Pomerian named Comet, microchip # 956000008729509, was observed shaking his head,
and dark brown material was seen staining the area beneath his left ear. Upon closer examination, the internal part
of the dog’s left ear contained a large amount of dark brown, crusty material that extended approximately 1.5 inches
towards the jaw line. Thick, sticky, yellowish opaque liquid could be seen within the crust inside the ear canal. The
skin within the ear was red, appearing irritated and inflamed. In the right ear, a moderate amount of crusty dark
brown material could also be seen inside the canal and staining the area around the ear. The condition affecting the
ears was not observed by the licensee, therefore the attending veterinarian was not consulted for treatment.
Thick buildup of material in the ears may be indicative of infection and/or other veterinary medical conditions that
can cause pain, discomfort, as well as damage to the ear. The licensee is responsible for developing appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
The licensee must have Comet evaluated by a veterinarian to obtain a diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. To
be corrected by: October 4, 2019.
