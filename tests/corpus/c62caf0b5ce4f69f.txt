PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On the bottom edge of the lemur cage, the chain link fence ended in twists or barbed ends with exposed sharp
points on the edge of the enclosure, but within reach of the hands of the animals.
Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points
or edges that could injure the nonhuman primates and protect the nonhuman primates from injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Animals covered under the animal welfare act must be kept in enclosures that are structurally sound, in good repair
and prevent injury to the animals.
In multiple enclosures, there were exposed sharp points on the edges of wire mesh.
*In the upper kinkajou enclosure (Mr. Magoo), additional wire mesh had been added to the walls of the enclosure
and had been left with sharp points in the upper corner of the enclosure behind the half barrel.
*In the possum enclosure, the lower door that opens for cleaning has a section of wire with sharp points that extendinto the doorway, and rest on the inside of the door.
*In the sloth enclosure, the wire mesh has been cut and bent, creating sharp points. The area where the mesh has
been cut has a layer of plexiglass that covers the hole, but the sharp points of wire are extending into the enclosure.
*In the lower 2 kinkajou enclosure, there are additional sharp points of wire mesh that protruded into the enclosure,
where an area had been cut near the junction between the roofline and the walls.
*In the Binturong enclosure, the dirt did not meet the fencing on the floor of the enclosure, creating a space where
digits can be caught under the wire floor.
*In the porcupine enclosure, the feeding station was damaged and unstable.
A system of maintenance must be in place to ensure that the enclosures are structurally sound and prevent injury to
the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The western section of the perimeter fence line along mission road was less than 5 feet in height, adjacent to the
corrals.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that
it can act as a secondary containment for animals in the facility. A system of maintenance must be in place to
ensure that the perimeter fence surrounding covered animals is in good repair and meets the minimum height of 6
ft.
