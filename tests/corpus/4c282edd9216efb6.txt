2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A licensee transported by car two 2-week-old lynx cubs from Minnesota to Oregon. They were reportedly
transported in crates with blankets and a heating pad, and they were fed every three hours for the duration. The
cubs were bright and alert and moving around normally at the time of inspection.
It has been determined that transporting neonatal (<4 weeks old) nondomestic cats is not consistent with safe
handling and protecting them from harm. The rigors of travel can cause behavioral stress and discomfort. In
addition, neonatal animals are not considered to have competent immune systems until they have had a series of
vaccinations. They were potentially exposed to pathogens from other animals and people along the way.
Correct by no longer transporting neonatal animals from this point on.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a licensee, an IES investigator, and an Oregon Department of
Fish and Wildlife representative.
