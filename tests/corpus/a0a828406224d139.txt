2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In the guinea pig breeding room, there is a guinea pig with a yellow swelling along its right eye, where the skin around the
eye was thickened, and a swelling with hair loss along the top R side of the head over this eye. The animal otherwise
appeared to be in good health. In the holding room, there is a black and white Teddy Bear hamster and degu who both
have medical issues. The hamster has an inflamed, swollen genital area with yellow discharge from the penile opening,
and walks around slowly. The degu has an overgrown left incisor that is curling out of his mouth upwards in a mustache
fashion, where it otherwise appears to be in good health. In the last sugar glider breeding building, there is a ground
squirrel with hair loss and inflammation along the front of its upper chest and the inside of its thighs, where it otherwise
appears to be in good health. In the hedgehog breeding room, there is a hedgehog with red, inflamed skin along its face,
chest, abdomen, and ears, where the ears are swollen and thickened with yellow crusts. It appears to otherwise be in
good health. None of the animals have been seen by the Attending Veterinarian (AV), nor has the AV been notified.
Observations have been conducted daily, where the issues were not noticed for these animals. Daily observations serve
as a key function in assessing the health and well-being of the animals. As such, when conditions go unnoticed, it
contributes to worsening of said condition and further discomfort and stress for that animal. The facility must establish and
maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include daily observations of all animals to assess their health and


well-being. Furthermore, if daily observations are performed by someone other than the attending veterinarian, a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems
concerning animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
