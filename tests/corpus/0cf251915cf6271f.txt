* Protocol 2015-0024 describes a scoring system and frequency of animal observations during disease progression.
A review of animal records indicated that on May 29, 2017 at 9:30 p.m. two hamsters were assessed with scores of
3 and therefore subsequent observations should occur three times daily according to the approved protocol. The
two hamsters were not observed again until 12:00 p.m. on May 30, 2017 when they were found dead. Scheduled
observations three times daily imply a reasonable expectation of no more than eight hours between observations.
Personnel responsible for observations stated that the observation period was extended unintentionally. This
protocol deviation may have contributed to unrelieved animal distress or suffering.
*Protocol 2015-0024 as approved states that pharmaceutical grade Vancomycin will be used in the study because it
is commercially available. According to lab personnel non-pharmaceutical grade Vancomycin has been used on all
hamsters receiving this antibiotic since October 2016. To ensure consistency and effectiveness non-
pharmaceutical-grade substances should only be used in regulated animals when commercial products are
available after specific review and approval by the IACUC. Deviations to approved protocols must be reviewed and
approved prior to implementation.
Correct by: All future significant changes to protocols must be approved prior to implementation.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Six hamsters have been used in a Clindamycin study under protocol 2015-0024. Although the use of Clindamycin is
described and approved in this protocol the current study comparing pharmaceutical grade and non-pharmaceutical
grade Clindamycin use in six animals is not described in the protocol or any approved amendments.
A complete description of the proposed use of animals must be contained in protocols or significant changes so that
the IACUC may conduct reviews of those components of the activities related to the care and use of animals prior to
approval and determine that the activities are in compliance with the regulations and standards under the Animal
Welfare Act.Correct by: All future approved protocols must contain a complete description of animal use.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility staff/IACUC members.
