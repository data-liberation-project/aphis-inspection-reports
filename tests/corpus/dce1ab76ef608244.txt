FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The shelter for the two pigs in the outside enclosure needs to be replaced. It consists of scraps of plywood and a
tarp for a roof. Lack of adequate shelter can lead to injury or illness during weather extremes. A more structurally
sound shelter that provides adequate protection from sunlight and inclement weather needs to be provided.
