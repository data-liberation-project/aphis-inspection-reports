ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** The Program of Veterinary Care was out of date at the time of the inspection. The last time the attending
veterinarian had visited the facility and signed the APHIS form 7002 was on 3-27-14. The licensee must ensure that
the attending veterinarian visits and signs off on the PVC annually. This form must be fully completed and signed
by the current attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by: 4-28-15.
