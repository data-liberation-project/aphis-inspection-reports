SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
There is a orange tiger approximately 5 months of age that is in a 4ft x 8ft enclosure that is not high enough for the
tiger to assume the natural position of being able to stand to its full height. During the inspection the tiger tried to
stand up fully at the front door of the enclosure, and bumped the top of his head on the roof. There was a thump
sound, while the tiger returned his head back between his shoulders while he remained standing. The tiger is able
to walk and lie down comfortably, however the height of the enclosure needs to be higher to accommodate the
ability for the tiger to stand and stretch to its full height, assuming a natural postural movement.
The inability of an animal to assume their full postural movements can be a source of stress and discomfort for the
regulated animal.
The primary enclosure at the home facility must provide enough room for the tiger to be able to stand up and stretch
to his full height, without bumping its head. As the animals get larger, the primary enclosures need to be large
enough for the regulated animals to assume all natural postural movements.
