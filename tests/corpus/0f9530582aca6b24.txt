2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection there is a female mule deer with an oblong swelling on the inside of the left hindlimb just below
the hock measuring ~3.5” long by ~3” wide by ~2” deep. The deer did not bear full weight on that limb, frequently
touching only the front of that hoof on the ground. The deer also had an ~0.5” circular area about an inch under the left
eye that is pink and appears wet. The facility representative stated that the animal had injured itself when frightened and
trying to escape the pen during the evening of the 4th of July fireworks. The representative noted the swelling the week
prior but said that he was now seeing that it had become larger since he first noted it. The veterinarian was not contacted
before the inspection, but the facility representative immediately called the veterinarian to arrange an evaluation of the
deer.
Failure to report health issues when detected can result in a delay in appropriate care and potentially worsening
illness/injury or even death.
This animal needs to be evaluated by the veterinarian at the earliest opportunity, and the licensee must establish and
maintain a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
