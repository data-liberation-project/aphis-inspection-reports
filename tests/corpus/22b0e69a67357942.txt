Personnel qualifications.
On June 29, 2020 a 1-year old female pig-tailed macaque removed a feeder that was not locked by husbandry staff and
exited through the 3.5 x 5.75 inch feeder opening. The primate climbed onto another enclosure where a male pig-tailed
macaque pulled her left arm through the 1 x 1 inch mesh enclosure. The husbandry staff were able to separate the 2
animals and called veterinary staff immediately. The female primate sustained multiple injuries and had to have her left
arm amputated.

In order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, personnel should ensure all locks are in place and secure to
maintain the animals in their enclosure. It is the responsibility of the research facility to provide continued training and
instruction to all personnel with sufficient frequency to fulfill the research facility’s responsibilities.

Corrections were instituted prior to the inspection on December 1, 2020 in order to prevent recurrence.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
