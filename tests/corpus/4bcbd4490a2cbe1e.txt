"Simba" has an accumulation of hard dental tarter on his canines, premolars, & molar teeth. His gums were dark
pink to red, inflamed, and are receded in some areas.
Dental tarter causes inflammation of the gums leading to: difficulty in eating, bleeding gums, loosening of the teeth,
irritation, pain, and may also affect the liver & kidneys of animals if left untreated.
Have your veterinarian examine this dog and treat accordingly.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Photos that was posted on a website (that was not the licensees') showed a person who was identified by the
licensee as a landscaper/volunteer. The photo showed that this individual had his hands on the chain link fence
enclosure with a tiger on the other side. The tiger can easily & quickly put his/her claws through the chain link fence
and injure this this person who is not fully knowledgeable in the care, training, &/or behaviors of these dangerous
animals. Alternatively, this person could also put something through the chain link and potentially injure this cat.
Other pictures posted on this website also showed other people (identities unknown) in similar activities with tigers
as well as other species of big cats
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public. This type of activity does not assure the safety of the public nor the animals.

Several rusty roof nails were extending through the roof in the 3 raccoon enclosure. The raccoons do climb up and
rest at the level of some of these nails and can be injured by these sharp points which are in close proximity to
where they were observed resting.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a large gap underneath the perimeter fence door and adjacent area of Katrina's (tiger) holding area, which
was created by water runoff. This gap was sufficiently wide & deep enough to allow small animals under this fence.
Additionally, this area's perimeter fence was only approx. 7 feet high.
A portion of the bear's perimeter fence was also not secured to a vertical post along the back right side of the
enclosure.
The fence must be constructed and maintained so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals
and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so
that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence must
also be at least 8 feet high in all areas for dangerous animals.
