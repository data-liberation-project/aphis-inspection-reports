Time and method of identification.
One dog (Josie, #104, DOB 5/30/2020) did not have official identification on her at the time of inspection, although her tag
had been made and was on hand and ready for placement on a collar. Lack of identification on dogs can make tracking
of animals for health or breeding more difficult. Adult dogs (over 16 weeks old) must have identification affixed to them by
means of a collar made of material generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a means of identifying their pet
dogs.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
