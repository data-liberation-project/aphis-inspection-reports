MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
Records indicate that on 1-08-2015 five puppies less than 8 weeks old were sold to a pet store. Records also
indicate that on 2-19-2015 six puppies less than 8 weeks old were sold to a pet store. All the puppies were 55 days
old instead of the required minimum of 56 days old. Transporting puppies under 8 weeks of age may increase their
risks of health problems. Puppies from a USDA licensed facility must be at least 8 weeks old and weaned prior to
being sold or transported in commerce. Correct from this day forward.
