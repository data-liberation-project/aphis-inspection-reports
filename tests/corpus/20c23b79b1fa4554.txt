INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semiannual report sent to the IO in December 2015 was not signed by a majority of the IACUC members, as is
required by the regulation. In the semiannual report, Minor/Significant deficiencies were not distinguished and a
reasonable and specific plan with dates for correcting the deficiencies was not documented.
There is no documentation provided to verify reports sent to the Institutional Officer (IO), including IACUC
semi-annual program and facility inspections, for December 2015 have been reviewed and approved by a majority
of the IACUC. A system should be in place to ensure the required reports are reviewed and signed by a majority of
the IACUC members. The semiannual report shall identify all deficiencies found, designate them as minor or
significant, and that contains a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
The IO is fully responsible for compliance with the AWA by the research facility and to ensure that any deficiencies
noted can be addressed in a timely manner.
Correction date 15 April, 2016.
Exit Interview conducted with facility personnel by Dr.'s Alexandra Andricos, Michael Schnell and Katharine Frank.
