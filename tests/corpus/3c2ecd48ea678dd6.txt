INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC office notified the IACUC chair by a memorandum (dated 6/11/15) of the death of two prairie voles from
dehydration which occurred on June 7th and 8th, 2015. At the time of this inspection, there were no documents
provided to the APHIS official indicating that an investigation has been initiated. It is the IACUC's responsibility to
investigate reports of noncompliance regarding animal care and use received from research facility personnel to
assure animal welfare is addressed at this facility. The IACUC must review, and, if warranted, investigate concerns
involving the care and use of animals at the research facility resulting from complaints or reports. To be corrected
by: July 31, 2015.
2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Although supportive care was provided for one male prairie vole displaying signs of dehydration (sunken eyes, skin
tent) by the graduate student who discovered the animal during a colony check at 2pm on Sunday, June 7, 2015;
the attending veterinarian was not notified until after 6 pm on that same day. This animal (ID#15M7903) was found
dead on Monday, June 8, 2015. There is not a mechanism of direct and frequent communication currently in place
at this research facility to assure that timely and accurate information regarding animal health issues is conveyed to
the attending veterinarian. When daily observation of animals is performed by research staff, the attending
veterinarian must be notified of issues regarding animal health in a timely fashion in order to assure that adequate
and appropriate veterinary care is provided to the animals at the facility at all times. To be corrected by: July 10,
2015.

WATERING.
At 2pm on Sunday, June 7, 2015, during a check of the prairie vole breeding colony, a graduate student found a
dead male vole (ID#15M7902) in one cage. The graduate student also noticed that another live male vole
(ID#15M7903) in the same cage was displaying signs of dehydration (sunken eyes, skin tent) and that the waterbottle spigot was blocked with bedding and fur. Water receptacles must be monitored for proper function to ensure
that all animals in every enclosure have access to water as necessary to maintain health and comfort of the animal.
Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. All water receptacles
shall be kept clean and sanitary. The facility has since established a system to ensure that water consumption is
monitored properly. Corrected at the time of this inspection.
Inspection was conducted on Monday, June 29, 2015 with facility representatives. Exit briefing was conducted on
Monday, July 6, 2015 with facility representatives.
