2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The opossum and raccoon enclosures do not have sufficient distance and / or barriers between the animals and the
general public so as to assure the safety of the public and the animals. Small children are able to put their fingers
into the holes of the fencing and could be bitten by these animals. During this inspection several of the raccoons
approached the fencing where the children were. Although these raccoons do appear tame to previous being pets,
these are exotic / wild animals and are unpredictable.
