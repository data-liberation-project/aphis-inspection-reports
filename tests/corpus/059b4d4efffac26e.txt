3.14(e)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that 4 dogs were too large for the crates that they were being transported
in.
One dog (Sassy) measured to be 37 inches tall x 44 inches long. The crate she was in measured 25 inches tall x 38
inches long.
One dog (Raleigh) measured to be 30 inches tall x 43 inches long. The crate he was in measured 25 inches tall x 38
inches long.
One dog (Lady Mary) measured to be 22 inches tall x 18 inches long. The crate she was in measured 19 inches tall
x 24 inches long.
One dog (Fenway / Jetter) measured to be 31 inches tall x 30 inches long. The crate he was in measured 29 inches
tall x 22 inches long.
It is obvious that these crates were too small to allow for the dogs to be able to stand up, turn around, and make
normal postural movements. More care will need to be taken to ensure that all the dogs / puppies being transported
are in crates that have sufficient space.
3.15(f)
PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
While inspecting this cargo van it was noted that there was a row of medium size crates along the bottom row.
However, the next level of smaller crates had 2 crates, one in front of the other, in 2 different sections of the van.
The doors to the crates in the back were blocked by the crates in front of them. When the owner needed to gain
access to those crates he needed to dislodge the bungie cords and take the other crates down first. This put 4
puppies in danger of not being able to be removed in a timely manner should there have been an emergency.
These 4 crates need to be repositioned so that all doors are easily accessible.
3.17(a)CARE IN TRANSIT.
In speaking with the owner I was informed that they do stop and check on the animals. However, there was no way
to verify that this was happening. Nor could it be verified that they were checking on the animals at least every 4
hours. To ensure that the temperature is within the acceptable range and that the animals are not in any physical
distress a mechanism will need to be in place to ensure that all the animals are observed at least every 4 hours.
This inspection was conducted in a Park and Ride parking lot on RT 395 / exit 89 in Plainfield, CT.
An exit interview was conducted with the registrant.
