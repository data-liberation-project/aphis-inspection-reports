ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Grooming
There are two dogs that are in need of grooming
A female Yorkshire Terrier, microchip #012323992 "Olivia", has matting on her abdomen and back legs that are
bound closely to the skin.
A female Poodle, microchip #0A0233847 "Chanel", has matting on her left hip area that is bound closely to the skin.
Matting of the hair coat can be painful, can lead to the development of skin infections, and reduces the ability of the
coat to insulate the animal. The licensee must remove the matted hair from the above stated dogs. The licensee
must develop an effective program of hair coat maintenance.
