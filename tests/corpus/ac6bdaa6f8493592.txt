FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage.
The facility has begun redoing the substrate in the 2 paddocks serving as the primary enclosures for 10 teaching
horses. However, there is standing water in both paddocks. The standing water in the north paddock was located
near one of the water receptacles and in front of one of the shelters. There was also a large pool of water in the
northwest corner of the north paddock. The south paddock has an eroded area filled with water running through the
center of the paddock. This stream of water was located between the feeding receptacle and the shelter.

Standing water attracts pests, such as flies and mosquitoes, which can affect the comfort and health of the animals.
Standing water located in areas where animals need to walk to utilize the feed and water receptacles and the
shelter areas can also affect the comfort of the animals.
Repair the substrate of the paddock areas that serve as primary enclosures for the teaching horses so that water is
rapidly eliminated. Correct by: 1 November 2015
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with Saint Paul Area Veterinarian, Area Supervisor, Veterinary Technician,
