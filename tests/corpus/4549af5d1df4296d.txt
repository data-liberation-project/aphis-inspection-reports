ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A number of flies were observed hovering around the head of horse used for teaching. Ocular drainage was
observed on the skin below the left eye of the horse. According to a staff member and written instructions on the
stall door, a fly mask was to be placed on the horse daily as part of the treatment of a small open mass on the
eyelid.
Failure to protect open wounds from flies may interfere in the healing process and cause discomfort to animals.
Staff should ensure that treatment plans are followed in accordance with established veterinary medical and nursing
procedures.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
