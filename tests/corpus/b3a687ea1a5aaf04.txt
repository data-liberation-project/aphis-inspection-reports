ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 am on
05-Oct-16.
Arrived at the facility at about 11:00 am. There was no phone service for a 30 mile radius. No one was home so I
waited for 45 minutes and then left the premises.
