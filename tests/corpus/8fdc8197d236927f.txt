3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the building closest to the residence, there was one enclosure housing 2 dogs that had a hole in the wire mesh
flooring approximately 1 inch by 3 inches in size with broken wires protruding into the open space.
Holes of that size with the broken wires could cause injury to the dogs' legs. The licensee must provide floors that
are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' fee and legs from injury, and that , if mesh, do not allow the
dogs' feet to pass through the openings in the floor.

3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the facility there were eight outdoor enclosures housing 25 dog that had not been cleaned or sanitized
since October of 2016. The licensee stated that they put the bedding in the enclosures in October when the
weather gets colder and adds bedding as needed throughout the winter without cleaning or disinfecting during that
time.
The build-up of dirt, feces, bedding and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
enclosures, and food and water bowls daily and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and ACI Bartels.
