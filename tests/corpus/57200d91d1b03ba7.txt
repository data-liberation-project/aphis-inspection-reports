3.3(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
A total of 11 cats are being housed in 2 enclosures (10 in one & 1 in the other). The ambient temperature taken
with a Kestral 3000 at 2:00 PM under overcast skies was 88 degrees F. These enclosures did not have any
additional cooling and temperatures in this area, at this time of the year, frequently exceed 85 degrees for more
than 4 consecutive hours.
The ambient temperature in sheltered housing for cats (and dogs) shall not rise above 85 degrees for more than 4
consecutive hours when cats are present, and shall be sufficiently cooled to protect them from temperature
extremes to provide for their health and well-being.
