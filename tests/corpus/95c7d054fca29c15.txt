Feeding.
The dry pelleted feed being fed to the sheep was expired. Based on the Husbandry and Room Sanitation-Sheep Standard
Operating Protocol and confirmed with one of the animal caretakers, the sheep are fed the pelleted feed twice a day along
with hay. The sheep housing room contains a large plastic feed container (which holds the contents of a bag of feed) from
which the caretakers scoop the daily pelleted feed for the sheep. The label on this feed container states that the Rumilab
5508 feed it held had an expiration date of 8-28-22. Feed that is not in date may no longer be wholesome, may have lost
palatability and may have lost nutritive value. The facility shall ensure that food being fed is in date so it is wholesome,
palatable, free from contamination and of sufficient nutritive value. Corrected during the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, the IACUC chair, the Director of OAWA
and other facility representatives.
