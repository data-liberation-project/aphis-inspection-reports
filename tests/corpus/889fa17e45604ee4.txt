2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
USDA Inspectors requested to see records of the euthanized bear that was seen on the last inspection. The licensee
could not find and provide a copy of the disposition paperwork for the bear. Every dealer other than operators of auction
sales and brokers to whom animals are consigned, and exhibitors shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which
fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise
acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported,
sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. Correct by June 20, 2022.
2.75(b)(1)(iii)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
When looking over the paperwork for the white tiger acquired by the licensee the records were incomplete. The record
did not contain the address of “W-R-R” and no record of the government issued ID together with the paper. When an
individual is not licensed under the Act, as is the case in WRR, the number of the driver’s license must be kept on file with
the acquisition paperwork. The vehicle license number and State, and the driver’s license number (or photographic
identification card for nondrivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered
under the Act. Correct by June 20, 2022.

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On May 31, 2022 as soon as USDA Inspectors came onto the property the licensee stated they were not allowed to the
back where he keeps another tiger and two monkeys under the licensee’s declared rehabilitation facility, licensed by state
FWC. When asked about food storage and preparation, he stated he gets fresh meat everyday for the tiger in the back
(FWC Licensed) and the tiger in the front (USDA licensed). The licensee then led Inspectors to a freezer where he keeps
surplus meat for both sides. It is unclear as to how the licensee maintains separation of business when the surplus food
for both licenses are kept in one freezer. It is also undetermined whether there are separate facilities to clean and
sanitize food receptacles/primary enclosures since inspectors were not permitted in the back. USDA Inspectors shall be
able to inspect and photograph the facilities, property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce
provisions of the Act, the regulations and the standards of this subchapter. Correct immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Facility Representative.
