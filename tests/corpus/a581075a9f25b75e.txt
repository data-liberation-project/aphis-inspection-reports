Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The Lemur enclosure contains an excessive amount of excreta, which is present throughout. There is no area of the floor
of the enclosure that is clean, dry and free of excreta. The water container was knocked over and did not have any clean
water present. The animals could not access their water without walking the contaminated area.

Animals that cannot escape their own waste can develop a range of diseases that are detrimental to their health and can
cause stress and distress in the animals. Additionally, the food and water can be contaminated and become
unwholesome and unpalatable which can lead to malnutrition and additional discomfort and illness.

Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are being cleaned and excreta removed on a routine basis and as often as
necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.

throughout. There is no visibly clean and dry location for the animals to stand and the animal must walk through the
contaminated area in order to access food or water. The floor of each enclosure had excreta smeared over the entire
surface. The animals had areas of their hair coat on their tails and extremities that were covered with the excreta.
