2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At the bat exhibit, there are not adequate barriers in place to prevent the public from having contact with the bats.
Although the bats have not been observed to approach the netting that separates them from the public, they could
do so. Members of the public have been observed sitting and leaning against the netting, and putting fingers
through it.
At the outdoor part of the rabbit exhibit there is nothing the prevent a member of the public from bending over and
touching a rabbit, were one to approach the fence.
The facility must ensure that adequate barriers, or trained personnel, are in place in order to prevent any
unsupervised contact between the animals and the public, so as to ensure the safety of both.
To be corrected via temporary measures to prohibit contact, by 10/21/16, with more permanent solutions to follow.
3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure for Cotton-Top Tamarins there was a heat lamp with an exposed electrical cord. Electrical cords
inside animal enclosures pose a risk of electrocution.
Animal enclosures should be designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner that protects the animals from the
risk of injury.
To be corrected by 10/21/16.
3.80(a)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Surfaces inside the enclosures for non-human primates should be maintained so that they can be readily cleaned
and sanitized, and should be replaced or repaired when worn or soiled.The following problems were observed at the time of inspection:
1.) Squirrel Monkeys - Whereas the primary off-exhibit enclosure for squirrel monkeys has had the surfaces
repaired, the smaller "Holding" enclosure, which is in use, has areas of missing and peeling paint.
2.) Chimpanzees - Paint missing and peeling from metal grating that comprises the walls of the outdoor enclosure,
as well as paint peeling from the metal frames that hold the grating, and frame the doorways in the outside
enclosure. There is also evidence of some rust in these areas.
Non-human primates that are exposed to surfaces that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected due to
deterioration, or that are exposed to debris from peeling paint or decomposing surfaces, could suffer ill effects to
their health and well-being. Surfaces should be maintained in good repair, free of debris, and such that they can be
adequately cleaned and disinfected.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal enclosures should be structurally sound, and maintained in good repair, so as to protect the animals
from harm. The following hazards were observed in animal enclosures:
1.) Inside the off-exhibit bat enclosure there was a dehumidifier with an electrical cord draped across the floor.
Although the electrical cord had been covered in thick hose material, there were still some parts of the cord exposed
at the ends. Electrical wires inside an enclosure present an electrocution risk.
2.) In the Eland off-exhibit enclosure there was chicken-wire around the top of the back wooden shelter area. The
wire had edges sticking out that were sharp and pointed. There were also heavy-duty plastic bird spikes installed in
the eland enclosures which were at face-level for the elands, and could cause injury. These hazards could cause
injuries to eyes or skin.
3.) In the outdoor exhibit area for the giraffes there are vertical wooden boards that compose the back wall of the
enclosure. Many of the boards are broken near the top, creating some openings where a giraffe could potentially get
its head caught. Entanglement strangulation is a leading cause of death in healthy, captive giraffes, and every effort
should be made to remove such hazards.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair, and free from hazards that could cause injury.
3.127(d) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Whereas the perimeter fence is in the process of improvement, and new fencing has been, or is in the process of
being installed, in at least one area the perimeter fence still does not meet the requirements specified in 3.127 (d).
The fence should be at least eight feet in height, due to the presence of animals defined as dangerous animals, and
it should prevent animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing secondary containment in
the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure.
- There is a portion of the fence near camels that falls short of the eight feet minimum height requirement. The
fence measured only 68 inches in one area. Additionally there was a gap under a gate in this same area measuring
six inches.
The fence should consistently meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. Gates in the fence
should remain closed if unattended. This facility should have a perimeter fence which adequately prevents people
and animals from passing through or under the fence, and which can also act as a secondary containment system
for the animals on exhibit. This facility houses animals such as big cats, bears, hyenas, and elephants, and
therefore the perimeter fence should be at least eight feet in height, and it should either fully enclose the whole
premises, or the areas where these animals are housed, with a perimeter fence measuring at least six feet in height
for the other animals. There should be a separation of at least three feet between the animals on exhibit and the
perimeter fence, and it should preclude contact with people or animals. The fence should be maintained in good
repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here. Failure to meet these standards could endanger
the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
