2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Female Yorkie #40, previously identified on 18 September 2014 as needing veterinary care for an injured eye,
was not present at the inspection today - according to the licensee, she is having surgery to enucleate the injured
eye to eliminate permanent problems as a consequence of her fight injury. This is an appropriate corrective action.
***Male Boston terrier #53 has a right eye that is cloudy and blue, with green thick discharge. The dog is not
squinting and the eye does not appear to be painful. Although the licensee remembers this dog has been
previously examined and treated by the attending veterinarian for a cherry eye removal, there was no record of this
dog's chronic condition (possible consequence of cherry eye surgery including dry eye) with instructions for treating
ongoing problems from the veterinarian. The dog did receive treatment via an eye ointment that the licensee had
documented in March of 2014, but no further treatments were recorded. This dog must be re-examined by 17
January 2015 to determine if this ongoing problem can be improved and to document an expected prognosis or end
point for treatment, or a management plan if the condition is expected to become chronic. The licensee must
document and maintain record of this examination and treatment, *including any instructions for any ongoing
problems expected,* for future inspection by APHIS officials. Failure to ensure ongoing treatment for dogs with
chronic medical conditions can lead to pain and suffering in the affected animals.

3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The outdoor washdowns on the south side of the main kennel have an excessive accumulation of feces and
staining. Also, the outdoor portions of some of the primary enclosures are littered with fecal material. The licensee
stated that they are cleaning the washdowns twice weekly, and cleaning and scrubbing the primary enclosures
every other week. Excreta and other waste material must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and the
washdowns must be cleaned as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, minimize odors, and satisfy
accepted cleanliness standards. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining these areas on a more frequent basis. Correct by: Remains uncorrected.
