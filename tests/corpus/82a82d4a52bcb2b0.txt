2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** A prairie dog located in the back of the museum had approximately 30 to 40% hair loss on its left side and flank
area at the time of inspection. The skin did not appear to be red or irritated. The licensee stated the animal had
been evaluated by a veterinarian in February of this year but there was no supporting medical documentation. The
licensee stated that the hair loss has worsened since the evaluation by the veterinarian. Hair loss can be an
indication of bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections as well as a psychological stress. This prairie dog must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment
plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector
upon request.

3.31(d)
SANITATION.
**** On the bottom edge of the keeper's door of a prairie dog enclosure, were numerous scattered insect excrement
as well as a live roach-like insect on the inside edge of the keeper's door. Lack of an effective pest control program
can create unsanitary conditions and lead to the potential spread of disease. No bait, bait traps or other means to
control or eliminate the insects were viewed during the inspection. The licensee must establish an effective
program of pest control and ensure the excrement is removed and the area is properly cleaned and sanitized for the
health and well being of the prairie dogs.
