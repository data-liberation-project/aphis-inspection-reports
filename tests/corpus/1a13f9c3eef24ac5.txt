ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three males and two female guinea pigs are housed together. The majority of the guinea pigs were noted
scratching excessively. A fresh open wound was identifed on the right hindquarters of one of the male guinea pigs.
The guinea pigs need to be examined by a veterinarian to determine the cause of hair loss. The guinea pig with the
open wound needs to be treated immediately.

There were 3 adult males and 2 adult female guinea pigs housed together. One male was noted to have a wound
on his right hindquarter possibly due to fighting. Multiple male guinea pigs housed with females can lead to
agression. Guinea pigs must be maintained in compatiable groups.
