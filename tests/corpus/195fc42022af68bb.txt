Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
There are primates housed both in groups and individually. However, the enrichment protocol from the attending
veterinarian only address primates housed in group settings, and does not address enrichment based on age or species.
There is no way to determine if the attending veterinarian knows primates are housed individually, or what additional
enrichment or enhancements may be required for their well being. A primate enrichment protocol must be created and
approved by the attending veterinarian or all primates must be housed in social group settings.

Facilities, general.

Enclosures containing 2 red coatimundis, and 2 albino coatimundis contained a tin roof structure in which multiple nail or
screw heads were observed coming down into the enclosure. There is at least one screw head that is accessible to the
albino coatimundis from a climbing branch directly below. This can pose a direct injury hazard to the animals within.

Sanitation.
Multiple rodent enclosures contained an excessive accumulation of bedding material, excreta and seed throughout the
enclosures and tanks. Some of this buildup was observed to be several inches high. This can attract insects and vermin
and can contaminate food and water stores.

Outdoor enclosures housing 11 Genets throughout the facility contained soiled cat litter boxes that are cleaned weekly
according to the employee. However, the employee stated that they had just arrived back in town from a trip and normal
cleaning practices had not been kept up. These litter boxes contained fecal material covering 50 to 75 percent of the
surface to the extent that the animals would not be able to utilize the box without coming in contact with excreta.

Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to avoid the excessive buildup of organic material.
3.131(d) Repeat

Sanitation.
Enclosures containing 9 Genets, 2 Otters, and 8 Fennec foxes contained an abundance of spiderwebs and arachnids
which the employee and licensee's brother identified as Banana Spiders. These webs and spiders were above the
animals, feed and water ports and shelters. The employee stated that they could not get rid of them.


An outdoor enclosure housing 4 Coatimundis had a large stagnate pool of water directly under and to the side of the
corner of the enclosure. This water contained a number of small swimming and writhing inspects that were too numerous
to count,

The Rodent and Marmoset building was inundated with small dark, gnat-like flying insects. These insects were of such a
number that the inspector had to fan them away several times while walking through the building.

An affective pest control plan must be in place and be utilized in order to preserve the sanitation of the facility, enclosures,
food and water stations and animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with site caretaker.
