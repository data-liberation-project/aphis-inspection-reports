3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In Toyota Stadium there were several areas on the pool entry ledge where the paint was missing on the surface
within the dolphin enclosure. Exposed concrete was observed, and some spots appeared to have divots or defects
in the concrete as well. Spots with missing paint ranged from clusters of small defects measuring less than 1/4 inch
to spots up to an inch or more in diameter. These areas are accessible to the dolphins, and suggest that
contaminants could be entering the water, even though staff check and clean these areas daily and veterinary staff
report no health related issues.
Exposure to contaminants could affect water quality, and be harmful to the animals. All surfaces in a primary
enclosure must be constructed of durable nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning and disinfection as appropriate,
to maintain acceptable water quality. All surfaces must be maintained in good repair as part of a regular ongoing
maintenance program.
To be corrected by September 30, 2016.
