Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
On the morning of 7/8/22, at approximately 5:30AM, USDA personnel observed animals being loaded in to a vehicle for
ground transportation. USDA personnel asked if these animals had been dropped off earlier in the morning, and facility
staff stated that many of the animals had been received the night before. USDA personnel specifically asked if the only
young brown puppy (“Daisy”) had been received the night before transport, and facility personnel stated that she had.
Animals in transport may experience stress, hunger, thirst, or may become soiled. Accepting animals for transport more
than 4 hours before the scheduled departure time of the transporter may expose the animals to stress, discomfort, or risk.
Correct by 8/1/22 by accepting animals no earlier than 4 hours prior to their scheduled departure time, or up to 6 hours
prior if agreed upon by the consignor.
3.14(c)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
On the morning of 7/8/22, the transporter transported 22 animals (10 dogs, 7 puppies, and 5 kittens) for transport without
first obtaining a written certification that the animals had been offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to
the transporter.
A template of the intake/drop off paperwork used by the transporter does not include any statements about food or water


availability prior to transport, nor does it include instructions for feeding/watering during transport. The template also lacks
spaces for the consignor’s name and address, the time and date the animal was last fed and watered, instructions for
feeding and watering for a 24-hour period, and the consignor’s signature. Animals may experience hunger and thirst
during transport. Young animals are especially vulnerable to the negative effects of prolonged time periods without access
to food. Correct by 8/1/22 by obtaining written certification that every animal has had access to food and water in the 4
hours prior to beginning transport, and by obtaining the consignor’s name and address, the time and date the animal was
last fed and watered, instructions for feeding and watering for a 24-hour period, and the consignor’s signature.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
None of the approximately 20 crates used to transport 22 animals (10 dogs, 7 puppies, and 5 kittens) were labelled with
“live animal” signage or directional arrows. “Live animal” signage and directional arrows are important for animal welfare
during travel by alerting personnel about the contents and upright orientation of each crate containing live animals.
Correct by 8/1/22 by ensuring that crates are labelled with the words “live animal” in at least 1-inch tall letters,
accompanied by directional arrows indicating the correct upright orientation of the crate.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
