INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A whelping room housing one adult and her 7 puppies smelled of ammonia. The ammonia level was high enough to
be irritating to the eyes and nose. Excess ammonia in the air can result in respiratory irritation and infection, as well
as other health conditions such as unthriftiness ("poor-doers") and reproductive problems.
More frequent cleaning and increased ventilation will decrease ammonia levels for a healthier environment.

FEEDING.
There were 20 food prep receptacles lined up, half full of water following the morning feeding. Almost half of them
had excessive accumulations of dried and caked food residue. The residue was observed along the sides of the
receptacles.
Caked food residue can harbor bacteria and other disease-producing organisms which could affect the health of the
adult dogs and puppies utilizing these receptacles. The caked food residue must be removed, and the licensee
must ensure that food receptacles are kept clean to prevent the accumulations of caked food residue and to protect
the health and well-being of the dogs.

The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
