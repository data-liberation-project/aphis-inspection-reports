2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The animal records were incomplete. The acquisition, disposition, and inventory were incomplete for 39 rabbits and
two pigs. One alpaca had died in the early part of January 2018 and was not documented. In addition, the dates of
six goat deaths since the last inspection had not been documented. Not providing complete and accurate
information does not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an APHIS official. A current inventory of all
regulated animals must be created and maintained going forward. All acquisition and disposition information must
be documented for all regulated animals.
3.53(c)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One primary enclosure containing eight rabbits was too small for the rabbits it contained. The licensee estimated
the individual rabbit weights to be 4 lbs on average. For eight rabbits they would need a total space of 12 square
feet. The enclosure measured 41.5 inches by 18 inches for a total of 747 square inches or 5.1875 square feet. The
enclosure is short by 6.8125 square feet. Cage space requirements ensure that the rabbits have enough room to
move about freely within their enclosures. It minimizes the rabbits from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and
also minimizes the spread of disease. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures containing rabbits have enough
floor space to meet the minimum floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the rabbits in that
enclosure. Correct immediately.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
An enclosure containing eight rabbits had a large amount of feces building up on one side of the enclosure.
Because of the large number of rabbits in the small size of the enclosure, feces is easily able to build up within the
enclosure. Upon inspection, the rabbits were generally trying to stay out of the feces that had built up on the one
side of the enclosure but not all the rabbits were able to fit on the cleaner side so at least a couple of the rabbits had
no choice but to sit in the feces. Rabbits sitting in their own feces can contribute to the spread of disease not only
among the rabbits, but also any person that may come into contact with those rabbits. The rabbits should be
provided a larger enclosure or divided into multiple enclosures and the enclosure(s) should be cleaned on a moreregular basis so it doesn't get to the point that the rabbits have no choice but to sit in their own feces. Correct
immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
