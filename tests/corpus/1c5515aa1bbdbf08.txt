2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15 pm on
06-Jun-17.
No one home at facility. I called and spoke to Licensee. She is away at a training clinic this week. We discussed
optimal hours-approximately three four hour blocks of time during daylight hours are needed each week to facilitate
inspection. Innovative means of meeting this requirement need to be explored. In the meantime, Licensee will
send hours of availability as often as necessary
