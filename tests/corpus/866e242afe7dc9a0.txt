Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
An expired bottle of bupivicaine was in a lab refrigerator during the inspection (expiration 5/1/2022). A new bottle had
been acquired but the seal was still on the new bottle and it was on a shelf. Per lab personnel bupivicaine had been
used in 6 animal surgeries this week prior to inspection. Since the new bottle was sealed and the old bottle was ready for
use, expired bupivicaine was likely used for the 6 surgeries. Expired medications might not be as effective as unexpired
medications. Ensure that expired medications are not used in animals and are not stored in a manner that allows their
use with animals.
Note: The lab animal manager removed this expired medication to not permit its use and confirmed an unexpired
replacement was available for the lab.

Correction: Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
