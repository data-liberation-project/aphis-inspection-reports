3.53(a)(1) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In early September 2016, a rabbit was found by staff with an enrichment device (bell) stuck in its mouth. Staff
contacted the attending veterinarian and it was decided to euthanize the animal. The rabbit was eight months old
and therefore at the end of its production cycle. It likely would have been euthanized within a week. This
contributed to the decision to euthanize at this time. At post-mortem, the bell was removed with no other injuries
apparent. Bells are hung from the ceilings of the rabbit enclosures on chains. The bells are attached to the chains
with with a metal circle. The ends of the circle are in close opposition to each other but do not overlap. It is
suspected the bell had become detached from the chain and fell to the bottom of the enclosure allowing the rabbit
push its lower jaw into the wide part of the bell where it became stuck. Though the facility plans to move to a more
sturdy enrichment device, the bells have not been modified or replaced. On inspection today, one bell was seen
lying on the enclosure floor of one rabbit. Enrichment devices which are not safe and secure can harm animal
health. Primary enclosures, including enrichment items, shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair
to protect the rabbits from injury.
