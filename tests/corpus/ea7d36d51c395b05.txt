HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside enclosure #16 housing two adult wolf-dogs named "Batman" (Tag # 86) and "Amulet" (Tag #72) is exposed
ground fencing along the west side next to the fence. The exposed ground fencing has holes large enough for the
feet to get caught and potentially cause an injury to the animals.
Inside enclosure #17 housing two adult wolf-dogs named "Oreo" (Tag #85) and "Buku" (Tag #83) is two exposed
pieces of re-barb protruding upward from the ground along the north side of the enclosure. The animals can come
into contact with the sharp edges of the re-barb which could potentially cause an injury. This was corrected during
time of inspection.
Inside enclosure # 18 housing three adult wolf-dogs named "Valley Spirit-Mama"(Tag #81), "Asia" (Tag #84) and
"Talon"(Tag #82) is exposed ground fencing along the north side next to the fence. The exposed ground fencing
has holes large enough for the feet to get caught and potentially cause an injury to the animals.
Licensee shall maintain all housing facilities so that they are structurally sound and kept in good repair so that they
protect the animals from injury.
