Facilities, general.
A fallow deer buck (adult male) was located in an area behind the giraffe barn. This area is not an animal holding area,
and contained vehicles, dumpsters, farm equipment, and a large amount of unused fencing that was on the ground.

Animals who enter areas containing equipment, construction materials, and dumpsters may become injured or entrapped.

Correct by Feb 12, 2021, by containing animals within enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. Approximately 2 hours after the end of the inspection,
the deer was moved out of the area and the gate was closed to prevent entry of further animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
