FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from Sunlight.
***It was a sunny day with clear blue sky at the time of the inspection 2:30-3PM. The pen located behind the turkey
pen/shed that contained one Llama had full sunlight and there was no natural means or structure in the pen to
provide some shade to the animal.
Per this Section of the Regulations, sufficient shade by natural or artificial means shall be provided to animals
housed outdoors to allow the animals to protect themselves from direct sunlight. Exposure to direct sunlight may
cause overheating or discomfort to the animals.
The Licensee needs to provide a source of shade for the Llama currently housed in the pen located behind the
turkey pen/shed. In addition, this pen needs to have a source of shade available for any other AWA species of
animals that may be housed in this pen in the future.
Licensee corrected this item during the inspection by moving the Llama to another pen that provided shade for the
animal.
NOTE - Exit briefing held on-site with Licensee. Report delivered by email 6/4/19.
