2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A dark colored female raccoon is lying flat on her right side along the front of the enclosure. The raccoon appeared
lethargic and had no response when approached by the inspector and the facility representative. The raccoon
would slightly raise her head, but would not get up and move. The facility representative thought the animal is an
older raccoon and may not be getting along with her pen mates.
A female white raccoon has an abnormal appearance to her left eye. At least half of the surface of the left eye is
covered in a white-yellowish colored discharge. There is a dark line of material under the bottom of the eye.
The above mentioned raccoons must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish
an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.131(e) DIRECT REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The Raccoon Building has a high ambient temperature and humidity. The building is constructed of metal and is not
insulated. There are large fans running at both ends of the building and there are windows that are open along the
sides. Towards the middle of the building there is little to no movement of air and the temperature in this part of the
building as taken by the Kestrel at approximately 2:00 pm is 96.1 degrees F and the heat index is 119.4 degrees F.
The outdoor air temperature at the time of the inspection as read by the Kestrel 101 degrees and the heat index is
113 degrees. Multiple raccoons were displaying behaviors such as panting and lying on their sides and abdomens
with their legs splayed out that could indicate they are uncomfortable with the temperature. There are
approximately 290 raccoons housed in this building. High temperature and humidity could have a negative impact
on the health and well-being of the animals.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health and well-being, appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must reduce the temperatureand humidity inside this building to a level that is comfortable for the raccoons in order to support their health and
well-being.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, and the facility representative.
This is a focused inspection conducted only on the building containing the raccoons.
