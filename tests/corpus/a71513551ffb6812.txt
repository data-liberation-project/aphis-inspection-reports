2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
No written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was available at the beginning of this inspection. Upon phone contact by
inspector to the Attending Veterinarian (AV), a copy of a 2018 PVC was provided to the facility. The 2018 PVC does not
accurately reflect the species present during inspection. The PVC includes species no longer held by the exhibitor (sugar
glider, possum) and does not document all current species (rabbits). Each exhibitor shall employ an AV under formal
arrangements. In the case of a part-time AV, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care
and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor. Correct by July 13, 2021.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
No records of acquisition, disposition, or animals on-hand were available for inspection. Disposition of a sugar glider was
not recorded. Acquisition information for 2 rabbits, 1 hedgehog and 1 chinchilla was not available. No record of animals on
hand was available. Per the regulations, every exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain adequate records or forms which
fully and correctly disclose the required, detailed information in this section concerning animals purchased or otherwise
acquired, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold,
euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. Correct by July 13, 2021.


3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Excessive numbers of fruit flies were present in the animal display room, centered primarily around the hedgehog
enclosure. High numbers of pests serve as an increased disease risk for the animals due to feces and disease
transmission between the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and
mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct by July 13, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
