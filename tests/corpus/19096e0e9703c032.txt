3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The current perimeter fence is still only 4 feet high and is not of sufficient height to keep animals contained if
they are out of the primary enclosure. Additionally, a 4 foot high fence does not prevent unauthorized access to the
animals. Fences less than 6 feet high for animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The perimeter
fence needs to be addressed to ensure the safety of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
