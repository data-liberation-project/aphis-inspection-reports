2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The following information was gathered from an interview with the facility manager. On approximately January 19,
2017 a Lynx was taken out of a temporary holding unit while it's permanent enclosure was to be assessed for
possible repair. The animal was put on a leash by one of the animal caretakers and held in an area where the
public had access. At this time, a member of the public walked directly in front of the animal and it raised up on its
hind legs and wrapped its front paws around her, causing scratches on her where the animal's claws came in
contact. The animal was not under adequate direct control from the trainer, nor was there sufficient distance or
barriers between the animal and the public. Without a proper barrier between the public and dangerous animals,
there is a heightened risk of danger to both the public and the animals, as well as a risk of animal escape.
Correct by: Corrective actions were taken before this focused inspection occurred. Retraining of all employees with
access to animals has occurred and the Lynx in question has since been relocated to another facility.
This was a focused inspection to address allegations brought fourth in a complaint. No animals were inspected at
this time.
This focused inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
