observations of the facility and animals. Correct by having the veterinarian visit the facility and update the PVC as
needed, then sign the form in the PVC indicating the veterinarian has visited the facility. The PVC and the signature
form with other relevant information must be maintained and available for USDA personnel to review. To be

Cobwebs holding dust and bedding were present throughout the facility at the time of inspection. The accumulations
in these cobwebs provide a source for irritation of the airway in the guinea pigs and could make them susceptible to
respiratory disease. Correct by assuring the premises (buildings and grounds) are kept clean and in good repair in
order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. To be corrected by: 9
