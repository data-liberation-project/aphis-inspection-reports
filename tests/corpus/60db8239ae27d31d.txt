goat, pig, sheep, and alpaca enclosures. During the inspection, the facility representative began cleaning out and
filling up the water receptacle in the pig enclosure.
Water receptacles should be kept clean as required for the health of the animals.A system should be in place and
maintained to ensure all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
There was a moderate accumulation of expired food ( corn husks) in the pig, alpaca, and sheep enclosures. There
was also a vacant enclosure adjacent to the pig enclosure that was maintained in the same condition. Expired food
may attract pests and increase disease hazards to animal areas.
A system should be in place to ensure expired food and other debris are removed from primary enclosures as often
as necessary to prevent contamination to the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odors.
