2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 4 vials of outdated canine vaccines with an expiration date of 22 Aug 2017 kept in the refrigerator.
Expired medication or vaccines may not be efficacious in treating or immunizing animals against the infectious
organisms that they are meant to treat or prevent. An adequate program of veterinary care which includes the use
of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care, shall be maintained at all times.
Correct from this day forward.
2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The record of dogs on hand did not match the number of adult dogs counted on the premises. At least 24 adult
dogs were counted during inspection but only 14 adult dogs were accounted for on the inventory.
Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain the information which fully and correctly discloses the details required
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to
ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking or tracing of animals.
Correct from this day forward.
3.1(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least three enclosures in the sheltered housing facility had the side mounted plastic feeders removed (due to
their chewing of the plastic) exposing sharp points of metal. A dachshund was observed poking its head through
the opening and the skin on its neck came into direct contact with the exposed points. Although the dog was not
injured at the time of inspection, these sharp points have the potential to injure the dogs contained in the affected
enclosures. The sharp points must be removed and/or covered in such a way so that the dogs cannot put theirheads through the openings in the integrity of the cage and come into direct contact with the sharp points on the
wires.
Correct from this day forward.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outdoor housing facility closest to the residence, containing 3 females and one stud male had wooden flooring
that was no longer impervious to moisture because the boards had rough grooves and cracks in their surface that
were no longer waterproof.
All surfaces in contact with animals must be maintained on a regular basis so as not to harbor bacteria or viruses
that can potentially negatively affect their health and well-being. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized because of irregular, rough or no longer sealed surfaces must be repaired or replaced when worn or
soiled.
Correct by November 10, 2019.
3.10
WATERING.
A couple of water bowls in the outdoor kennel facilities had green algae growing on the insides of the containers.
One of the bowls had a buildup of limescale that gave the algae a rough surface to adhere to and more readily
grow.
All dogs need easy and convenient access to clean food and water to maintain their health and well-being. Water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as often as necessary to be kept so.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Licensee.
