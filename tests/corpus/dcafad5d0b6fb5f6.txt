*The male Savannah cat was climbing the fencing of its enclosure when the inspectors arrived. An area of hairloss
at least 1 inch in diameter was noted on the cat's underside near the cat's left front leg. A swelling or mass
approximately 3/4 in in diameter was noted in this area. No wounds were visible. The caretaker reports that the cat
had visited the vet on Dec. 8, 2015 for vaccinations, fecal exam and deworming. The caretaker called the vet's
office and talked to the receptionist today. No notations of a mass were noted in the cat's record. The caretaker
made an appointment to take the cat to the vet clinic tomorrow.
*A female mouflon first noted in quarantine during the Oct. 19, 2015 inspection for weight loss issues is still being
kept separate from the others. The attending vet recommended deworming. The caretaker reports the mouflon is
doing better but is "still not right" and that "she doesn't look like the others". The mouflon appears alert today but
quiet. She is thin with muscle loss and a tucked in abdomen. Her haircoat appears dull and has not shed
normally/completely and her eyes have a glazed appearance.
The facility needs to maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries in order to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. The
Savannah cat and mouflon need to be examined by a veterinarian who shall make a diagnosis and develop a
treatment plan.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The Nilgai enclosure has a severe drainage issue with standing water and thick mud present. The animals are
unable to avoid the thick wet mud when walking to their feed and water receptacles. The 2 nilgai walking through
this area sunk several inches deep into the mud with each step and made a sucking sound when lifting each foot
from the mud. When standing, mud covered the entire feet and part of the lower leg. Both nilgai were noted to have
the lower portion of their legs covered with dry and fresh mud. The facility corrected the drainage problem however
the one corner and along the fence line has returned. A permanent solution needs to be implemented. Wet
enclosures can lead to discomfort to the animals, injury due to slippery footing and health problems/diseases of thefeet and legs. The enclosures shall be provided with a method to provide rapid elimination of excess water or the
animals should be moved to drier enclosures.
