2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On August 12, 2022, an adult, male African Crested porcupine was found deceased at the end of one of the tunnels down
in his exhibit. Per a facility representative, the porcupine had not routinely been fully visualized during daily observations
by the facility’s staff. This was in part due to the skittish nature of this animal, which made the staff uncomfortable and
afraid to handle him, as per the facility representative. In failing to conduct consistent daily observations on this porcupine,
medical conditions or injuries were not detected in time to prevent the death of this animal. Each exhibitor shall establish
and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include consistent and adequate daily observation of all animals
to assess their health and well-being. As a result of this incident, the facility began more training and socialization of the
porcupines to make observations and handling easier.

Separation.
On September 23, 2022, a male, juvenile African Crested porcupine was found with matching lacerations on the top and
bottom of his foot consistent that of a bite wound. In consulting with their Attending Veterinarian, the facility’s internal


investigation determined that the animal was bitten on his right foot - through the fence - by the older female African
Crested porcupine neighboring his enclosure. Incompatibility between these two animals resulted in injury and discomfort
to the juvenile porcupine. Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere with their health or cause them
discomfort. At the time of inspection, the facility already installed an additional protective barrier between the two animals,
preventing them from accessing one another.
