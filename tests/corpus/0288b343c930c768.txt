2.126(a) CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On the afternoon of 18 March 2020 at approximately 12:05pm, USDA inspectors arrived outside the licensee’s front
gate. The licensee was called and a voicemail left for her. Inspectors noted the presence of members of the public
on the property. The licensee called back and refused inspection to USDA inspectors over the phone. About 5
minutes later, the licensee walked out from her house and said “Write me up, I don’t care!” “I’ve done a joint
inspection with Fish and Game and USDA, and I’m not going to do it again. I can’t refuse you guys [FWC], but I can
refuse USDA.”
Failure to allow for unannounced animal welfare inspections makes it impossible for APHIS to determine if the
facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations. Correct this by allowing APHIS officials
access to the facility for all future unannounced inspections.
Correct by 19 March 2020.
