2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:32 pm on
12-APR-17.
Knocked on front door. Licensee's husband answered the door and replied when I asked him if I could do an
inspection that he was on his way to work and that licensee would not be off work until 5:00 pm.
