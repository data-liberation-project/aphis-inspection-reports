2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The blond male goat housed with one sheep and one pony has significant hair
loss on both its sides: from behind the shoulders to the lateral surfaces of the thighs. There is more hair loss on the
left side of the rib cage with some white flakes on the underlying skin. There is hair on the area over the backbone
with yellowish white crusts seen along the mid-line. There were no records available at the time of this inspection
describing the extent of the hair loss. The goat has not been seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for its
current skin condition. Hair loss can have many causes such as parasites, infectious, nutritional, and may be a sign
of a more serious health concern. The goat must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide appropriate
veterinary care.
Correct by having the blond male goat evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must document and
maintain records of the examination, treatment and outcome for future inspections by APHIS officials. Correct by
July 25, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility owner.
