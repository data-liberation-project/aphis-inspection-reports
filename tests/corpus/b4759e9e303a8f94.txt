ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) last reviewed on 12/29/2016 is incomplete. The guidance in
the written PVC is not complete regarding the vaccinations and internal parasites. The PVC states that the animals
should be vaccinated for Clostridial diseases, but does not list the frequency the animals are to receive it. The
attending veterinarian (AV) states under internal parasites twice yearly fecal exams, last fecal neg. There is no
additional guidance if the animals have to be treated for internal parasites. Failure to include complete written
guidance regarding these topics does not ensure the welfare of the animals maintained by the facility and may lead
to failure in providing measures for preventing, controlling, and treating of diseases. Consult with the attending
veterinarian and develop a complete and accurate written program of veterinary care that reflects the practices at
the facility. All treatments and medications must have directions for use from the AV to include dosage, route of
administration, frequency, or concentration listed on the PVC or available in the facility.
