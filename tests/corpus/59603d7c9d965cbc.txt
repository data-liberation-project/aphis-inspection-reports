(1) General requirements
A metal gate in the outdoor enclosures was rusty on the lower 2/3 of the vertical frame piece. The rust had caused
a severe deterioration of the frame piece such that 1/2 of the vertical pipe was gone. The metal had jagged edges
on the surface facing into the enclosure. As the dogs move about, they could receive an injury from the jagged
edges. The rusty surfaces can no longer be cleaned and sanitized because the surfaces are rough and flaking.
The structural integrity of the metal pipe vertical frame is very poor and may not last much longer. Surfaces that are
easily cleaned and sanitizable and safe from injury and keep the animals safely enclosed are necessary to ensure
healthy dogs. The licensee must repair or replace the gate.

Cleaning
****In the whelp building there were 2 enclosures that had an excessive amount of feces in the outdoor part. As the
approximately 7 week old puppies moved about, it was difficult for them to avoid walking in the feces. A clean
environment is essential to reduce the risk of disease. The owner must provide for daily cleaning and more frequent
cleaning, if necessary, to prevent the dogs from being in contact with the feces.
3.10
WATERING.
At least 6 plastic and metal water receptacles had green algae-like material in the water. Some was floating loose
in the water and other receptacles had green material along the sides and bottom. This material could cause illness
or discomfort to the dogs when they ingest it as they drink the water. Clean water receptacles are important inpromoting good health and in preventing illness. To ensure that clean water is available to the dogs, the
receptacles must be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized on a frequency to prevent the accumulation of the green
material or other contaminants.
