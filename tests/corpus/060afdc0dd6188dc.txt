The licensee had not identified the dogs with nails that had been cut so short that the feet were bleeding and was
not performing any treatment. The licensee stated that the dogs nails had been cut in the morning. The dogs
identified by the inspector were actively bleeding at 12pm and many were still bleeding when the inspector returned
at 4:45pm. When the nails are cut too short the dog can become lame from pain and the feet may get infected. At
the time of this write up the attending veterinarian was examining the dogs identified above. The licensee must
follow all treatment recommendations and maintain documentation for examination by APHIS inspectors.
Additionally the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian for the proper method for the routine
trimming of the nails to prevent injury during this process.
