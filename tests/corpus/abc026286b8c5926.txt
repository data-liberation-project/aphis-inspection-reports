2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A group of public members, consisting of approx. 4 adults and 2 children, were left unattended inside the enclosure
(approx. 12 ft X 21 ft) that housed the two Albifron lemurs and the one housing the two Coatimundi and one
Raccoon. The public was allowed to feed and interact freely with the animals while the tour guide was outside the
enclosures, either not paying attention or retrieving more food for the animals.
In the building housing the two Green Vervet monkeys, the public is allowed to feed the primates. The tour guide
was not paying close attention to the primates or the public members near the enclosure. One young child was seen
placing his hands on the wire enclosure within easy reach of the primates and could have easily been bitten. After
initially introducing the group to the primates, the guide walked to the other side of the building to show off another
animal, leaving the group to interact with the primates without direct supervision.
Due to the lack of physical barriers, safety of the public and the animals relied solely on the supervision of the guide.
This lack of supervision could lead to physical harm to the animals or the public.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the the animal and the general viewing public so as to
assure the safety of animals and the public.
