ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

not currently being treated for any medical condition and has not been seen by the attending veterinarian. Each
dealer or exhibitor must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries and the availability of emergency,
weekend, and holiday care. Prompt and appropriate veterinary care must be provided to this piglet.

by the veterinarian must be provided and documented.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Four Guinea pigs were housed in outdoor primary enclosures. This climate is not conducive to housing guinea pigs
outdoors as the late spring/summer temperatures frequently exceed 100 degrees F. Guinea pigs must not be
housed in outdoor facilities unless the climate is appropriate and only with prior approval from the Regional office.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sheep/goat pen: In the front area of the pen, fencing at the bottom of the sheep/goat pen had protruding wires
sticking out in an approximate 2 foot area of fence. Also, a metal stake was placed in the ground approximately
8-10 inches from a gate entrance to the pen. The gap or opening between the stake and the gate creates enough
space in which a goat or sheep could become trapped and/or injured.
Pig pen: Wire fencing material with approximately 2 inch gaps was placed on the ground directly in front of a water
source.

The presence of protruding wires from fencing and inappropriately placed wiring and metal stakes may lead to
animals being trapped or injured. These areas must be identified, kept in good repair and maintained to protect the
animals and prevent injury to limbs and keep them from being entrapped between fence materials.

SANITATION.
Sheep/goat pen: The rear portion of this enclosure had an excessive build up of excreta. Excreta should be
removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained and to reduce disease hazards
and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of the sheep/goat pen should be more effective to prevent the buildup of
excreta.
