ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1130 on
11-MAR-19.
Upon arrival at the facility I made contact with a family member. He stated that the licensee was not home and
would not return until much later in the day. I then left the facility.
End of report.
