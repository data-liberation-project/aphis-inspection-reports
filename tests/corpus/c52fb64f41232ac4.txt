FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some of the lower horizontal metal poles in the bear den have advanced deteriorating rust and are no longer
structurally sound. These poles serve as the lower attachment of the enclosure chain link.
The chain link roof in panther enclosure # 2 (from left side) also has advanced deteriorating rust and may not be
structurally sound. Additionally, some of the U nails in the panther enclosures are also rusty. These nails also
attach the hog panels to the wood frames of the enclosures.
Inspect all metal surfaces & fasteners and remove or replace deteriorating rust so that all enclosures are structurally
sound and capable of containing the animals.
