3.87(a)(3)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
Two primary transport enclosures housing one common squirrel monkey and one red handed tamarin respectively had
openings large enough for the animals to reach outside their enclosures. The transport enclosures were constructed of
wire mesh with square one inch openings. The transport enclosure for the squirrel monkey had a section of wire mesh
with two inch openings. Both enclosures allowed the animals to extend their arms outside of the wires. The squirrel
monkey extended its hand and almost its entire arm through the opening to try to reach out to the inspector. Openings
large enough for the non-human primates to extend parts of its body through can lead to injury to the non-human primates
or to other animals/people nearby. The nonhuman primate shall at all times be securely contained within the enclosure
such that it cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.87(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
Two primary transport enclosures housing one common squirrel monkey and one red-handed tamarin respectively did not
have handles present. All sides of the enclosure were constructed of metal wire. To pick up the enclosure the handlers
have to wrap fingers around the metal wire which may lead to the handler coming in contact with the non-human primates


contained inside. This may lead to injury of the animals and/or the handler. All non-human primate enclosures must have
devices such as handles or handholds on the exterior that enable the enclosure to be lifted without tilting it, and ensure
that anyone handling the enclosure will not come into physical contact with the animal contained inside.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.87(a)(10)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
Two primary transport enclosures housing one common squirrel monkey and one red-handed tamarin respectively were
constructed entirely of metal wires with no solid bottoms. Primary transport enclosures should be leak-proof to prevent
urine and feces from seeping outside of the enclosure and to prevent the animals from being excessively soiled.
Transport enclosures that prevent the leakage of bodily fluids must be used for all future animal transport to keep the
animals as clean and dry as possible while in transit.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.

This was an inspection conducted prior to consignment at the December 2022 auction. This inspection and exit interview
were conducted with the facility representative.
