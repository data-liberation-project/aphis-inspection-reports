ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care is not being followed by the licensee. The PVC stated that each adult dog is to
receive a rabies vaccine either annually or every three years. There is no record of the adult dogs ever receiving a
rabies vaccine. It also states that every dog over one year of age and with tartar on the teeth was to have its teeth
brushed twice a week. The licensee believes that he brushes the dogs teeth about four times a year. In addition
each adult dog was to receive oral ivermectin every month for the prevention of heartworm disease. The licensee
did not have any ivermectin on hand and did not remember providing this medication to the dogs.
The licensee had not been performing these tasks as directed by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must
follow the attending veterinarian's direction to ensure optimal animal health.
The inspector spoke with the attending veterinarian and a plan has been made to have the licensee and
veterinarian re-evaluate the PVC. Correct by speaking with your veterinarian to make a clear health program for
your animals by August 8th, 2017.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Puppies in the kennel had no form of identification. Cage cards must be used to identity any puppies that are less
than 16 weeks of age if they re not already identified with a tattoo or official tag etc. Identification is necessary to
ensure that the animals can be tracked and appropriate medical records can be generated for each animal.
