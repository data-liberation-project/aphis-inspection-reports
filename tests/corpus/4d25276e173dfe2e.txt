3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All surfaces that house animals must be maintained on a regular basis. Two outside enclosures of the Stevens
building/sheltered facility, housing one capuchin monkey and the other housing three spider monkeys, the concrete
flooring has large cracks and a few places where the concrete is missing, leaving a small hole in the floor. These
cracks are long and deep. Cracks in hard surface flooring where animals walk can be a hazard to the feet and
toe/finger nails. Nails can become lodged and torn. Also, proper cleaning and sanitizing these cracked areas of
flooring cannot be adequately done. Deep cracks in animal areas can harbor diseases and feces that cannot be
washed out, properly cleaned and sanitized. The facility must replace these areas of the flooring to ensure that good
cleaning and sanitization can be done and the monkeys are in a safe environment. This will help in the good health
and care for the animals in this building.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury and to
contain the animals in a safe manner. Two to three feet of a top portion of the enclosure fencing housing 3
Aoudad(cid:25)s (Barbary sheep), is in need of repair. The six foot wire mash fencing is smashed down about 6 to 8
inches and needs to be put back into place and properly secured. The facility representative must repair or replace
this area of fencing and put into place a good maintenance program that daily inspects areas that contain animals.

properly washed out, cleaned, and sanitized. Also, cracks in hard surface flooring where animals walk can be a
hazard to the feet and toe nails. Toes nails can become lodged and torn. The facility must replace these areas of
