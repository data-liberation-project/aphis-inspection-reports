2.1(a)

Requirements and application
This facility is operating as a dealer without a valid USDA license. Listings advertising puppies for sale including shipping
and guardian homes led to a search of this facility. After a conversation with both the veterinary clinic and the facility
representative, it was confirmed there are more than four breeding females on sight. Regulated activity is being
conducted. The sale of puppies sight unseen through a transporter require a USDA license. The customer has indicated
that she will be pursuing a USDA license and will be applying via the on-line application.

No regulated activity may be conducted from this time forward until a USDA license covering the activities is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
