HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The back of "Akasha's" (dog) enclosure shares a common chain link fence wall with 2 alligator enclosures on the
other side. There is a partial plywood barrier affixed to the wall on the left side of the enclosure. On the right
portion of the enclosure, this barrier has a large hole in the lower portion. The design of this barrier is of insufficient
height on the left side and not solid in on the right side, which can permit the dog to potentially put her paws, tail, or
other portions of her body through the chain link and get injured by the alligator.
The enclosure must be designed to protect the animals from injury.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The dirt in the Dorkie's enclosure has eroded at the front of the enclosure which has now exposed the underlying
chain link mesh. The size of the holes in this chain link can allow their feet to pass through and can potentially
injure the dogs.
Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so that they have floors that are constructed in a manner that
protects the dogs' and cats' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the
dogs' and cats' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.

The rabbits did not have any artificial cooling provided at the time of the inspection. The temperature at 12:15 PM
was 90.8 degrees F. (taken with a Kestral 3000). The licensee stated that she mists them down by hand during the
hot weather, but does not monitor the atmospheric temperature to ensure that the rabbits are provided additional
cooling at all times when the temperature exceeds 90 degrees F.
When the atmospheric temperature exceeds 90 degrees F. artificial cooling shall be constantly provided by a
sprinkler system or other means.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Peacock feathers were observed frozen into the ice in the chest freezer that contains the meat for the animals. The
feathers observed would indicate that this bird was just put into the freezer without any type of bag. Carcasses that
are not food for the animals shall not be placed in the freezer containing animal food. An SOP &/or signage for
volunteers and staff needs to be implemented so that this does not reoccur.
All food must be stored in a manner that protects it from contamination.

SANITATION.
The portion of the rear wall in the indoor kinkajou enclosure consist of painted sheetrock. This is an area where a
bird had damaged the drywall when it was housed in this enclosure previously. The underlying sheetrock is now
exposed. Additionally, this area has several deep holes.
This area of the enclosure can no longer be adequately cleaned. The holes can also harbor insects, vermin ,&
bacteria, and does not minimize disease hazards.
The top of the den in the bear enclosure & the skunk enclosure were dirty. There was also foul decaying odor
around the bear as well as near the leopard enclosures.
The porcelain toilet in the bobcat/raccoon/bobcat/domestic cat enclosure was filled with dirty, stagnant water. The
licensee stated that the bobcat & raccoon plays in it.
Repair or replace the kinkajou enclosures as appropriate. Institute a more frequent & thorough cleaning in andaround the skunk, bear, leopard & bobcat/raccoon/domestic cat enclosures to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odors.

SANITATION.
The outdoor food storage and preparation continues to be dirty. Surfaces where food is stored and prepared are
still covered with dust, dirt, pest droppings, & dried blood. The refrigerator & freezer also has dried blood, dirt, &
pest droppings inside where food is stored.
It appears that all of these surfaces still are not being thoroughly cleaned with any regularity.
The buildup of dirt, dust, and dried blood, does not protect the food from contamination. All food shall be stored in
areas that are maintained in a clean fashion.
The following enclosures continues to have scattered accumulations of loose fiberfill &/or stuffing materials that
have come from stuffed animals or other objects that have been chewed/shredded by the animals: Pig/goat
enclosure, back 2 raccoons enclosure.
These materials pose a risk of esophageal, intestinal or stomach blockage if the animals should ingest this material.
All enclosures shall be maintained in a clean manner to minimize hazards.
The exit interview was conducted with the licensee on-site. This report will be E mailed to the licensee.
