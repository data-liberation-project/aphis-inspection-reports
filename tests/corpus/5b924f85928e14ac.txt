ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Bichon Frise, microchip #900118000353433, was observed to be thin. Upon closer observation this dogs
vertebrae, hip bones, front shoulder bones and ribs were easily palpable. This could be a sign of a medical
condition. The licensee needs to have this dog evaluated for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. The
licensee must provide documentation of this visit to the inspector/s upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
There is an unlabeled bottle of a blue mixture inside of the sheltered facility. When questioned the licensee stated
that is was a mixture of ivermectin and isopropyl alcohol used on her dogs. This bottle and all other transfer bottles
of medication must be labeled clearly to describe what the contents are and include the expiration date. Expired
medications may be contaminated, may not work as expected, and could harm the animals. Licensee must ensure
that all medications maintained for and used on the animals are not expired at all times.
