*** A 13 year old female Timber wolf was noted to be in need of veterinary care. On the back left leg, below the
knee, there was a 4 inch by 2 inch (approximate) mass. The mass appear to have a moderate amount of hair-loss.
The area did not appear to be inflamed and did not appear to be causing the animal any immediate pain or distress.
***A 10 year old male ring tailed lemur was noted to be in need of veterinary care. The animal was non-weight
bearing on the front right foot. There was a small abrasion noted between the toes on the affected foot. The first
digit on that hand was curled toward the palm. The animal appeared to be affected by this injury in that there was
little to no use below the elbow.
Animals not provided appropriate veterinary care will often not improve and may lead to the worsening of the
original condition along with secondary infections. Correct by having a veterinarian examine, diagnose and treat the
described wound above.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Two animals were found to be in need of veterinary care. This included a lemur with an injury to the right
hand/arm, and a wolf with a swelling on the left knee area. Daily observation is needed to assess an animal(cid:25)s
health and well-being. Failure to daily assess animals and report illnesses to a veterinarian can result in injuries
and diseases not being diagnosed and treated in a timely manner which can result in the further progression of the
illness or injury. Provide daily observation for all animals to evaluate their health and well-being, and provide an
accurate and timely means of communication so that all problems for all animals are reported to a veterinarian.

3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing 5 pigs has an area of plastic coated flooring that is exposed along the left wall. This
exposed flooring is a potential injury hazard to the animals as they could either get a foot/leg injured or caught in
this area. This area is in need of repair or replacement. This is an areas of potential injury or do not satisfy the
requirement to maintain all facilities in good repair. The facility must ensure that all animal enclosures are
maintained to adequately contain the animals, protect them from injury, and maintained in good repair.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although
an 8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, large mature trees remain within 3 feet of the
perimeter fence that have no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the perimeter
fence. Five adult pigs are also being housed in an enclosure that is within 3 feet of the perimeter fence. The height
of this enclosure is approximately 6 feet in height. A substantial perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair
and not less than 8 feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that contain potentially dangerous
animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event of an accidental escape there
is a secondary containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the property and endangering public
safety thereby placing the animal's life in jeopardy. Correct by removing enclosures that are in close proximity to the
perimeter fence and altering trees in a manner to ensuring the perimeter fence can adequately function as a
secondary containment system.
