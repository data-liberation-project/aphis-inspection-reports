ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:20 PM on
08-Aug-18.
I spoke to a relative at the house who stated that the licensee was not there and they tried but were not able to
contact her by phone. Later in the day, I was contacted by the licensee. We discussed her hours of availability.
