3.6(a)(2)(xii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Suspended wire flooring that is constructed of metal strands, must have strands greater than 1/8 inch(9 gauge), or
coated with a material such a plastic or fiberglass. Both sides on the outside runs of the whelping house (north
sheltered kennel) the plastic/fiberglass covering is chipping from the metal wire strands. The missing portions or
chips of the wire flooring that the dogs are on does not adequately give the dogs a good area for dogs to walk.
This could be uncomfortable, lead to sore feet, less exercise, and cause sores. The owner must repair or replace
these areas of missing wire coating to help insure the good health and well-being of dogs in these areas. Correct by
