2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In building "A" there is a female Rat Terrier (Saturn, microchip #018 345 587) whose legs and feet have multiple
hairless, red lesions on them. The skin on the inside of the dog's hind legs is also reddened. The left hind leg
appeared to show some weakness and seemed the most sensitive to the dog. The dog's head and both ears are
also covered in hairless spots and patches. Initially, the inspector saw the dog standing on only its right hind leg
and left front leg while holding the other two legs off the floor. The dog was very resistant to moving even when the
other dogs ran into her. When she did walk she was very hesitant to place any of her feet on the ground or bear
weight on them and moved with an abnormal, choppy gait.
The licensee had documented that the dog was evaluated by a licensed veterinarian on January 31, 2015 and had
treated the dog with Miconazole cream for two weeks and a tablet medication once a day until gone. During the
inspection, the facility representative contacted the veterinarian's office by phone to acquire a statement about the
dog but they could not confirm that the veterinarian had evaluated this dog.
Skin conditions such as this can cause pain and discomfort to the dog. The facility representative was verbally
instructed to have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by 12:00 pm on Thursday, March 19, 2015 in order
to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and appropriate treatment plan is established. This information,
including diagnosis, treatment plan and resolution of the condition, must be documented and available to the
inspector upon request.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In building "A" there is one enclosure, containing four dogs, that has a buildup of dirt and grime on the outside wall
near the access door. This buildup of dirt and grime does not allow for sanitization of this surface. Licensee must
ensure that all surfaces remain free of dirt and grime to ensure that proper sanitization can occur at least once every
two weeks or more often if necessary.
