2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On 02/04/22 at approximately noon, an adult female eland was observed. The animal’s left horn was broken off at the
base. The base of the horn had a wound approximately 1 inch long and insects were observed landing on the wound.
There was dark discharge around the edges of the wound and on the fur below the left eye. The animal appeared to be
bright and alert and was in normal body condition. The eland arrived at the auction on 02/02/22. The attending
veterinarian stated that she was not aware of this animal’s injury, but when shown pictures of the injury she believed the
animal did not need to be treated right away. The consignor of the animal stated that this injury was old and had
previously been treated.
Injuries including broken horns may cause pain or discomfort, and may become infected or infested with pests. Daily
observation of animals is important for identifying injuries, illness, or problems. Direct and frequent communication with
the attending veterinarian regarding new or ongoing issues is important so that the veterinarian can assess the animal
and decide of care is required.
Correct by 2/4/22 by ensuring that daily observation is completed for all regulated animals, and that issues are
communicated to the attending veterinarian promptly so that animals can receive assessment and care.
3.137(a)(1)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.

A female African crested porcupine (Tag #2345) was contained in a collapsible wire crate. Collapsible cages may collapse
with an animal inside during transport, injuring the animal or permitting the animal to escape. Correct by ensuring that
transport containers are strong enough to withstand the normal rigors of transportation. Correct by 2/7/22.
3.137(a)(4)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
19 hedgehogs in 11 hard plastic tote containers (each tote containing 1-2 hedgehogs) did not have ventilation on any of
the sides. (Tag numbers: 2364, 2359, 2356, 2354, 2353, 2352, 2351, 2358, 2357, 2360, 2361.)
Animals without adequate airflow during transportation may suffer from stress, difficulty breathing, or may overheat.
Transport containers must be adequately ventilated so that animals have adequate air flow for breathing and maintaining
body temperature during transport.
Correct by 2/7/22 by ensuring that travel containers are adequately ventilated in accordance with 3.137(a)(4).
3.137(c)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
A young pig (tag #162) was contained in a hard-sided pet taxi that did not provide adequate space for normal postural
adjustments or turning around freely. The animal was unable to turn around in the crate. Animals that are in cages that
are so small as to prevent normal adjustments and movement of the body may become stressed or injured. Correct from
this day forth by ensuring that animals have enough space to turn around freely and make normal postural adjustments.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.137(d)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
An adult male skunk (tag #2288) was consigned and contained in a wire cage that had a wire floor and no solid bottom or
tray beneath.

An adult coati (tag #2430) was consigned and contained in a wire cage that had a wire floor and no solid bottom.
Animals contained in enclosures without solid bottoms may come into contact with insanitary flooring, discarded food, and
urine or waste. Animals in enclosures without solid bottoms may also contaminate nearby animals, which may result in
the spread of diseases or parasites.
Correct by 2/7/22 by ensuring that primary enclosures used to transport live animals have solid bottoms to prevent
leakage during shipment.
3.36(a)(5) Repeat

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
One white, black, and brown female guinea pig (tag# 2332) was consigned in a hard plastic tote that did not have
ventilation openings on any of the sides.
Four adult female guinea pigs (tag #2405) were contained in a hard plastic tote that did not have ventilation on any of the
sides.
Animals without adequate airflow during transportation may suffer from stress, difficulty breathing, or may overheat.
Transport containers must be adequately ventilated so that animals have adequate air flow for breathing and maintaining
body temperature during transport.
Correct by ensuring that travel containers are adequately ventilated in accordance with 3.36(a)(5).
