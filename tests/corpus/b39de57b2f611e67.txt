HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
2.131 (d)(2)
The facility is providing buckets of feed pellets for the public to purchase in order to feed to the animals, both in the
walk-through petting zoo area and in the drive-though park. One of the facility employees, when questioned to
specify for which animals these pellets were intended for food, stated that generally it was allowed for any animals
other than the large cats - this includes deer, elk, large birds, and buffalo. In the drive-through park, there are not
attendants readily available to observe these interactions between the public and the animals on exhibit. This is a
hazard for both the animals and the public, as unsupervised interactions may pose a risk to animals' health as well
as unnecessary risks of injury to both animals and the public. The licensee shall prohibit the public from feeding
animals or having any interaction with the animals without the availability of a knowledgeable attendant.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS DAY FORWARD.
This routine inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility respresentative.
