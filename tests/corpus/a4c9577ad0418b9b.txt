3.137(a)(1)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The following animals were transported by the licensee to an auction in transport crates that were not strong enough to
withstand the normal rigors of transportation:
*2 adult African crested porcupines (#945), and 2 adult African crested porcupines (#943) were contained in wire cages.
The top panel of cage #945 was bent inwards. The top panel of cage #943 was bent inwards causing the top panel to
have no contact with the top edge of the back panel of the cage. 90% of the front door and the front third of the floor of
cage #943 was rusted.
*1 adult male and 1 adult female sugar glider (#946), and 1 adult male sugar glider (tag #947), were contained in cages
constructed of thin metal wire. Approximately 30% of the wire on the sides and bottom of the cages was rusted.
Animals in transport may be injured or killed if cages or carriers are not of adequate construction and strength to endure
the rigors of transport. Rusted and bent cages may be weak and unable to withstand the normal rigors of transport.
Correct from this day forth (December 2, 2021) by transporting animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA
transportation standards.
3.137(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.


The licensee transported 2 adult African crested porcupines (#943) to the auction in a wire enclosure that did not have
handles.
Personnel handling cages or crates of animals may be injured if handles are not available, causing the personnel to come
into contact with animals during movement and handling of cages/crates. Animals may be stressed or injured if cages are
tipped or dropped during transport due to lack of handles.
Correct from this day forth (December 2, 2021) by transporting animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA
transportation standards.
3.137(d)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The licensee transported 2 adult African crested porcupines (#943) to an auction in a metal wire cage that did not have a
solid bottom. The floor of the cage was made of wire and there was no tray or other solid surface below.
Travel crates must have solid bottoms or trays to prevent the spillage of fluids, waste, or soiled bedding when crates are
stacked on top of each other. Travel crates with solid floors must have absorbent bedding to prevent the animals within
from becoming soiled by their own waste. Animals who become soiled with fluids or waste may become cold or stressed,
or may be exposed to diseases carried by other animals above them.
Correct from this day forth (December 2, 2021) by ensuring that primary enclosures used for transport have solid bottoms,
and that transport enclosures with solid floors have a safe and suitable absorbent bedding in sufficient quantity to absorb
and cover excreta.
3.137(e)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The following animals were transported by the licensee to an auction in enclosures that were not marked on the top and
one or more sides with the words “Live Animal” or “Wild Animal”:


*2 sugar gliders(1 male, 1 female, #946) in a wire cage
*1 adult male sugar glider (#947) in a wire cage
*3 adult Patagonia cavy’s contained individually in 3 plastic hard-sided crates (#950, 951, 952)
*1 juvenile Patagonian cavy (#948)
*2 adult African crested porcupines contained in a wire crate (#945)
*2 adult African crested porcupines contained in a wire crate (#943)
“Live animal” signage, with directional arrows, protects animals in transport cages/crates by identifying the contents of the
carrier as living animals and alerting personnel to the correct upright orientation of the cage or crate.
Correct from this day forth (Dec 2, 2021) by transporting animals in enclosures that are labelled with the words “live
animal” in letters not less than 1 inch in height, with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the
container.
