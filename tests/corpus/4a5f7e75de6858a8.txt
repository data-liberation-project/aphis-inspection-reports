2.126(a)(4)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee did not disclose the acquisition of a woodchuck and fennec fox that were housed inside her residence and
were used for exhibition. On the licensee’s business Facebook page, a posting dated 7-21-21 indicated the facility added
a fennec fox who was already traveling for exhibition. Two additional Facebook postings, 11-20-20 and 2-2-21, showed
the woodchuck at the facility. Both animals were acquired before the routine inspection of the facility on 8-24-21. At the
conclusion of each inspection, the licensee was asked if any other animals were present at the facility. The licensee
indicated there were no other animals. Failure to allow inspections of all animals, their enclosures, diets, etc., does not
ensure compliance with the regulations and standards. Each exhibitor shall allow APHIS officials to inspect all animals
necessary to enforce provisions of the Act.
Correct from this day forward.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
The licensee stated two raccoons at the facility escaped after an employee failed to properly close the entrance door to
their enclosure. The licensee also stated the raccoons escaped through the perimeter fence and were never recovered.
The facility is surrounded by wooded areas on three sides and is located on a busy roadway. The escaped animals could
be injured or killed by predators, vehicles on the roadway, or other potential hazards. Animals must be handled in a

manner that does not cause trauma, stress, or physical harm.
Correct from this day forward.

The licensee stated a fennec fox escaped from the inside of the house into the garage. She then stated the animal
escaped from the garage, ran onto the busy roadway in front of the facility, and was struck by a car. The fennec fox died
because of its injuries. Animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause physical harm.
Correct from this day forward.
3.127(b) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
As reported by a Boone County, Illinois Official, a capybara at the facility was found dead in an outside enclosure. On the
previous two inspections, the capybara was housed in the outdoor enclosure with a wooden shelter consisting of a roof,
rear and side walls. The shelter alone would not have been adequate to protect the capybara from the low temperatures
observed in the area when the animal was discovered dead (nightly lows from 25F to -3F as per NOAA). Adequate
shelter appropriate to the local climactic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept
outdoors to afford them protection.
Correct from this day forward

As reported by a Boone County, Illinois Official, two newborn Patagonian cavies were found dead in an enclosed porch at
the facility. The enclosed porch is not equipped with climate controls. The enclosed porch alone would not have been
adequate to protect the animals from the temperatures on the day the animals were discovered dead (Boone County
Official reported the temperature as 3F while at the facility). Adequate shelter appropriate to the local climactic conditions

for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection.
Correct from this day forward
3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence failed to contain two raccoons after escaping from their enclosure. The animals were never
recovered. The facility is surrounded by wooded areas on three sides and is located on a busy roadway. The escaped
animals could be injured or killed by predators, vehicles on the roadway, or other potential hazards. The perimeter fence
must be constructed so that it acts as a secondary containment system for animals at the facility.
Correct before housing animals in outdoor facilities.

The inspector was not able to contact the licensee to conduct the exit briefing after multiple attempts.
