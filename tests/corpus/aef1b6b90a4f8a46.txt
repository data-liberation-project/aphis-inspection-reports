2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The left front teat of an adult, female Lakeland Terrier (m/c# 95600008501375) named Shawnee was discolored
black, was swollen, and the skin was moist. The licensee had not recognized the problem and no treatment had
been given. Untreated medical conditions can worsen and can be painful. The licensee must have this dog
examined by a veterinarian, must follow the treatment recommendations, and must keep a written medical record.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
None of the unweaned puppies had any form of identification. The licensee is not properly identifying puppies that
are less than 16 weeks old. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for
inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must properly identify puppies with
an acceptable form of identification, which include a cage card (if litters are not comingled), a microchip, a collar and
tag, or a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MAY 11, 2016.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the Elements.
Two shelters in the outdoor facility did not have adequate wind/rain breaks. The shelters were igloo type structures
with offset tunnels for the entrance. However, the dogs had chewed the tunnels to the point that they were not
providing adequate protection from the rain and wind. Wind/rain breaks are necessary so the dogs have a dry place
that is protected from the wind. The licensee must ensure that all shelters have adequate wind/rain breaks.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for Premises.Five enclosures housing a total of six dogs had an excessive amount of tall grass and weeds adjacent to the
enclosure. Tall grass and weeds can harbor pests such as fleas, ticks, and snakes. The licensee must ensure that
grass and weeds are trimmed on all sides of each enclosure.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MAY 11, 2016.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, facility representatives, Cassie Driskill (MDA),
and Nick Meizler (MDA).
