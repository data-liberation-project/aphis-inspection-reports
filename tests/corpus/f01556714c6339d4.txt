ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male gold and white Shih Tzu number 408 has a left eye completely covered by matted hair that is crusted
with a thick, greenish-brown discharge. The right eye appears dry with a discharge covering approximately one
third of the surface. The whites of both eyes are slightly reddened. The licensee stated that the dog has been
diagnosed by her veterinarian as having dry eyes as a result of cherry-eye surgery as a puppy. She said her vet
told her to keep the eyes clean, and the hair around them short. The licensee has not consistently followed her
veterinarian's directions for treating this dog.

Eye problems can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be
uncomfortable or painful to the animal.
The licensee must have the adult Shih Tzu re-evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and
provide the inspector the documentation of this visit upon request.
A bottle of Ivermectin that expired November 2014 was found intermingled with other medications, and is therefore
considered ready for use. The licensee stated she used the Ivermectin within the past week to deworm two puppies.
The inspectors directed her to tell her veterinarian that she used the expired medication on these puppies and get a
recommendation for this situation. Both puppies appeared healthy. The expired bottle was discarded at the time of
the inspection.
Using expired medications can have an adverse or diminished effect, or not treat the condition for which it was
intended.
The licensee must ensure all animals are given proper veterinary care at all times.
