FEEDING.
In a rabbit room there was a small bag of hay that was open, and on a table with a bottle of disinfectant. The bottom
side of the hay bag was wet, possibly with disinfectant.
Storing food in a manner where it could become contaminated could be harmful to the rabbits. All animal food
should be stored and maintained in a manner that protects it from contamination and deterioration.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
