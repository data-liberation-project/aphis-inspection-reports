Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The acquisition information for two ring tailed lemurs was not documented. Complete and accurate records must be kept
in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The
licensee shall make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose all required information concerning all
animals purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his possession or which are transported, sold,
euthanized, or otherwise disposed of. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal.

Handling of animals.
On Saturday, March 19, 2022, per the licensee, he allowed a patron to enter the lemur enclosure unaccompanied for
approximately 5 minutes. The lemurs were free roaming within the enclosure and jumping on the patron and sitting on
their shoulders and/or head during this time. Then, the spouse requested entry as well with their 1-year-old child. The
licensee approved their entry and was standing behind the parent and child, planning to accompany the whole family at
this point. Upon entry of the spouse and child, the lemurs jumped on the child’s head and shoulders. The child was
injured and had a scratch below one eye and another injury to the back of the head that bled. The local sheriff’s office


was notified, who then investigated, and a report was filed. The child was taken to a hospital for treatment. Per the
licensee, he began allowing patrons into the enclosure beginning the previous weekend, but he accompanied them into
the enclosure at those encounters. Neither lemur had a leash on, nor were recall trained for any of these interactions. He
allowed patrons to stand or sit in the enclosure with the lemurs jumping on their shoulders and/or heads. This direct
contact with the animals, in the current manner of public interaction, failed to protect the public from harm and is an
indication that the animals are not trained and are not under direct control. Trained nonhuman primates may be allowed
physical contact with the public, but only if they are under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or
trainer at all times during the direct contact. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk
of harm to the animal and to the public, so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.

Feeding.
The rabbits are currently being fed pellets and hay on the ground which was scattered and mixed in with feces and no
food receptacle present. The rabbits’ feed is placed where the rabbits’ excreta can contaminate the food supplied.
Contamination of feed by excreta can lead to the spread of disease and/or inappetence. All food fed must not be
contaminated with excreta and, if food receptacles are used, they shall be kept clean and sanitized at least once every 2
weeks.
MUST BE CORRECTED BY: April 25, 2022

Watering.
The water receptacle for the rabbits was a plastic bowl on the ground that contained their water but was contaminated
with hay in it. This water bowl is being cleaned with water and sponge only, without any sanitization. Unclean and


unsanitary drinking water can cause illness and disease in the rabbits. All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when
dirty and at least once every 2 weeks.
MUST BE CORRECTED BY: April 25, 2022
3.56(b)(3)

Sanitation.
The primary rabbit enclosure is located on the ground in a pasture and is being cleaned with only water and a sponge as
needed while also moving the entire enclosure to a new area of pasture weekly. The enclosure it not being sanitized
since the water does not reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit and a disinfectant is not being applied. When enclosures are not
sanitized adequately, there is higher risk of large numbers of germs remaining on the surface which creates a health
hazard for the rabbits. Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 degrees F)
and soap or detergent, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective
disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two lemurs are housed in an outdoor enclosure without an adequate perimeter fence surrounding the enclosure.
Currently, there is a fence surrounding the property that is constructed of wooden posts connected with 6 wires with
approximately 10-inch spacing between them running horizontally/lengthwise from post to post with a total height of
approximately 5 feet. Along the backside of the lemur enclosure, the current perimeter fence is approximately 18 inches
away from the primary enclosure. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high and 3 feet from the enclosure is needed
with sufficient wire spacing to prevent unauthorized humans and other animals from going through or under it. Not having
an adequate perimeter fence is a safety risk because other animals and/or people can come in, and there is no secondary


containment. The facility shall ensure the outdoor housing facilities for the lemurs are enclosed by an appropriate
perimeter fence, or a variance, if appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be requested from the Administrator/Regional
Office.

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two areas of the public barrier surrounding the lemurs was not sufficient at providing an adequate barrier. Along one side
of the enclosure, the top rail of the public barrier was missing approximately 2 feet of railing and allowed access closer to
the primary enclosure. Then, along the other side of the enclosure, one corner of the public barrier was only 21 inches
away from the primary enclosure. Members of the public could easily access the side of the primary enclosure at both
deficient areas, which could result in injury to the animals or the public. A sufficient public barrier that is at least 3 feet
away from the primary enclosure of the lemurs shall be in place to ensure the safety of the animals and the public.

3.80(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
The primary enclosures for the lemurs were not constructed and maintained in a way to prevent injury or escape. The
outdoor primary enclosure had sharp points extending out about ¼ inch on the main door to the enclosure where the wire
mesh was attached to the swinging door. The sharp points extended about 1/4 inch beyond the door frame for at least a
distance of 18 inches vertically towards the top of the door frame and the lemurs actively jump and climb on this area.
The indoor night enclosure had an electrical light switch and two electrical outlets within reach of the lemurs. The
enclosure was pushed up against two walls of the building in a corner. The spacing of the wire mesh was large enough to
allow the lemurs’ hands and/or mouths through the mesh to the location of the light switch and both electrical outlets that


were approximately 2 inches away from the enclosure. The indoor primary enclosure had an eye and hook metal latch
with a gap between the door frame and the enclosure of approximately ½ inch. This gap was large enough to allow a
nonhuman primate to lift the latch and escape. The lemurs could become injured by exposure to the sharp points, the
electrical outlets and the switch. They may also become injured or escape their enclosure due to the unsecured latch
presently on their night enclosure. The primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the
non-human primates from injury and/or escape.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
Per the licensee, no environmental enhancement plan has been developed, documented or followed under the direction
of their attending veterinarian. Nonhuman primates are highly social animals whose psychological well-being, to include
socialization, environmental enrichment and special considerations, need to be cared for in order to ensure their overall
well-being. Under the direction of the attending veterinarian, and in accordance with accepted professional standards, the
facility shall develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates.

Feeding.
The food receptacles for the lemurs are hand washed with water and a sponge daily. The food receptacles are not being
sanitized currently. Not sanitizing their food receptacles creates risk for contamination by excreta, pests and/or disease.
Food receptacles must be kept clean and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the following
methods: 1) live steam under pressure, or 2) washing with hot water (at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit) and soap or


detergent, or 3) washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent/disinfectant product that accomplishes the same
purpose, with a thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove organic material first, and then to provide sanitization
followed by a clean water rinse, or as often as necessary to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility currently houses two lemurs which are exhibited in an outdoor enclosure during the day and an indoor
enclosure each night. The enclosures are currently being spot cleaned and when necessary, using only tap water and a
sponge. No live steam, water over 180 degrees Fahrenheit, or disinfectant are currently available for sanitation.
Adequate cleaning and sanitizing of enclosures are necessary to ensure the health of the animals by preventing spread of
disease and contamination. Hard surfaces must be sanitized at regular intervals using live steam under pressure, hot
water over 180 degrees Fahrenheit and soap or detergent, or detergent/disinfectant (after removing organic material first)


followed by a clean water rinse every two weeks or as often as necessary to provide for the health and well-being of the
animals.

Employees.
The employees, which consist of the licensee and a family member, do not have the knowledge, background, or
experience in proper husbandry to care for the two lemurs. Their current diet being fed is not complete and balanced,
there is no environmental enhancement plan in place to ensure the psychological well-being of the lemurs and, he was
allowing interactions with the public without having a plan in place for conducting the interactions or knowing how the
lemurs would react to certain patrons, including children. At least one interaction was allowed by the licensee without an
attendant present that culminated in an injury to a member of the public. When asked what background they have with
lemurs, the licensee said, “the person who sold them to me taught me.” Currently, the lemurs are being fed a diet of only
fruits and vegetables since “the lemurs wouldn’t eat the nonhuman primate biscuits.” The attending veterinarian was
interviewed and stated she did not approve of the diet that is currently being fed and was concerned about the lack of
nonhuman primate biscuits. This lack of adequate knowledge of this species is evident in another citation in this report
whereby the lemurs are being used in interactions with members of the public and allowed to jump on the patrons’
shoulders and heads without any recall training or leashes. A young member of the public was injured in the lemur
enclosure due to the lemurs not being handled appropriately for the interaction. The facility must ensure that their
employees are sufficiently well-trained to adequately care for the animals to ensure their health and safety.
