Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On December 7th, 2022 during the USDA facility inspection, a female baboon was observed to have a round
approximately quarter sized wound located on the on the left heel. The baboon was observed shifting weight between the
right and left feet and lifting the left foot. Upon review of study observation records, the laboratory staff observed bilateral
pressure ulcers on the feet on December 5th and applied Bacitracin.
The laboratory staff did not inform the RAR veterinary staff about the bilateral ischial pressure abrasion until the
scheduled weekly rounds on Wednesday December 7th. After rounds with the laboratory members, a RAR veterinarian
observed the baboon and noted ulceration on both hind feet. The laboratory staff had started a treatment plan of
Bacitracin and pain medication on December 5th. The treatment plan was reviewed by the RAR veterinary staff on
December 7th.
Daily observations may be done by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided there is a mechanism for
direct and frequent communication on problems of animal health and behavior. The mechanism for reporting daily
observations must ensure direct and frequent communication with the Attending Veterinarian to allow for a timely and
accurate diagnosis and treatment of health issues.
Corrected during the time of inspection.


2.38(f) Critical

Miscellaneous.
Procedures under a traumatic brain injury study were conducted on August 26th, 2022 and August 31, 2022. One study
rabbit was euthanized after demonstrating significant neurological deficits. The necropsy revealed an abscess at the
incision site. On September 5, 2022, a veterinary resident noticed dehiscence of the incision for another study rabbit. A
RAR veterinarian identified another study rabbit with an infection at the incision site. All three rabbits were euthanized.
Upon further investigation by the veterinary staff, it was determined that the research staff was not appropriately following
the established aseptic procedures during the surgeries. An IACUC investigation cited inadequate aseptic technique,
inadequate postsurgical monitoring, and not following the established humane endpoint parameters.
Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm.
The research facility did not ensure research staff performed procedures in accordance with the protocol and facility
policies. The research facility must ensure research staff have knowledge of and follow all facility policies and procedures
for conducting research so that study animals are handled in a manner that prevents physical harm or distress.
An appropriate corrective action plan was implemented that included retraining, veterinary oversight, and a new location
for performing the surgery.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and the IO.

This inspection was conducted 12/06/2022 to 12/09/2022.
