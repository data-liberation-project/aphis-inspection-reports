An electric power cord for one heating pad for a mother with puppies was plugged into an outlet and the protecting
cover for the power cord did not extend the length far enough out of the reach of the puppies and mother. Puppies
and adults could chew on the power cord resulting in serious injury to the animal. All electric power cords must be
protected to prevent chewing on them from the animals in the enclosure. Correct by 17 March 2018.
