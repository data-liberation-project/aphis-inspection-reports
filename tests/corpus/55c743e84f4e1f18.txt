2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 on
21-SEP-16.
Attempts to contact the licensee were made by knocking on the door of the house, checking the barns, and calling
the home phone. A voicemail message was left, and after 30 minutes with no contact from the licensee, the
inspector left the premises.
Lack of availability renders the inspection process impossible. The licensee must ensure that a knowledgeable
representative is available for inspection during regular business hours.
