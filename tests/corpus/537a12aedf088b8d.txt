2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female chimpanzee # 1216 has hairloss over her back, head and limbs. The haircoat appears thin/sparse in
coverage and fine in texture where it is present. No lesions/wounds were noted. The staff report that she is getting
vitamins and flaxseed (given to all chimps) for her skin but is not currently on any other medications. Her medical
record at the zoo states that on 10/20/15 she was noted "losing more hair" and the attending veterinarian examined
her on 10/21/15 making a diagnosis of "generalized hypotrichosis/alopecia. No skin lesions." There is no notation of
any diagnostic or treatment plan prescribed for the zoo to follow. She arrived at the zoo on June 23, 2015. Review
of records from the chimp's previous home facility noted that on 4/24/15 "animal appears to have developed
diabetes mellitus. will focus on weight loss to help control" based on an elevated blood glucose. Additional
bloodwork at the previous home facility on 6/10/15 showed an even higher blood glucose and an elevated
fructosamine level. Based on review of facility records available and a conversation with the attending veterinarian,
no additional medical followup has been done at the Chattanooga Zoo regarding the diabetes with the exception of
continuing on her weight loss plan. Endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus can lead to skin issues and
hairloss. In addition, unmonitored and untreated diabetes can lead to other very serious medical consequences
along with discomfort to the chimp. The zoo shall ensure the use of appropriate methods to diagnose, treat and
monitor chimp #1216's hairloss and diabetes and any other related complications.
The attending veterinarian faxed a diagnostic plan for chimp #1216 to the zoo during the inspection.
Previously cited camel #1191 and chimp #1213 have been evaluated by a veterinarian and treated.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
