RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
APHIS Form 7006, Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats. No APHIS 7006 forms documenting the past 12
months animal dispositions/transactions were available for the inspector to review at the time of inspection.
Licensee stated they had stopped using 7006 forms and were recording required information on a computer
software Bill of Sale record. Bill of Sale records provided by the licensee in lieu of APHIS 7006 forms did not
contain required APHIS Form 7006 information regarding broker USDA license numbers, method of animal
delivery, nor driver/shipper information. Documentation for authorized variance from use of APHIS Form 7006 was
not available at the time of inspection.
Incomplete documentation or entry of information on APHIS Form 7006, or use of unapproved forms in lieu of
APHIS Form 7006, do not meet USDA regulatory requirements under 9 CFR 2.75 (a).
Licensees are required to complete APHIS Form 7006 for every applicable dog or cat transaction. All fields on
APHIS Form 7006 must also be completed. No other forms in lieu of APHIS Form 7006 may be used to meet
regulatory requirements unless a written approval for variance has been issued by an authorized APHIS official.
Correct this date forward.
