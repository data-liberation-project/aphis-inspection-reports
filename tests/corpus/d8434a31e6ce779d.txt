OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***An adult male German Shepherd is housed on the northwest corner of the kennel area in an outdoor enclosure.
A medium sized igloo with a short entrance tunnel is the only shelter provided from the elements. This shelter does
not provide adequate protection at the entrance to effectively protect the dog and bedding from wind and rain. All
outside enclosures must be provided with shelters that are provided wind and rain breaks to protect the dog and
bedding from the effects of wind and rain. To be corrected by: 12/19/15

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** An enclosure housing 6 German Shepherd puppies was observed with a heating lamping that had an electrical
cord that had been severely chewed. This exposed electric cord poses an injury or potentially a risk of death to the
puppies in this enclosure. This electrical cord must be rerouted to prevent the contact of the puppies with the cord
to eliminate the risk of cord damage by the puppies. All enclosures must be designed and maintained to reduce the
risks of injury to the dogs contained. To be corrected by: 12/14/15
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the owners by Curt McGruder-ACI.
