SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: In the Hut building the racks with the hamster enclosures and the attached water
hose had excessive accumulations of bedding dust. The wall filter and the ceiling vent in the hamster area also had
an excessive accumulation of bedding dust. Excessive dust may affect the ventilation system and will accumulate
on the animal enclosures and food. The animal racks, water hose, ceiling vents and filters must be cleaned more
frequently to prevent the accumulation of an excessive amount of dust on surfaces to protect the health of the
animals and to promote the efficiency of the ventilation system for the room. Correct by April 7, 2017.
