2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several medications at the facility which are being given to the chimps are extra label medications. Extra label
medications are not prescribed for the species they are being given to. Without the approval of the attending
veterinarian these medications are not considered appropriate veterinary care for the animals at the facility. The
attending veterinarian needs to review these drugs and approve their use as intended on the label for the animals at
the facility.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility owner.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 17, 2016.
