2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals need to receive veterinary care:
**** In building number eight a seven year old fawn colored female Pomeranian (microchip # 101347290) had an
accumulation of brownish-green debris covering her check teeth and molars extending into the gumline. The shape
of the teeth is no longer visible. The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and
tooth structures, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal. These
signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease. The licensee must have this animal examined by a
veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented
and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times.

**** In building number ten an adult female Boston Terrier born June 2013 (microchip #941000016003745) had
bilateral corneal ulcers, but the left eye appeared to be more red and inflamed than the right. Both eyes were
partially cloudy in appearance and the white/sclera of the left eye was more red in color. This could be due to an
injury, infection, allergies, irritation or other medical conditions. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted
nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that this was caused by
scratches when this dog was a puppy and has not been evaluated by a veterinarian since the initial puppy exam.
Eye problems can be painful causing discomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

left paw. The affected area is circular in appearance (estimated size of a pea) and there is some swelling due to
fluid buildup between the toes of the foot. The licensee stated that today was the first time the problem with the foot
had been noticed. Fluid buildup can be painful causing discomfort and it could potentially affect the mobility and
daily activity of the dog. The toes were splayed when the dog was standing in a normal position, which could cause
pain and discomfort to the dog. The licensee must have this dog seen by a veterinarian to determine and obtain an
accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan and document all findings and treatments for the inspectors to
review at the next inspection. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

**** An adult, female fawn colored pug (microchip# 029105586) had cloudy eyes and discharge from both eyes. It
appeared that the entire left and right eyes were grey to blue in color. The left eye appeared more reddened
compared to the right eye. The left eye also contained a central area of debris with hair stuck to the eye. This eye is
reddened and has an area of a mucous-like substance at the top aspect of the eye. The right eye has a thick
mucous-like substance covering the entire cornea. The right eye's bottom eyelid, further away from the nose, the
hair surrounding the eye was crusty and a wet and a sticky discharge was noted. The attending veterinarian had not
been consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. Eye problems can be painful causing
discomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a
veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must
be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.

**** A black, adult female pug (microchip# 4B181A6B08) in building six had opacities and grey to blue colored
eyes. There was also a clear discharge from the animals' eyes. The hair around the eyes was slightly wet, matted,
and crusty. The licensee stated that the animal had dry eye/KCS in both eyes. This animal hadn't ever been seen
by the attending veterinarian, but the licensee stated that he had doctored the eyes on 7-3-14 and documented it,
but no follow up visit or care has occurred since the initial treatment. Eye problems can be painful causing
discomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a
veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation mustbe documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.

2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
**** There are over one hundred young dogs at the facility that did not have official identification on them at time of
the inspection. The licensee is using microchips as the official identification for the adult animals. The licensee
stated that the young dogs are from eight weeks to six months in age and these animals typically are sold at eight
weeks of age. However, the licensee has not been able to sell the puppies and has not used any type of official
identification and is not maintaining these animals with their dams or in litters. Official identification is needed to
ensure that each animal(cid:25)'s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee
must ensure that all dogs have official identification on them at all times.

3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** In the barn there was an open sack of dog feed located on the ground and an open sack of dog feed in a
plastic barrel without a lid. The feed is being fed to over one hundred dogs. All open feed supplies must be stored
in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination or vermin infestation. The nutritive value of the feed could
be affected if it becomes spoiled or contaminated. Spoiled or contaminated feed is not healthy for the dogs to
consume and could lead to health issues. The licensee must keep all open feed supplies in leak proof containers
with tightly fitting lids at all times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**** In building one and building twelve there were several enclosures with puppies and their dams. The legs andfeet of the puppies were observed to be falling through the floors of the enclosures. The licensee stated that he had
just taken out the carpet squares covering the floors the day before the inspection. Flooring that allows feet and legs
to pass through any openings can be stressful and could lead to possible injury. Daily activity and mobility can be
greatly affected (limited) when the dog/puppy appears to be walking on a tight rope or is careful where it places it
foot with the next step. The risk of potential injury to the feet or legs exists if the puppy cannot or has to struggle to
bring its feet or legs back through openings in the flooring. Wire or expanded metal flooring must be small enough
so that no feet or legs can pass through any openings in the flooring.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
**** In buildings six, seven, three, and two roach-like insects were observed throughout the facility. In building
seven a roach-like insect was seen inside a puppy's food receptacle. The roach-like insects were observed on the
walls, floor, sinks, wash downs, and a sealed food barrel as well as in the dogs'(cid:25) enclosures. There were a number
of dead roach-like insects inside the buildings as well. The licensee stated that he had put chemicals in the buildings
for pest control. Lack of an effective program that controls pests can create unsanitary conditions and lead to the
potential spread of disease. The licensee must establish a more effective program of pest control to reduce or
eliminate the population of roach-like insects in the entire facility.
