2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There is no documentation of the number of rabbits held for breeding or currently on premises. The cage cards currently
being used may have the rabbits name but many do not keep an accurate count of the number of bunnies born to each
doe and their disposition and there are no other records documenting this information,. The dealer shall make, keep and
maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information concerning the animals acquisition, offspring
born, and their disposition.
3.53(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
There are several enclosures that have rusty corroded and broken wire on the sides and flooring. The structural strength
of these enclosures is compromised leaving broken wire, holes and sharp points that may allow the rabbits to become
injured or possibly escape. The enclosures must be repaired or replaced to protect the rabbits from injury and to maintain
them securely within.
3.54(b) Repeat

Feeding.
There are several metal feeders attached to the enclosures that have severe rust and corrosion leaving jagged edges.
Rust and corrosion inhibit proper sanitization. Improper or inefficient sanitization increases the risk of feed contamination


and disease hazard which may cause illness. These feeders shall be repaired or replaced to provide for the well being of
the rabbits.
3.56(b)

Sanitation.
The vinyl/rubber mats in some of the enclosures with the rabbits have excreta build up that has dried on the surfaces and
between the mats and wire flooring. The mats are currently being cleaned by periodic brushing but require additional
means of cleaning to remove the remaining excreta and allow proper sanitation. There is a brick in one of the enclosures
that has a brown wet substance accumulating in the holes and grooves which appears to be excreta. The white PVC
water lines running through the length of the enclosures have accumulated brown sticky waste material. Improper
sanitation increases the risk of bacterial growth and other disease hazard that may lead to illness.

All items in the enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis to prevent accumulations and allow
sanitization. Correct by March 1, 2022.
