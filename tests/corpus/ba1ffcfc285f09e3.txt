Sanitation.
In the outdoor pen containing the four goats and three sheep, there are four piles of composting feces. Three of the piles
were approximately three to four feet in diameter and at least one foot tall. Feces can harbor disease and produce odors.
Remove the composting feces and ensure the pen is maintained to prevent excessive accumulations of feces.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license.
