ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** A white wolf was observed limping, carrying its left front limb, while in its primary enclosure. The animal was not
utilizing the limb but would rest it only when it sat down. The owners stated that they noticed it limping in the
morning. It was about 2:00 pm when I observed the behavior and the owners had not consulted the veterinarian
about the animals condition.The owner must consult their attending veterinarian on health concerns of the animals
in a timely manner in order to provide the proper diagnoses and treatments to ensure good health and well being of
the animals. Correct by November 16, 2015
** The attending veterinarian instructed and documented that the facility should be treating the wolves monthly with
ivermectin for heartworm prevention. The facility only documented that they treated the animals in March, July and
September. The facility needs to follow the prevention plan provided by the attending veterinarian to ensure the
animals health and well-being. Correct by November 16, 2015.
** A female bison was examined by the attending veterinarian September 22, 2015 for a wound located bilaterally in
the under arm area (auxiliary). He instructed the facility to treat with a topical antiseptic and fly repellent. The facility
was treating it with vetericyn and watching it. The veterinarian also instructed them to contact him if it doesn't get
better. During the inspection the wound appeared fresh and wet with a bright red color. The animals was actively
licking the wound as well. The facility had not followed up with the attending veterinarian about the condition not
resolving. This animal needs to be reexamined to access the current condition of the animal and to reevaluate
treatment options more appropriate for the matter. The owner must consult their attending veterinarian on health
concerns of the animals in a timely manner in order to provide the proper diagnoses and treatments to ensure good
health and well being of the animals. Correct by November 16, 2015.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In "Simon" the bonnet macaque and "Pamela" the spider monkey's night houses there was old feces, dirt and
debris in the rear of it and had not been spot-cleaned daily. Hard surfaces in which nonhuman primates come in
contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the primary enclosure containing the lions, the entire backside of the enclosure is covered in foliage and vines
that can affect the overall structural integrity of the enclosure and conceal any structural concerns that may be
present. All areas of the enclosure shall be able to be visualized to ensure the enclosure is in good repair. The
excessive vegetation growth should be removed. The primary enclosure fence needs to be maintained to ensure
that the fencing is appropriate to contain the animals and is in good repair.
** In the calves primary enclosure there was a large metal screw that was protruding from the front of shelter. There
is potential for the calves to injure themselves on the exposed screw. The shelter shall be maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury.
** Around the black bears primary enclosure there are posts stabilizing the fencing horizontally that needs repairing
and replacing. There is potential for the fencing to come down allowing the animals to escape. The post shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
**On the backside of the grizzly bears enclosure there was a hole at the bottom of the fencing. There was a piece of
fencing added on top previously to temporarily repair the hole but it is peeling up and exposing the hole again. The
primary enclosure fencing needs to be maintained to ensure that the fencing is appropriate to contain the animals
and is in good repair.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the grizzly bears enclosure the dog food that is being fed to them ends up on the ground when the bears flip
their feeders. From day to day the excess food accumulates on the ground and is never cleaned up. The leftover
food on the ground is attracting flies and has an odor. Food waste needs to be properly disposed of to minimize
vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards. Correct by November 16, 2015.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
** The top of the lions enclosure was covered in decomposing old leaves and debris. The top of the sheet metal roof
could not be observed and could potentially degrade the roof causing it to be in disrepair. Please keep the roof of
the enclosure cleaned and free of old leaves and debris. ** In the calves enclosure there were several shreds of pieces of plastic on the ground and it needs to be removed.
The animals could potentially ingest the materials and it needs to be removed for the health and well-being of the
animals.
