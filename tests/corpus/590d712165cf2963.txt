Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures housing Ring Tailed lemurs and Tufted capuchins have several cobwebs encompassing dead insects along
the perimeters of the primary enclosures. The span of the cobwebs suggest they’ve remained uninterrupted for months,
amidst husbandry practices performed at the facility. Failure to clean all areas of the primate enclosures enable grounds
for bugs, insects, and other pests to thrive within the housing areas. Premises where housing facilities are located,
including building and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the husbandry practices in
this subpart to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, pests, and vermin.

Facilities, general.
Two coin-operated vending machines contained pelleted feed that was caked and beginning to deteriorate. Though the
facility stated both machines are out of order, the food receptacles remain on exhibit with the aged feed.
Dirty food storage areas can lead to contamination of food supplies for animals, resulting in digestive issues and other
health concerns, in addition to reduced palatability and nutritional value. The licensee must ensure that supplies of food


are stored in a manner that adequately protects against deterioration, contamination, or molding.
