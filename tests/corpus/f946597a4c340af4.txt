FEEDING.
Three plastic containers in the bat food refrigerator are not labeled with the current contents. Foods stored in
containers other than the original, and not properly labeled, cannot be readily identified as to type and freshness.
Food for animals must be wholesome and free from contamination.
This was corrected on the day of inspection by labeling the containers.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
