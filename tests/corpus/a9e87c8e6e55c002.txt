INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A non-survival procedure on a pig was being performed in a lab area at time of inspection. The following
items/conditions were noted in the laboratory area while the procedure was in progress: an active HVAC vent was
blowing directly toward the surgery table; there was unorganized clutter present, including two cardboard boxes,
un-used monitors and equipment, among other stacked items on a table within 4 feet of the procedure site; a sink
with a build -up of dirt, debris, and clutter was present; the door entering into the lab space was unsecured.
It was noted there was only one lab member present with the pig while the procedure was in progress. According to
the lab personnel, an additional lab member had just stepped out and was due back. According to a facility
representative from the Division of Lab Animal Medicine (DLAM), they were not aware or informed that a procedure
was in progress. The corresponding approved protocol lists at least 2 lab members that are qualified to assist the
anesthesiologist and surgeon during survival and non-survival procedures, and should have been made available
as relief personnel.
Non-survival procedures must be performed in accordance with established veterinary medical and nursing
practices.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least 2 Yucatan pig enclosures, the metal, drain covers in the floor were in disrepair and had openings which
were wide enough to allow a hoof to potentially get caught and lead to animal injury. Enclosures for all animals
should be constructed in a manner that is appropriate and safe for the animals involved and should regularly be
maintained so as to protect the animals from injury and to ensure their health and well-being.
