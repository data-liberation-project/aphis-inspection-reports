ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 on
31-JUL-18.
The licensee has delegated many of the kennel responsibilities to a partner, who was unavailable at the time of
inspection. New optimal hours and alternative contact methods were discussed to allow for both partners to be
present during the next inspection.
