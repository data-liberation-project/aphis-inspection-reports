FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing on the south and southeast side of the elk and white-tailed deer pens are in disrepair. Two sections of
the cyclone fencing (each section approximately eight feet wide) on the elk pen have a gap beneath them
measuring approximately five inches. One section of cyclone fencing (approximately eight feet wide) on the deer
pen has a gap beneath it measuring approximately four inches. The bottoms of these three fence sections can be
pulled approximately one and a half feet away from the pens.
The gaps and the ability to move the bottoms of these fences could potentially allow wild animals and unauthorized
persons into the elk and deer pens.
Repair or replace the affected sections of fence.
