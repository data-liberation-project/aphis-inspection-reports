FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***** At time of inspection the metal posts and frames of the enclosures to the wallaroos, kangaroos, zebras on the
hill behind the shop and the camel pen located to the north of the residence had not had a rust inhibitor or paint
applied to help in slowing or stopping the rusting process. This rusting process if left unchecked will lead to the
eventual structural failure of these frameworks and posts. These surfaces need to be kept in good repair to prevent
structural failure.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***** The facility is made up of various enclosures constructed with pipe, metal posts and 8 foot tall high tensile
game fence.
These enclosures house various numbers of kangaroos, wallaroos, zebra, camels and blackbuck antelope. While
these pens are of quality construction the enclosures and facility do not have a secondary perimeter fence of at
least six feet in height located three feet or more from the primary enclosures. The fence must be constructed so
that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and persons from going through it or under it and
having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment for the animals
in the facility.
This has been discussed with the licensee and the inspector in the past and during the inspection of this date.
Unless approval in writing from the Administrator is secured, which would exempt this requirement, then a perimeter
fence will be required. They will need to construct a perimeter fence which will be at least six feet in height and three
feet from the existing enclosure fencing.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 5/13/2016
