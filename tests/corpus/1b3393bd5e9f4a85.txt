2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The notebook containing records of animals on hand is written in pencil. Records need to be indelible so they
cannot readily be altered and so that they remain legible for as long as they are required to be maintained.
Many entries are incomplete; they do not contain all the information required for the buyer and/or seller. It is unclear
as to whether the contact information recorded is for who the animal came from or to whom it went. It is also unclear
whether the "Out" date means that the animal was sold or it died.
There is an APHIS Form 7020 recording the ownership transfer of two "canis lupus" pups which is dated 5/7/15. If
these animals are wolf-dog crosses as stated by the licensee, they are considered dogs and use of the APHIS Form
7006 is required for this purpose. There is no official identification recorded for these animals, and none of the
information for the five wolf-dog crosses is recorded on an APHIS Form 7005 as required in Section 2.75(a)(2).
Maintaining accurate records is required of the licensee so that animals can be tracked to ensure legal and
appropriate transfer of ownership.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Photos of animal encounters on the facility's website and FaceBook page show members of the public in contact
with non-human primates (NHPs) with no restraints on the animals or barriers between the animals and the people.
One photo shows two people in an enclosure with at least 4 ringtail lemurs. Another shows two people interacting
with three NHPs, also with no restraints on the primates. These three NHPs appear to be a black and white colobus,
a spider monkey, and a booted macaque.
The set up of the main habitat where sloth encounters occur has no barriers between the animals and the public.
This enclosure contained twelve animals at the time of inspection. A second encounter room, holding seven animals
at the time of inspection, does have kennel-type enclosures containing the animals, but the doors are not secured to
maintain separation when the attendants are not present to supervise.Exhibiting the animals without proper distance or barriers exposes both the animals and the public to potential for
injury and/or disease transmission. NHPs and people share susceptibility to some of the same diseases. Further, all
macaques are susceptible to and can carry Herpes B virus, which is a minor problem for the animal, but can cause
a fatal encephalitis in people. Members of the general public do not have the training or experience to be in safe
contact with these animals. These interactions could result in harm to either humans or animals, or both.
Correct by exhibiting animals with appropriate distance and/or barriers at all times to protect both the humans and
the animals.
Note: The wolf (versus wolf-dog) encounter situation is under review.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In a discussion regarding the (cid:28)"Sleep With a Sloth(cid:29)" program, where members of the public pay to spend the night
within a sloth enclosure, it was revealed that there is not an attendant present at all times while the participants are
in the enclosures. The licensee stated that attendants check in every hour or so.
Members of the general public do not have the training or experience to be in contact with these animals.These
kinds of unsupervised interactions could result in harm to either humans or animals, or both.
Correct by having appropriately trained and experienced attendants present at all times during public exhibition.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The room in which the two binturongs and one tamandua are held has a very strong odor. Both species normally
have a strong scent, but this odor was due to urine and feces. There is no window or exhaust fan in use to improve
air quality.
Poor air quality can predispose the animals to illness, especially respiratory infections. Poor air quality is corrected
by more frequent cleaning, by increasing ventilation, or both.
Correct within 30 days, by 1/1/2016.
3.131(a)
SANITATION. The floor of the enclosure holding two binturongs is damaged along the edge near the center divider. The
impermeable surface layer has been torn up, exposing the permeable subsurface. That subsurface cannot be
cleaned and sanitized adequately.
Inability to clean and sanitize adequately can allow disease-causing organisms to grow, and also contributes to the
odor in the room. Surfaces must be maintained in good repair to ensure adequate cleaning is possible.

The inspection and the exit briefing was conducted with a licensee.
IES Investigator Sue Orham was present at this inspection.
