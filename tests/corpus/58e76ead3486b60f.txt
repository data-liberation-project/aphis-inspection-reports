HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three enclosures with plastic shelters that are severely chewed and worn. The chewed and worn areas
are mainly along the entrance to the shelters. There is dirt, grime and/or hair stuck to the chewed and worn areas.
There are a total of five dogs in the affected enclosures. Severely chewed and worn surfaces cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All chewed and worn surfaces must be
repaired or replaced so they can be readily cleaned and sanitized.

Cleaning.
There are three enclosures within the outdoor housing facility, containing a total of five dogs, that have an excessive
build-up of snow, feces and/or urine. In two of the three enclosures, the snow, feces and/or urine has become
compacted and covers nearly the entire floor of each enclosure. In one enclosure, containing two golden retrievers,
the feces, snow and/or urine appears moist and the fur on the dogs' feet and legs appears wet, iced and/or soiled
with feces and/or urine. The current temperature according to the inspectors Kestrel is approximately 28 degrees.
According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature for last night was 4 degrees F. Failure to properly
clean and sanitize primary enclosures can lead to health hazards for the animals. Hard surfaces with which the
dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks in order to prevent an
accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are three enclosures within the outdoor housing facility, containing a total of five dogs, that have shelters withno wind and rain breaks. The current temperature according to the inspectors Kestrel is approximately 28 degrees.
According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature for last night was 4 degrees F. Shelters without
wind and rain breaks do not provide the dogs with protection from the elements. All shelters must be provided with a
wind and rain break at the entrance in order to provide the dogs with protection from the elements.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
None of the shelters within the outdoor housing facility contain bedding. The current outside temperature, according
to the inspectors Kestrel, is 28.5 degrees. According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature for last
night was 4 degrees F. There are a total of eleven dogs in the affected enclosures. Failure to provide clean, dry
bedding within dog shelters does not ensure the animals can remain warm and dry during low temperatures which
can lead to health hazards for the animals. Shelters for dogs must contain clean, dry bedding material if the ambient
temperature is below 50 degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F
or lower.
The licensee needs to provide sufficient bedding for all outdoor shelters by 6:00 pm Today, November 18, 2014.

Shelter from the elements.
Within one outdoor enclosure, containing one dog, the shelter is too small for the German shepherd dog located in
that enclosure. When the dog sits next to the shelter, the dogs' head is taller than the top of the shelter. The shelter
is not large enough to allow the dog to sit or stand in a normal manner within the shelter. The current outside
temperature, according to the inspectors Kestrel, is 28.5 degrees. According to the National Weather Service, the
low temperature for last night was 4 degrees F. Proper shelters are required to help animals conserve heat and to
provide for the health and well-being of the animals in extreme temperatures. Outdoor facilities for dogs must
include a shelter that is accessible to each animal, and is large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure
to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.
The owner must provide a proper shelter structure for all dogs by: 6:00 pm Today, November 18, 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is one enclosure within the outdoor housing facility and two enclosures within the indoor housing facility thathave broken wires on the floor of the enclosure. The broken wires create sharp points that protrude up into the
enclosure. In two of the enclosures, the broken wires create holes in the floor that are large enough to allow the
dogs' feet and/or legs to pass through. There are a total of three adult dogs in the affected enclosures. Flooring with
broken wires can lead to animal injury and can make it difficult for the animals to walk. All floors must be repaired or
replaced so they protect the dogs' feet and legs from injury and so they do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through
any openings in the floor.
