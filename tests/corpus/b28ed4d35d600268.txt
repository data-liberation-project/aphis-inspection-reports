2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
**The current program of veterinary care listed dogs, however, had not been updated to include pigs when housed
at the facility. The program of veterinary care should be updated to reflect animals that will be housed at the facility.
Failure to provide an updated written program of veterinary care that accurately reflects the animals to be housed at
the facility does not provide for the adequate veterinary care of the animals. It is the responsibility of the licensee to
have an updated written program of veterinary care that has been reviewed by the attending veterinarian in order to
promote the health and well-being of the animals as set forth in this section.
