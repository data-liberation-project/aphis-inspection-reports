3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The enclosure housing eight guinea pigs contained an excessive accumulation of excreta. The presence of this
waste could increase disease hazards, pests, odors and soiling of the animals. This enclosure needs to be cleaned
and disinfected and maintained on a more regular basis to reduce these risks and ensure the health and well-being
of the animals. Correct by December 9, 2015.
The female Capybara documented under 2.40(b)(2) on the inspection report dated October 1, 2015 has been
addressed.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the owner and Kevin Wilken, ACI.
