ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection, there were 8 non-human primates singly housed at the facility for approximately 1 month
and the facility had not made attempts to socially house those animals. Those animals were not under a veterinary
exemption nor an active IACUC - approved scientific exemption for single housing. The facility must address the
social needs of the non-human primates for their psychological well-being.
