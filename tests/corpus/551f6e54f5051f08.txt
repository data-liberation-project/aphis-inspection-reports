Facilities, outdoor.
***The main enclosure for the goats has no dry surface area accept for what is provided inside of the barn. There has
been extensive rain in the area but it is not raining during todays inspection. The dirt in the center of the enclosure is not
mounded resulting in the water creating a mud pit. The enclosure has rubber mats about 3 ft in width surrounding the
center ground and lining the fence line. These mats are uneven and pocketed resulting in large puddles of water that
cannot drain. The drainage in this enclosure is not sufficient to allow the rapid removal of excess water resulting in a
muddy enclosure. Subjecting the goats to continuous mud and standing water may lead to poor health including
infections and lameness. Adequate drainage must be provided to prevent accumulations of water and protect the goats
from disease and injury hazards. Correct by February 10, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Owner.
