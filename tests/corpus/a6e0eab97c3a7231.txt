2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A tri-color adult guinea pig in Pen 108 was observed with a head tilt
to the left. The guinea pig was in good body condition and did not appear lethargic. The licensee had not observed the
head tilt, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was not administering any treatments. The Program of
Veterinary Care addressed the condition and provided treatment options.
Head tilts can cause discomfort or distress and, if caused by an infection, can worsen and spread to other parts of the
body and result in other health issues.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to
evaluate the animal and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
