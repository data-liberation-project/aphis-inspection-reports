Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available during this inspection. Approximately 258 adult guinea pigs, weanlings,
and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records maintained since April 2022. Failure
to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal losses by
decreased number of guinea pigs born or raised. The licensee must maintain these records containing the required
information for animals which disloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births
and deaths. Correct by August 1, 2022.

Primary enclosures.
An enclosure on the floor housing approximately 70 weanling guinea pigs has unsealed wooden surfaces. Unsealed wood
cannot be adequately cleaned or properly sanitized, retains odors, and allows the absorption of liquids and moisture. In
addition, unsealed wood can increase the risk of disease to the guinea pigs housed within. Correct by sealing wood
surfaces or covering wood surfaces with an impervious surface. Correct by August 6, 2022.
3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.

Space. Insufficient space was being to provided to guinea pigs in the following enclosures:

Twelve enclosures along the left wall measure 32 inches by 24 inches or 768 square inches of floor space. These 12
enclosures were housing either 10 adult guinea pigs with offspring or had 17 or more weanlings present. Maximum
number of guinea pigs in this size enclosure is 7 adults or 12 weanlings.

An enclosure on the floor housing approximately 70 weanlings measures 65 inches by 42 inches or 2730 square inches of
floor space. Maximum number of guinea pigs in this size enclosure is 45 weanlings.

Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, and can increase aggression in animals which can result in ear
chewing and other injuries from fighting. Weanlings guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60 square
inches of floor space each. Weanlings weighing over 350 grams and adult guinea pigs require at least 101 square inches
of floor space. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per
animal to prevent unnecessary stress, discomfort, and aggression. Correct by August 5, 2022.
