Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At time of inspection the following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:

A tri-colored (brindle, tan, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #36 housing 9 adults and 1 newborn was observed
with hair loss over the right lower back and rump that was approximately 2 inches in diameter. The underlying skin was
red, irritated, and had actively draining lesions and scabs. There was another area of hair loss on the left medial lower
back that was approximately 1 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.

A tri-colored (brown, tan, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #56 housing 8 adults and 1 newborn was observed
with hair loss on over both sides of the lower back and rump. The right area was approximately 2 inches in diameter. The
underlying skin was red and thickened with multiple areas of lesions and crusts. On the left side, there were two areas of
hair loss. The anterior area was approximately 1/2 of an inch in diameter and the posterior area was approximately 1.5
inches in diameter. The underlying skin was red and thickened with multiple areas of lesions and crusts.

A tri-colored (tan, black, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #57 housing 10 adults and 10 newborns was observed
with extensive hair loss on the lower back and rump that was approximately 5 inches in length that encircled the back.

The underlying skin was red and thickened with actively draining lesions with red discharge and crusts. There was one
area on the left lower back with thick, white, actively draining discharge.

A white adult female guinea pig in enclosure #5 housing 11 adults and 14 newborns was observed with moderate
generalized hair thinning on both sides of the lower back. The underlying skin was crusty.

A tri-colored (reddish brown, brown, white) adult male guinea pig in enclosure #16 housing 10 adults and 15 newborns
was observed with severe hair loss on the left lower back that was approximately 3 inches in diameter. The underlying
skin was thickened with open, draining wounds. Toward the middle of the back, the underlying skin was crusty with scabs
present. The animal was observed continuing to bite at the affected areas.

A tri-colored (brindle, tan, white) adult female guinea pig in enclosure #22 housing 7 adults and 3 newborns was observed
with a cloudy and dull left eye that was much smaller than the right eye with thick, white ocular discharge.

One newborn was found dead in enclosure #4. The lower half of its body had been cannibalized.

Two recent newborns were found dead in enclosure #28.

There were no records to determine if these animals with hair loss, crusty skin, and/or with scabs were observed prior to
this inspection. There were no treatment records or medications present to treat these animals. The program of veterinary
care mentions bacterial skin infections. For treatment, it states "[s]eparate animals as soon as possible. If superficial,
topical neosporin. If severe, consult a veterinarian."


A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of
care provided to animals and can prolong animal health problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their
health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.

These 6 guinea pigs with veterinary conditions identified above require examination by a veterinarian to prevent
worsening of the conditions and unnecessary suffering. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such
examination and treatment to APHIS officials upon request. Remains uncorrected.
3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The bottom of the wire divider was broken that was separating enclosure #42 housing 6 adults and 3 newborns and #47
housing 7 adults and 7 newborns. There was an approximately 2 inches in height and 4 foot long gap with protruding
ends. Newborns were observed going between the two enclosures.

Housing facilities need to protect the guinea pigs from injury and contain the animals securely. Failure to do so can lead to
injuries. Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures are properly maintained. Remains uncorrected.
3.25(c) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Storage. The entrance door was blocked by loose hay scattered all over the floor. To the right of the door, there were
empty bags of feed stored on a pallet containing food and shavings.


Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in areas that protect supplies against spoilage, deterioration, and
contamination from insects or rodents. Loose hay and spilled feed can attract insects and rodents. The licensee must
ensure that the food storage area is kept clean to prevent contamination of the feed by insects and vermin. Remains
uncorrected.
3.28(c)(1)(iii) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided to guinea pigs housed in the following enclosures:

Brown enclosure #2 housing 39 weanlings measures 62 inches by 24 inches or 1488 square inches of floor space. The
maximum number of weanling guinea pigs in this size space is 24.

Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches of floor space each. Weanlings
weighing over 350 grams and adults require at least 101 square inches of floor space each. Inadequate space can cause
stress, overcrowding, and aggression in animals. The licensee must ensure guinea pigs are provided at least the
minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary stress, discomfort, or aggression. Remains
uncorrected.
3.30 Repeat

Watering.
The rack of enclosures numbers 48-52 housing a total of 36 adult guinea pigs and 34 newborns had accumulations of
dirty, wet bedding, fecal material and debris on the sides of the wire surfaces surrounding the PVC drainpipe for the water
nipples.


Water bottles and water nipples must be sanitized when dirty so that potable water is provided to guinea pigs to protect
their health and well-being. In addition, water receptacles must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Failure to do
so can increase the risk of disease as well as possible avoidance of water. The licensee must ensure that guinea pigs
have access to potable water, have clean water receptacles, and that water receptacles are sanitized at least once every
2 weeks. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
