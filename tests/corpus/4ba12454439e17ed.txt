minimize contamination by excreta. All food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times to minimize
contamination.

SANITATION.
The refrigerator that contains fresh fruits and vegetables for the Coati-mundi, kinkajou, and Prairie Dogs has a thick
brown layered material on the bottom part of the refrigerator with dirt, debris, and food particles. Throughout the
refrigerator there is the same brownish material on the storage shelves and inside of the top freezer shelf of the
refrigerator. Lack of proper husbandry practices in the food storage area could possibly lead to disease hazards
and contamination of the food. Premises shall be kept clean and clear to protect the health of the animals.
