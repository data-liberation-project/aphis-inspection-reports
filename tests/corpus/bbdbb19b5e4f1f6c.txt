3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Along the back north side and the west side of the sheltered building, the lower edges of the structure is rusted in
multiple areas. The material has flaked away to form holes and rough edges all along the wall. These areas are
below the indoor/outdoor access doors and along the adjoining walls. Material that has rusted to this degree cannot
be adequately cleaned, and flaking of the rusted metal may result in sharp points and edges which are a potential
source of injury to the enclosed animals. These rusted areas need to be repaired or replaced, and properly
maintained in the future.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
