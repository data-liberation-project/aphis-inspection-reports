2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the previous inspection on May 16, 2017, eight guinea pigs were identified in need of veterinary care. At that
time two two juvenile guinea pigs were unable to rise, breathing rapid & shallow. They were intermittently twitching
or paddling their feet. Licensee called the attending veterinarian (AV) requesting an emergency visit so these two
guinea pigs could be humanely euthanized. The AV did not arrive that day or the next. The two juvenile guinea
pigs did not receive any supportive care and eventually died. These guinea pigs experienced prolonged suffering.
Licensee must establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the availability of
emergency care.
Remains Uncorrected
The remaining six guinea pigs were not examined by the attending veterinarian but are are being treated as directed
via phone discussion with the AV
