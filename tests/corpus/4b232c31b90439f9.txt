The licensee was not aware that the right ear of a 5 yr old golden retriever with chip ID # 000016908338 was filled
with a dark waxy substance. This dog also had thick deposits of tarter on her back teeth that had not been
documented as having been observed. An adequate care program requires daily observation of all animals and
timely effective communication with the attending veterinarian.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Arriving at the facility, one dog was seen digging at the front fence of the enclosure. The dog, a male golden
retriever with chip ID # 941000016908338, dug his way out and spent approximately 20 minutes running free in the
yard. The licensee was not home initially. Once the licensee arrived, the dog was caught and returned to the pen.
There was a large hole dug under the fence which has also weakened the fence posts. The licensee filled in the
hole during the inspection. The licensee stated that the dog had also been out last night and that he hole had also
been filled back in then.
Running loose puts the dog at risk of severe injury. Ensure all dogs are securely contained. To be corrected
immediately.
