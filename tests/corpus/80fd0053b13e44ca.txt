2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
No formal arrangements with an attending veterinarian could be produced during the inspection. Without formal
arrangements with a veterinarian, there is no way to ensure that animals receive adequate medical care or that a
veterinarian has appropriate authority to oversee or treat animals at the facility.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An Aardvark in the interactive room is missing the tip of its tail. A purple coloration on the tail was a spray that the licensee
used to attempt to prevent infection. The attending veterinarian had not been notified of the problem and therefore could
not diagnose or treat it. Without adequate and proper medical care, injuries can become infected, further negatively
affecting the animal and putting it at risk of more serious medical conditions.

A young giraffe died recently at this facility. According to the licensee it died of a “twisted gut”. There were no medical

records available for review to confirm this diagnosis. The attending veterinarian was unable to be contacted for
confirmation because his/her information was never provided by the licensee.

A pygmy hippo was recently acquired by the licensee and died shortly after acquisition. When asked if the attending
veterinarian was contacted about the animal before or after it’s death, the licensee said no.

When animals die acutely and suspiciously, as seems to be the case with the giraffe and the hippo, the veterinarian
should be notified. The veterinarian is responsible for ensuring the animals receive adequate veterinary care.
Determining the cause of death can be important for the health of other animals at the facility.

Acquisition and disposition records are required so that animals being used in regulated activities can be accurately
tracked to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation. Animals transferred to or acquired from
other licensees must have disposition and acquisition records containing all information required by the Animal Welfare
Act Regulations available for inspection. This requirement applies to all regulated animals purchased or otherwise

acquired, owned, held, leased or otherwise in possession of or under control of the licensee, and all regulated animals
transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring
born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

animals when they have contact with customers. There is a risk of direct injury to both the public and the animals in the
interaction area. Animals must be under the direct control at all times during interactive sessions.
