Facilities, outdoor.
The primary enclosure containing 50 macropods on the Eastern wall has about three sections where the perimeter fence
is the primary enclosure fence. In a second enclosure housing a muntjac on that same Eastern wall two areas of the
perimeter fence were also part of the primary enclosure fence. Perimeter fences that are not of sufficient distance from
the outside of the primary enclosure cannot prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals
or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be
approved in writing by the Administrator. The facility does not have a variance for either enclosure. The perimeter fence
must also function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
Corrected during time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility representative.
