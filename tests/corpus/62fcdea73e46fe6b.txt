2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male apricot poodle id # 11 was heavily matted along his back, down his legs and under his belly. A female cavalier
(Lilly) had matted fur at the base of her ears. A female cavapoo (Lassie) had matted fur along her rear legs and under her
tail.
Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing skin irritations which can be painful. In addition, matted fur no longer
functions to insulate the dog from the elements. These dogs need to be trimmed on a regular basis prior to this degree of
matting for their comfort and wellbeing.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Twenty-six puppies were sold last September 5, 2022, and there was no information completed in block 4 of the records
of disposition form identifying the buyer of the puppies, nor was there any information completed in blocks 5-8 identifying
how the dogs were transported. This information is important to be able to track the movement of puppies and should be
recorded in a timely and accurate manner for recordkeeping purposes.
