Outdoor housing facilities.
The fenced yard holding four golden retrievers with a shed for a shelter building, does not have an additional area of
shade being provided to protect the dogs from the direct rays of the sun. While the dogs are able to crawl under the
shelter, the space does not allow for the animals to stand, sit and turn around freely. There is a large tree on the perimeter
of the fence on one side, however this is not reliable year around when the leaves fall, or at certain times of the day as the
sun moves changing the direction of the shade available.

It is important for there to be other options of consistent shade available to protect the animals from over heating from the
direct rays of the sun. A shelter building that is not temperature regulated can be too hot for the regulated animals as an
only source to avoid the sun.

The licensee must provide in addition to the shelter structure, one or more separate outside areas of shade large enough
to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun.

This inspection was an announced site approval inspection. This site is not ready for approval to conduct activity covered
under your current Animal Welfare Act License.

Conducting regulated activities at a non-approved site is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Please contact your
inspector to schedule your next new site approval inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
