CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
The facility is currently housing six rabbits in with one animal of another species. At time of inspection, there was an
attendant present in the primary closure with the animals.
Housing rabbits with other species may affect their health and well-being and increase their risk of injury.
The facility should ensure the rabbits are not housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species.
