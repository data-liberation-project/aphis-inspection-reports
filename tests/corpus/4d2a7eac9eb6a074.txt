2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This facility is selling camels without a USDA license. This is in violation of Section 2.1. Selling of exotic species
without a USDA license does not adequately protect those animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act nor allow
oversight of those sales including tracking of these animals, which is especially important in the event of a disease
outbreak.
An application packet was sent to this facility along with a copy of this report.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
