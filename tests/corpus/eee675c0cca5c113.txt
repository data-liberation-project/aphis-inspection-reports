ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:35 pm on
12-Mar-20.
No one was present at the home site even though the submitted itinerary stated that they would be at this location.
I called a facility representative who said that the animals were in travel status.
