2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During a review of acquisition and disposition records, the following deficiencies were noted:
- For striped skunks, the licensee had birth, death, and sales records that resulted in a current inventory of 24 skunks.
However, during inspection, only 21 skunks were observed, resulting in 3 skunks being unaccounted for.

- For Patagonian cavies, the licensee had birth, death, and sales records that resulted in a current inventory of 3
Patagonian cavies. However, during inspection, only 1 Patagonian cavy was observed. The licensee had a note that two
cavies had passed but there was no record of the date, only an estimation of March 2020.

- All of the facility's guinea pigs and several of the rabbits were transferred to the retail pet store where the licensee works.
There are no records documenting the dates or number of animals transferred.

Animal exhibitors are required to make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the animals
acquired, including births, and animals disposed of, including deaths. These records must include dates of all such
acquisitions and dispositions.



Failure to maintain these records can inhibit disease traceback investigations, accounting for animals for health purposes,
or establishing proof of ownership. Correct by including all required information on acquisition and disposition records,
including births and deaths.
3.56(b)(1)

Sanitation.
During the inspection, the licensee stated that she is not sanitizing the rabbit enclosures, only spot cleaning as needed.

Rabbit enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 30 days by using one of the following methods:
- Washing with hot water (180°F) and soap or detergent, OR
- Washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, OR
- By cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame

Failure to sanitize the rabbit enclosures can lead to disease or other negative health impacts through continued
contamination of enclosures. Correct by sanitizing the rabbit enclosures at least once every 30 days using one of the
methods prescribed above. Correct by June 1, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
