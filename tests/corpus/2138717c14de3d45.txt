ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). However, the written
PVC is incomplete. Under the section "(cid:28)Ectoparasites,"(cid:29) the PVC states (cid:28)"as needed."(cid:29) Under the section for
internal parasites, the PVC states "(cid:28)in feed."(cid:29) There are no types of drugs or methods, dosage, route of
administration, frequency, or concentration listed on the PVC for these routine treatments. In addition, in the section
marked "(cid:28)Euthanasia,"(cid:29) the non-emergency method states "(cid:28)deliver IV,"(cid:29) but no drug or dosage is listed. A clear,
complete PVC is important for proper understanding between the animal caretakers and the attending veterinarian
to ensure medical treatments are administered accurately and with the direction and knowledge of the attending
veterinarian. The licensee must ensure that the PVC be filled in completely and accurately. To be corrected by:
