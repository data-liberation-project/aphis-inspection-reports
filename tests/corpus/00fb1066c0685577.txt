HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A new heater system has been added to the C enclosures housing baboons. Delivery of the heat is thru a metal
pipe that extends into the animal enclosure to the shelter used by the baboons. On 1/19/17, one male baboon
received and was treated for 2nd degree burns to his hands and feet after contacting the heater pipe while the
heater was operating. Additional animals are at risk of injury if they are able to contact the pipe when the heater in
use. The facility has taken corrective action until the heater pipes in all C enclosures can be fitted with protective
barriers to prevent animal contact with the pipe. These actions include regulating heater temperature and time
heater is running to prevent the metal pipe surface from becoming excessively hot. The pipes must be made
inaccessible to the animals when the heater is operating to protect the animals from injury.
