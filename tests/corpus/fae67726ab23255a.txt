Records: Operators of auction sales and brokers.
Item 2.76 a
At the time of inspection, a review of records was performed from 2020 and 2021. Many records of acquisition of dogs
did not contain the complete information required. Multiple records did not contain the vehicle license number and State
and the driver’s license number (photographic identification card for non-drivers issued by the State). In addition, an
official USDA tag or tattoo, the sex of the animal, color of the animal, and method of transportation of the carrier and the
name of the owner of the privately owned vehicle is not recorded. The above information needs to be acquired and
maintained by the licensee for the event of a necessary trace-back.

Correct from this day forward 6/23/2020

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
