MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
Four puppies born on 5/19/16 were sold by the licensee to a USDA licensed dealer on 7/12/16. The puppies would
have been 54 days old on the day of sale which is two days shy of the required 8 weeks of age that they are
required to be before being sold and transported. Dogs younger than 8 weeks of age are more susceptible to
stresses that occur from travelling and being placed into a new facility. Their immune systems are more susceptible
to becoming comprised which could cause them to become sick and even die. The licensee must not sell any more
puppies under 8 weeks of age unless it is directly to the end consumer. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
