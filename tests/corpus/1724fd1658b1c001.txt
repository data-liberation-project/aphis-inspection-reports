*** A female pig had recently broken her leg. The licensee stated the animal had been seen by the vet and was
being treated with antibiotics and pain meds. There was no records available for review that confirmed the vet had
seen the animal or that treatment was being provided as stated. In the future when animals are assessed and
treated some method of documentation needs to be recorded and maintained to assure the health care needs of the
animals are being met. This is proper recordkeeping practices to assure communication with and by the vet is
followed.
