position. Troy was observed sitting with his head lowered. His head was touching the top of the crate while he was
in this position. The crate was not tall enough to allow him to hold his head in a normal position while sitting . A crate
that allows enough space to allow him to turn about normally while standing , to stand and sit erect and lie in a
natural position must be provided to prevent discomfort.
