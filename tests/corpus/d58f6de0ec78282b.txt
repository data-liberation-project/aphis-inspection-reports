Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00-1:00 PM
on 06/11/2014. Arrived at facility, knocked on the door and left voicemails at both phone numbers. Contact was
made with the licensee's spouse who informed me that the licensee had been called into work unexpectedly.
Contact was later made with the licensee who confirmed this and provided me with the most current work schedule.
