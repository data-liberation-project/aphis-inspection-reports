Housing facilities, general.
The following outdoor enclosures need repair:

Some of the wooden elevated shelves have rotted and there are holes in some of the boards in the enclosure housing the
spider monkey.

There is a rotted wooden perch and two protruding nails on the elevated shelf in the enclosure housing the white-headed
capuchin.

Enclosures for non-human primates must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Failure to maintain
enclosures in good repair can result in injury to the animals. Correct by repairing, replacing, or removing rotten platforms,
perches, boards with large holes, and any protruding nails or screws. Correct by September 15, 2022.
3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Housekeeping for premises. There is overgrown vegetation growing through four empty outdoor chain-link enclosures.
Two of these empty enclosures separate the spider money from the pair of ring-tailed lemurs. The other two empty

enclosures separate the two single housed capuchins making it difficult for these animals to see each other. Premises
must be free of junk and discarded matter. Overgrown vegetation must be controlled to prevent pest problems. Correct by
September 15, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
