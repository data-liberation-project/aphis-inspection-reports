FEEDING.
The feeders for several of the non human primates ( squirrel monkey , de brazzos monkey ) are noted to have
black debris on the sides . Mold and old food that is allowed to accumulate on a food container may contaminate
the food and may cause an illness. Food containers must be kept clean and sanitized every 2 weeks.

WATERING.
The water for the non human primates is somewhat cleaner than on the inspection in June but it still is not clean.
Green algae and a black substance are covering the sides of the water containers for all the non human primates at
this facility. Floating food is noted on the surface of the water for one pair of gibbons in the front enclosures.
Potable water must be provided to every non human primate housed at the facility to ensure their health and well
being . Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized with a method described in section 3.84 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( ie.
washing with appropriate detergent solution or hot water /detergent ) at least once every 2 weeks or as often as
necessary to keep them clean and free from contamination.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
There is a smell of stale urine at the fennec fox enclosure this date. The substrate appears worn and dirty. There
are several piles of feces and possible urine or body oil staining a large flat rock in the enclosure . This indicates the
enclosure is not being cleaned as often as necessary . Fecal and urine buildup pose a disease risk and are a
source of odors. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination and minimize
diseases and odors.
