ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One eight-week-old female yellow Labrador Retriever (#18-7-2) was observed to be lying on its side, breathing very
slowly and not moving. The puppy appeared to be close to death, as it did not respond to stimulation around it,
including lack of response to flies landing on its body and the loud barking of nearby dogs. The facility
representative relayed that an infection was diagnosed last week by the attending veterinarian and that #18-7-2's
litter was being treated. She also indicated that the puppies initially seemed to be improving after treatment, but
some had deteriorated. Three other puppies in the litter had died, and #18-7-2 was groaning and appeared "lazy"
the evening prior to inspection, the facility representative conveyed. The representative also shared that no
additional phone calls or consultations with the attending veterinarian took place since the initial treatment was
dispensed the prior week. Upon inquiring with the attending veterinarian, the attending veterinarian conveyed to
USDA that outside of a positive fecal test result indicating an infection for which he dispensed treatment, he was
unaware of puppies being sick, because the licensee had not brought in nor called him about the puppies thereafter.
The inspection stopped so the facility representative could have the puppy evaluated and treated by the attending
veterinarian.
Frequent communications with the attending veterinarian are required to allow for the veterinarian to advise
licensees on needed treatments for health concerns, which helps to mitigate the effects of adverse health
conditions. Conditions that worsen in the face of treatment necessitate timely communications with the attending
veterinarian, to prevent an animal's health from deteriorating further and to identify ways to promote the animal's
health. While phone conversations may be appropriate for some minor medical conditions, animals with serious
medical problems should be examined by the attending veterinarian.
The licensee sought and obtained the needed treatment for Dog #18-7-2 from the attending veterinarian on the day
of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
