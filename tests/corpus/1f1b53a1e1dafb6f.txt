2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has not assured the authority of the attending veterinarian to ensure the adequacy of veterinary and
husbandry care. Staff are instructed to go to the curator about animal medical and husbandry problems, and then
information will go to the attending veterinarian if deemed necessary by the curator, preventing or delaying the attending
veterinarian’s access to timely, accurate information on veterinary medical issues and the animal care program.

*** The attending veterinarian has directed that only essential personnel may enter animal care areas for felids to avoid
COVID19 exposure. Despite these instructions, in the fall of 2020 a tour for two members of the public was performed in
the lion house, risking exposure and subsequent infection.

*** On April 16, 2021 a snow leopard cub was born. Animal care staff disregarded the birth management plan developed
by the attending veterinarian which directed that the animals must not disturbed for 24 hours after birth to reduce chance
of stress and maternal neglect. To check camera monitors placed in the snow leopard kitchen area adjacent to and visible
from the birth den, multiple staff members entered the building. Staff entered 6-7 times in an approximately 7 hour period
to “check” on the animals. After initially being observed caring for the cub, the mother rejected the cub. The cub was then
removed, and hand reared by the veterinary staff.


*** Clear and direct guidance was provided by the attending veterinarian to personnel for animal management at the time
of birth, but these instructions were not followed, leading the mother to neglect the cub, increasing the chance that the
cub’s health would be negatively impacted. The cub developed a respiratory infection and gastrointestinal condition that
required medical management in the hospital. While in the hospital, staff disregarded instructions to limit handling and
several facility staff members were permitted to handle and have their photographs taken with the cub.

*** In August 2021 the attending veterinarian was notified that one sea lion "Daley" was observed biting her front flipper
repeatedly while swimming in a repetitive manner. As part of the treatment plan, staff was notified by the AV that
additional enrichment should be implemented as a preventative method to reduce the abnormal behavior pattern.
Additional enrichment has not been added as of September 2021 as part of appropriate methods to address flipper
chewing.

The facility shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** Elephant keeper staff noted through overnight video the elephant Timba displaying a stereotypic rocking behavior in
the mornings an hour prior to keeper arrival in March 2021. This issue was brought to the attention of the attending
veterinarian, in April after the animal developed a painful bruise on her foot, due to the rocking. The veterinarian who

along with the keepers created a treatment plan which include increase enrichment using an automatic feeder prior to
keeper arrival in the mornings. The automatic feeder was not installed until July of 2021 at which the swaying behavior
abated. Treatment plans created by the attending veterinarian must be implemented in a timely manner to prevent injuries
and to ensure the health and wellbeing of the animals.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of the inspection, while in the red panda holding area, the inspectors could hear the juvenile snow leopard cub
vocalizing in the adjacent holding area and noted additional vocalization upon entry into the building. Upon entry, the
animal was observed rapidly pacing back and forth along the front door in a repetitive, agitated manner. Due to
inadequate space to allow each snow leopard outside access at the same time, the snow leopard cub has not had access
to the outside enclosures and is maintained solely inside in the holding area. The keeper staff notified the curator that the
animal was engaging in these stress-like behaviors, but the information was not conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
The AV became aware of the issue when he made rounds to the building and saw the behaviors exhibited by the juvenile.
A method of direct and frequent communication must be established and maintained so that problems on animal
behavioral health and well-being is conveyed in a timely and accurate manner.

Housing facilities, general.

At the time of the inspection, the cooler temperature in the commissary was 41.9 deg F with a reading of 99% humidity.
High humidity levels are associated with mold growth, which was found on the seal of the doors. Coolers should be cold
and dry to protect perishable food items from contamination and deterioration. This cooler should be addressed to
adequately store refrigerated food items for the health and wellbeing of the non-human primates.

Facilities, general.
*** On Sept 3, 2021, a female lion was in holding and during an unscheduled, unapproved husbandry training session
was placed in a in a squeeze cage attached to the primary enclosure. This was a new behavior for the animal as she had
not been squeezed for injections. The squeeze cage was located external to the primary enclosure, in an area where two
keepers were located. At the end of the session, the squeeze wall was moved in a manner that created a gap in the
primary enclosure and as the animal backed out of the cage, she was able to get through the opening created between
the main door and squeeze wall into the keepers’ working area. Facilities that maintain dangerous animals must always
contain them for their safety and that of the staff.

*** The mesh netting over the wolf enclosure is in disrepair with some of the mesh broken and hanging down into the
enclosure. This broken mesh needs to be addressed to keep the enclosure in good repair for the safety of the animals.
The mesh was removed at the time of the inspection.

Facilities, outdoor.
During the inspection, a gap of approximately 12 by 6 inches was noted on the perimeter fence underneath a gate
installed for construction access. The gap may permit access by vermin and predators, potentially leading to injury or
disease transmission. The perimeter fence line is not regularly checked for gaps or openings. The facility must ensure that
perimeter fencing keeps predators and unauthorized persons out of the facility and safely contain animals.

Sanitation.
At the time of the inspection, there were rodent feces in the lion and baboon building, and around multiple bait traps in the
naked mole rat building. Bird feces and nests were observed on building pipes in the lion, baboon, sea lion and polar bear
containment areas. Bird nests were observed around the rhino enclosure. The facility does not have an effective plan to
mitigate rodents and avian pests from its enclosures and buildings. Rodents and other pests may carry communicable
diseases to animals on exhibit and may contaminate feed. The facility shall ensure that a safe and effective program to
control avian and mammalian pests is established and maintained.

Employees.
*** On September 3, 2021, a lion escaped from a primary enclosure at the end of a training session and was loose in the
keeper hallway between the kitchen area and baboon area. The lethal force team was deployed without adequate training
for performance during emergencies. An incorrect code for the incident was called by the first responder on scene.
According to reports and a responding member of the team, another team member lacked a weapon, and did not

demonstrate adequate safety precautions when handling held weapon. If emergency personnel are not adequately
trained when responding to emergencies this may lead to an inability to respond appropriately, resulting in injury or death
of animals, staff members, or the public.

*** There are two maintenance personnel assigned to the zoo, which is an insufficient number to perform the myriad tasks
necessary to maintain the physical facility. This includes the animal primary enclosures, perimeter fence line, support
buildings and grounds. Multiple repairs are pending or have been delayed, including repairs for elephant containment,
perimeter fence maintenance, and installation of vital enrichment devices for behavior management. Overgrowth of
bushes around animal enclosures may lead to increased rodent and avian pest populations. Vines and branches are
growing on and around the perimeter fence and multiple primary enclosures which can impact the structural integrity of
the enclosures and fences. This also reduces necessary visibility of the fence line to ensure there are no gaps or areas in
disrepair. The facility must ensure that there are adequate personnel to maintain housing facilities and physical grounds to
ensure a professionally acceptable level of husbandry standards are met.
