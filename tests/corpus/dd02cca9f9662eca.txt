Watering.
On June 4, 2022, while inspecting the warm room Inspectors noticed a water bottle attached to a primary enclosure with
three guinea pigs (tag no. 1388) that contained green-black filamentous material attached to the inside of the water bottle.
Dirty water receptacles are breeding grounds for biological organisms that can cause disease, parasite issues, and other
health concerns. Water provided to guinea pigs daily must be potable and all watering receptacles shall be sanitized
when dirty. Corrected at the time of inspection.

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, several pens in the auction barn required repairs to the wooden boards. There were two pens in
the North side of the barn holding approximately 15 cows, both with horns and polled. There was a broken and loose 1x6
wood board between the enclosures. The pens housed adult cattle with calves, and the boards posed an escape and
entrapment risk. The loose broken board had jagged rotten edges that also pose a risk of injury for both the adults and
calves. The indoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by August 1, 2022.
3.137(a)(4) Repeat

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.

In the warm room, Inspectors found 7 pot belly pigs in 7 hard plastic tote containers (each tote containing 1 pot belly pig)
did not have ventilation on any of the sides and were stacked on top of one another. Animals without adequate airflow
during transportation may suffer from stress, difficulty breathing, or may overheat. Transport containers must be
adequately ventilated so that animals have adequate air flow for breathing and maintaining body temperature during
transport. Correct by August 1, 2022 by ensuring that travel containers are adequately ventilated in accordance with
3.137(a)(4).

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Facility Representative.
