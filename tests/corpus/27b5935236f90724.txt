3.87(a)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.
Construction of primary enclosures
*** On September 8, 2014, eight (8) non-human primates were shipped in primary transport enclosures constructed
in a manner that waste products were able to leak from the enclosure while in transit. Primary transport enclosures
should be leak-proof to prevent urine and feces from seeping outside of the enclosure and to prevent the animals
from being excessively soiled. Transport enclosures that prevent the leakage of bodily fluids must be used for all
future animal transport to keep the animals as clean and dry as possible while in transit. Correction: The IACUC
conducted a review. The registrant has purchased and redesign d transport cages to meet the primary enclosure
standards outlined in section 3.87 (a)(10). This item has been corrected.
3.87(d)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.
Compatibility
***On September 8, 2014, two (2) non-human primates were shipped in a double compartment transport enclosure
with no divider. The animals arrived with minor wounds and blood was present in the transport enclosure. There
was no paperwork indicating the breeding or pairing status of these animals.
Only one non-human primate should be shipped in a single transport enclosure to prevent possible fighting or injury
to the animals while in transit. Measures must be taken to ensure that only one non-human primate is present per
transport enclosure, except under certain provisions, for the overall health and safety of the animal. Correction: The
IACUC conducted a review. New double compartment enclosures have been purchased and new transportation
policies have been put in place. This item has been corrected.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.
