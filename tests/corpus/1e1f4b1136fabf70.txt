2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One white adult female Bichon ( microchip number 065623577 ) has matted hair on its back, belly, hindquarters,
and rear legs covering approximately 60 percent of its body. The matted hair is balled and is tightly adhered to the
skin. Matted hair can trap dirt, debris, and moisture and cause pain and discomfort. It can foster skin infections and
hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. Also, matted hair does not maintain the same insulating
qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for
coat maintenance for the health and well-being of the dog. Correct by 5/20/16.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* Three West highland Terrier and one Peekialier dogs had no official identification on them at the time of
inspection. The licensee stated that the four dogs were born around December 3, 2015. The licensee is currently
using microchip identification as the official identification. Official identification is needed to ensure that each
animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty which helps to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must
ensure that all live dogs on the premise shall be identified by an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo marking
that is acceptable to and approved by the Administrator or by a microchip chip number. Correct by 6/3/16.

* At least five water receptacles had an algae looking substance in them. Ten dogs are in contact with the affected
receptacles located in outdoor enclosures. When the water becomes contaminated, it is no longer considered to be
safe to be consumed and could lead to potential health risks. Algae buildup in the receptacle indicates a lack of
cleaning is occurring on a regular basis. The licensee must ensure all water receptacles must be kept clean and
sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b). Correct by 5/13/16.
