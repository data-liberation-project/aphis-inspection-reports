**The licensee has not notified the AC Regional Director by certified mail of a new site at the time of inspection.
More than a year has passed since the licensee has had animals at the Maywood, Il site, (site 001). Additionally, all
enclosures used to house the animals were removed from the site more than a year ago according to the individuals
currently at the site.
**Notification must be sent by certified mail to the AC Regional Director regarding any change in site location within
ten days. It is required to know the location of the animals so that they and the facility may be inspected in order to
determine compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
