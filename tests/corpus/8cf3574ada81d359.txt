2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1245 on
11-Apr-18. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I honked the horn and then contacted the licensee by
phone and left a message. The licensee called me back a few minutes later and informed me she wouldn't be
home for a while. I told her I would try again another time.
End of report.
