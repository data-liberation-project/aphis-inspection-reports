ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shih Tzu with USDA tattoo # OHDAN -18 is nursing a litter of four puppies. She is thin and has a sparse
hair coat over her back and hind quarters. She has tan material adhered to her teeth. Her gums have receded
back from the tooth roots and a grey green substance has accumulated along the gum line, especially around the
top incisors. Her lower incisors are missing and there is increased motion between the two sides of her lower jaw,
though she did not react to palpation of this area. Dental problems can affect the dogs ability to chew and are a
source of infection for other body systems.
Female Yorkie with USDA tattoo # OHDAN -9 has a firm nodular mass on her lower abdomen. It is approximately
grape sized and is located between the last two mammary glands on the left side. The mass may be indicative of a
disease process that can have detrimental effects on the health of the animal without treatment.
Appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be utilized. These dogs
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of assessment, treatment, and plan for each dog
shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.
