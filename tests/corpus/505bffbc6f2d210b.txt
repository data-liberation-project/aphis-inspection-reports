3.6(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
A majority of enclosures have areas where the wire mesh is rusty or broken, with exposed sharp points. Rusty surfaces
are porous and not able to be sanitized appropriately. Sharp points/edges can cause injuries to the animals in the
enclosures. Correct by ensuring all surfaces are readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled, or when
broken or sharp edges occur.

3.11

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Several primary enclosures have a buildup of dust/cobwebs, hair hanging down under the floor, and/or areas of brown,
organic accumulations on the surfaces. In addition, the licensee stated sanitizing is being done every 3-4 weeks. Lack of
cleaning/sanitization and removal of these areas can harbor infectious agents that can cause diseases in the dogs
housed in those enclosures. Correct by cleaning all surfaces the dogs come into contact with as often as necessary to
prevent accumulation of organic debris, in addition to sanitizing all primary enclosure surfaces at least once every 2
weeks in accordance with 3.11(b)(2).
