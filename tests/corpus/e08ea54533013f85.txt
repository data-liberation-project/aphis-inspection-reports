3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** General housekeeping needs to be addressed at the facility. Upon entering the building there was a strong
ammonia odor attributed to puppy enclosures that were empty but had not been cleaned and still had fecal waste in
the pans. This odor permeated into the whelping area as well. There were boxes of items including microchips with
needles stored on top of the enclosures. An empty feed bag was used as a trash container and per 3.1(f) this
receptacle must be leak proof with a tightly fitting lid. The facility is in the process of working on the outdoor runs,
but left over items are on the ground next to the enclosures and need to be disposed of. Housekeeping needs to be
addressed to keep the area free of accumulations of trash and reduce odors for the health of the animals.
