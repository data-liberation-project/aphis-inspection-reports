ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** One of the fallow deer that approached the fence was very skinny, with hips protruding and ribs visible. The
facility states this is a geriatric deer, but no daily observations have been done to assure the animal is eating and
the animals’ condition has not been communicated to the attending veterinarian.
*** Two of the black bears were rubbing along the logs and black tubing for extended periods of time. Both bears
have small patches of hair loss on their hindquarters and sides. This extended rubbing could indicate skin irritation
and discomfort. The bear’s hair loss and scratching should be communicated to the attending vet.
*** Two geriatric Capuchin's had hair loss and were thin. Their hair loss and weight could be attributed to their age,
or there could be underlying health issues contributing to their condition. There was no documentation indicating
their condition had been conveyed to the attending vet.
*** A geriatric red fox was walking and circling with its head tilted. The facility stated the animal had some possible
vision loss, but there is no documentation indicating this condition. This animal’s condition needs to be
communicated to the attending vet.
*** The chinchilla’s fur coat was very coarse looking with tuffs standing straight up. Abnormal hair coats must be
addressed by the attending veterinarian, since they may be caused by infections, parasitic, hormonal or metabolic
issues as well as inadequate husbandry. These animals have not been provided with a dust bath since their arrival
to the facility. Dust bathing for chinchilla’s is a normal postural adjustment that allows them to care for their own fur
coat. In addition to a veterinary work up, these animals need to be provided the appropriate dusting material and
pan to sufficiently dust bath multiple times a week. This needs to be addressed in consultation with your veterinarian
for their health and well-being of the chinchilla.
The facility needs to put into place a mechanism of communication in a timely manner with the attending
veterinarian so that accurate information on animals’ health and behavior is conveyed. Daily observations lead to
early detection of animal health issues and can assist the vet with a thorough history to help with diagnosing
problems. All animals noted should be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and treated per theirrecommendations.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The wood surfaces in primate enclosures are not constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned
and sanitized. These hard surfaces must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks in
accordance with regulations 3.84. Currently there is an accumulation of grime, feces and food debris along many of
the platforms which are not being cleaned or replaced at regular intervals as required. The concrete that is not
sealed is discolored with green algae that needs to be cleaned. Surfaces must be constructed in a manner that
allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn. The surfaces for the non-human primates
need to be addressed to facilitate cleaning for their heath.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Several wooden platforms and resting boards in multiple bobcat enclosures are in disrepair with rotted wood.
This is causing some of the nails to be exposed which can pose potential injury to the animals. These platforms
need to be replaced for the safety of the animals.
*** The plastic kennel in the coyote enclosure inside the barn area is cracked and in disrepair. This kennel should
be replaced to keep the area in good repair.
*** The wood and black plastic tube in the degu enclosure is in disrepair. The broken plastic can become andpotential ingestion hazard. These furniture items should be maintained in good repair or replaced on a routine basis
for the safety of the animals.
*** The top section of the wooden platform in the Chinchilla enclosure is chewed through with a large hole in the
wood. The hutch in the bottom of the enclosure is also chewed and should be replaced for the safety of the animals.
In general the facility needs to be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from potential injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The facility is using a modified refrigerated semi as a walk in cooler area. The facility has just recently stacked
butchered meat products on shelves next to produce that was open in bins. The shelves are not leak proof,
therefore fluids were on the walls and floor of the cooler. Storage facilities that contain both meat products and
produce should be separated by space to prevent cross contamination which can affect palatability of the food
source. The current set up of the cooler does not facilitate keeping the area clean and preventing potential
contamination between the meat and produce products. The area just outside the cooler was dirty with flies and
debris on the floors and table. Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure facilities used to store and prepare
food are kept in a sanitary manner to ensure optimal health.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The fallow and white tail deer have no shelter provided for inclement weather. There is a large acreage
enclosure with trees for adequate shade, but when the trees lose their leaves, there is nothing to provide adequate
shelter from inclement weather. This needs to be addressed for the comfort of the animals
