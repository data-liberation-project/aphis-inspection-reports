Facilities, general.
In the enclosure housing the two North American River Otters, the upper frame of the shift between two pens has
corroded so that there is a gap between the frame and the surrounding wall. This gap runs along the entirety of the
upper frame of the shift and along the side there are areas of cracked paint/plaster, exposing the concrete underneath.

Housing facilities need to be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. This
deterioration of the shift frame can cause injury to the otters by either contact with the jagged edges or through ingestion
of the flaking material. Correct by repairing the shift between the two pens.

Correct by: March 25, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
