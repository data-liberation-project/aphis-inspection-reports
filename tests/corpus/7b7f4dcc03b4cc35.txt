ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection Aphis Officials observed a brown, female goat with visible pelvic bones. Additionally, this
goat appeared very thin along her spine. This condition was also observed by the facility representative at the
same time. Due to this goat's thin condition, she should receive veterinary care to determine the cause of her
weight loss.
Daily observations are necessary to assess animal health and well-being. Such observations should be
communicated to the veterinarian in a timely manner so that health issues can be addressed.
