3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The puppies are not being vaccinated or receiving intestinal parasite treatments according to the schedule documented in
the Program of Veterinary Care.

One Akita puppy is 18 days old and according to the schedule it should have been dewormed at 7 & 14 days of age but
has not been. Three Labrador puppies are 34 days old and should have been dewormed at 7, 14 and 23 days of age, but
the facility representative stated that they have only been dewormed once. The puppies are also required to receive a
treatment for coccidia at 28 days of age but have not. Additionally, these puppies should have also received a
vaccination for Bordatella at 23 days of age but have not.

Failure to follow the vaccination schedule and intestinal parasite treatment plan does not ensure the puppies are free of
dangerous parasites and properly protected from serious diseases.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must ensure that the vaccination schedule and intestinal parasite

treatment plan that are documented in the Program of Veterinary Care are accurately followed in order to ensure the
health of the animals.
3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has no copy of the vaccinations and intestinal parasite treatments that three Akita puppies (DOB 07-23-22)
have received. The licensee stated that the form containing this information was given to the broker. At the time of the
inspection, the inspector attempted to acquire the information from the broker but was unsuccessful.

Failure to maintain documents containing information concerning treatments that are administered to the dogs interferes
with the ability of APHIS officials to determine that an animal has received adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records. These records must include the names of all vaccines and treatments
administered and the dates of administration. The licensee must ensure that every vaccination and treatment that is
administered to the dogs is fully documented and available for inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class "A" license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 31-December-2022 or the applicant will forfeit the
license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License
Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
