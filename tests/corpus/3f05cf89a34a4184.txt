2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection process a male sugar glider was found in an isolation enclosure on the top shelf in back
holding. The owner was not aware the animal was there and when the animal was examined it was missing an eye.
The owner stated his employee must have found the animal and moved it to the enclosure and provided it food and
water. The concern is that the condition of the animal was not communicated to the owner and the attending
veterinarian. Methods of communication need to be put in place when animals are sick or injured to assure their
health care needs are being met. This animal should be assessed by the vet for his welfare.
