ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, female golden retriever with chip number 900032001722460 has wounds on her neck and legs. The hair on
the underside of her neck is moist with blood tinged discharge. The skin feels thick in one area under the neck and
there is a thick yellow discharge appearing from under the matted fur at this area. The wounds on both the front and
rear right legs have red, moist areas of hairless skin with some blood along with areas of dry hairless skin.
Adult, male black and white husky with chip number 103 518 828 has an area of hairless skin just above the left
front foot. The upper part of this area has moist skin tinged with blood. The lower part of the area is thickened, pink
skin.
Wounds can result from trauma or injury and licking of the skin can perpetuate wounds. Discharge can indicate
concurrent infection. The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,
including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the
inspector upon request.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was standing water, food wastes and animal wastes in the indoor portions of the two wash-downs of the west
kennel building. Standing water and wastes can create an environment for pests and pathogens and cause odors.
Housing facilities must be equipped with disposal facilities and drainage systems that are constructed and operated
so animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated. Correct by 19 Dec. 2016.
3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The feet of one litter of puppies housed on elevated mesh flooring are too small for the openings of the flooring
material. The legs and feet of these puppies were observed falling through these openings several times during theinspection. This could cause injury to the puppies. The flooring material must be constructed in a manner that does
not allow the animals' feet to pass through the openings. Correct by 16 Dec. 2016.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an accumulation of dried feces on the elevated flooring of one enclosure on the lower side of the east
side of the west kennel building. These feces were trapped on the support tube and between the layered flooring
material. Accumulations of feces can increase disease transmission, create odors and attract pests. Feces must
be removed from the primary enclosures on a daily basis. Correct by 13 Dec. 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
