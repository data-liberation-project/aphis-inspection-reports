Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At time of inspection a female Golden Retriever (901001003828527), with 6 two week old puppies, was exhibiting a poor
body condition. Upon examination, all of the ribs were easily palpable, the spinal vertebra was visible and protruding with
no palpable fat. The pelvic bones were becoming prominent and had an obvious waist tuck. The female was also
exhibiting pale gums. The licensee stated that he has had trouble with the animal eating and has been force feeding her
and has not contacted his attending veterinarian regarding the issue. Animal health and well-being is very important in
animal husbandry. The licensee shall have the aforementioned female examined by a veterinarian with written medical
records for review. Moving forward, the licensee shall implement a proactive daily observation and communicate with the
attending veterinarian regarding concerns.

3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
At time of inspection the female Corgi (909937) was exhibiting a significant buildup of tarter on the teeth. The licensee
stated that the attending veterinarian was at the facility in November 2021 and checked teeth at that time and no direction
was given to conduct a cleaning. The Program of Veterinary Care states "check teeth & schedule dental if needed".

Dental care is an important aspect of animal husbandry for care and condition. The licensee shall implement a proactive
regimen to check teeth and schedule a dental as needed as it is outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care.
The aforementioned female was also exhibiting long nails. The nails were at a length that the toes of the dog were curving
outward while standing on the concrete floor of the enclosure. Keeping nails at an appropriate length will deter the
curvature of the toes of the animal and promote animal husbandry. The licensee shall implement a proactive nail care
regimen, as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care, to promote animal health, care and condition.
