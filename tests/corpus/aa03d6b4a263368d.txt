2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) had 183 dogs recorded, but there were 196 adult dogs counted by
the inspector. When the records and dogs at the facility do not match it makes the records incomplete. Complete
and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
ability to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at their
facility. Correct by 5/10/14.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Dug holes were observed under the enclosure divider fencing in two enclosures. Eight dogs are in contact with
the affected areas which are located in outdoor housing. The holes were estimated to be six inches wide by four to
six inches deep. This affects the ability of enclosure fencing to contain the dog securely. It could lead to potential
injury affecting the safety and health of the dog. The licensee must keep facilities in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals securely. Correct by 4/27/14.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 4/10/14 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
