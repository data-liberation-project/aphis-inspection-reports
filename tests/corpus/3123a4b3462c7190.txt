FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Shelter from sunlight***
The enclosure housing the 6 zebras and 20 aoudads on the north side of the big barn does not have a shade
structure in place. Three pens on the east end of the barn holding 3 zebus and 4 dromedary camels do not have
shade structures in place. All enclosures must have shade, either natural or artificial, to effectively protect the
animals from issues of discomfort or heat stress. Shade structures must be provided for these enclosures. To be

SANITATION.
***Cleaning of enclosures***
Two enclosures within the big barn were observed with excessive accumulations of bedding material and waste.
The enclosure containing a water buffalo, a zebu, and a yak was observed with a buildup of approximately 10
inches of bedding material and waste above the gravel flooring level. These animals were observed with soiled
areas on the legs and sides from the waste contaminated bedding. An enclosure containing 9 nilgai was observed
with a large accumulation of bedding material near the feed trough that was contaminated with fecal material.
Outside, on the southwest area of this site, an enclosure containing 2 badgers was observed with the gravel strata
receding below the wire panel flooring. This has created a cleaning obstacle. This enclosure was observed with
fecal waste, feed, mud, and other organic materials covering the floor area below the wire panel. A foul odor was
noticeable in close proximity to this enclosure.
All enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent soiling and contamination of the animals a nd to
minimize disease and odor hazards. To be corrected by: 10/06/15
