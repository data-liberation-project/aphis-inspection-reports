FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. Three coati mundi are housed together in an outdoor enclosure. There is an old wood bird
nesting box wired to the fencing inside the coati mundi enclosure. This wood box is warped and rotting and the wire
holding the box to the fencing is rusty. The wood box could fall to the ground and injure an animal. This wooden
box must be taken down and removed from the coati mundi enclosure. To be corrected by: August 13, 2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather. One male camel named "Aladdin" and one female camel named "Jasmine" are
housed together in one outdoor enclosure with one shelter. This shelter is not tall enough or wide enough to
comfortably house both of the camels during inclement weather. An additional taller shelter must be added to this
outdoor enclosure to provide adequate shelter for both camels. To be corrected by: August 31, 2014.
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representative.
