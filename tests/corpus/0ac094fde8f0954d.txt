HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The area that displays the puppies to the public is next to the store's checkout area. The checkout area has
become cluttered with business equipment, stacks of papers, and old supplies. The puppies are carried through this
area and are allowed to exercise next to this area. The employees must walk through this area to preform daily
cleaning and husbandry practices. This area has become difficult to clean and poses an environment for bacteria,
pest, and injuries.
-The licensee must ensure that all animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter,
including equipment, furniture, and stored material. This will prevent potential injury and allow for ease of cleaning
and observation of the housing area. Steps must be taken to ensure this noncompliant item does not repeat.
