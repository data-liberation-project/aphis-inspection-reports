ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white and gray/black male Shih Tzu identified as “Hurley” (no microchip # available) was observed to be missing
several teeth and had a large buildup of brown and tan debris/calculus on upper canine and upper cheek teeth. The
buildup of debris/calculus material obscured normal teeth contours. Areas of gum recession and thickening were
evident in areas of calculus buildup.
A white and brown intact male Shih Tzu identified as “Romey” ( Microchip # 077 102-111, DOB 10-9-2011) was
observed to have a buildup of brown and tan debris/calculus over the upper canine teeth and lower and upper
cheek teeth. Reddening and recession of gum tissue were evident in areas of debris/calculus buildup over the upper
canine teeth.
Accumulation of large amounts of tartar or calculus on teeth may result in the development of gum disease,
infection and tooth loss. In turn, this may also further impact the well-being of an animal by causing chewing
discomfort, inappetence and weight loss.
The two dogs described above need to be evaluated by a veterinarian within fourteen days and appropriate plans of
treatment established to address the observed dental issues. Written documentation of veterinary evaluation and
treatment also need to be available for review upon inspector request.
