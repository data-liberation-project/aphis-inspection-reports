2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Pomeranian microchip #005-008-600 continues to have problems with her teeth. The upper teeth remain
covered in a dark hard material. Also a female Pomeranian microchip #045-839-905 has problems with her teeth.
The upper teeth have a thick buildup of brownish colored material on their surfaces. Tooth problems can be painful
and cause further health issues in dogs if not treated. To ensure that these dogs are not in pain and receive
appropriate treatment have the attending veterinarian evaluate them to diagnose the teeth problems and treat them
per the veterinarian's instructions. Documentation of the dog's diagnosis must be kept for future inspections.
