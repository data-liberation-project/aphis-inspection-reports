2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The tiger known as Sher Kahn would not stand even when prodded with the facility CEO's cane. The tiger had
areas of hair missing from the top of both rear feet. The flesh below was bright pink. These lesions appeared to be
from the tops of the feet being drug on the ground as the animal walked. The left front foot had an overgrown claw
which extended all the way around and back into the foot pad. This condition can be extremely painful. The facility
CEO was not aware of these lesions. This tiger is suffering in its current condition. This tiger requires evaluation by
the attending veterinarian for treatment to alleviate its pain and suffering. The facility attending veterinarian was
consulted about the condition of this tiger at the conclusion of the inspection by the facility CEO.
The macaque known as Huey had a small wound on the tip of its tail. This lesion was about 1/4 inch long and was
red and raw. Medication has been prescribed by the attending veterinarian and is on hand to use as needed for this
condition. Tail wounds of this nature can spread rapidly if not treated in a timely fashion as the animal will continue
to pick at this area. This can lead to infection which can ultimately require tail tip amputation. Wounds must be
treated promptly to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering. This monkey requires administration of the medication
prescribed by the attending veterinarian for this condition.
Documentation of the veterinary evaluation for the tiger with treatment recommendations and treatment records for
both animals must be maintained and available for review by APHIS officials.

Failure to observe health issues and promptly treat and/or report them to the attending veterinarian will lead to
unnecessary suffering and in extreme cases even possible animal death. Thorough daily observations of all animals
should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra scrutiny. Report all health issues promptly to
the veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The meat cooler had a horrible ammonia like odor mixed with the odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor
makes it very hard to determine if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the
cooler, identify the source of the odor and eliminate it.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
A training for facility employees has still not been conducted. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of
properly trained employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering.
Workers need to be trained in the basic needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum:
the importance of adequate water, the need for adequate bedding during times of extreme weather, the importance
of cleaning and good housekeeping procedures, proper diet for different species of animals and observation of
animals for abnormal conditions and behaviors. This training should be done in conjunction with the attending
veterinarian or his designee. A list of topics covered and attendees must be documented for review by APHIS.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the facility CEO.
