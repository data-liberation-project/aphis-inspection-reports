3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain-link enclosures being used by 25 dogs in the indoor facility have areas of excessive rust along the bottom
parts of the panels the dogs can come in contact with. At least five front chain-link gates have excessive rust on the
metal frames and parts of the wire mesh. The back wall of at least five enclosures that is constructed of painted
sheet metal has excessive rust along the bottom edge. The rusty areas are also pitted and beginning to deteriorate
affecting the structural strength of the enclosures.
These affected surfaces can no longer be properly cleaned and sanitized. The rusty areas need to be painted,
repaired or replaced. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs be free of excessive rust
that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization.
3.1(c)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor facility that is housing 27 dogs has a pungent odor of noxious and ammonia-like fumes. There are
several windows partially opened and a fan that is on near the back of the building. However, the fumes are still
causing the inspector's eyes to burn and discomfort when breathing. Some of the dogs are showing signs of
discomfort from the high level of fumes by wincing or squinting rapidly in an abnormal manner. There is a mixture of
fresh, old and dried urine covering most of the concrete floor surface in the enclosures. The excessive accumulation
of urine in the enclosures is causing some of the dogs to become wet and soiled. The hair coat on the dogs that are
white or light colored are discolored from lying on the affected areas. Most of the rubber mats in the enclosures are
damp and heavily soiled. There is an excessive accumulation of fur, grime and fecal material adhered to the lower
half of the chain-link fencing material that is being used to contain the dogs. The licensee stated that it has been a
couple weeks since the enclosures were thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.
Cleaning and sanitization of surfaces that are in contact with the dogs is necessary to prevent the accumulation of
dirt, debris, excreta and other disease hazards. Hard surfaces the dogs come in contact with must be spot-cleaned
daily. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces within the housing facility are cleaned and sanitized once every
two weeks or more often if needed for the health and well-being of the dogs.
