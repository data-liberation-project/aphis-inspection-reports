2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Patagonian Cavy was observed to be thin and its fur appeared to be unkempt. During closer examination of the
animal, the spinal column of the Cavy was protruding out and could be easily felt when I ran my hand down its back.
The licensee had not observed the animal's condition prior to inspection. An animal that is thin along with an
unkempt fur coat can indicate an underlying health problem. Contact the Attending Veterinarian and provide
adequate veterinary care for this animal. Must be corrected by 12-14-15.
A Kinkajou was observed to have a reddish bulge coming out of its right eye. The licensee stated that the animal
has been examined by the Veterinarian and he is currently treating the animal with eye medication. He informed
me that the animal has a chronic condition with its third eyelid. The licensee was unable to produce any
documentation verifying this. I contacted the Attending Veterinarian, but was not able to verify what the licensee
had told me. Eye problems may be contagious and can lead to more serious health problems. Contact the
Attending Veterinarian and provide adequate veterinary care for this animal. Correct by 12-14-15.
2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee was unable to provide records showing the disposition of the animals that have been euthanized, died,
or sold. This does not allow for review by APHIS Officials. The licensee must maintain up-to-date disposition
records that show what happened or where the animals went after leaving the facility. Correct immediately.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL. During inspection the licensee informed me that there was a deceased goat in the back part of the enclosure that
contains other goats, a zebu, sheep, and llamas. He informed me that the goat had passed away of unknown
causes 3-4 days ago. Failing to remove deceased animals immediately can result in the spread of disease causing
the live animals to become sick and possibly die. The deceased goat must be removed and disposed of in a proper
manner. Correct immediately.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
End of report.
