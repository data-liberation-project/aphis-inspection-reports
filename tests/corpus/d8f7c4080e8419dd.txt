The inspector arrived at 12:30 PM on 11/7/19 to conduct an inspection. There was a sedan in the driveway but no
one came to the door after the door bell was rung twice, and a dog started barking when the inspector knocked on
the door but no one came to the door. The inspector tried to reach the Licensee by telephone but the call was not
answered. The inspector left a voice message, waited 30 minutes and then left the premises.
