2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* Adult, female blue and white Italian Greyhound with number 933 has not been evaluated by a veterinarian
since the last inspection. The gum line over the upper right large premolar tooth is red and recessed away from the
tooth surface. The gum line over the lower left premolar teeth is recessed and one lower premolar tooth is loose.
The front of the lower jaw is able to be moved when the two lower canine teeth are gently manipulated. The two
lower canine teeth can be slightly moved toward each other. There is dark brown material coating the upper right
large premolar tooth and the lower left premolar teeth. This dog is currently receiving "Tylan" powder in the drinking
water at the rate of 1 tsp/5 gallons. Documentation from the attending veterinarian directs the Tylan to be used at a
dose of 1 tsp/1 gallon of drinking water. The license gives the water free choice every day. This dog is also
receiving (cid:28)Plaque Off(cid:29) in the food.

* Adult, female Schnauzer with number 653 has not been evaluated by a veterinarian since the last inspection.
The gum line over the upper premolar teeth of both sides is recessed away from the surface of the teeth. The roots
of the large upper premolar teeth are exposed on both sides. One of the small upper premolar teeth is loose on the
right side. One of the small upper premolar teeth and the large upper premolar tooth is loose on the left side. The
licensee had a conversation with the attending veterinarian about the care of this dog via telephone. This dog is
receiving (cid:28)Plaque off(cid:29) in the food as discussed with the veterinarian.

* Loose teeth, recessed and red gums are some of the signs of dental disease in dogs. Dental disease can
cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures (such as bone loss in the jaw), be painful, and
impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal.

* The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the
diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon
request.


* Black and tan adult male Dachshund with number 1004 still has matted hair observed on the ears and backlegs that is tight against the skin. Salt and pepper colored adult male Schnauzer with number 64 still has matted hair
on his all four legs, rear end and abdomen. The matted hair was (cid:28)balled(cid:29) and ropey in appearance and was tight
against the skin. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris, and moisture, and can foster skin
infections. The matted hair on these dogs must be removed and a program of coat maintenance must be
established at the facility.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 4/7/16 were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver
VMO and Robert Bacon ACI.
