2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While re-inspecting the animals cited in the February 25, 2020 report under 2.40(b)(3), we observed the licensee
treat the left eye of a white female chinchilla and we noticed some hair loss and reddened skin by her collar and
requested to look closer around her collar. The licensee removed the collar and the skin underneath was eroded
where the collar was and it had some dried material around it. The licensee treated this animal's neck and moved it
to a separate enclosure (29B) for further treatment. Daily observations need to be improved to find conditions such
as this so that they can be treated promptly per the attending veterinarian's instructions.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
