CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises.
1. The following housekeeping issues were identified in the small kennel room at the time of the inspection. The
entry door to the room is a hollow core metal door. The surface of the lower part of the door close to the floor was
rusty and part of the rusted area had corroded through forming a rectangular shaped opening approximately 1 inch
high by 12-14 inches long that exposed the inside of the hollow door. In addition, the painted cinder block wall of
two of the kennels had small areas of peeling paint that were near the floor level of the walls.
Rusted surfaces cannot be effectively sanitized and the opening into the hollow core door allows dirt or other debris
to get inside the door itself and cannot be adequately cleaned. The presence of peeling paint in primary enclosures
can pose a risk should pieces of the paint flake off and be ingested by the dogs and can also interfere with effective
cleaning and sanitization of the walls.
Per this Section of the Regulations, buildings where housing facilities for dogs are located must be kept in good
repair to protect the dogs from injury and to facilitate required husbandry practices.
The Registrant needs to address the condition of the kennel room door and the walls of the two kennels to maintain
the premises in good repair and to ensure effective cleaning and sanitization.
Correct by 8/15/16.
