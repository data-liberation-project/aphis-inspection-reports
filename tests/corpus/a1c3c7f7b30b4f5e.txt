2.31(e)(1)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The facility's protocol does not contain the approximate number of animals to be used in the protocol. The protocol states
that the ratio of students to animals will be 4:1 but there is no overall number of animals to be used.
An overall approximate number of animals to be used in the protocol is critical information that needs to be provided to the
IACUC while performing protocol review so they can assess the validity of the request and either deny, approve with
modifications, or approve the protocol.
Correct by September 27, 2022 by modifying the current protocol to include the approximate number of animals to be
used, explain why that number of animals is being requested, and resubmit to the IACUC for approval, approval with
modifications, or denial.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institutional Officer.
