Contingency planning.
The contingency plan for covered species was not developed and documented in writing by the deadline of 5 July 2022.
Contingency plans are required to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of the
animals in the event of an emergency or disaster.
3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
The opening for one of the outdoor shelter boxes had been chewed by the wolf dogs, resulting in sharp points that could
injure the animals. The material that the shelter boxes was made of was no longer sealed, and therefore can not be
readily cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must be maintained in a manner that prevents injury to the wolf dogs and
allows for the required cleaning and sanitization.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The veterinary care plan for dogs was documented in writing, but the veterinarian has not been out to the facility in more
than a year and the head to tail physical exams for the wolf dogs have not been completed. Annual visits to the premises
and physical exams are required in order to ensure the health and welfare of the wolf dogs.
