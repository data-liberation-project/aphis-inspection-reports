ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The kennel facility consists of two sheltered buildings and one indoor housing building ( whelping building) which
houses mothers and puppies . In the whelping building there is one two year old female Yorkshire terrier, chip #
019317089, named Angel Fire. The animal had a splint and bandaged right front leg. The dealer stated the animal
had injured it's leg approximately two weeks prior with a reevaluation appointment in two days. The dealer did not
have any written documentation of the animal being injured or being evaluated by the attending veterinarian. In
building #2 there is a two year old female Yorkshire terrier, chip #004327043, named Lady Mist. The animal's left
eye is an orb of pink tissue. The dealer stated the animal's eye was a birth defect. The dealer also stated the
animal had been evaluated by the attending veterinarian. However the dealer did not have any written
documentation of the evaluation or treatment. Both animals must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and
the dealer must maintain written documentation of the evaluation and all treatment to protect the health and welfare
of the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In sheltered building #2 there are four enclosures whose expanded metal type doors have excessively rusted
surfaces which are rough and pitted. The doors need to be repaired or replaced to insure they can be properly
cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and
objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in
contact with the dogs must be free of excessive rust that prevents required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects
the structural strength of the surface.
