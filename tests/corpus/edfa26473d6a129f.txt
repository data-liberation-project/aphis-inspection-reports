2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Regular visits to the facility have been made by the Attending Veterinarian, however the written Program of
Veterinary Care (PVC) could not be located by the licensee during inspection. Lack of a written PVC doesn't allow
APHIS officials to verify if the care of the animals is overseen by the Attending Veterinarian. A formal written PVC
reflecting the care of the animals must be maintained and made available for APHIS officials during inspections so
that it can be verified that appropriate veterinary care is provided and available for animals at the facility.
