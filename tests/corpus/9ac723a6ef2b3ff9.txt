INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 2015-8 is a diet study on Peromyscus Sp. and includes a forced swim test apparently to asses body
condition but which may cause distress. The protocol is listed as Category C and therefore no search was
performed for alternatives to this as a potentially painful or distressful procedure. Not looking for alternatives to
procedures that may cause distress to the animals can subject the animals to unnecessary discomfort. The IACUC
must assure the principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than
momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and has provided a written narrative description of the methods
and sources. Additionally, the IACUC must re-review and approve the revised study with using the criteria outlined
in 9CFR. Correct before using animals in this activity and no later than 30 December 2016.

ANNUAL REPORT.
The annual report shows 50 Peromyscus Sp. used on protocols for FY 2016. The Principle Investigator stated that
the numbers represent the breeding females but that the offspring are also used in research under the protocol.
This means that the numbers reported by the facility are under reported. The facility needs to verify numbers are
correct and under the proper column on the annual report to assure accurate tracking of the animals. An amended
report must be submitted to the Raleigh, NC office for Animal Care. Correct by submitting a revised and accurate
annual report no late than 1 December 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Laboratory Manager.
