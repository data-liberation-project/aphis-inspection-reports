FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The water bowls in jaguar holding are constructed of concrete and painted. The paint is showing signs of coming
loose and needs to be repaired to prevent accidental ingestion of paint flakes during drinking. All three water bowls
in jaguar holding are showing signs of loose paint and need to be repainted.
In Ocelot holding there is an approximately 24 inch scrape on the floor where the paint is coming loose. This needs
to be repaired so cleaning procedures do not make the condition worse and the possible ingestion of paint by the
Ocelot is prevented.
All surfaces in animal areas need to be kept in good repair to ensure the safety and health of the animals and to
facilitate cleaning and sanitation.
