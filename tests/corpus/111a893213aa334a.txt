2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Although the written Program of Veterinary Care is available, it does not address a recurring problem at the facility.
Tiger cubs were transferred from the Florida facility to the Myrtle Beach facility on 2-22-16. Two of the white tiger
cubs then exhibited ringworm like lesions on the dorsum of their paws. The licensee started the treatment he has
used in the past. At this inspection, the small circular areas of hair loss on the paws all have new hair growth
occurring. Although the treatment given appears to be working, the Attending Veterinarian has not signed off on
this particular treatment.
Because ringworm can be a recurring problem, the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian need to develop a
written plan for how it will be treated. The treatment plan needs to include treatments to be used, any
environmental measures to take, and public safety issues to address, such as when the animals can have public
contact.
To be corrected by 4-15-16.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
