ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
In August, 2013 one rhesus macaque died after it was caught in the chain of an enrichment device that was hanging
on the front of the cage. This device had been used routinely at the facility without any problems prior to this
incident. The chain was about 9-12 inches long which enabled it to be pulled through the bars of the cage when the
animal was playing with the ball attached to it. Since the incident, all chains for enrichment devices have been
shortened to no more than 6 inches or covered with PVC pipe. Upon observation of some primate cage racks, a
few cages had lengths of chain attached to the divider between cages to prevent the divider from sliding out too far.
These chains were about 9 inches long and when the divider was pushed in could be pulled into the cage and
present a similar injury risk to the primates. Although no incidents have occurred with these divider chains, they
need to be modified to prevent any further injury risks. Correct by March 25, 2014.
This was a focused inspection to address a complaint and covered Friedberg campus only.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
