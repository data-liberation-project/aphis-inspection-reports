FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The chain link material along two walls of the enclosure containing 21 goats, 21 sheep, 3 alpacas, and 1 llama
was in disrepair in several locations, with several sharp points extending into the enclosure. Additionally, there were
several gaps between the ground and the chain link that measure approximately 5 inches. These gaps and sharp
points are within contact of the animals and could cause injury.
***An entire wall of fencing of the enclosure containing 1 zebra and 2 camels is leaning at an approximately 70
degree angle away from the enclosure. This fencing structure is not structurally sound and is not adequate to
securely contain the animals within.
***The walls of a metal shed in the daytime enclosure of two camels have sharp, rusted edges at the base, where
they are not in contact with the ground. Two of the walls are coming off of the frame of the shed, creating sharp
edges that pose a risk of injury to the animals.
***A portion of the fencing of the daytime enclosure of two camels is in disrepair. A wooden pillar was uprooted from
the ground and is causing the section of fencing around it to sag. The pillar has created a problem with the current
in the electric fence and there is no electricity running through the wire.
***The metal gate in the daytime enclosure of two camels is tilting between the fence posts. It is attached to the
fence posts with rope and chains. This fencing structure is not structurally sound and is not adequate to securely
contain the animals within.
All housing facilities must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in
order to protect the animals from injury. A routine schedule of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance
must be in place to protect the animals from injury, contain them, and ensure that these items do not repeat.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***One side of the perimeter fence that encircles the camel and zebra enclosure is loose and has several large gaps
between the wire fencing and the ground that extend approximately 10 feet in length and are approximately one foot
in height. This fence is not adequate to prevent animals or unauthorized people from entering the premises.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and so that it can function as a secondary containment
system for the animals in the facility.
