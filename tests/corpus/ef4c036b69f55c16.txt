RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
Records of acquisition for four naked mole rats were not available at the time of inspection. All acquisition records
and/or documentation shall be available for inspection (and maintained at the research institution for at least three
years). The institution shall keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose information on
purchased or otherwise acquired animals, and that are in its possession/control. The Record of Animals on Hand
(APHIS Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or Transport of Animals (APHIS Form 7020) are forms
which may be used by the institution to keep and maintain the information required by federal regulations. The
institution needs to obtain the required information on the four recently acquired animals as soon as possible.
