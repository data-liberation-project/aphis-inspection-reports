2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At the time of inspection the calf was walked through an area with many hazards, including a manure conveyor
apparatus where the calf had previously scraped her head, causing a two inch abrasion, and electrical wires on the
wet ground which the calf walked over. Upon returning to the barn, the calf walked unattended into a utility room
that contained many hazards, including bottles of bleach, and other cleaning supplies within reach of the calf.
Another risk for the elephant calf is that of infection, and the biosecurity measures in place at the time of inspection
were limited and not adequate to prevent her from the risk of exposure to pathogens.
All animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause them harm, and that safeguards their well-being.
From this time forward all animals shall be handled in a manner that safeguards their welfare, including appropriate
planning to address the logistics and staffing issues to handle reasonably foreseeable contingencies.
