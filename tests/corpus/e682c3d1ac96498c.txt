DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
- The drive through area of the park is currently open for visitors, but is not an approved site. Site 002 (drive
through site) is not a valid site and must be in complete compliance with all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act prior
to being used for regulated activity.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- The male rhinoceros "Tank" was visibly thin and lethargic during the inspection. He appeared to have lost muscle
on his sides and hindquarters, and had loose skin rolls on both flanks. Tank had a clear sticky discharge from both
nostrils. His barn was filled with abnormally soft stool, which caretakers stated had been occurring for
approximately two weeks. There was no knowledge of when Tank had last been evaluated by the attending
veterinarian. There was no feed, including hay, present anywhere in the enclosure and the pasture has little to no
grass other than dry weeds.
Tank's current physical condition is considered to be an emergency, and requires immediate assessment and
correction. At a minimum, Tank must have free access to good quality hay at all times. He must also be assessed
by the attending veterinarian within 24 hours, and any veterinary recommendations followed strictly. Tank must be
rechecked as often as the attending veterinarian deems necessary, but not less than weekly until his body condition
has improved.
- During the drive through inspection, a black male llama (approximately two months of age) was noted off the side
of the road in sternal recumbency. The animal did not respond to auditory stimulus, and was approached on foot by
inspectors and facility personnel. The llama appeared barely conscious, and his attempts to stand were weak and
spastic. Physical palpation of the animal showed him to be in very poor body condition, extremely thin with muscle
wasting and little to no body fat. The upper palate was tinged blue, and the saliva thick and ropey. The inspection
was immediately stopped and facility personnel directed to contact the attending veterinarian for emergency care.
While the veterinarian was en route, the animal was offered food and water but did not or could not respond. With
the attending veterinarian on the way, employees moved the llama to the medical barn. One employee stayed with
the animal while the other employee rejoined inspectors to continue the inspection. Upon the attendingveterinarians arrival, the inspectors and accompanying attendant went to the medical barn to observe treatment
efforts. Unfortunately, the llama had died before the veterinarian arrived on the premises. A field necropy was
immediately conducted by the attending veterinarian. Her initial impressions were that internal organs appeared
relatively normal, but the animal was very thin and muscle wasted. She believed the animal likely had a heavy
internal parasite load, and suspected the llama had entered a "negative energy balance" which it could not recover
from. She estimated the llama to be approximately two months old. Samples were submitted for histopathology
and fecal analysis, and results are pending.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- Numerous animals throughout the park are thin and in poor body condition. There is no indication in records that
anyone in the park has noticed any problems with thin animals in the preceding weeks. It was clear that no
employees had noticed any problems with this young llama prior to finding him on the inspection. Young, small
animals as well as thin animals are extremely susceptible to environmental stresses, parasite loads, and other
dangers. A young animal in poor body condition is in a gravely dangerous situation, and any amount of stress can
quickly overload a weakened animal. The animal caretakers were aware that there is a natural "hierarchy" among
the various species in the park which determines access to available food. Young animals in general, and
especially members of a less dominant species, will often have difficulty eating especially when food supplies are
limited (such as during the winter). Employees must be aware and diligent in finding and observing younger
animals to ensure they are eating sufficient amounts of wholesome food to maintain body fat and muscle. The
facility clearly failed to properly observe, evaluate, and care for the llama which died on the inspection date.
Greater care must be taken with all park animals, and especially younger and more vulnerable animals. Body
condition must be evaluated constantly for all animals in the facility. When possible, animals that will permit
themselves to be touched should have their body condition assessed by physical palpation, as observation through
thick wool or hair coats can be difficult. The facility must also give more consideration to methods of feeding, and
must consider methods of feeding that will ensure smaller, weaker animals are able to reach food without being
pushed away by larger, stronger animals.

2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, such as a rhinoceros and a tiger, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals mightnegatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle these
animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site can be
approved for regulated activity.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- At the time of inspection the drive through area of the park had members of the public driving through and feeding
animal feed from paper Pepsi cups that are available for purchase at the gift shop. There were no park employees
present during this public/ animal interaction. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or
attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Throughout the drive through park are numerous broken t-posts extending a foot or so above the ground. There
are multiple areas with broken fencing, and metal fence sections on the ground. The zebra enclosure has a broken
t-post and a loose horseshoe right in front of the shelter entrance.
- Along the outer border of the public barrier fence around the rhino enclosure, there are several areas with loose or
broken wire along the ground level. This is a potential hazard to any animals which might approach this fence.
- In the Serengeti area, there are many shelters in poor repair. One structure (building 6) has a large approximately
2 foot by 4 foot triangular sheet of plywood missing in the middle top area Many structures (building 6, 15, and 18)
have broken boards and many of these boards have long sharp points. The roof on shelter 6 is wavy and the roof
on the short shelters next to the Rhinoceros enclosure has metal pulled up which has sharp edges. There is a wall
in shelter 18 that is leaning and no longer secure or structurally sound. There is a shelter in the Serengeti area that
has a detached front face plate on the south east corner with numerous sharp points. This structure has roofing
resting on the detached face plate board and is not structurally sound. Leaning walls, structurally unsound shelters,
nails and sharp metal edges pose risks of injury to any animals using the shelter. All shelters must be repaired or
replaced, and maintained appropriately.
- In the Serengeti area there are multiple holes in the fencing. Some holes are in the perimeter fence and others
are in the fence next to the rhinoceros enclosure area. These openings are a potential source of injury/entrapment
to animals in the park. All areas of the park must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.- In the area beside the medical barn and by the hyena enclosure are areas where there were numerous loose rolls
of fence on the ground. This fence/wire poses a risk of injury to any animal in the area of the park. The fence and
loose wire must be repaired and maintained in good condition or removed if not necessary.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
-Multiple deer were noted outside the perimeter fence at the time of the inspection. There were 3 fallow deer and at
least 2 other deer observed by the inspectors and the facility representative. The facility representative was asked if
that was their property and if those animals were being fed. The representative stated it was not their property and
those animals were not being fed. The perimeter fence must be kept intact, both to prevent unauthorized access
and to serve as a secondary containment for the animals. Failure to properly contain animals inside the facility
causes risk of escape and loss or injury of the affected animals.
3.129(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
- The current feeding methods/plans for the entire facility are clearly insufficient. Numerous herd animals, as well as
the male rhino, were found to be thin and in poor body condition. Upon arriving at the facility, there was no creep
feed left in the storage barn, although a shipment of feed did arrive later that day. There was very little decent
quality stored hay, and throughout the facility little to no hay was available for the animals. As the drive through
inspection was conducted, animals in every area of the park rapidly approached the vehicles, including species not
normally expected to approach cars. Because park visitors routinely feed the animals from their vehicles, we
believe the behavior of the animals during the inspection indicated they were seeking food. This was a consistenly
observed behavior throughout the park and across species, including llamas, donkeys, oryx, buffalo, and numerous
others.
The facility must immediately provide additional hay and feed to the animals. This additional feed must be provided
within 24 hours of the initial inspection date.
For long term maintenance, at a minimum the park must provide all animals with free access to good quality hay.
This means that sufficient quantities of hay must be present in all areas of the park, at all times. This hay needs to
be distributed in multiple spots to ensure that all animals have convenient free access to food at all times. Also,within 48 hours of the initial inspection date the facilty will have the attending veterinarian create a written feeding
plan covering every sector of the park, detailing a specific plan for proper feeding in each area. The facility will
maintain copies of this plan, and all employees will be instructed to follow the written plan. Any deviations from this
feeding plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
- Multiple watering containers in the drive through portion of the park had a moderate amount of greenish colored
debris concentrated on the sides and bottom of the container. This is an indication that these containers are not
being cleaned frequently enough. Water receptacles must be clean and contain potable water for the health and
well-being of the enclosed animals. More frequent cleaning and sanitizing is needed.
3.131(a) DIRECT
SANITATION.
- The rhino barn was filled with an excessive amount of feces and urine. The droppings were soft and had spilled
out of the stalls and onto the outer perimeter of the barn, including the walkway between the stalls. Droppings were
present on numerous stall bars, and the water troughs on one side of the barn were half full of an unidentifiable
liquid which did not appear to be water. The fecal matter had been present long enough for most of the surface to
be coated with a white, fuzzy growth which appeared to be mold. Pools of standing urine were also present in the
stalls. On the outside of one stall, tracks of a small unknown animal were found imprinted in the puddle of feces.
The condition of this barn was absolutely unacceptable, and the rhino "Tank" must not be allowed access to this
facility until it is thoroughly cleaned and properly sanitized. Any animal exposed to this area would be at a severe
risk of contamination, both from the presence of the waste and from the suspected mold growth covering the pools
of fecal matter. Since this barn is the only true shelter available to Tank, the entire area must be cleaned and
sanitized within 24 hours to ensure that in the event of adverse weather the rhino will have access to a clean,
heated shelter space.

3.132
EMPLOYEES.
- There are currently two full time employees who work directly as animal caretakers. At the time of he inspection
neither employee knew where the key was to allow access to Tank's enclosure. In order for the round bale of hay to
be placed in his enclosure the lock had to be broken and removed. This is not a sufficient number of trained
employees to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices set in the AWA. Adequatenumbers of trained employees must be maintained at all times to properly care for the animals present.
