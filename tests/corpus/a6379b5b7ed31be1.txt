HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***During the inspection a potbellied pig twice escaped from it's primary enclosure. The attendant that was present
did not operate the gate in a manner to contain the animal. The licensee must ensure during periods of public
contact, a responsible, and knowledgeable attendant is present in these areas at all times. Correct from this day
forward.
This inspection took place at the Quitman elementary school in Quitman, MS.
