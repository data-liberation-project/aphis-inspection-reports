ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***The registrant self reported an incidence in which bats did not receive a prescribed treatment in a timely manner.
An increase mortality rate was noticed in the bat colony. Based upon the results of the necropsies, the attending
veterinarian prescribed a treatment to prevent further illness. Directions for administering the treatment were given
to the research staff on December 20, 2014. Treatment was not provided to the affected bats until January 7, 2014.
Bats did not receive treatment for 3 weeks and additional bats died before the treatment was started. The delay in
treatment was detemined to be the result of miscommunication. A system must be in place to ensure direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure timely and accurate treatment for all illnesses.
The IACUC took timely and appropriate corrective action to prevent a reccurence of such incidents.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility presentative.
