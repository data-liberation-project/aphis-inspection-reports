***Female Yorkie #14 has excessive tartar on all teeth on the upper arcade on both sides. The 4th upper premolars
on both sides are completely covered in tartar. The gums above the upper molars and upper canine teeth are also
bright red in color. These signs are consistent with dental disease that can be painful and may lead to the dog
being unwilling to eat. Additionally, dental disease has been linked to other health problems including kidney and
heart disease.
***Male Yorkie #33 has tartar build-up on all of its teeth. Especially, the 4th upper premolar on the left side and both
lower canines are completely covered with tartar. It is missing several teeth including lower incisors. There is no
record of treatment on hand for this animal. This dog is also drooling significantly from its mouth. These signs are
consistent with significant dental disease and pain.
Both of these dogs are in need of veterinary care. The licensee must have these dogs exained by a veterinarian by
2 March 2015. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care can lead to pain and suffering in the animals and
does not ensure appropriate care to animals in the facility.
Correct this by contacting a licensed veterinarian and to have these animals examined. Licensee must follow all
recommended treatment and maintain documentation of treatment for future review by APHIS officials.
Even though this is a repeat NCI, the licensee must have these animals examined by 2 March 2015.

DIRECT*** Two dogs were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection. The licensee was unaware of the
condition of both of these dogs and no documentation of treatment or care was on hand concerning these dogs.
The licensee must ensure that all animals are observed daily to ensure that medical problems can be discovered
and appropriate care given in a reasonable amount of time. Failure to observe animals daily and give needed care
can result in animal suffering. This continues to be a problem at this facility with dogs found in need of care without
the licensee's knowledge of the condition of the animals on previous inspections dated 04 March 2014 and 01July
2014.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Most of the inside enclosures in the sheltered facility have surfaces in contact with the dogs that are dirty and
require cleaning. There are fecal smears, grime build-up and dirt in all of the corners of the enclosures and on
enclosure walls. These surfaces must be spot cleaned daily as needed to ensure that the living space for the dogs
remains clean and disease hazards are kept to a minimum. Failure to clean and maintain these enclosures
exposes the dogs to unnecessary disease hazards and does not satisfy accepted cleanliness standards. Correct
this by cleaning and maintaining all primary enclosures in a sanitary condition.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** Six adult dogs are being housed outdoors with shelters that have no bedding. Although the dogs are pair
housed, there is no bedding in the shelter boxes. The outside temperature during this inspection was 16 degrees F.
Temperatures tonight are expected to drop below zero with daytime temperatures over the next few days in the
mid-20's to low 30's. The licensee stated that he provides the dogs with sawdust as bedding. Although sawdust is
acceptable as bedding when required for temperatures dropping below 50 degrees F, it is not acceptable when
additional bedding is needed when temperatures drop below 35 degrees F. Straw, hay, or other bedding is
required to allow these dogs to nest and maintain body heat. Sawdust will not provide adequate insulation to the
dogs. Failure to provide adequate bedding exposes the animals to unnecessary temperature extremes and can
result in cold stress or injury to the dogs. Correct this by providing these dogs with adequate bedding.
***The licensee was advised during this inspection on 27 February 2015 to provide these dogs adequate bedding.

FEEDING.
*** Two self-feeders being used in the sheltered kennel at this facility were found to be dirty, and contained caked
feed in them. Caked feed is not safe for the dogs to eat and can lead to health problems or digestive upset. All
feeders must be kept in good repair and maintained clean and sanitary. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining all
feeders as needed.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Several outside runs for the sheltered kennel have feces in excess of one day in them. Even though it is
understandable due to the recent weather that outdoor washdowns have not been sprayed down, the licensee must
ensure that all primary enclosures have feces removed on a daily basis to ensure the dogs are able to remain clean,
dry, and free to walk in an enclosure free of feces. Failure to remove feces on a daily basis can expose the dogs to
unnecessary disease hazards and does not satisfy accepted husbandry or cleanliness standards.
