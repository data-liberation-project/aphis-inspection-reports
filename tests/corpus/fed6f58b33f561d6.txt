ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility did not perform adequate daily observations of a rabbit and did not identify abnormalities on the animal’s
head. On a black adult rabbit there was a raised, circular area of hair loss above the nose. The hairless area was
approximately 2 cm in diameter. The visible skin was pink/red in color, becoming red and inflamed towards the
center of the hairless area. There was a smaller area of hair loss on the forehead and the visible skin appeared pink
in color.
This particular condition had not been documented by facility staff.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and
the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.

WATERING.
In the fallow deer, goat, and sheep enclosures, the plastic drinking bowls were dirty and had a green slimy film on
the interior sides and bottom. In some bowls there was green, brown slimy debris floating on top of the water. It is
the responsibility of the licensee to make sure all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary for the overall health
and well-being of the animals.
