FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The red kangaroo and 2 wallaroos do not have a 6' perimeter fence. The facility does have fencing around it, but
some areas are only 4' in height.
Perimeter fence. On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be
enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. For
non-dangerous animals the fence must be 6' in height.
Construct a perimeter fence of at least 6', or request a perimeter fence variance from the Eastern Regional Office.
Perimeter fences are required to protect the animals from predators, to act as a secondary containment in case of
escape and to prevent unwanted people from entering the enclosure.
To be corrected by September 1, 2017.
