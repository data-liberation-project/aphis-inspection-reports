ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** One of the Zebra's had back hooves that need to be trimmed. Overgrown hooves need to be monitored and
trimmed on a routine basis if the hooves do not wear down naturally. This is to prevent any injury or walking
abnormality if the hooves grow too long impacting the animals gait. The attending vet needs to be consulted and a
program put into place for these routine husbandry concerns.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The facility has three juvenile olive baboons in the main building in an enclosure that has no platforms or
climbing areas and no areas that allow them to hide from the guests. Young baboons should have areas that allow
them to hide from public view to reduce any stress behaviors. These animals need to have additional enrichment
enhancements listed in their program to assure the psychological needs of these animals are met.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The fallow deer enclosure has one shelter structure for 13 deer with fawns due any day. There should be an
additional structure that allows all the animals to comfortably fit into the shelter during times of inclement weather.
This needs to be addressed for the comfort of the deer.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS. *** The enclosure for the fallow deer needs to be addressed. There are 13 deer in the pen with additional fawns due
to be born soon. The enclosure was very open with one shelter and some trees, but there are no visual barriers, or
tall grasses or vegetation. Normal postural and social adjustments for these animals is to have areas where they
can feel hidden from guests to give birth and then hide the fawns for safety. This enclosure needs to be addressed
to provide elements of hide areas for the comfort and well being of the deer.
