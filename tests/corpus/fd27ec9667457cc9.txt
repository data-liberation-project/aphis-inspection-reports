2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee does not have a written program of veterinary care from his attending veterinarian. A complete and
accurate written program of veterinary care is required to ensure that the animals are receiving veterinary care
consistent with currently accepted veterinary medical practices. Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending
veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant
arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled
visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor. The facility must have a veterinarian visit the facility and complete
the program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*****An adult, female French Bulldog, identification number 956000009308373, had abnormal left and right eyes.
There was an area on the surface of the cornea of both eyes that was approximately one eighth inch in diameter.
This area was cloudy and milky. There was a discharge from the left eye. The conjunctiva of both eyes was
reddened and swollen. The animal was blinking both eyes much more than normal.
*****An adult, male French Bulldog, identification number 956000009307721, had an cloudy/milky area on the
surface of the right eye. This area was approximately one eighth inch in diameter. The conjunctiva of both eyes
was reddened and swollen.
Eye conditions can be painful, can progress quickly, can result in loss of sight, and can be the result of injury or an
underlying medical condition. The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by close of
business on December 13, 2016, to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited
above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided to the inspector upon request.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.The licensee was not updating information on APHIS Form 7005, Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on
Hand. The licensee had four Chihuahuas on the premises. The Form 7005 listed six Chihuahuas. There were five
Havanese on the premises. The Form 7005 listed nine Havanese. There were six Pomeranians on the premises.
The Form 7005 listed ten Pomeranians. There were 17 French Bulldogs on the premises. The Form 7005 listed
nine French Bulldogs. Complete records and proper record keeping are essential to facilitate the inspection
process and to track the movement of animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act. Each dealer must make,
keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required information concerning each dog
or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her
control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
To be corrected by: December 26, 2016.
2.131(e) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There were two adult French Bulldogs and one French Bulldog puppy that were housed outside without any shelter
or heat source. The ambient temperature at the time of inspection was 41 degrees Fahrenheit. All three animals
were seen shivering during the inspection. The lack of shelter and/or heat source during cold weather can cause
pain and/or distress and lead to frostbite and even death. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's
health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. The animals
were moved to a heated facility during the inspection.
Corrected during the inspection.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were structures in the facility that were not being maintained. There were particle board sheets lining the
walls of the French Bulldog housing area. The edges of these sheets were chewed and ragged. Surfaces not
maintained on a regular basis cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. There were two metal vertical support poles
in disrepair. The bottom section of the poles are rusted and not structurally sound. Housing facilities for dogs must
be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in good repair, and they must
protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. The particle
board sheets and metal poles must be repaired or replaced.
3.9(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
There were at least three food receptacles that were dirty. There was rodent feces mixed in with the feed in the
bottom of the receptacles. There was also a buildup of food residue and grime on the interior. There was “caked”
food kibble in the bottom of these feeders. There were at least two food receptacles with white/moldy food kibble
bits. Food receptacles which are not properly cleaned and sanitized, can harbor disease-causing organisms andcould decrease the dogs' acceptability of the food. The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are kept clean
and are sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary in order to prevent an accumulation of
dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. These food receptacles were cleaned during the
inspection.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive accumulation of rodent feces on the floor, window sills, food receptacles, and on top of the
wooden enclosure boxes inside the sheltered kennel building. A mouse was seen on the floor of the facility during
the inspection. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote
the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. These areas must also
be cleaned more often.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and Jeff Baker, Veterinary Medical
Officer.
