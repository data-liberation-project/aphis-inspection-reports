MISCELLANEOUS.
The current numbering system in use for identifying the dogs allows the three digit tattoo animal number provided at
the facility to be reused. Since the dogs arrive at the facility with an original tattoo from the vendor in one ear and
then are given the additional three digit identifier while at the facility, combining the tattoo numbers gives each
animal a separate ID number. This system is okay as long as both numbers are referred to in the animal records.
Some of the animal records reviewed only refer to the three digit ID given at the facility, which may be on more than
one dog, creating confusion when connecting the animal records to the individual dogs. Both numbers will need to
be referred to on the animal records to prevent misidentification. Correct by August 31, 2015.
