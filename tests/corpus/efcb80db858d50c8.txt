FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Section 3.26(b) Ventilation: There is an ammonia odor in the room housing the hamsters. The licensee informed
the APHIS official that the exhaust fan for the room was set on a timer. The exhaust fan did not turn on during the
inspection of the hamster room which lasted at least one hour. The ceiling air vents and the exhaust fan have an
accumulation of dust and debris. A dirty ventilation system may decrease the effectiveness of the system for
providing fresh air to the hamsters. The ammonia odor in the room may irritate the eyes and respiratory tract of the
hamsters and cause health problems. The exhaust fan and ceiling vents must be kept clean. The room housing
the hamsters must be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the hamsters at all times.

SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: The rack holding the hamster enclosures in the first row is also being used to store
enclosure tops and miscellaneous items. Bedding, enclosures, supplies and a heater are piled to the right of the
door so the floor cannot be adequately cleaned in this area. Enclosures housing animals must be kept away from
storage for the safety of the animals. Items necessary for the care of the hamsters must be stored on an organized
manner to allow the room to be adequately cleaned to maintain the health of the animals.
