3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* 11 metal dividers in the kennel had paint that came off along the bottom of the dividers. This is exposing bare
metal that is excessively rusty and flaking. Three metal self-feeders were excessively rusty and flaking around the
area of the feeders where the dogs eat. These excessively rusty and flaking surfaces cannot be properly cleaned
and sanitized. Thus, increasing the disease potential and affecting the structural integrity of the surfaces affecting
29 adult dogs..
All metal surfaces must be kept free of rust that prevents required cleaning and sanitization. Metal surfaces free of
rust will also maintain the structural integrity. With required cleaning and sanitization, the disease potential is
reduced for the animals.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The outside enclosures with concrete flooring had an accumulation of fecal waste on the concrete. Four
enclosures had the fecal waste smeared onto the concrete surface. The owner stated it had been a few days since
the enclosures were cleaned because of the rain. The accumulation of fecal waste can increase the disease
potential for the 20 adult dogs.
All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized as often as necessary for the prevention of disease
hazards to the dogs.
