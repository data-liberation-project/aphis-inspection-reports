of craniotomy and thoracotomy which is a terminal procedure

Item 2.31e 3
At the time of inspection protocol 1023 was reviewed. The Protocol involves the use of swine in a painfulprocedure. The investigator in the protocol indicates that persistent recumbency is an endpoint. Swine number 496
underwent a procedure and the medical records for this animal post operatively indicated that the animal was in
recumbency from 18:30 on Mar 30 2016 till 09:45 on 3/31/2016 when the animal was euthanized. In addition a
similar issue occurred with swine number 497 that continued to be in recumbency from approximately 1420 on Apr
5 till 0732 on the Apr 6th when the animal was euthanized.
The IACUC needs to have the investigator provide a time frame that when the end points that are described in the
protocol are reached the animal will be euthanized. In addition the IACUC needs to review the painful classification
for this protocol and see if any animals need to be reclassified into category E
