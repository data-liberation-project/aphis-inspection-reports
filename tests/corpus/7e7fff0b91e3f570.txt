In five exterior enclosures of the sheltered building, there were what appeared to be bird droppings. The bird
droppings affected approximately 10 dogs. The bird droppings were on the inside and outside of the self feeders.
Birds and bird droppings can transmit diseases and parasites to dogs. The licensee must establish and maintain a
safe and effective pest control program to protect the health of the dogs.
