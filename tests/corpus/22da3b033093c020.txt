2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility had not updated the program of veterinary care since the previous attending veterinarian retired. A new
attending veterinarian is employed; however, the paperwork does not reflect those changes. Attending Veterinarians are
needed to oversee the health and well-being of the animals. The facility shall employ an attending veterinarian under
formal arrangements. The formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled
visits to the premises.
