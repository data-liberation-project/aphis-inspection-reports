2.1(a)(1) REPEAT
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The owner of the property has Bobcats, cavies, goats, Watusi, Whitetailed deer and a rabbit on exhibit to the public
at his amusement facility.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a exhibitor, except persons who are exempted from the licensing
requirements under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must have a valid license.
A USDA, APHIS, AC license must be obtained to exhibit animals to the public.
2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility employs a veterinarian under part-time or consulting arrangements. The written program of veterinary
care does not give guidance on the two Whitetailed deer fawns that are present. Written veterinary guidance for the
care and well being of the various species at the facility has not been provided by the owner. Animals may be
mishandled and mistreated without current applicable guidelines for their care and treatment. For example, two
Patagonian cavies died last
December at the facility when they were housed outdoors without a heated nest box. Each exhibitor shall employ an
attending veterinarian under formal arrangements, which shall include a written program of veterinary care in the
case of a part-time or consulting veterinarian. A written program of veterinary care, including appropriate guidance
for each species at the facility, must be documented and implemented.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Since June, 2013 there have been new managers in charge of animal care at the facility and there have been
numerous
deaths of animals in their care. The list includes one ringtail lemur, 1 bobcat kitten, 2 adult watusi, 2 cavy, 1 fox, one
peacock, one Chinese pheasant and two fallow deer. Two Whitetailed deer fawns were recently acquired. Thecaretakers have no experience bottle raising these animals. The managers husband stated that the technician that
was
hired this spring was represented as having wild and exotic animal experience, but they found out she had only
worked at a dog kennel, which is also the only experience that the manager and the managers husband have had
with animals. Since the previous inspection a rabbit has had a back injury due to poor handling.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain.
The managers must gain the appropriate knowledge and experience of any species of animal prior to acquiring the
animal or hire someone with the proper knowledge and experience with the species involved.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is allowed to hand feed animals on exhibit including: four goats, two cavies and a watusi. The public
may contact the animals during feeding. Employees or attendants are not present during these times of public
contact. One of the rabbits present at the last inspection was seen by the attending veterinarian for a back issue
that was causing lameness. The care takers are not aware of how the injury happened because there are no
attendants present at times of public contact. Unattended public contact may result in physical injury to the animals
by trauma or them eating unapproved items. The animals experience mental harm when they are subject to
ignorant and inappropriate human contact. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or
attendant must be present at all times during public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a rusty, deteriorated piece of metal along the bottom of the shelter for the bobcats.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
All animals must be contained in an enclosure that is appropriate for the species to prevent injury and/or death of
the
animals. Remove or replace the rusty metal at the bottom of the bobcat shelter to prevent injury and to maintain the
structural strength of the shelter.
3.127(b) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The watusi is housed in an enclosure that does not have a shelter with 3 sides and a roof.
This is not a sufficient shelter for the watusi. It does not protect the animal from wind and rain in the summer and
wind and snow in the winter.
A shelter with at least three sides and a roof must be constructed or walls added to the current structure to protect
the
animal and prevent discomfort.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two cavy are in an enclosure that does not have a perimeter fence.
On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet
high for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent
physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such
fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
A perimeter fence must be errected around any enclosure housing a wild or exotic animal to act as secondary
contaiment and to prevent death of the animal by a predator.
3.129 REPEAT
FEEDING.
The bag of deer pellets that is being fed to the Whitetailed deer fawns is open and sitting on the floor of the gift
shop.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.
Open bags of feed need to be stored in a way to minimize the possibility of rodent and pest infestation to ensurethat the food is wholesome and maintains nutritive value.
Exit conducted by phone with the owner.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
