2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Dachshund puppy appears mildly dull and lethargic. She was observed sitting quietly in the food
receptacle while the other puppies actively bounced around and on her. She also has mildly thinning hair on the
sides of her body and patchy hair loss on her face. The hair loss on the face is mainly located on the bridge of her
nose and around both eyes. This puppy is mildly to moderately thin with a prominent backbone. The gums were
moderately pale in color. The licensee stated that this puppy was in “sugar shock”.
Conditions such as this and can lead to further health complications. This puppy must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must
be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals
receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are four empty bags of dog food on the floor of the building housing the Labradors. The bags are located
directly across from the dog enclosures. The licensee stated that she intends to burn them this weekend. The
empty food bags could attract pests such as insects or mice.
Trash containers in housing facilities must be leak-proof and have tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The
licensee must place the empty dog food sacks into a leak-proof container with a tightly fitted lid if they are to be
stored within the Labrador building. The licensee removed the sacks from the building at the time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Heather Cole, VMO and the facility representative.
