2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Although it is known that the facility has a program of veterinary care from past inspections, a copy and confirmation
of veterinary inspection could not be located at the time of this inspection. All records required by USDA need to be
available for examination at the time of inspection. There should be a system of filing or storage in place that
makes the required records available for examination at the time of inspection.
