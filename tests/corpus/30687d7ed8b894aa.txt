3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Basement" there is one enclosure, housing one adult Cocker Spaniel and eight puppies, whose flooring is
covered by newspapers. The newspapers covering nearly the entire floor space outside of the whelping box have
become saturated with liquid and feces leaving very little clean area for the adult dog. Some piles of feces have
been stepped on by the dog and smeared across the newspaper. The licensee stated that the enclosure is cleaned
once a day, but this particular dog produces a large amount of waste. The buildup of waste material and limited
amounts of clean space could have a negative effect on the health of the dog and her puppies.
Surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized once every two weeks, or
as often as necessary, to prevent the accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee must
remove the saturated and soiled newspapers from the Cocker Spaniel(cid:25)'s enclosure as often as necessary in order
to eliminate the buildup of waste and allow the dog access to clean areas outside of her whelping box. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain free of a buildup of waste material in order to promote the health
and well-being of the dogs.
The licensee removed all the newspaper from the affected enclosure during the inspection.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the food storage area there is one open bag of dog food and one uncovered bucket of dog food sitting on the
floor. Also, in the storage area there are two bags of unopened dog food sitting on the floor. The uncovered dog
food and bags of food stored on the floor could potentially become contaminated by pests such as flies and mice.
Consuming contaminated food could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

All supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage, vermin infestation and
contamination. All open food must be stored in a leakproof container with a tightly fitted lid and all unopened bags
of food must be stored off the ground and away from the walls. The licensee must ensure that all dog food isproperly stored at all times to prevent food contamination and spoilage.
