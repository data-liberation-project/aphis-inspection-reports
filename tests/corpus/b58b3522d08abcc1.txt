of an emergency or disaster, thus helping to safeguard the good health and well-being of the animals in these situations.

Sanitation.
The room for the hedgehogs has accumulated fecal material and bedding present on the floor. Clutter, dust and debris
are present throughout the room, and debris is present on the walls. Several of the floor tiles are loose and could allow
fecal material and pests underneath. In addition, there is a large accumulation of materials on the floor in the back of the
room. Accumulated bedding and fecal material on the floor contribute to odor and make it difficult to maintain pest
control. Clutter and excess equipment make the animal room difficult to clean and sanitize.

The floor and walls of the animal housing room must be cleaned, and clutter and debris removed from the room. Loose
flooring tiles must be removed or repaired. The licensee must also ensure that the animal housing room is kept clean,


organized and free of accumulations of trash and other materials in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices. The
facility was most recently cited under this regulation on 2/13/2020.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
There are a large number of insects throughout the hedgehog room. They appear to be tiny beetles, and the insects are
covering numerous surfaces in the room. Insects and other pests can contaminate the food and bedding, and also
spread disease. A safe and effective program for the control of insects and other pests must be established and
maintained. To be corrected by: July 25, 2022
