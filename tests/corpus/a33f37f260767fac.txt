2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Maltese named Annie Oakley (#7E10137862) had a large scab under her right eye, that when removed,
revealed an oozing draining tract. Upon exam of her teeth, the back teeth on both sides were covered in a thick, hard,
brown material and her gums were reddened and recessed, exposing the roots of the teeth. The location of the scab
corresponds to the location of the roots of the back teeth. Draining tracts on the face, red swollen gums, and heavy
buildup on the teeth can be evidence of dental disease. Dental disease can be painful and lead to additional
complications like infections and difficulty eating. An adequate program of veterinary care uses appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by 12/3/22 by seeking veterinary care.
3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
There were several enclosures with sharp metal points protruding into the enclosures that could injure the dogs. Nine
enclosures containing 14 dogs had wire walls that had rusted and broken, creating the sharp points. Approximately half of
the 9 had holes large enough for the dogs to put a head or foot through and cut themselves on the broken wire. Primary
enclosures that are not maintained can put dogs at risk for fights, injury, and escape. Correct by 12/8/22 by ensuring no
sharp points protrude into the enclosures and maintaining the wire to prevent future breakage.


3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was an enclosure containing a male Dachshund that had a large pile of fecal material in the middle of the outdoor
pen. The licensee stated that he had not been able to wash down the enclosures due to the cold weather but he had not
made an attempt to scoop the waste material. When feces are allowed to build up, it can attract pests, create foul odors,
limit access to all areas of the enclosure, and cause illness such as skin irritation and intestinal parasite infestation.
Correct by removing excreta from primary enclosures on a daily basis. Corrected at time of inspection
3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was evidence of a mouse infestation in the kennel. The inspector observed a mouse running across the floor. The
shelf and floor underneath the workbench were covered in mouse droppings. In the front room/office, there was a strong
odor of mouse urine. The licensee stated that they had traps and bait out but they did not seem to control the problem.
Mice can carry disease and can contaminate food and bedding. Correct by 1/1/23 by developing and implementing an
effective pest control plan.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
There was no current written program of veterinary care. The licensee was able to find a dated and signed sheet and
medical records from her current veterinarian but there was no written plan addressing the requirements for adequate
veterinary care. Without an established and written program of veterinary care, USDA cannot assess the level of
veterinary care, prevention, and treatment plans of the dogs in the kennel. Correct by 12/8/22 by establishing a written
program in consultation with the attending veterinarian.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
