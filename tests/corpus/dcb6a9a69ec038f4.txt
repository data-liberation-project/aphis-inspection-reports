FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. There are large areas of bare wood on the floor in the guinea pig building where the paint is worn
or scratched off. The floor was last sealed with white paint in the spring of 2017. The paint on the wooden floor is
not holding up to daily activity such as cleaning, feeding, maintenance, and water spills. The interior building
surfaces such as floors must be constructed and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture
and can be readily sanitized. Correct by ensuring the floor where bare wood is present is resealed or covered with
an impervious surface that can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected, and won't retain odors.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
There were rodent droppings on top of the two racks of enclosures housing the weaned guinea pigs. There were
boxes, bags, old rusty self-feeders, and cans being stored on the tops of enclosures on the left side of the building.
The presence of bags, boxes, and other items being stored on tops of enclosures can create living and hiding areas
for rodents and can increase the risk of disease for the guinea pig colony. In addition, there were numerous
cobwebs on the ceiling, upper walls, and roof supports. Correct by ensuring the premises are kept clean, including:
removing items stored on tops of enclosures to prevent pest problems, cleaning tops of enclosures of boxes, cans,
bags, and empty feeders, and dusting off cobwebs from ceiling, roof supports, and upper walls to support good
animal husbandry and health. Correct by June 16, 2018.
This inspection was conducted with the owner's wife and the exit interview was conducted with the owner.
