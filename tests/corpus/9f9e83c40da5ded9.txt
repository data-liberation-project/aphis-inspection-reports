2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A non-pregnant Female Yorkshire Terrier with USDA tattoo # OHDAN -58 was noted to have severe dental disease
during the inspection. She has a heavy buildup of tan material adhered to her canine teeth, pre-molars and molars.
Her gums have receded back from the tooth roots and a grey green substance has accumulated along the gum line,
especially around the top canines. Several of her cheek teeth on both sides of her mouth are missing and there are
loose back teeth on the right side. The program of veterinary care as well as instructions from the attending
veterinarian should be followed to ensure adequate care for the animals. Untreated dental disease may lead to
problems consuming food as well as several conditions, such as cardiac disease, that affect the health and
well-being of the animal.
An adult female Bulldog with USDA tattoo # OHDAN -2B3 has a firm nodular mass between her toes on her front
right foot. It is approximately the size of a small marble and is pink colored tissue. The animal did not appear painful
and was not showing any favor to the foot at the time of the inspection The mass may be indicative of a chronic foot
injury or process that can have detrimental effects on the health of the animal without treatment.
Appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be utilized. These dogs
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of assessment, treatment, and plan for each dog
shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.
