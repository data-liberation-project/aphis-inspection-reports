2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The November and May 2013 IACUC semi-annual reports to the Institutional Officer (IO) each identify minor facility
deficiencies. These reports do not contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting
each deficiency. The IO, as the legal representative for the research facility, should be informed of the status and
plan to correct deficiencies to ensure they are addressed in a timely manner.
To be corrected from this day forward
2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol does not contain a rationale for the appropriateness of the species used. Protocols
require this rationale in order to prevent the unnecessary use of a species in research. The IACUC must ensure all
principle investigators provide a rationale for the appropriateness of the species used.
To be corrected by August 1, 2014
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.
