ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four expired medications were found stored with current medications for the dogs. Mometamax had expired in
August 2011, an Ear Mite medication had expired in November 2014, Oxytocin had expired in May 2015, and
GentaMax had expired in January 2015. Expired medications can lose their effectiveness and the health of the dog
could suffer.
The use of expired medications is not considered acceptable veterinary care. Expired medications must be either
marked as expired, properly discarded, or moved to a physically separate location from current medications. The
licensee disposed of the expired medications during the inspection.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the section of the barn that houses adult Boston Terriers, the dogs have access to outdoor enclosures. The
fencing of the outdoor enclosures is constructed of metal bars. Three of these enclosures, containing three dogs,
have excessive rusting of the metal bars. The rusted areas of the bars are pitted and flaking. The rust does not
allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the metal bars to occur.
All enclosures must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization. These rusty
metal bars must be repaired, replaced or altered in manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The
licensee must ensure that all dog enclosures remain free of excessive rust.

3.1(c)(2) REPEATHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the barn, the first enclosure containing two Golden Retrievers has a piece of plastic running along the bottom
of one side. This plastic has been excessively chewed by the dogs and dirt and grime has been embedded into the
chewed areas.

In the whelping area of the barn, the whelping boxes have pieces of wood in each corner. The dogs have
excessively chewed the wood in at least one whelping box. This whelping box is used by one adult dog and three
puppies.
In the section of the barn containing adult Boston Terriers, there are six enclosures that have plastic door frames
around the access door. The dogs have excessively chewed these door frames and dirt and grime has become
embedded into the chewed areas. There are six adult dogs housed in these enclosures.

The damage caused by the chewing does not allow the wood, plastic door frames, or piece of plastic to be properly
cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must
be replaced when worn or soiled. The pieces of wood, plastic, and plastic door frames must be repaired, replaced,
or altered in a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces
remain in good repair at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor dog pens, the shelters are clad in sheets of metal. In one enclosure, containing two Golden
Retrievers, the dogs jump up and place their front feet on the metal shelter and push off as they run back and forth.
The area of the metal where the dogs place their feet and push off has broken and created sharp points and edges.
In another outdoor enclosure, containing two Boston Terriers, the metal bar along the bottom of the fencing has
broken creating sharp edges that have bent inward towards the dogs. Sharp points and edges can cause injury to
the dogs.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the dogs. The sharp points and edges on the sheet metal and fencing must be removed, repaired, or altered
in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for
the dogs at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the section of the barn containing adult Boston Terriers, there are five enclosures that have a thick, dark buildup
of dirt and grime on the access doors. There are five dogs housed in these enclosures. The buildup of dirt and
grime can increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures must be sanitized once every two weeks, and more often if necessary, to prevent the
accumulation of dirt and grime. The access doors must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks in
order to stop the buildup of dirt and grime and reduce the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all
surfaces within the dog enclosures are free of accumulations of dirt and grime.
