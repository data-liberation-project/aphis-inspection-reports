ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete. Sections 1, 3 and 4 of APHIS form 7002
have not been completely filled out. The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending
veterinarian establishing standards of care for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the
health and well-being of the animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated
animals at the facility and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The coroplast lining in the rabbit enclosures is chewed at the edges and overly soiled throughout. Failure to
maintain facilities, including enclosures, poses a risk of injury to the animals. Additionally, an overly soiled material
does not allow for adequate cleaning/sanitization of the enclosure. Housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally
sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to
restrict the entrance of other animals.

***The shade cloth in the capybara enclosure was torn with frayed edges with long strands of the fibers accessible
to the animal. The frayed strands pose a risk to this animal for ingestion and intestinal obstruction. The affected
structures must be repaired or replaced. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
