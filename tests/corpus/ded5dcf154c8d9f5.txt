In Pen 13, there is one grey adult female guinea pig with poor body condition and 80-90% hair loss. This animal has
an abnormal body posture, with her hind limbs partially or completely extended out behind her, depending on her
position. When attempting to move, her hind limbs appear weak, and she was not able to bear weight on them at
the time of inspection. On palpation, her hind limbs are cool to the touch. This animal had been identified by the
licensee over the weekend. The attending veterinarian has not been contacted prior to inspection. Direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to convey problems of animal health is required to ensure
the provision of adequate veterinary care.
The attending veterinarian must be contacted to direct care for this animal. To be corrected by June 5, 2019.
