FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure # 403 housing 36 sheep has old pig feeders along the east side of the enclosure. Several of
the flaps were missing, unsecured, or broken on these feeders, posing a risk of injury should a sheep step into or
onto one of these feeders.
The outdoor enclosure housing 2 reagent steers had a cement feeder on the southeast side that was in disrepair.
Broken cement pieces were in and around the feeder and a bolt was protruding from the broken side, posing a risk
of injury.
Enclosures housing animals should be monitored for areas that could be hazardous to the animals and maintained
in good repair to protect them from injury.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by 2/23/2015.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor enclosure housing 2 reagent steers had two large areas of standing water that was dark brown in color.
One of the areas was within the pathway for the steers to get to their mineral block so the animals would have to
walk through this pool of fluid to access the feed supplement.
Standing water poses a risk for attracting pests, promoting the growth of microbial organisms, and limits the mobility
of the animals in this enclosure.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The method of drainage shall comply with
applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of theenvironment.
To be corrected by 2/17/2015.
