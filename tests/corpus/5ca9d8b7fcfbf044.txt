2.33(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Daily veterinary observations and husbandry care for two hamsters did not occur on a Sunday. Based on an IACUC
investigation report, a scheduling error led to this incident. No negative physiological effects were noted upon the
discovery of the weekend day oversight the following day. The hamsters had adequate water and feed over the weekend.
The IACUC approved a corrective action plan to prevent future occurrences of missed daily observations and husbandry.
Not providing daily observations of the animals can lead to negative effects on the health and wellbeing of the animals.
3.129(b)

Feeding.
Several rooms of swine housed in the finger barns had unsanitary food receptacles, which were contaminated with grime
and brown material. Unclean food receptacles can be a source for infection and disease transmission. Per the
regulations, food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times. Corrected during inspection.

This inspection (17-18Oct2022) and exit interview (18Oct2022) were conducted with facility representatives.
