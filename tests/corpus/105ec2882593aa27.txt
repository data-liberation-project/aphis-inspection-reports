3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four dog doors in the Sheltered housing facility had an excessive buildup of dirt and grime on their surfaces,
appearing as dark brown material on the dog doors. Dirt and grime can harbor organisms that can cause disease in
dogs. The licensee must spot-clean and sanitize hard surfaces that come into contact with the dogs as often as
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
This was a focused inspection of the non-compliant items listed on the January 15, 2015 inspection report. For item
2.40(b)(2), the adult male French Bulldog named "Pierre" has had his toenails clipped. For item 2.40(a)(1), the
Attending Veterinarian has conducted an inspection of the dogs and the facility. For item 3.1(c)(3), the licensee has
cleaned only two of the six dog doors.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
