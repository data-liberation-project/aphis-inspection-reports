Contingency planning.
Although the Licensee has developed and there is a Contingency Plan in place, the part-time weekend animal caretakers
have not been trained on the Plan.

Per this Section, exhibitors must provide training for their personnel regarding their roles and responsibilities as outlined in
the Contingency Plan. Training of personnel on the provisions of the facility’s Contingency Plan ensures all employees are
familiar with the Plan and the animals receive proper care during emergency situations. Correct by 2/6/23.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representative.
