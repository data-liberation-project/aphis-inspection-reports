Facilities, general.
A fence post in disrepair in the southeast corner of the bison enclosure. The fence post is leaning inward, towards the
enclosure and can be moved a few inches when pressure is applied. Additionally, there are two small gaps between the
bottom of the fence and the ground, located between northeast and southeast corners of the enclosure. The fence post
could potentially break and the gaps and could allow unauthorized animals into the enclosure. Ensure the bison
enclosure fence and fence posts are maintained in good repair.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 7-23-22 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
