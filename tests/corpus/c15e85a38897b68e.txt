3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
Bags of food and bedding and unsealed mineral blocks are are directly on the floor in a building which has evidence of
vermin present. There is one bag of food with a tear in it. Supplies of food and bedding should be stored in a manner that
protects such supplies against deterioration and contamination by vermin. Changes in husbandry practices must be
established to ensure the supplies of bedding and food are protected from being soiled and to prevent spoilage and
contamination. Correct by June 6, 2021
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The following housekeeping items were noted within the enclosures or on the premises during the inspection:

1) Unused equipment and supplies are scattered in the open field that alpacas, llamas, sheep, goats, and pigs have
access to roam -. Metal equipment, rusty equipment, old tires, a ladder, empty gas cans, and building materials
2) The remnants of a tree truck located in the mixed small mammal (capybara, cavy, kangaroos, wallaby, wallaroo)
outdoor enclosure has splintered leaving pointy wood spikes



Leaving hazardous items in enclosures can lead to animal injury or illnesses. Grounds should be kept in such a manner
that protects the animals from injury. Unnecessary equipment and other structures and items that put the animals at risk
of injury must be removed from the enclosures and/or kept in designated areas away from the animals for their health and
safety.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
The building in which food is stored and prepared, and sometimes animals, has evidence of mice infestation. Mice can be
heard scurrying behind the Styrofoam insulation boards. Near the sink, a couple of holes chewed by mice are located at
the bottom edge of the insulation board. There are gaps in the insulation along the seams and the bottom edge. The foam
used to seal the seams is ineffective in preventing the mice from chewing through. Some spilled feed pellets are seen on
the floor as well as rodent feces and chewed Styrofoam pieces. Mice have chewed the bottom edge of the insulation in
the area near the sink. An effective program for the control of mammalian pests should include husbandry practices that
minimize the attraction of rodents. A safe and effective pest control program must be established and maintained to
prevent the entry and harborage of mice in the animal / food storage building. Correct by June 6, 2021
