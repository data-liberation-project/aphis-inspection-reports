2.31(d)(1)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Inspectors reviewed Protocol # 2013-8707-069 and found that there was no written assurance from the principal
investigator that the animal activities do not unnecessary duplicate previous experiments. Principal investigators
must provide assurance that animal activities are not duplicative in order to ensure that animals are not used in
research activities without appropriate justification, and to ensure that a reduction of the number of animals used is
considered. The IACUC must ensure that all approved proposals to use animals contain written assurance from the
principal investigator that animal activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments.
*****
The aforementioned protocol was updated and re-submitted for IACUC review during the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
