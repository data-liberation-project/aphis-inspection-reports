2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
As a Class C exhibitor with no reported primary site, submitting an itinerary for the traveling animals is crucial to
ensuring that the animals are maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. There has been one
incomplete itinerary submitted to the inspector in September 2016, but not to the the Regional Director or
ACWest@aphis.usda.gov in 2015, 2016 or 2017. Complete and accurate itineraries must be submitted to the
Regional Director with the required information no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel or move in order to
inspect the licensee. Monday, March 20th, Inspector called the 760 number on the paperwork and left a voicemail
asking for itinerary/location in order to conduct inspection, with no response in 3 days.
In accordance with 2.126(c) a written itinerary is required to be submitted to the Regional Director at
ACWest@aphis.usda.gov no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate
information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's
approved site. As defined in the regulation, the itinerary shall include the following:
(i) The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes,
including any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is
leased, borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who owns such animal;
(ii) The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and age
of each animal; and
(iii) The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,
including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require
removal of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length shall be reported to the
AC Regional Director the next APHIS business day. APHIS Regional offices are available each weekday, except on
Federal holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
