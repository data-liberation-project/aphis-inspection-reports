ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:41am on
10-AUG-17.
When we arrived at the facility at 9:41 am, there was no call button or another means to contact anyone at the
facility. There was also no cell phone service at the facility to call the owner. We left the facility to find a place to
obtain cell phone service. We called the facility representative at 9:43 am, 10:01 am, and 10:20 am and left a
message with a call-back number regarding the attempted inspection. We left the area at 10:21 am.
