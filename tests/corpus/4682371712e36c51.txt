ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There are two marmosets housed at the facility, however there was no documentation describing the plan for
environmental enhancement to promote social well-being for non-human primates. The facility was providing
various forms of enrichment, such as swings, toys, various edible treats and daily human interaction, however this
was not being documented. All facilities housing non human primates must have a documented environmental
enrichment plan as prescribed and reviewed by the attending veterinarian.
