3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the Hoop Building there are nine metal watering receptacles located between animal enclosures that are not
being used. The metal surface of these watering receptacles were excessively rusty with flaking in areas. These
surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. This can increase the disease potential for the 40 adult dogs
housed in the enclosures.
All metal surfaces (metal watering receptacles) must be free of excessive rust or removed. This will allow for proper
cleaning and sanitization and preserve the structural strength of the surface. As a result this will allow for adequate
cleaning and sanitization. Thus, decreasing the disease potential for the dogs.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* In the Hoop Building there were six plastic dog houses. The area around the doorways of these houses was
excessively chewed and scratched. There was brown to grey debris in the chewed areas. These surfaces are not
in good repair and prevent required cleaning and sanitization. This can increase the disease potential for the 20
adult dogs.
All surfaces or plastic surfaces must be kept in good repair. This will allow for the required cleaning and sanitization
of the surfaces. Therefore, decreasing the disease hazards to the animals.
