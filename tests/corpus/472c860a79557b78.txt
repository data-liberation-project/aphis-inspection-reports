ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs had injuries that had not been noted at the time of inspection. A Shiba Inu (microchip #018-619-858) was
noted to be limping on its left front leg during inspection. The leg was noticeably swollen. On the inner upper part
of the dog's arm, there was a small amount of hair loss with what appeared to be a scab or dried up blood. The
licensee had not noticed the dog was limping prior to inspection. A swollen leg can be painful and can lead to an
infection which can be deadly. The dog must be seen by a Veterinarian no later than 11-10-15.
Another dog, a Poodle (microchip #018-637-584), had a scab with hair loss on its left side. A scab with hair loss
indicates the dog may have been injured somehow. Injuries can be painful and can become infected. This dog
must be seen by a Veterinarian no later than 11-16-15.
3.7(b)
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
During the inspection two Shiba Inu's were growling at each other, showing teeth at one another, barking in each
other's faces, and snapping their jaws at each other. The dogs' microchip ID numbers were 018-619-858 and
018-772-587. Also, while reviewing paperwork from the inspection, it was noted that a Female Poodle (microchip ID
#004-513-793) had died in a fight. The dog was born on 6-9-15. The date of death was not noted, but the licensee
stated the dog was approximately four months of age when she died. Dogs must be compatibly grouped together.
Failure to do so can result in injuries which can be painful for the dogs and can result in death such as the Female
Poodle that is noted above. Correct by 11-10-15.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
