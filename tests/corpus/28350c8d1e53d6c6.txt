ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A male cream and white bulldog (with no ID) was found with red masses of tissue on inner corners of both eyes.
These masses appear to be a condition commonly known as "cherry eye". There was no written documentation
that the facility had addressed this problem or that the attending veterinarian was notified of this problem. This dog
requires veterinary attention. Failure to provide veterinary care to animals in the kennel can result in pain and
suffering in the dogs. Correct this by having this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian and following all
recommended treatments. The licensee must maintain documentation of treatments and exam for future inspection
by APHIS officials.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** A male cream and white bulldog was found with no official identification. A cage card on the enclosure housing
this dog states "born 5/5/15 bulldog". This date of birth means this dog is at least 6 months of age. Official ID is
required for this dog. Failure to provide identification for all dogs make animal tracking difficult, impedes the
inspection process, and is especially important in the event of a disease outbreak. Correct this by properly
identifying this and all dogs in the kennel.
