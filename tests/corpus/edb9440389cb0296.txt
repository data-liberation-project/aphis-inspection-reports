ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230pm on
02/20/2015.
I knocked on the door with no answer, and then called the licensee who advised they were at work and unable to
come to the residence to conduct an inspection. There was no one else available on this date to conduct an
inspection.
