3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a large mound of animal feces and old bedding laying approximately 2 foot in front of the warthog
enclosure. The inspector observed several flies swarming around the mound of animal waste. The mound of
animal waste can potentially promote disease hazard and attract pests to the facility. Eliminate the animal waste
through proper disposal from the facility as often as necessary to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease
hazards.
