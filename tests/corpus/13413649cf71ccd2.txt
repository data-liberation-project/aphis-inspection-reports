Facilities, general.
* The interior fiberglass wallboard in the bear enclosure has several areas of missing fiberglass wallboard. Torn,
missing wallboard with jagged, sharp edges were observed. The fiberglass wallboard is attached to the interior wood
wall. One black bear is in contact with the affected fiberglass wall board located in outdoor housing. Jagged, sharp
edges could cause potential injury to the bear. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces must be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 10/28/21

Sanitation.
* Bird droppings were observed accumulating on the storage shelf and on the cement flooring located under both
interior enclosure gates. The affected area is located in the red fox / racoon building. One red fox and one racoon are in
contact with the affected area. The facility has no effective pest prevention program in place. No means to control or
eliminate the birds were observed. Bird droppings can create unsanitary conditions in the facility. Birds can spread
disease and contaminate food supplies. The licensee must establish an effective program for the control of insects and
external parasites that are pests. This program must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-
being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in the animal area. Correct by 10/12/21.
