HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During inspection there were multiple broken linoleum floor tiles with visible gaps in flooring observed in the
whelping room and the kitchen area. At the time of inspection there were dogs in the whelping room and nine dogs
in the kitchen area.
Broken floor tiles with exposed gaps may allow moisture, urine and excreta to build up between or underneath floor
tiles. This makes it difficult to adequately clean and sanitize those floor areas in which dogs are being kept.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized, must be
replaced when worn or soiled.
