FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** There were four rabbits in an outdoor enclosure that did not have shade sufficient enough to keep the rabbits out
of the direct sun. The temperature was 92 degrees F behind the shelter and it was 102 degrees F in the other areas
of the enclosure using the raytek minitemp gun. The rabbits were breathing heavily and they were all trying to get
behind the shelter from the direct sun which was not sufficient for all of the rabbits to stay cool. When sunlight is
likely to cause overheating and discomfort, sufficient shade shall be provided to allow all rabbits kept outdoors to
protect themselves from the direct rays of the sun. The atmospheric temperature must not exceed 90 degrees F.
There needs to be another means of artificial cooling in place to alleviate overheating and discomfort for the rabbits.
This was corrected by removing the rabbits before the exit briefing.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the program manager.
