Water quality.
There were several dates during the months of March, April and May 2022 where the total chlorine readings in the pools
Dolphin East, Dolphin West, Dolphin Far West and Dolphin Main were above 1PPM. Industry standards set the maximum
level of total chlorine at 1.0PPM. Total chlorine is a measurement of both free chlorine and chloramines. Chloramines are
much more irritating to an animal’s skin, eyes and lungs than free chlorine. Total chlorine levels above 1.0PPM over long
periods of time can cause marine mammals skin, respiratory, and eye issues. Constant management and maintaining
chlorine levels below 1.0 PPM is necessary to maintain the health and welfare of the marine mammals.
3.106(b)(3) Repeat

Water quality.
There were at least two coliform readings for the pools (Dolphin East, Dolphin West, Dolphin Far West and Dolphin Main)
that were not taken at the required 7 day intervals. Timely and accurate testing for coliform counts is required to quickly
identify harmful levels of bacterial counts and effectively maintain water quality standards. Water samples shall be taken
and tested at least weekly for coliform count.
