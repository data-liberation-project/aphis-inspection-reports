2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several chinchillas were noticed to have rough, dry haircoats. One predominantly grey breeder chinchilla was noted
to have small patches of hairloss on its head and face in addition to a rough dry haircoat. Some of the hairs
appeared broken/shortened. The attending veterinarian needs to examine the chinchillas with abnormal haircoats in
order to make a diagnosis and institute a treatment plan. Correct by 9/4/15.
3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two open bags of bedding were noted on the floor: one of wood shavings and one of equine bedding pellets.
Rodent droppings were noted on the floors in the same rooms. All open bags of supplies of food and bedding need
to be kept stored in a manner, such as in a closed container with a lid, that will adequately protect such supplies
against contamination by vermin and spoilage. Correct by 8/24/15.
3.26(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Upon entering the building housing the animals, a distinct low level ammonia odor was detected in the first room
that was housing hamsters. The ammonia odor became much stronger in the second room housing the guinea pigs
and chinchillas. The only source of fresh air for the rooms was one small window airconditioner. A ceiling fan was
operational but just recirculated the stale air. Ammonia odors and poor ventilation can lead to discomfort to the
animals and can lead to health issues. The indoor animal housing area shall be provided with fresh air and shall be
ventilated so as to minimize odors. Correct by 9/12/15.3.31(b)
SANITATION.
The rooms housing the animals (including hamsters, guinea pigs and chinchillas) need cleaning. There are
numerous cobwebs on all surfaces including the window, walls, airconditioner and light bulbs. There is spilled feed
and hay on the floor along with rodent pellets. Tools and other materials not relating to the animals' care are lying
on top of cages. The curtains/window hangings/door hangings are musty and dirty and need washing. There is a
broken window on the same floor of the house in a room adjacent to the animals room. A hanging quilt forms the
door from the room with the broken window to the animal room-pests and other unwanted animals may enter
through the broken window. The front porch adjacent to the door leading into the animal facility is piled high with
empty cages some containing bedding and feed-these may attract unwanted pest animals. The premises including
the animal facility building and the grounds need to be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices. Correct by 9/12/15.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
Rodent droppings were noted on the floor in both animal rooms and on the windowsill and window airconditioner
ledge. Rodents can carry diseases that could be transmitted to the animals in the facility. An effective program for
the control of insects, ectoparasites and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct
by 9/21/15.
3.125(a) DIRECT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Upon entering the room housing the chinchillas, one chincilla was noted to have its head and part of its neck
extending outside of its enclosure. The enclosure was stacked on another enclosure and was about 3 ft above the
ground. The chincilla had pushed up on a movable door section of the caging wire of the enclosure that had been
fastened with a carabiner type clip at the top but had no fastening on the bottom. The carabiner clip allowed the
chincilla to push up the door about an inch to an inch and a half which gave the chincilla enough room to stick out its
head and neck. The chincilla was able to be freed from the opening and appeared unhurt. The chincilla may injure
itself on the current enclosure setup and if it escapes, it would fall to the ground which would also lead to injury. A
second clip was added as a temporary measure to the enclosure. All enclosures must be constructed and
maintained in such a manner that they are in good repair and protect the animals from injury and contain the
animals. Correct by 8/24/15.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The chinchilla enclosures need cleaning. The room housing the chincillas has a strong ammonia odor. The
chincillas have equine bedding pellets in the trays underneath the wire bottoms of their enclosures. The bedding
has become soaked with urine and expanded in size to the extent that the pellets are now covering the wire bottoms
of the enclosures in areas. Thus the chinchillas are touching/sitting on the the urine soaked pellets in some
enclosures. Buildup of wet pellets/bedding material leads to odors, possible disease transmission and soiling of the
animals. Excreta shall be removed as often as necessary from the primary enclosures to prevent contamination of
the animals and to minimize disease hazards and odors. Correct by 8/24/15.
