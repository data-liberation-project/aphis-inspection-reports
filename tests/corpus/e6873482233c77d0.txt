PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The transport crates used to transport the prairie dogs were not tall enough/high enough to allow the prairie dogs to
sit normally. The crates, accounting for bedding, only provided about 4 in. of height. This height did not allow the
older prairie dogs to sit up in their normal position. Lack of adequate space prevents the animals from making
normal postural adjustments and may lead to distress. All primary enclosures used to transport live animals shall be
large enough to ensure that each animal has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural
adjustments. Correct from this inspection forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
This inspection was conducted at the Espresso Exotic Animal Expo in Cowan, TN.
