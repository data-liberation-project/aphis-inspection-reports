WATERING.
Goat and sheep enclosures: The automatically filling water receptacle in the goat pen broke overnight, causing a
constant overflow of water and a puddle in the adjacent enclosure. The water was turned off by the animal
caretakers earlier in the morning and there was no water available in the water receptacle at the time of inspection
for the goat or sheep pens.
The situation was immediately corrected by refilling the receptacles and turning the water off to prevent continued
spill over, and there is a plan to fix the mechanism today. One goat came over and drank water as the receptacle
was filling, but only drank for 10-20 seconds. When the automatic water supply is shut off, either additional water
receptacles should be available or the water should be manually turned on as often as needed to maintain fresh
water for the animals until the automatic system is working again.
Access to sufficient potable water is required to maintain the health and well-being of animals and is also critical for
maintenance of body temperature on warm and sunny summer days. A system of maintenance of the water
receptacles and provision of adequate potable water is required to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.
