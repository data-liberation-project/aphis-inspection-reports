Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On November 28th, 2021, two separate rooms containing rabbits and hamsters were not checked by animal care staff.
According to facility representatives, the daily observations did not occur due to miscommunication between animal care
staff scheduled to do weekend observations. The rabbits and hamsters were checked on Saturday November 27th, 2021.
On Monday November 29th, the animals were assessed. According to the Attending Veterinarian, the animals were
healthy. The rabbits and hamsters had access to food and water. Daily observations of all animals are required to
assess their health and well-being.

This was corrected at the time of inspection by establishing additional schedule monitoring procedures.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conducted 12/06/2021 to 12/07/2021.
