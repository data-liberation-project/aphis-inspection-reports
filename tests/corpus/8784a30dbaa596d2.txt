ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The black female goat n the large run is limping on her left front leg. When standing she is hesitant to put it down
and place weight on it. There are no records documenting her condition. This goat shall be examined by the
veterinarian and appropriate treatment provided.
The large white pig that is allowed to roam free in the park was observed recumbent. When the licensee attempted
to wake her she had great difficulty rising to her feet. Once she was up she attempted to walk but was not able to.
This pig shall be examined by the veterinarian and appropriate treatment provided.
There are three very thin sheep in the main sheep pen, two adult and one juvenile, and there is a bobcat that is thin
as well. The flank area of these animals is sunken in and the boney prominence of their hip bones and spine are
prominent. These animals shall be examined by the veterinarian and appropriate treatment provided.
There are three or more goats in the large goat pen that have thinning hair and bald spots. There is a large white
female sheep that has balding areas on her abdomen and front leg that are very pink and shiny. In some areas the
skin is flaking. The goats were previously under treatment for this same condition which had improved and the hair
was growing back, but it now appears that the condition is recurring. These goats shall be examined by the
veterinarian and appropriate treatment provided.
The small black and white pig in the pen with two other pigs is unsteady on her feet. The pig was observed
staggering and stumbling when attempting to climb into the house. Once in the house the pig just stood leaning
against the wall with her legs crossing or slanted abnormally beneath her. This pig shall be examined by the
veterinarian and appropriate treatment provided.
There is a white Ram sheep in the hospital area with several other sheep . The Ram is limping on his right forelimb.
This was observed and documented earlier in the day by the employee. This sheep shall be examined and
appropriate treatment provided.3.52(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The rabbits currently housed in the hospital area are in stacked stainless steel cages beneath a shelter roof. There
is minimal (less than an inch of shavings) bedding provided in these enclosures for the rabbits which will provide no
protection from the wind and the cold. Currently the atmospheric temperature in this location is dropping into the
low 30's (farenheit). Exposure to cold temperatures for extended periods of time may result in illness or death.
Shelter must be provided to protect the rabbits from the cold when the atmospheric temperature drops below 40
degrees F

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two (2) goats, at the beginning of the walk through area, have an area cut out in the fencing, where they can put
their heads through it, in order to be fed by the public. Where the wire was cut, there are several protruding wires,
with sharp points facing into the opening. Each time one of the goats pokes it's head in, or pulls it out, of the cut
hole, there is a chance of the animal scraping or being scratched by the protruding points. All facilities must be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Three (3) bobcats are being housed in a corn crib. There is a small area of secondary wire placed over a hole in the
initial wiring of the crib. This secondary wire is old, corroded, and has sharp points. The condition of the secondary
wire could result in injury to the animals involved. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such
strength as appropriate for protecting the animals from injury and to contain the animals from escape.
In the Hospital area, there are two enclosures containing goats, and sheep. Around the back and side area of these
two enclosures are panels that are beginning to rust, and are not securely attached to the wall, creating a gap. This
is allowing for a possible injury to the animals contained in those areas. These panels need to be removed,
repaired, or replaced to maintain a safe environment for the animals.
There is an enclosure with two (2) pigs. In the rear of the enclosure, the fencing does not meet the ground, leaving
a gap in between. This gap is a large enough opening that an animal from the outside could enter the pigs
enclosure. Repair of this area is necessary to protect the animals from harm and to eliminate the possibility of other
animals entering.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter currently provided for the deer is a roof with no sides. The natural surroundings in the enclosure are not
enough to provide sufficient protection from the wind and cold. A shelter shall be provided that will protect the deer
and prevent discomfort during inclement weather.
The four adult goats, one sheep and two baby goats currently housed in the same pen in the hospital area do not
have a shelter. Insufficient protection from the wind and cold can result in illness or death. Adequate shelter shall
be provided to protect these animals from the cold and prevent discomfort.
The large pen housing seventeen goats has a raised house with no access and two dog igloos provided for shelter.
. This is insufficient housing for the number of goats in the enclosure. Additional shelter shall be provided to allow
all of the goats access to shelter from the wind and cold.
There is no bedding, or minimal bedding provided in the enclosure with the small black and white pig and two larger
pigs. With the current temperatures dropping into the low 30's additional bedding shall be provided to protect the
pigs from the cold and prevent discomfort.

(c) Drainage
***The pig enclosures that have dirt floors, do not provide any dry surface area for the pigs during extensive rain.
The only dry area was observed in the pigs primary housing. The pigs were observed sinking down into the mud
while walking around the pen with no dry area to stand or lay if they want to get out of the mud. Although pigs enjoy
mud they must have dry surfaces as well. Constant exposure to wet, soggy ground can lead to disease and illness.
Proper drainage must be provided to efficiently remove excess water to prevent the muddy conditions and provide
for the health and well being of the pigs.3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The elevated platform in the enclosure containing 4 Bear, has a build up of hair, dirt, leaves, feces, and other debris,
around all the edges. The area has visibly not been cleaned and sanitized in an appropriate length of time to
maintain a clean and safe enviroment. This accumulation of debris can harbor contaminants, and cause a risk
factor of disease for the animals involved. Sanitizing and appropriate cleaning is to take place as often as necessary
to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
