3.75(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for three guenon and two eastern black and white colobus had a significant amount of rust on the
brackets securing the water spickets in place, adjacent to where the animals drink. Excessive rust can prevent
effective sanitization of the surface, which may affect the health of the animals through buildup of pathogens.
Surfaces which come into contact with nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust and constructed in such a
manner to promote effective cleaning and sanitization of the surface and preserve structural strength. Correct by

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor enclosure for seven red river hogs was covered with mud and no dry area was available. An area that
doesn’t drain and allows water and mud to accumulate has the potential to cause sanitation related diseases. A
suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by May 15, 2017.
