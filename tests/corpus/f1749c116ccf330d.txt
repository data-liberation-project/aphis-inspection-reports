FACILITIES, INDOOR.
A wood board in between two rabbit enclosures has not be sealed and is therefore not impervious to moisture which
doesn't allow it to be readily sanitized. The board either needs to be removed, replaced, or sealed so it is
impervious to moisture. Correct by 8/13/19.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
An enclosure containing 16 rabbits had a large amount of feces buildup in the corner of the enclosure, in the beds
that were provided for four bunnies, and the container below the enclosure used to collect the feces was overflowing
with fecal material. The four bunnies were sitting in fecal material. There was a strong odor coming from the
building in which this enclosure was in. Rabbits sitting in feces can contribute to the spread of disease not only
among the rabbits, but also any person that may come into contact with those rabbits. The enclosure should be
cleaned on a more regular basis so it doesn't get to the point that the rabbits have no choice but to sit in their own
feces. Correct immediately.

WATERING.
The water in the goat and sheep enclosure that contained 7 goats and 11 sheep was slightly brownish in color.
When the lid was removed from the top of the waterer, crud was floating around in the water. The licensee stated
the water was changed two weeks ago. The water for the three pigs was changed three days ago. The water in
those containers was green in color. Unsanitary water could be contaminated with various types of parasites which
could cause illness or disease for the animals. All watering receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. From here
on out, the water needs to be changed on a more regular basis so gunk doesn't build up and the water doesn't
change to a brownish or greenish color. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.End of report.
