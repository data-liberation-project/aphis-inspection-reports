2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** In building #2 there was a female Shih-Tzu (chip# 941000016564114) with a discharge surrounding both eyes.
The hair appeared to be wet and darkened in a streak-like fashion encircling both eyes. Upon closer observation,
the fluid-like discharge was cloudy and pink in color. Clumps of dark brown to black material were observed in the
hair surrounding the eye and appeared concentrated in the corner of the eye. Also, the eyes appeared watery and
the pink tissues lining the eyelids (conjunctiva) appeared to be mildly inflamed. Upon further examination this dog
also had an accumulation of brown material coating over 50% of the surface of all of her teeth. The gum line had
receded up and away from the cheek teeth exposing a 1/2cm of a tooth root on the upper right hand side. These
signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease, can be painful, lead to the development of other health
problems, and can inhibit the ability of the animal to eat normally. According to the licensee, he had not noticed this
dog's condition until it was pointed out by the inspectors. The licensee scheduled an appointment with the attending
veterinarian in the afternoon, the same day as the inspection to get the animal evaluated, diagnosed, and treated.
**** In building #2 there was a female Bichon Frise (chip# 497F301973) with a matted shut right eye and the globe
of the eye wasn't visible due to the excessive matting in the hair on the eye. While observing the dog's eyes, the
dog would frequently move its head from side to side. There was debris in the hair on and surrounding the eye,
blocking view of the eye. Clumps of brown to tan material were observed in the hair obscuring the eye. The
attending veterinarian had been contacted and an appointment was made for later that day.
* The watery eyes and/or discharge and matting on or around the eyes could be the result of injury, infection or
other veterinary condition which may cause discomfort. The licensee must have these animals examined in order to
ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed.
