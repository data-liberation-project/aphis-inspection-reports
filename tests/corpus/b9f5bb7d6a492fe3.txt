2.40(b)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The Program of Veterinary Care that was established has not been maintained with the acquisition of new species. The
PVC does not contain information related to the care of the red kangaroo and the capybara.
Without adequate guidance by the Attending Veterinarian within the PVC, improper care and subsequent negative impact
upon the health of animals under care may occur.
The PVC must be updated currently and whenever a new species is acquired to provide Licensee with direction for their
care.
