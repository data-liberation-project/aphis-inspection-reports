2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A report of the semiannual evaluations was prepared and submitted to the IO in May 2020; the next report submitted to
the IO was updated in May 2021. The IACUC conducted the required semiannual program and facility evaluations in
November 2020 but no report was prepared or submitted to the IO at that time. The report to the IO was therefore not
updated at least once every six months. Per this section of the regulations, reports to the IO shall be updated at least
once every six months on completion of the required semiannual evaluations.

To be corrected from this point forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
