2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A research proposal for activities involving Nile rats does not contain a complete description of the proposed use of
animals. The study is designed to investigate the impact of feeding experimentally manipulated diets. The research
proposal does not contain a complete description of the experimental diets being fed, the potential adverse effects of the
specific experimental diets, or proposed responses to those potential adverse effects. This information is required for
IACUC review of activities involving animals. Proposals to conduct activity involving animals must contain a complete
description of the proposed use of animals.

2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On February 1, 2021, a Nile rat enrolled on a diet study was observed to be sick by animal facility staff. On evaluation, the
animal was noted to have lost "almost 50%" of total body weight and was provided adequate veterinary care at that time.
Weight loss to this degree takes time to progress and indicates a serious problem of animal health or well-being that was
not identified until the condition was severe. Animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being and the


veterinarian must be provided with timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, or well-being.
Correct from this point forward.
2.38(b)(1)(iv)

Miscellaneous.
An IACUC approved protocol includes routine monitoring of individual animal weights. Records of animal weights could
not be provided to the USDA inspector to determine that the protocol was followed as approved by the IACUC. The facility
must ensure that at the time of inspection the USDA inspector is able to review documentation that is requested as
necessary to enforce the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.
Correct from this point forward.
2.38(f)(1)

Miscellaneous.
An IACUC approved procedure space used for study procedures on Nile rats was found to be soiled on inspection. For
these procedures, the animals are restrained in a chamber for the induction of gas anesthesia. Used bedding and fecal
material is present at the bottom of 3 of the chambers and more used bedding is present on the material used to cover the
procedure table. A disposable glove, which is attached to the anesthetic gas hose and used to create the chamber’s seal,
is soiled with dried reddish brown material. Exposure of animals to the used bedding, excreta, or blood of other animals
during study procedures may cause unnecessary behavioral stress in the animals. Handling of animals shall be done as
carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause behavioral stress or unnecessary discomfort.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
