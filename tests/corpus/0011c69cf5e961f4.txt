3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An unforeseen accident caused the death of a bobcat on 8-2-17. The zoo director stated the young bobcat was
able to climb out of its enclosure and a young Siberian lynx being fed in its vicinity attacked it before the person
supervising the animals could separate them. The bobcat enclosure did not adequately contain it to protect it from
the lynx. The facility described reasonable steps to be taken prior to housing young bobcats.
All animals must be housed in enclosures that prevent their escape.
To be corrected: From this day forward
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility president.
