Sanitation.
In the outdoor pens (69 animals total- hoofstocks, exotics, foxes) there was a large amount of baler twine on the ground in
every pen, along with tarps and pieces of other trash and debris on the ground. One alpaca was observed to have a loop
of twine around its neck. Twine and other debris can be ingested or cause physical injury or entrapment which could lead
to serious injury or death.


Animal housing areas should be always kept clean and clear of trash and debris to protect the animals from injury.
The loop of twine around the alpaca was removed at the time of inspection. Correct by February 16, 2022.
