1) In row 3, there was an enclosure with two of the five adult guinea pigs with hair loss and one dead guinea pig.
An adult white guinea pig had hair loss and a large scab on the top of its back with thinning hair on its sides. An
adult tricolor guinea pig had a circular area of hair loss on the left side of its mouth.
2) In row 3, there was an enclosure with one of the five adult guinea pigs with hair loss and two dead guinea pigs.
An adult tricolor guinea pig had hair loss on its sides.
3) In row 4, there was an enclosure with four of the five adult guinea pigs with hair loss and five dead guinea pigs.
An adult black guinea pig had hair loss on the back half of its body. An adult tricolor guinea pig had hair loss on its
rear end. An adult gray and white guinea pig had hair loss over most of its body. An adult brown and white guinea
pig had thinning hair on the back half of its body.
4) In row 4, there was an enclosure with two of five adult guinea pigs with hair loss and one dead guinea pig. An
adult white guinea pig had hair loss on the top of its back and another adult white guinea pig had hair loss and
thinning on its sides. Also in the same enclosure there was an adult tan guinea pig with an open sore behind its
right shoulder.
There were no records of these guinea pigs receiving any diagnosis or treatment. The licensee informed the APHIS
officials that he was treating some guinea pigs for ringworm, but the treatment was not under the direction of the
attending veterinarian. The medication shown to the APHIS officials was not approved by the attending
veterinarian. There were dead guinea pigs found in the same enclosures as the guinea pigs with skin and/or hair
loss problems. The licensee must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use
of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The guinea pigs must be
examined and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian to prevent death and suffering.

2.40(b)(3) DIRECTATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection there were 10 adult guinea pigs observed with hair loss and/or sores or scabs descirbed in
Section 2.40(b)(2). There were also at least 19 dead guinea pigs in the enclosures with the live guinea pigs. The
attending veterinarian has not been notified of the conditions of these animals. Based on the number of dead
guinea found and the number of animals needing care, daily observations either are not performed or are not
performed adequately. Dead animals must be removed from enclosures at least daily for the health of the
remaining animals. A failure to conduct adequate oberservations with direct communication with the attending
veterinarian can result in a delay of care provided to the animals and prolong animal suffering. All animals must be
observed daily to assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with
the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are
conveyed.
Correct by November 14, 2014.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on October 16, 2014, records of animal births and deaths were not been maintained
for the guinea pigs. Records must be kept on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program,
and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal births and
death are kept and maintained.
Correct from this day forward.
3.28(a)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The solid floors of the primary enclosures for guinea pigs were covered with feces. There was little or no bedding
present. There was no area with clean bedding in the guinea pig enclosures for the animals to get out of the fecal
material. Not having clean bedding exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacteria, fungi and
parasites. Primary enclosure with solid floor must be provided with clean bedding for the health and comfort of the
animals
Correct by November 14, 2014.
3.31(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Fecal material covered the floors of the enclosures housing the guinea pigs. Little or no bedding was observed inthe guinea pig enclosures, The guinea pigs were oberved standing, sitting and nesting in the fecal droppings. The
fecal material consolidated into a moist fecal pad on the floor area by the automatic waterer. The guinea pigs and
their offspring could not avoid the feces. There were no areas with clean bedding for the animals. Dead animals
were observed in the feces covered enclosures as well as animals with hair loss and/or sores/scabs.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are still not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations
of excreta. Most of the enclosures had no bedding. The licensee stated that rows 1, 2, and 4 were cleaned about
two weeks ago and row 3 had not been cleaned in three weeks. The cleaning process (method and frequency)
utilized is not effective in removing this fecal accumulation inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation
exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures
must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding and must be sanitized at
least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough
to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(4) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
The licensee again stated during the inspection that they have not started a sanitation program yet. During this
inspection dead animals and guinea pigs needing veterinnary care were observed. Lack of a sanitation program
exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures
must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as necessary with proper agents to sufficiently disinfect all
surfaces that the guinea pigs may come into contact. Sanitation of primary enclosures is necessary to minimize risk
of disease to the animals housed therein. Correct by ensuring a sanitation program is put into effect.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping. There were accumulations of feces, dirt, and debris by the automatic water valves for the enclosures
housing 674 guinea pigs. These accumulations around the water valves and PVC drain pipes expose the guinea
pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi and parasites. The licensee is treating some guinea pigs for
ringworm and there are guinea pigs with generalized hair loss. Inadeqaute cleaning of the automatic water valves
and PVC drain pipes can result in contamination of the guinea pig colony. The wate valves and PVC drain pipes
must be kept clean to ensure the health and well-being of the guinea pigs. The licensee cleaned the water valves
and PVC drain pipes during this inspection. Licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water
valves and PVC drain pipes clean.Correct from this day forward.
3.32 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The facility does not appear to have a sufficient number of employees to adequately care for the number of guinea
pigs being housed and to keep up with the general conditions in the facility.This facility has been cited previously for
inadequate cleaning and sanitation. Guinea pig enclosure have not been cleaned in two or more weeks and
enclosures have accumulations of excreta. The enclosure floors are covered in excreta so that animals can not
avoid the feces. Daily observations, removing dead animals and providing veterinary care to the animals is not
being done adequately. A sanitation program has not been implemented since the last inspecton. Insufficient
employees allows cleaning, sanitation and housekeeping to fall behind; inadequate veterinary care; and inadequate
removal of dead animals. These conditions can pose health risks to the animals. Correct by ensuring that an
adequate number of employees are present to adequately care for the guinea pigs so that appropriate animal health
and husbandry are maintained.
Remains uncorrected.
Exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
