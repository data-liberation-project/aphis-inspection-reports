six months. The last facility reviews were conducted on Dec. 3, 2015 and June 14,2016. The last protocol reviews
were conducted in February 2016. The facility is currently updating their curriculum has planned for a future
program review. Regular program reviews are necessary to ensure IACUC oversight of the facility's program for
humane care and use of animals. The IACUC shall review the facility's program for humane care and use of
animals at least once every six months.

2.31(d)(1)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The literature search for alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress
to the animals was last conducted 26-October 2012. The facility uses a single set of literature searches to
encompass all program protocols that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress. The facility needs
to update this literature search to ensure that alternatives were not available. This literature search should be
updated as needed but not less than every three years to ensure that the most relevant and up to date information
is used to make decisions.
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is responsible for ensuring that investigators have
avoided or minimized discomfort, distress and pain to the animals; appropriately considered alternatives to any
procedures that may cause more than slight or momentary pain or distress; and consulted with the attending
veterinarian in the planning of the procedures.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.The most current program of veterinary care and exercise plan were reviewed and signed 3-October 2012. Since
that time the attending veterinarian for the facility has changed. This form needs to be updated with the guidance
from the current attending veterinarian and needs to be reviewed and maintained at least annually. Formal
arrangements with the attending veterinarian shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly
scheduled visits to the research facility. Failure to have specific accurate and up-to-date guidance does not ensure
the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has
accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing
a complete and accurate Program of Veterinary Care for the care and use of the animals housed at the facility.
