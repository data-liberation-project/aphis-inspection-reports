CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were excessively tall weeds and grass in the enclosures for the Weimaraners, Bernese Mtn. Dogs, and
Golden Retrievers. Tall weeds and grassses provide habitat for pests such as ticks, fleas, mice, and snakes. The
licensee must ensure that weeds and grasses are controlled so as to facilitate pest control and cleaning of the
premises.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At least 6 adult dogs had ticks attached to their bodies. A Bernese Mountain dog had a bloody area on its back due
to a nest of ticks. Two Wiemaraners had a few ticks on their abdomens. Three Cocker Spaniels had many ticks on
their chests and abdomens. Ticks can result in anemia and can carry diseases that can affect the health of the
dogs. The licensee must establish an effective pest control program for the dogs and the premises.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
