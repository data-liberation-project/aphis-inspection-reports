In the whelping building there are 3 of 5 enclosure wood panel floors and walls that have holes in them or chewed
surfaces through the wood paneling. The second enclosure floor on the left has a 3 inch hole in the front left corner,
and the last enclosure on the left side has a 6 inch hole in the wall below the flap door. There are 2 other enclosures
on the left that have chewed wood around the door inserts or on the wall on the right side of the kennel There are
multiple chewed 2x4s that make up the outdoor run 'doors' that have been chewed and damaged in the first breeder
building.
Chewed wood can cause possible health issues due to splinters entering the mouth or intestines. Chewed surfaces
can not be properly cleaned and sanitized. Holes in the floors and walls can be a source of injury and hold debris
that can cause possible health issues if it can not be cleaned and sanitized.
All chewed wood or damaged surfaces that the dogs come in contact with must be repaired or replaced when worn,
damaged or soiled. All wood must be sealed and intact in order to be properly cleaned and sanitized.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 5 outside runs in the breeder building that have a buildup of feces in the grate flooring that has not been
cleaned out on a daily basis. The outdoor run areas are being picked up on a weekly basis instead of daily pickup.
While most of the feces in most kennels goes through the flooring, there are several runs that have a solid buildup
in one section that does not go through, or the slats have filled in and need to be cleaned out.
The buildup of feces and lack of daily pickup can cause possible health issues if the animals come in continual
contact with feces and debris.
Hard surfaces with which the dogs or cats come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance
with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.
