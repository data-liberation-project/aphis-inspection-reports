3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
On December 30, 2021 the female bobcat escaped the facility again. The door from the shelter of the exhibit to the
exterior portion of the exhibit was not locked, the female bobcat hit the shelter latch and the door opened allowing the
female bobcat access to the outside portion of the enclosure, which allowed it to escape as the exterior portion of the
exhibit had not been repaired from the first escape.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Primary enclosures for wild animals must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to prevent escape from the
enclosure. Primary enclosures must contain the animals to prevent injury or death. The facility has made repairs to the
exterior portion of the exhibit where the male bobcat is currently housed. The facility is no longer attempting to live trap
the escaped female bobcat. All live traps were removed approximately 1 week ago.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Wildlife Education Specialist.
