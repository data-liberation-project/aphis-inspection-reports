2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the building that houses thirteen adult dogs and two puppies there is a bottle of Vetericyn that expired in
December 2012. The licensee stated that she does not use this medication very much. Expired medications may
lose their effectiveness and the health of the dogs may suffer.
The use of expired medications is not considered adequate veterinary care. The expired medication must be either
properly disposed of, clearly marked as expired by the licensee, or moved to a physically separate location from any
current medications. The licensee disposed of the expired Vetericyn during the inspection. The licensee must
ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Correction date: Corrected during inspection
Exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and facility representative.
