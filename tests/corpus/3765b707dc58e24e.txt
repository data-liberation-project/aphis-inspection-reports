2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This was a focused inspection regarding the status of a lion cub named "Lucie".
A female lion cub named "Lucie", approximately 8 1/2 months old, was previously found to be severely lame,
uncomfortable, and unwilling to stand at the time of the previous inspection on 6/7/17.
At the time of the inspection prior to that, on 4/27/17, the cub was exhibiting some lameness in its hindquarters, and
had a history of intermittent lameness in the front as well. The exhibitor was asked to have a diagnostic work up
completed by a veterinarian who is experienced with this species, by 5/1/17. Radiographs and blood work were
completed by that date, but the results were inconclusive. Subsequently two radiologists who specialize in zoo
animals reviewed the radiographs at the request of the USDA / APHIS / Big Cat Specialist. Both radiologists stated
that the radiographs showed thinned bone cortices, which is typically seen in metabolic bone disease, which can be
caused by a dietary deficiency. Currently the animal is able to stand only momentarily, with great reluctance, and
she is not able to walk, but does crawl. Although the lion cub seems more comfortable than she did at the time of
the 6/7/17 inspection, her condition has not significantly improved. Additionally the lion cub has a history of difficulty
swallowing. Although the lion cub's body condition appears healthy, the licensee states that all the lion's meals are
being fed to her by hand out of necessity. The last time the attending veterinarian observed the animal, according to
records on hand, was 6/12/17, which was two weeks ago.
At the time of the last inspection on 6/7/17, the exhibitor was asked to have a consultant veterinarian with a higher
level of expertise with big cat nutrition and medicine review every aspect of this case and to determine an
appropriate treatment plan including specific guidance about medical care, treatment, diagnostics, diet and
nutritional supplements for this animal. The licensee has not complied with this request, as of the time of the 6/26/17
inspection.
Failure to provide appropriate diagnostics and treatment can result in a poor outcome for animals. The exhibitor
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care, to include the use of appropriate methods to
diagnose and treat diseases. Veterinarians should have sufficient experience with the species on hand, so as to
ensure appropriate care.The licensee must have a consultant veterinarian with a higher level of expertise with big cat nutrition and medicine
review every aspect of this case and to determine an appropriate treatment plan including specific guidance about
medical care, treatment, diagnostics, diet and nutritional supplements for this animal. The licensee must
immediately follow the exact recommendations of this expert veterinarian. The outcome of this consultation must be
provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, any
diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed, any medications or supplements prescribed
along with the dosing instructions, the treatment plan, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health
record that list when the medication or supplement is administered to the animal, showing the amounts, and who
administered it.
The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by
the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care
shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
This inspection was conducted on 6/26/17 with the licensee, and the inspector was accompanied by Dr. Gage
during the inspection.
The exit interview was conducted on 6/27/17 with the licensee, and the inspector was accompanied by the
Supervisory Animal Care Specialist, Dr. Kathleen Garland.
