2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There was one - 15 ml tube of Animax
Ointment with an expiration date of 02/2005. There was one - 50 ml bottle of Poly-Vi-Sol with an expiration date of
04/2008. There were two - 29.6 ml bottles of Puppy drops with an expiration date of 09/2012. These medications
were intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use.
The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary
practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected
results when expired drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The
licensee must ensure that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by
3/5/15.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An estimated 1/2 inch gap in the cement flooring was observed in two outdoor enclosures housing four dogs.
Gaps in cement flooring can allow accumulations of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards to
collect creating unsanitary conditions for the dogs. In addition, the affected surfaces cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized. The licensee must fill all gaps with a material that will allow all cement surfaces to be readily
cleaned and sanitized on a routine basis.
* The facility inspection done on 2/5/15 and exit briefing done on 2/6/15 were conducted with the licensee.
