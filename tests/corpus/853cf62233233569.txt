2.31(c)(4)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
--The IACUC did not conduct a thorough investigation into circumstances surrounding the unanticipated death of a rabbit
subsequent to handling by a veterinary student.
--The IACUC did not conduct a thorough investigation into circumstances surrounding the unanticipated death of a ferret
subsequent to prolonged surgery by a veterinary student.
--The IACUC did not conduct a thorough investigation into circumstances surrounding the unanticipated death of a blood
donor horse. The IACUC did conduct an inspection of the pastures that had contained the horse. However, the IACUC
did not investigate how daily observations were conducted and how these observations should have been communicated
to the AV. The horse was urinary incontinent, had urine scald, and was subsequently euthanized due to a large bladder
stone.
--Failing to conduct in-depth investigations into unanticipated deaths of animals, especially when brought to the attention
of the IACUC by personnel and/or faculty, does not provide a method for determining how these unanticipated deaths can
be mitigated and/or prevented in the future.
--Per the regulations, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review, and if warranted, investigate concerns


involving the care and use of animals at the research facility resulting from public complaints received or from reports of
noncompliance received from laboratory or research facility personnel or employees. Correct by June 15, 2022.
2.33(b)(3) Critical Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
--A blood donor horse was noted by an observer to be exhibiting urinary incontinence, urine scalding on the rear legs and
a foul odor. The observer notified the attending veterinarian (AV), who was not aware of the condition of the horse at that
time. The husbandry sheet indicated that the horse was observed daily, but there was no indication in the records that
the urinary incontinence, urine scalding of the rear legs and/or the foul odor had been detected and/or reported to the Site
Veterinarian or the AV.
--The inspector’s investigation documented that several CVM employees expressed concern about the status of this
horse, that this illness had not been observed or communicated appropriately, and that there was no apparent Standard
Operating Procedure describing how daily observations and communication to the AV must occur.
--Once the AV learned of the condition of this horse, the horse received immediate care. The horse was found to have
visible urine scalding and urinary incontinence. The horse was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital for further
diagnostics. A large cystolith was found to be present in the bladder of the horse and the decision was made to euthanize
the horse.
--Failure to conduct adequate daily observations of the animals, coupled with subsequent appropriate and timely
communications with the AV, can result in prolonged suffering and can result in unanticipated deaths of the animals.
--Per the regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that
includes daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being, provided however, that daily observation
of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the AV; and provided further, that a mechanism of direct and


frequent communications is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being is conveyed to the AV.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
--A rabbit vocalized while being handled by a veterinary student in its enclosure. Upon physical evaluation by the
instructor, it was believed that the rabbit’s back had broken and the animal was subsequently euthanized. The exact
actions being taken by the student at the time of the incident remain unclear and could not be determined by the
inspector. No necropsy was conducted to document the nature of the injury requiring euthanization.
--Improper handling of animals can result in injury and death to the animals.
--Per the regulations, handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that
does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Facilities, outdoor.
--Sixteen horses at RCEF were housed in pastures containing inadequate or no protection from the elements during
severe weather. One pasture of nine horses had only a shade cloth cover that would not provide protection from severe
weather. No trees or shrubs were present for natural shelter. The other horses were held in pastures that had similar
shade cloth covers that would not provide protection during severe weather and had inadequate amounts of trees or
shrubs available to provide marginal protection from severe weather. No run-in sheds were present in these pastures.
--Not providing adequate shelter from local climatic conditions, which can include severe thunderstorms, hail and other
types of severe weather at this time of year, jeopardizes the health of the horses held in those pastures.
--Per the regulations, natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall


be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and prevent discomfort to such animals. Correct by
July 1, 2022.

This inspection (May 11 - 16, 2022) and exit interview (May 16, 2022) were conducted with facility representatives.
