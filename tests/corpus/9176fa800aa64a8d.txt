3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a small rusted platform in the enclosure containing one (1) Macaque. The rust is showing signs of corrosion
and not suitable for use in this state. Rusted areas cannot be cleaned and sanitized appropriately. All surfaces
must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced
when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by May 30, 2016.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is wire fencing dividing the Camel and Giraffe enclosures. One of the wooden post used to secure the fencing
is leaning inward (toward the Camel enclosure). The post is loose in the ground and is not secure. This is creating
an injury hazard to the Camel and the Giraffe.
The fencing between the Camel and Giraffe enclosures has wood along the top of it to keep the animals from
pushing the fencing down with their long necks. There is one of these support boards along the top of the fence that
is broken. The broken and splintering of the wood, could cause an injury to one of the animals within the enclosure.
The two Bears at the facility have an enclosure that can be divided into two separate areas. At the time of
inspection, the animals were divided up with each in a separate enclosure. The enclosure on the left has a raised
wooden platform for the Bear to lay on. This platform is broken and in need of repair. The Bear could easily be
injured by the broken, splintered wood and the platform is not structurally sound. The Bear should not have access
to this area until the platform is repaired or replaced. Corrected at the time of inspection by removing the Bear out of
the enclosure into the adjoining enclosure with the other Bear.
In the drive through part of the park, to the right of "center court", is a drain pipe. The mouth of the pipe is torn,
creating sharp and jagged edges. The pipe, in its current condition, could cause serious injury to any animal who
comes in contact with it.The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted by Brenda Pietrosante, ACI and Michelle Williams, VMO, with the
facility's Head Zoo Keeper.
