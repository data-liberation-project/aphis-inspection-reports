2.40(b)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Multiple mature goats in multiple barns were observed to have both front and back hooves with walls on each claw that
had grown long enough to prevent standing or walking normally on the surface of the pad of the claw. The animals
exhibited gait abnormalities in adaptation to using the uneven walking surface of the hooves. Overgrown hooves may
increase stress on limbs with an abnormal gait, potentially leading to lameness, joint problems, and alterations to normal
foraging and social behavior in the herd. Due to changes in employees’ schedules during the pandemic, the facility
reports that too few employees were available to trim hooves to maintain them at a proper length. The facility must
ensure the availability of personnel needed to follow the attending veterinarian's directions of adequate veterinary care.

Correction date: the facility has an ongoing commitment to increase hiring, and has scheduled to perform hoof trims on
all animals within 6 weeks.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
