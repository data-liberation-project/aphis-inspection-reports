2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the start of the inspection, Merle, the smaller adult male castrated Camel was laying down in a kushed position
with his head and neck extended and was foaming at the mouth. He would not rise when approached. The facility
representative was asked to contact the AV. About one hour later, Merle stood up. He exhibited hyperextension of
his limbs when walking and repetitive head bobbing and lip twitching. He did eat grain when offered, chewing
slowly. Veterinarian did not find any physical or behavior abnormalities upon exam and felt animal was in
acceptable body condition.
The juvenile Southdown sheep housed in a pen on the east side of the shed building was limping on its left rear leg.
The sheep had urine and fecal staining around the hind end and down the back of rear legs. It was reluctant to
move around and was pushed out of the feeder by the bigger sheep and goats. Veterinarian examined animal and
could not identify cause of lameness and felt the animal was in acceptable body condition. He administered a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory injection with follow up hoof trimming recommended.
Failure to recognize and provide appropriate diagnostic and treatment of illness or injury can cause the animals to
suffer pain and suffering or death. The veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and visited the facility and
evaluated the camel and the Southdown sheep within 2 hours.
Two fallow deer were observed with extremely long hooves on all four legs. Overgrown hooves can lead to pain,
discomfort, lameness, gait abnormalities and joint/conformation problems.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The harnesses on the two foxes housed together in a chain link enclosure were frayed and worn. Frayed or worn
harnesses could become a safety hazard and injure the animals if the harnesses were to get caught on fencing or
other items within their enclosure. A worn harness could fail to safely restrain the animal if the animal was removed
from the primary enclosure using the harness and allow the animal to escape or become injured.
Handling of all animals must be done carefully in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm orunnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected by 4/4/18.
3.54(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Three rabbit hutches containing 6 rabbits total had no food in the feeders. Two hutches with 3 rabbits total had
feeders with clumped food that prevented the free-flow of food such that no food was available to the rabbits.
We asked that animals be fed and all rabbits were provided with fresh food during the inspection. The rabbits ate
immediately.
Rabbits should be fed at least once a day with food that is free from contamination, wholesome, palatable and of
sufficient quantity and nutritive value to meet their normal daily requirements.
To be corrected from this time forward.
3.55 DIRECT
WATERING.
Three rabbit hutches containing 6 rabbits total had water bottles that were empty and dry at the time of the
inspection. We asked that water be provided, all animals were provided with water during inspection.
One pair of rabbits drank continuously for over 10 minutes, and within 45 minutes had drank 1/2 of their bottle.
Another pair drank contiuously for over 8 minutes.
Rabbits must be provided with sufficient potable water daily. All water receptacles shall be cleaned and sanitized
when dirty.
To be corrected from this time forward.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Four rabbit enclosure containing six rabbits have excessive amount of spilled food and excessive fecal material
built up in the bottom of the cage. Unsanitary conditions can lead to disease or infestation of pests. Cages must be
cleaned as needed to prevent fecal and debris buildup.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence between adult camels(2)/guanaco(2)/cow(1) and llama(1)/alpacas(2)/guanaco(1)/juvenile camel (1) had
one lower horizontal bar broken and protruding into the space at chest height of the llama/alpaca/guanacoenclosure. An animal could injure itself on this metal bar causing pain, distress or death.
The yak (2 adults) enclosure fencing along the southeast edge had posts that were loose and not embedded in the
ground. This could allow the animals to escape or injure themselves causing pain or distress.
All enclosures or facilities for all the animals must be constructed of such material and of such strength as
appropriate for the animals involved. All facilities must be structurally sound, free from sharp, protruding points or
edges, and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to properly contain them. A
system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to ensure the health and
well-being of all animals.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
The pen on the west side of garage that housed 1 calf, 7 goats and 5 sheep had a single plastic tub feeder that
was embedded in a mound of packed waste hay and fecal material. It was filled with packed waste feed and fecal
material to within several inches of the top of feeder. The more aggressive animals were able to prevent other
animals from eating from the single feeder. There was no available hay in the feeder during the inspection. We
asked and feed was provided to the animals who immediately and hungrily ate.
Other pens without feed at the time of the inspection included: pigs ( 3 pens, 4 animals) and one pen of 3 cows/4
donkeys, We asked that animals be fed and all animals were fed during inspection and ate hungrily.
Food and feeders should be sufficient in quantity and located so as to be accessible to all animals in the enclosure
and placed so as to minimize contamination. Feeders should be kept clean and sanitary at all times.
To be corrected by 4/4/18.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
All water tubs had large amount of green slime present along sides and bottom of tub. Contaminated water can be
unpalatable and unhealthy for the animals. All water containers must be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The fallow deer pen ( 10 deer, 1 llama) had loose pieces of polly baler twine on the ground and the fox pen (2) had
aproximately 4 inch square of woven poly grain bag fabric on the ground. These materials could be ingested
causing illness and death.Large amounts of clutter and debris were present around the sheep/goat pen on the west of the shed and around
the rabbit and fox enclosures. This can provide a habitat for vermin to breed and hide and present safety hazards.
Animal housing areas should be kept clear of trash and debris at all times.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
Only one person was providing all the care and feeding of the animals at the time of the inspection. Acceptable
levels of husbandry and care were not being provided resulting in unsanitary conditions and lack of feed and water
which can lead to pain, suffering and illness of the animals.
A sufficient number of trained employees must be utilized to maintain professionally acceptable levels of husbandry
and care.
To be corrected by 4/4/18.
