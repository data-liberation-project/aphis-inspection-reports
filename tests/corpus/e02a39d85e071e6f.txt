FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the outdoor enclosure housing 1 pig and 3 goats is a metal structure utilized for playing, walking on and
shade. The sheet metal on the structure has a rip along one side leaving a sharp pointed edge that could
potentially cause an injury to the animals. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound
and in good repair to protect the animals from injuries.
