3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a quarter-sized rusted area in enclosure #8 in one of the whelping buildings. There are at least 5 outside
enclosure gates that are rusted to the point that the metal is starting to flake. Rusted surfaces cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must be maintained in a manner that keeps them free from excessive rust that
prevents the required cleaning and sanitization. Correct by 30 July 2015.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are approximately 6 metal dog doors that have an accumulation of dog oil, dirt, and grime. This material
covers up to approximately 40-50% of the outdoor surface of some of these doors. Surfaces that are not sanitized
on a regular basis can lead to an increase in disease transmission. All hard surfaces in contact with dogs must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to reduce disease hazards.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are two enclosures each housing one dog where the metal is rusted to the point that there are sharp jagged
metal edges present. One is a free-standing enclosure and the other is a horse trailer. Sharp jagged edges could
cause injury to the dogs. All surfaces must be free of sharp, jagged edges. Correct by 7 July 2015.
