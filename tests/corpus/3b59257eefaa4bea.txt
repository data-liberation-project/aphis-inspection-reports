2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection a female cavalier king charles spaniel had large mats on the outside of both ears. Hair matting
can cause discomfort and lead to sores and infections when not treated appropriately. The licensee must use appropriate
methods to prevent and control health issues that could lead to disease and injuries. Correct by 29 August 2022.
3.6(a)(2)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
An enclosure containing 1 adult Cavapoo and 4 puppies has an approximately 3 inch gap at the bottom of the gate
fencing of the outdoor run. At the time of inspection when looking at the outdoor portion of the kennel, 2 cavapoo puppies
escaped from the gap in the fence. Failure to contain the animals securely can lead to animal escape and injury. The
licensee must ensure that all of the animals in the kennel are contained securely. Correct by 24 August 2022. The
licensee corrected at time of inspection.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
An outdoor enclosure containing 5 Mini Australian Shepherd females had a water bucket with accumulations of green
organic matter and debris. Water receptacles that have not been properly sanitized can lead to disease hazards and
animals refusing to drink. The licensee must sanitize all food and water receptacles every 2 weeks or as often as

necessary to prevent any accumulations of matter or disease hazards. Correct by 24 August 2022. The licensee corrected
at the time of inspection.
