Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** The arctic fox has long nails that need to be trimmed. There is no place in the enclosure for the animal to dig to
naturally wear down the nails so preventative trimming is needed to maintain the nails at a shorter length. Long nails can
begin to curl or splay and can put additional pressure on the toes. These nails need to be trimmed on a routine basis as
preventative care for the animal.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
*** The records of animals on hand do not account for animals born at the facility. There are three ring tail lemurs listed on
record as acquired and 15 at the facility. Records of animals on hand must account for all animals at the facility, whether
acquired from an outside source or born on property. In addition, all animals that leave the facility including sales of
hedgehogs, chinchilla’s must be recorded on disposition records that identity where the animals go.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

3.125(d)

Facilities, general.
The facility is currently dumping all hay, shavings and feces just outside the building adjacent to the outdoor areas for the
large hoofstock. Managing animal waste in this manner is not effectively removing it from the area or minimizing living
areas for pests and disease hazards. This waste needs to be removed and disposed of in a manner that protects the
animals.

3.131(a)

Sanitation.
There are two hedgehog enclosures housing females and babies that have an excessive amount of feces that need to be
cleaned. These enclosures must be cleaned more frequently to reduce this accumulation and to allow the animals to stay
clean and to reduce disease hazards and odors.
