ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female, seal point ragdoll "(cid:28)Rainey"(cid:29) ID# 45, is squinting in both eyes. The third eyelids are raised and appear
pink, and the outer eyelids, both upper and lower, appear pink and inflamed. There is a light tan to yellowish
discharge in the inner corner of both eyes with accompanying tear drainage, and there is a dark brown, crusty
discharge surrounding each eye. The licensee stated she had not sought veterinary care for this problem.
A female, seal point ragdoll "(cid:28)Spring"(cid:29) ID# 12, is squinting in both eyes. The third eyelids are raised, and there is a
moderate amount of light brown and dark brown crust around both eyes. The licensee stated the cat has "(cid:28)always
been like that"(cid:25)(cid:29) and she has had a veterinarian look at her in the past for this problem, but the veterinarian "did not
say what was causing it." The licensee had been given (cid:28)"ointment"(cid:29) to give to the cat, but stated "(cid:28)there was no
improvement." The licensee did not then follow up with the veterinarian.
A female, black and white Persian cat (cid:28)"Sue"(cid:29) ID# 31, has a right eye that is moderately cloudy on the surface.
There is a thick, greyish-brown discharge in the inner corner and lower eyelid, as well as some dark grey to black
dried and crusty discharge underneath.
Eye problems can be an indicator of injury, disease, allergies or irritation, and can be itchy and/or painful, and can
affect the well-being of the animal. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and to
develop and follow a treatment plan. The licensee must document the veterinarian(cid:25)s findings; the treatment plan
that is followed, and have the records available to the inspector upon request. To be corrected by: April 17, 2014.
A male, Bengal cat ID# 9, has an open wound on the back of his left ear at the base. It is round and approximately
inch in diameter. The area is hairless, red and moist-looking, and appears to be exposed underlying tissue. There
appears to be a dried, reddish crust at the perimeter of the wound. The licensee stated she saw it for the first time
when the inspector noticed it. She stated that the wound was not there that morning. The licensee stated that this
cat is extremely difficult to handle. The male cat is being housed with two female Bengals and had been mating with
them both. Open wounds can be very painful and be subject to infection. This can affect the well-being of the
animal. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian to develop and follow a treatment plan. The licensee must
document the veterinarian(cid:25)s findings; the treatment plan that is followed, and have the records available to theinspector upon request. To be corrected by: April 17, 2014.
3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In pen #4 and #6 on the left side of the cattery, there are gaps between the wall and the floor in several areas.
These gaps are preventing the area to be properly cleaned and sanitized. There is a buildup of grime in and around
these gaps. These areas affect six cats. All surfaces that come into contact with the cats must be constructed in a
manner and made of materials that can be properly cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must repair these areas in
a way that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized. To be corrected by: May 8, 2014.
3.11(b)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In pens #4, #5, and #6 on the left side of the cattery, there are several areas that need to be cleaned and sanitized.
In pen #4, there is a buildup of grime, hair, and urine on the wire and on the PVC pipes at the base of the enclosure.
This affects four cats. In pen # 5, the front right corner of the pen has a buildup of grime, hair and urine. This
affects four cats. In pen #6, in the right back corner there is a buildup of brownish grime along the wall and on the
floor. The metal is starting to rust in this area, and will need to be watched for future maintenance. This affects two
cats. All hard surfaces of primary enclosures must be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized in the methods described in
this section to remove organic materials and mineral buildup. The licensee must clean and sanitize all these
surfaces as often as needed to prevent a buildup of organic material and minerals. To be corrected from this day
forward.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
