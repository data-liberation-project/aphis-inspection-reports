fully open the eye. The upper and lower eyelids are swollen and large amount of greyish colored discharge is coming
from the eye and coating the hair beneath it. Some thick pieces of dried discharge are sticking to the hair above and
below the eye. The eye appears to be a blueish color and the white of the eye is severely reddened. Beneath the left eye

Housing facilities, general.
In Building #6, there are at least four enclosures, housing an approximate total of seven dogs, that have sharp points
located at the level of dogs. The sharp points are created by metal fence rods that have been cut in order to slide a food
bowl inside the dog enclosure. Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.

these sharp points in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures
are safe for the dogs at all times.

can not be properly cleaned and sanitized which could result in the increased risk of disease.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities - including all objects within the facility -
that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the water
bucket or alter the damaged areas in a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitizing of the bucket. The licensee must
ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are maintained at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The unopened bags of dog food are stored in the shop on a wooden pallet directly beneath a vehicle with an exposed
engine. Oil from the engine is dripping on top of the plastic sheeting covering the dog food. Contamination of the food by
engine oil could be detrimental to the health of the animals should they consume the food.

vermin infestation. The licensee must store the unopened bags of dog food in a location where there is no risk of
contamination. The licensee must ensure that all food is properly stored at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
In Building 5, the trash can does not have a lid. Open trash cans could create odors and attract pests such as flies and
mice which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The licensee must add a lid to the trash can and ensure that all trash containers
contain lids at all times.

In at least three enclosures, containing approximately a total of four dogs, small areas of the covering on the walls has
been torn exposing the wood beneath it. The wood is not impervious to moisture and is located at the level of the dogs.
Wood that is not impervious to moisture may begin to rot which could weaken the structural integrity of the enclosures.

The floors and walls of indoor housing facilities, and any other surfaces in contact with the animals, must be impervious to

moisture. The licensee must recover the exposed wood or alter it in a manner that makes it impervious to moisture. The
licensee must ensure all surfaces of housing facilities are maintained at all times.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In at least two enclosures, containing an approximate total of three bulldogs, there is a buildup of dark colored dirt and
grime on the walls located at the level of the dogs. The buildup of dirt and grime could increase the risk of disease
towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
The licensee must sanitize the affected enclosure and ensure that all enclosures remain free of a buildup of dirt and grime
at all times.

Veterinary care for dogs.
At least nineteen dogs are receiving treatment by the facility for veterinary concerns. The medical records kept by the
facility are incomplete and are missing necessary information. None of the records contain the information on how many
times a day a treatment should be administered or how many days the treatment should be administered. The dosages
of medical products such as penicillin is also missing. A few records lack the name of the product used and simply say
"antibiotic spray" or "antibiotic". Failure to provide a complete written medical plan does not allow APHIS officials to
ensure that treatments plans are being followed and that medical materials are being administered properly.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. These
records must include the problem identified, the date and a description of the problem, examination findings, test results,

plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The licensee must add a complete written plan for all
dogs under veterinary treatment in order for APHIS officials to ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.
