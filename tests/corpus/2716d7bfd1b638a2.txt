2.38(f)(1) REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
On March 19, 2016 a non-human primate (NHP) was injured after staff failed to secure an enclosure door. The
NHP, a four year old macaque, escaped from the enclosure through the unsecured door. It returned to the
enclosure of its own volition and staff noticed that it was lame. The NHP was diagnosed with fractures of both legs,
received prompt veterinary treatment, and has recovered from the fractures. Staff members involved in the incident
were re-trained and the facility implemented additional enclosure locking practices. The facility self-reported the
incident to APHIS officials.

Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar
problems from occurring in the future.
Previously to have been corrected immediately.
Accompanied by Dr. Michael Schnell.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
