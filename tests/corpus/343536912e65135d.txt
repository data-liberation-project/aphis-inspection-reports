availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care;
* A female Silky Terrier (#157) nursing two puppies (DOB 4-19-14) is very thin with easily palpable ribs and defined
vertebrae. She had a build up of brown, gray-green material on her back teeth with gums that were swollen and
when touched, a thick yellowish- white discharge occurred. She also has matted hair on the face and legs that are
dangling and pulling on the skin.
The appearance of vertebrae and ribs may be an indication of malnourishment, parasites or other illness. Swollen
gums may make eating painful also. Hair that is matted and pulling on the skin can cause discomfort and pain to the
animal. The licensee must remove the matted hair and have this dog examined by a veterinarian. The licensee must
ensure that a effective hair coat maintenance program is adhered to at all times to prevent matting of the hair and
that all animals receive adequate veterinary care with documentation (preferably in writing) of any treatments,
prescriptions or medical programs prescribed.

structurally sound. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the
animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

enclosure.Dogs were seen to push their head through the hole. These enclosures no longer protect the dogs from
possible injury. Licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are maintained and protect the animals from injury
and contain them securely.
