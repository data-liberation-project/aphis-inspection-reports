ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The mammal curator informed the inspector that a male lion named "(cid:28)Jamil"(cid:29) was noticed being underweight during
the first week of February 2015 and the diet was changed from 5 pounds of food per day to 10 pounds of food per
day. The curator had informed the attending veterinarian of the lion being under weight. After further review of the
lion(cid:25)'s medical record, there is no documentation of the lion being seen by the attending veterinarian for being
underweight nor is there documentation that the lion is receiving the changed diet. The diet for the lion currently
posted in the kitchen is dated 12/2013 for 5 pounds of food for five days and two days of bones from chickens or
rabbits. Failure to effectively communicate and document changes in health status and diet changes can potentially
have adverse effects on the animals health and inhibit weight gain. This facility must provide an accurate and timely
means of communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure that all problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being for all animals are reported and documented.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On Wednesday, February 18, 2015 a kudu had escaped from the premises of the facility. The curator informed the
inspector that the kudu was in the antelope quarantine enclosure. The kudu was spooked and jumped several
fences that were 7 foot in height until it reached a shallow waterway into a construction area within the perimeter
fence of the facility. The kudu escaped through the perimeter fence gate that was left open by construction workers.
The kudu was captured five days later. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it serves as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility, to protect the animals and prevent unauthorized persons from
entering.
