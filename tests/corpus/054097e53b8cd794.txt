ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Puggle named "Sweetie" (microchip #941000018995778) was limping on its left front leg. Upon closer
examination, she was noted to have a swollen lump in between her toes. The licensee informed me he noticed the
dog limping and the lump about a half hour before inspection. The condition was not documented however and the
Attending Veterinarian had not been contacted at the time of inspection. A lump in between the toes can be painful.
In addition, it could become infected causing further medical problems for the dog. The Attending Veterinarian
must be contacted and the dog must be treated per his/her instructions. Correct by 10/21/16.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
Note: This inspection was conducted on 10/19/16.
