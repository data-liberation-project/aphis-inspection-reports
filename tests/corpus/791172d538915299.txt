2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
As a result of unexpected study complications, four rabbits died between Saturday June 14th, 2014 and Monday
June 16th, 2014. The Principle Investigator and his staff provided care for the animals, but did not contact or consult
with the Attending Veterinarian and his staff about the health status of the animals. The Attending Veterinarian and
his staff were not notified about the deaths until Monday morning. Failure to notify the Attending Veterinarian
regarding the health of the animals does not ensure proper veterinary care at the facility. A mechanism of direct and
frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior
and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected from this day forward.
The inspection was conducted August 26-27th, 2014 and the exit briefing was conducted on August 27th with
facility representatives.
