Facilities, general.
The back wall of the kinkajou enclosure had one large strip of peeling wall covering approximately 4 x 10 inches long.
The roof of the kinkajou's house within the enclosure had multiple exposed nails, where the kinkajou had pulled the
roofing material off the house. The peeling wall covering and exposed nails pose injury risks via ingestion and/or
scratch/puncture injuries. Per the regulations, outdoor facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
