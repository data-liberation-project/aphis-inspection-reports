2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A young brown and white guinea pig, located in a cage labelled with tag #917 in the warm room, had a swollen left eye.
Inspectors observed the animal at approximately 12:00PM, two hours after the auction began. The left eye was swollen
shut, and there was yellowish green discharge covering the bottom eyelid. The animal was observed to be repeatedly
scratching at the eye. The consignor gently wiped the eye with a paper towel to remove the discharge, and the underlying
eyeball was observed to have a whitish yellow protrusion on its surface approximately 0.25 cm in size. The conjunctiva
around the eye was red and swollen. The warm room attendant stated that she had seen that the eye was swollen that
morning, but the attending veterinarian had not been contacted. The attending veterinarian had visited the auction earlier
that morning and had not been notified about the condition of this animal at that time. The attending veterinarian
subsequently examined the guinea pig and stated that it needed some antibiotics for the eye.
Prompt identification of medical problems in animals is important for animal welfare because untreated or worsening
medical problems may cause pain, discomfort, or stress for the animal.
Correct by today, November 27, 2021, by establishing a means of frequent and direct communication with the attending
veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal heath, behavior, and well-being can be
addressed promptly.
