3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The gate panels on outdoor enclosures where the Beagles are housed have rusting and structural problems. On at
least four of the gate frames the bottom pipe was nearly rust into pieces. The material has deteriorated to the point
that sharps edges are forming that could injury the dogs. Injuries from sharps points or rusting metal can be painful
for the dogs. The material is no longer structurally sound nor can it be adequately cleaned and sanitized. The
enclosures must be secure to contain the dogs adequately and protect them from other animals. Owner must
ensure that all fencing panels and gates are routinely maintained so as to protect the health and safety of the
animals. To be corrected by 07-05-2014.
