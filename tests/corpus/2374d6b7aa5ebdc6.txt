SANITATION.
The upper section of the enclosure for the one rabbit has a solid floor with hay bedding. Under the hay bedding
there is a buildup of old hay and fecal material. This needs to be removed and disposed of. Clean bedding needs
to be provided. Enclosures equipped with solid floors must have the soiled litter removed and replaced with clean
litter at least once each week.
