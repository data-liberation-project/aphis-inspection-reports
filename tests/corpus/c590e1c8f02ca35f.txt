FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The roof of the off exhibit holding building for two wolves is deteriorating around the skylights. The plywood around
the skylights inside the building is black and falling apart; apparently due to water penetration in this area. Shelter
must be provided for all animals kept outdoors to protect them from the elements and to prevent discomfort.
The roof of the wolf shelter must be repaired or replaced in order to protect the two wolves from inclement weather.
To be corrected by: June 30, 2016.

Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
