A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:25 pm on 16
February 2022. Arrived at the site address and called the contact numbers and left a message. Received a call back
within 5 minutes, but the site 002 address was incorrect. Discussed how to cancel this site and add the correct site as
well as new site inspection procedures with the licensee.
