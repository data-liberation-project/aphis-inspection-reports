2.31(d)(1)(x)(A)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Two protocols under the same Principal Investigator describe multiple major surgeries in cats. Protocol #21-001 involves
a major operative procedure that the cats are allowed to recover and a secondary implant surgery. Protocol #21-002
involves a major operative procedure that allow animals to recover and a secondary nerve tracing surgery. The
procedures for multiple major surgery are described in the protocols, but the Principal Investigator did not provide
scientific justification for the multiple major surgeries. Protocol #21-002 was approved by the IACUC in September 2019
and Protocol #21-001 was approved by the IACUC in April 2019. At the time of inspection, no multiple major surgeries
were performed by the Principal Investigator.

No animal will be used in more than one major operative procedure from which it is allowed to recover unless justified for
scientific reasons by the Principal Investigator in writing.
