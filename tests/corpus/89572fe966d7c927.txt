2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On September 07, 2017 USDA inspectors arrived at the facility to find the petting zoo open to the public. This
facility does not have a valid USDA exhibitor’s license.
The facility had applied for a license and underwent the pre-license inspection process between April and June of
2017. On June 30, 2017 the facility completed the pre-license inspection process, but failed to meet the
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act, therefore, the facility did not obtain a USDA license to exhibit animals to the
public. As stated on the June 30th inspection report and reiterated by the inspectors at that time, the facility would
have to wait 6 months before reapplying for a USDA license and exhibiting the animals without a license would be a
violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
Conducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license does not ensure the animals are receiving the care
required by the federal Animal Welfare Act. The facility must have a valid USDA license before continuing to exhibit
regulated animals to the public. Continuing regulated activity without a valid USDA license is a violation of the
Animal Welfare Act.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and the facility
representative.
