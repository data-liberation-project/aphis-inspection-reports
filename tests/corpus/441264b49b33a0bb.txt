ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at
1:25pm-1:55pm on 19-Dec-19.
I knocked on the house door, honked my car horn, and phoned. The voicemail box was full and I was unable to
leave a message.
