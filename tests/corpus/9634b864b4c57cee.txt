ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were seven chinchillas with signs of health problems that were not being treated and need reported to the
attending veterinarian to ensure that they receive appropriate treatment:
-A male silver (no ID, in south enclosure #37); its left eye was crusty and sealed shut.
-A female grey (KCS529 cage card, in south stacked enclosures); its right eye had some white discharge.
-A female black (eartag GROS 213 and cage card C103) had a sore or wound on on its left leg and a scab on its
chest and some hair loss around the scabs.
-A silver grey female (no ID, housed in front room, north side, row of cages facing the wall); had a left head tilt and
when it moved, it would circle to its left. This animal was cited in the June 22, 2016 report and has not been
reported to the attending veterinarian.
-Female grey with ear tag PMR 233; its left eye had an opaque mass inside of its eyeball. To ensure that this
condition is not painful, the licensee must have the attending veterinarian observe this animal's condition and follow
any treatment instructions. This animal was cited on the June 22, 2016 report and has not been reported to the
attending veterinarian.
-A male grey (cage card BDZ-419); its left eye had some white discharge and was crusty.
-A female grey (eartag GCC 5); its left eye was crusted shut and some discharge in it when handled by the licensee.
**Untreated medical problems can cause ongoing pain in affected animals and can be contagious to other animals
in the building. The veterinarian must be contacted to properly diagnose and treat each animal's health problem and
the facility must follow the recommended treatment. Documentation of the diagnosis and treatment plan for animals
must available for APHIS officials for future inspections.2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility had previously recognized about 20 chinchillas and had them under treatment, but there were 5 more
chinchillas that had health problems that we brought to the licensee's attention during inspection. These 5
chinchillas were pointed out to the licensee by inspectors to have health conditions:
-A male silver (in south enclosure #37, treatment tag #150 was added); its left eye that was crusty and sealed shut.
-A female grey (KCS529 cage card, in south stacked enclosures); its right eye had some white discharge.
-A female black (eartag GROS 213 and cage card C103) had a sore or wound on on its right front leg and a scab on
its chest and some hair loss around the scabs.
-A male grey (cage card BDZ-419); its left eye had some white discharge and was crusty.
-A female grey (eartag GCC 5); its left eye was crusted shut and some discharge in it when handled by the licensee.
The facility must develop and maintain a method of routine daily observations to ensure any animal with a health
problem is treated promptly and appropriately.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
One enclosure had a hole on the floor that was about 3 inches wide with wire points sticking into the enclosure that
the chinchilla could contact. Holes with sharp metal points inside enclosures can result in animal injuries. The
facility must be maintained in good repair to contain and protect animals from injury.
Note: The licensee moved the chinchilla to an enclosure without points during inspection.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal.
There was a large buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding, and water building up under the animals located overthe south gutter in the middle room of the facility. The north gutter machine was fixed since last inspection and the
licensee stated that the south gutter hadn’t been cleaned out since the last inspection (August 22, 2016) but has
contacted multiple mechanics to come repair the south gutter machine. The buildup of material created a strong
ammonia smell and foul odor within the facility and a large number of small black flies were present throughout the
facility. This buildup of material and foul odors can cause sickness in animals. The facility must eliminate the
excessive buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding, and excess soiled water from the facility as often as necessary
to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The bench in the first animal room on the west side of the building was excessively dirty. A dirty bench can
contaminate the products that are sitting on the bench. The bench needs to be cleaned and kept clean on a regular
basis. Correct by 10/31/16.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Pest Control
The flies throughout the facility were excessive. The licensee stated he is spraying on a daily basis. However, this
method of pest control for the flies is currently insufficient. Flies can carry and spread disease and cause the
animals to become sick. The licensee needs to take action to control the number of flies throughout the facility.
Correct by 11/20/2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee by VMO Welch, ACI Wilken, and SACS
Hovancsak.
