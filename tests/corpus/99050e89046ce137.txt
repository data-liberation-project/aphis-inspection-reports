ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1120 on
05-Oct-17. I went to the licensee's house. A relative answered the door and informed me the licensee was not
home and would not be home anytime soon. I informed him I would try back another time.
End of report.
