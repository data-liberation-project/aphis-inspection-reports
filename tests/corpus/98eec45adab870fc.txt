Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general.
(b)Condition and site.
The indoor portion of the dog kennels is full of lumber, tools, and various stored items. The items are piled on top of
the indoor kennels, along the walls and in the walkway. The accumulation of these materials in the animal housing
facility may harbor vermin or cause injury to the dogs. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat
and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and
necessary for cleaning the area, and fixtures or items not used for the care of the dogs removed.
