ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Zebu "Bandhu" was sedated by the attending veterinarian at 9:00 AM on July 12, 2013, and was subsequently
found dead the following day. The probable cause of death was listed as aspiration &/or regurgitant choke. There
are no medical records or personal (employee) accounts to document the after-procedure care, other than a written
statement indicating that the animal was ambulatory prior to the veterinarian leaving the facility and the animal was
"woozy" @ 3 P.M.. The sedation was performed & this animal was subsequently confined to a barn area.
The facility does not have an SOP for aftercare following anesthesia or sedation of any animal, and cannot
demonstrate that this animal received adequate post-procedural care in accordance with established veterinary
medical care and nursing procedures. This may be accomplished by (but not limited to) establishing SOP(s) for pre
& post procedural care, and documenting that care so that compliance (or non-compliance) with the Animal Welfare
Act Regulations & standards can be ascertained.

3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The squirrels are being housed in an structure that is in disrepair. The ceiling of this structure has multiple holes
and exposed protruding insulation material. There appears to be evidence of rodents in this ceiling also which
poses a risk of injury &/or disease to these animals.
The gutter downspout along the right portion of one of the goat's shelters has broken off. The rain water that falls
off of the roof now pours directly into a portion of the shelter. A portion of the wood directly underneath this broken
downspout is now rotted due to the water damage. When it rains, the ground will get wet from the water run-off and
the animals that might use this shelter would not stay dry.
All housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals. The holes in the ceiling shall be
repaired, and the insulation material shall be contained so that it cannot fall into the animal's enclosure or pose a
risk of ingestion. This area shall also receive appropriate rodent control if these animals are to remain in this area.
The gutter downspout shall be repaired so that the rainwater does not fall into the shelter &/or enclosure, and is
directed away to outside of the enclosure to protect the animals.
