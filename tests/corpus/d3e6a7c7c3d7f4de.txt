FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On inspection, a 3-foot (approximately) section of 4in by 4in wire fencing used to separate pasture 3 from pasture 4
was found to be in disrepair. The section of fencing had multiple wires that had broken away from one end and were
pointing into the paddock. The pastures are used to keep program-owned horses. Not only could the sharp points
cause injury or disease (for example tetanus), but also loose wires are more likely to break off and be eaten.
Furthermore, a horse could get a hoof caught in the broken fencing. No signs of injury to any animals were seen at
the time of inspection. Correct by repairing the section of fence to protect the horses from injury and monitor all
fences to ensure animal safety.

The inspection was conducted with the Animal Care staff and Administrative Assistant. The Exit was conducted with
the I.O. and Administrative Assistant.
