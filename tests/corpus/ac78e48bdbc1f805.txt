ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female (ID #40) had crusted material around both eyes. It's left eye had a large amount of crusted material that I
had to separate in order to see the eye. Both eyes had a pale discharge and the the right eye's surface was pale in
color. The crusted material and discharge are signs of eye problems. Eye problems can be painful for dogs and
sometimes can be spread to other dogs. This dog must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for treatment and
the recommended treatment must be followed.
A female Shih Tzu (ID #2) had a large clump of firm and matted hair underneath her tail. Hair mats can pull on the
hair causing pain and can cause skin infection under areas of matted hair. Ensure that dogs' hair coats are
maintained in a manner to prevent clumping of hair. This dog's hair must be groomed and if the skin underneath has
any problems the attending veterinarian must evaluate it and the treatment recommended must be followed.
