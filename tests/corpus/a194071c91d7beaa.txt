2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has a method of documenting acquisitions and dispositions using the Record of Animals on Hand (Other
than Dogs and Cats) (APHIS Form 7019). However, these records were incomplete and not up-to-date.
Accurate record keeping is essential to allow APHIS to accurately track animals and ensure that all animals are
receiving proper care as required by the Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, specific information regarding sources for
acquisition and disposition are necessary in the event of disease to facilitate tracking animal movement and to
ensure animal health and welfare. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records which fully disclose
information regarding all acquisitions and dispositions; including all births, deaths, and animals euthanized.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two primary enclosures housing rabbits did not meet the minimum floor space.
One cage contained 6 rabbits, a female and weaned offspring. The female weighed 4.75 pounds. The offspringweighed between 1.75 and 2.0 pounds The cage was approximately 30" x 30", or 6.5 square feet of floor space.
The total minimum floor space required for these rabbits is 24 square feet. A second cage contained 4 rabbits
weighing 3.0, 3.25, 3.25 and 3.5 pounds. The cage was approximately 24" x 30", or 5 square feet of floor space.
The total minimum floor space required for these rabbits is 24 square feet. The weights were obtained from the
Facility Representative, who weighed the rabbits using their scale.
Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space according to the
Animal Welfare Act regulations. Housing rabbits in inappropriately-sized enclosures may stress the animals. This
limited housing space can lead to increased susceptibility to disease, incompatibility, and fighting. Rabbits must be
housed in enclosures with the minimum required floor space for their health and well-being.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016, 9/6/2016, 12/28/2016, 2/22/2017
and 4/5/2017.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A light fixture containing four fluorescent light bulbs was located adjacent to primary enclosures containing pregnant
females and females with very young offspring. While a metal mesh guard was in place, pieces of glass could fall
into the cages and could lead to injury to the rabbits should a bulb be broken.
A means of protecting the animals from potential bulb breakage must be used.
