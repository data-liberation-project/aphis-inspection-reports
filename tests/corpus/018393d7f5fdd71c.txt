FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During inspection, Enclosure 1 which houses an adult female Grey Wolf was found to have a metal bar with a sharp
end inside the enclosure that may cause injury to the animal. The enclosure consisted of two areas divided by metal
chain link fencing. The dividing fence had an entrance way for the animal to go between the two areas of the
enclosure. On the ground in the entrance way of the dividing fence was a metal pipe like the piping often used for
the framework of chain link fencing. The metal pipe had broken off of one end and was laying several inches away
from its original place of attachment. The broken portion of the pipe appeared sharp and was approximately 1 to 2
inches long. The animal was observed walking over the broken pipe at least a dozen times. The licensee stated that
it has been that way for at least several months but the animal had never been injured by it. Sharp ends such as on
the broken pipe can be sources of injury and infection if the animal were to step on it. Since the broken pipe was in
an area of heavy traffic in the enclosure this increases the risk of injury to the animal. All sharp ends must be
removed from the enclosure to prevent the animal from injury.
