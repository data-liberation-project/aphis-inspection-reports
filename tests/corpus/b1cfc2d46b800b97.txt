3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the indoor portion of the enclosure for the two rhesus macaques there is an excessive build-up of brown to black
grime on the wire panels that make up the primary enclosure. Failure to clean and sanitize primary enclosures can
lead to disease hazards for the animals. Hard surfaces with which non-human primates come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of dirt, debris, animal or food waste, or other disease hazards.
3.84(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are an excessive number of flies flying around within the walkway in the back of the "reptile house". There are
two ring tailed lemurs, one red ruffed lemur and a vervet located in this area. The licensee confirmed these are fruit
flies. The flies are mainly located on the ceiling within the human walkways, but flies can also be seen landing on
the husbandry objects within the building. The presence of pests can lead to health hazards for the animals. A safe
and effective program for the control of pests, including flies, must be established and maintained.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are metal fence/gate panels in each of the primary enclosures for the goats, santa cruz sheep, and cattle with
areas that are broken and in need of repair or replacement. The broken panels have sharp and/or jagged edges
sticking into the areas where animals are housed. Sharp and/or jagged edges could cause injury to animals.
Ensure that primary enclosures are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to safely
contain the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The primary enclosures for the kinkajou housed in the entryway to the (cid:28)reptile house(cid:29) and the shelter for the
capybara are in need of cleaning. The kinkajou enclosure has an excess amount of dark liquid and soiled materialat the front end of the enclosure that is attracting flies. The capybara shelter has an excessive amount of soiled,
wet material that is attracting flies. Excessive soiled material in animal enclosures increases the animal(cid:25)s risk of
becoming sick and does not provide for their comfort. Enclosures must be cleaned more often and routinely to
prevent a build-up of soiled material to protect the health and wellbeing of the animals.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There are an excessive number of flies present throughout the entire facility. There are a large number of flies flying
around within the walkway in the back of the "reptile house". There are two coati mundi and one serval located in
this area. The licensee confirmed these are fruit flies. The flies are mainly located on the ceiling within the human
walkway, but flies can also be seen landing on the husbandry objects within the building.
There are flies flying around within and around multiple enclosures throughout the facility. The areas with excessive
flies include within the enclosure housing one ferret in the front of the "reptile house", within an enclosure housing
three chinchillas in the "education building", in the shelter within the outdoor capybara enclosure, around and within
the food bowl in the sloth enclosure, and around the area immediately adjacent to the kinkajou enclosure in the
entryway to the zoo. The majority of the flies in these areas are fruit flies. This was confirmed by the licensee. The
presence of pests can lead to health hazards for the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of pests,
including flies, must be established and maintained.
