The hooves of the female domestic pig are overgrown and are starting to curl and overlap. Overgrown hooves can
interfere with the animal's gait and can cause discomfort. This animal must have the hooves trimmed and a plan of
hoof maintenance must be established and documented as part of the facility's program of veterinary care.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a gap of approximately 6 inches in height and 8 inches in length under the perimeter fence located in the
northeast portion of the perimeter fence.
Gaps in the perimeter fence may not restrict animals and unauthorized persons from entering the facility. The
perimeter fence must be constructed so it serves as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility
as well as restrict animals and unauthorized animals from entering. Correct by 16 June 2015.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and Dr. Margaret Shaver,
VMO in attendance.
