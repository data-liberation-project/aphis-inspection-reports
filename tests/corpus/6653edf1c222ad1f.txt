HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
While conducting this inspection it was noted that the barrier fences between an empty corn crib exhibit, the serval
and the leopard enclosures were in need of attention. There are 2 -3 sections of 6' stockade fence that are
positioned between these three exhibits. There are also 3' split rail barrier fences behind the stockade fence that
run perpendicular to the 8' perimeter fence. However, there is an approximately 6' gap between the end of the
stockade fence and the empty corn crib exhibit. And the 3' barrier fences behind the stockade fence are either in
disrepair or the gates were not closed or locked. This large gap, and the opened gates, could allow a member of the
general public direct access to the servals or leopard. To ensure the safety of the animals and the public this
situation will need to be addressed.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During the previous inspection (2/20/18) it was noted that the ceiling in the ring tailed lemur enclosure has small
areas of bare sheet rock present. This has been corrected. However, during this inspection it was noted that a piece
of trim, in this same enclosure, had been pulled away from the wall. There is now bare sheet rock exposed and
there is a gap between the sheet rock and studs. This situation does not allow for the primate area to be readily
cleaned or sanitized. This enclosure will need to be addressed.
3.80(a)(2)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES. As we entered the keeper area of the ring tailed lemur enclosure it was noted that the door to the primary enclosure
was not locked. It was also noted that there was primate feces on the window sill in the keeper area. Therefore, it
appears that the lemurs were able to get out of their primary enclosure. Measures will need to be taken by the staff,
to ensure that the primates are securely contained within this enclosure.
