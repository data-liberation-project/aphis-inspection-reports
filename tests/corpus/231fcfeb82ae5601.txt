3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Although the enclosures had been sanitized within the last two weeks, the owner stated that he is not sanitizing the
enclosures as often as every two weeks. The animals had been treated with ivermectin per veterinary instruction at
the time the pens were last sanitized. No skin problems were noted at this inspection, but the probability of a link
between long periods between sanitization and skin problems is significant. Enclosures shall be sanitized at least
once every 2 weeks according to regulations to prevent the spread of disease. Correct from this point forward.
An Exit briefing was conducted with the facility owner
