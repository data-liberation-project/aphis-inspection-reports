Minimum age requirements.
Two litters were sold and transported before they were 8 weeks (56 days) old. Two 54-day old puppies (DOB 4-12-2021)
and three 50-day old puppies with (DOB 4-16-2021) were picked up by a buyer and per records transported to New York
on June 5, 2021. When dogs are at least 8 weeks old it helps ensure they are healthy for transportation. Dogs must be

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The outdoor exercise area for the dogs had areas of burdock and a pile of discarded bedding. Burdock growing in dog
areas causes thorny burrs that get stuck in hair coats and can cause animal discomfort. Discarded bedding in the
exercise area could cause odors and flies to reproduce. Ensure that a routine of controlling/removing burdock and other
weeds from dog areas is in place to protect the health and wellbeing of the dogs and that the old bedding is discarded
away from animal areas.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The vaccine and deworming schedule in use for puppies that a pet store requested does not match the Attending
Veterinarian's (AV) approved schedule. The schedule in use does not include a Distemper vaccine. Lack of a Distemper
vaccine and following a schedule different than the veterinarian-approved schedule increases disease risk for puppies.
Ensure that the preventive care schedules that are approved by the AV are followed and include the required vaccines
and treatments.

Correct from this day forward. Note: Licensee reports they will switch back to the AV-approved schedule that includes a
Distemper vaccine.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Two female dogs (tag #1 and #60) had areas of burrs matted in their hair coats and had to be trimmed out. Female #1
was seen scratching at the area with her paws and when held by the licensee I could see the burrs were matted in tightly.
Areas of matted hair can cause discomfort to dogs and can eventually lead to skin infections. Ensure that hair coats are
maintained on a more regular basis to prevent any type of matting.

Note: Licensee trimmed these mats out prior to exit interview.
Maintain correct from this day forward.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
