ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 pm on
05-Dec-19.
** I arrived at the facility at 2:00 pm and called the owner. He stated he was unavailable to participate in an
inspection at that time. I let him know that this would be considered an attempted inspection. I left the facility at 2:20
pm.
