2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a written program of veterinary care. However the program is incomplete and does not accurately
reflect the practices of the facility. The medication listed under the ectoparasites section simply states "Ivermectin
pour on". The licensee stated he does not use that product at the facilty and only has used an injectable ivermectin
product. Safeguard is listed under the internal parasites section. The product was not present at the facility during
the inspection. The licensee stated he gives Safeguard to all the animals twice a year. There is no documentation
from the attending veterinarian regarding directions for use on specific animals at the facility and frequency at which
to be given. The emergency care section simply states "veterinarian call". It does not identify specific veterinarians
or clinics to be contacted; and, therefore, their willingness to provide emergency back-up care is not known. There
are no provisions for routine care and husbandry should the licensee not be able to perform these duties. The
chemical immobilization method being used to capture animals at the facility is not consistent with what is listed on
the program of vet care.
Failure to have a complete and accurate written program of veterinary care does not ensure that the animals at the
facility are receiving veterinary care consistent with currently accepted veterinary practices. The program must be
amended to reflect practices of the facility. It shall include product dosage, route of administration, concentration of
active ingredient, the frequency of use, testing to be completed, and the frequency in which testing shall be done.
The program must be amended to include provisions for emergency care.

2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two expired medications present at the facility and deemed ready for use including: a 50ml bottle of
injectable Xylazine HCI 100mg/ml exp. 7/09 and a 50ml bottle of injectable Ivomec (ivermectin) exp.11/12. The
Ivomec label states for cattle and swine only. There is not a label or directions from a veterinarian authorizing the
use of this medication for the regulated animals present at the facility.
The use of expired medications on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and
does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results whenexpired drugs are administered to the animals could be drastically change or may not work as anticipated. The
licensee must ensure that all medications being used are not expired and labeled in accordance with standard
veterinary practices. Failure to have proper authorization and specific instructions for use by a veterinarian does not
ensure that proper dosing and administration of the product is being accomplished. It also does not ensure that the
animals are receiving appropriate veterinary care within currently accepted veterinary practices.

2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated he used a pole-syringe to inject an adult male nilgai antelope with xylazine to sedate and
capture the animal for transport. This type of chemical immobilization method is performed by the licensee if
necessary, to assist in the capture of hoofstock at the facility. The licensee does not have a protocol in place for
proper chemical capture practices. There is no documentation available showing the licensee has received
adequate guidance from the attending veterinarian involved in the care and use of animals at his facility regarding
handling, immobilization and tranquilization.
Sedative/tranquilizers and controlled substances must be used by a trained and knowledgeable individual. If not
used properly, these medications could cause harm to the animals.
If the veterinarian approves the use of chemical immobilization by the licensee to capture the animals at the facility,
then the licensee must receive and document proper training and instruction from the attending veterinarian. This
training is to minimally include proper technique, appropriate and safe use of equipment, and the appropriate use
and management of controlled substances and other sedative/tranquilizers to ensure proper dosing rates and
administration to protect the health and welfare of the animals. The licensee must also have written guidance from
the attending veterinarian to appropriately monitor animals and respond in the event of a medical emergency (injury,
respiratory distress, body temperature regulation etc.)
