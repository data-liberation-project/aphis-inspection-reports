2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The facility was not following the IACUC approved procedure for one category E protocol involving hamsters. The protocol
required challenged hamsters to be observed for morbidity twice daily at no less than a six-hour interval. One facility
representative working directly with the hamsters stated that the challenged hamsters were checked, as standard
practice, twice daily at a four-hour interval.

The reduction of the interval from at least 6 to every 4 hours, twice daily, would reasonably be expected to result in
greater distress, pain and suffering in these hamsters.
Failure to follow IACUC approved protocols, and implementing unapproved changes without IACUC oversight, may have
a negative impact on animal welfare.

The facility must ensure that all significant changes to protocols are approved by the IACUC prior to implementation or
that the facility follows the protocols as written and approved.
