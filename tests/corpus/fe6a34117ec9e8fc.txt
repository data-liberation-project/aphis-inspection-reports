the treatments were obtained in accordance to veterinary consultation while others were not.

that he recently identified many rabbits with respiratory conditions that he treated with Florfenicol. When asked, the
licensee explained that he did discuss using this medication with his veterinarian but was unable to obtain a dosage.
The licensee created his own drug dosaging and route protocol to treat. The licensee provided the medication to the
rabbits orally and through muscle injection. The licensee explained that the treated rabbits did not respond or
respond well to either treatment, many of them going off feed and getting worse.
-(cid:9)At least one black and white rabbit (Pecan side, second group) was identified by the licensee as having coccidia.
The licensee explained that he is treating animals with coccidia with Toltrazuril and that his veterinarian was
consulted on this. The licensee indicated that he determined dosaging on his own through research.
Treating animals and/or dosaging without guidance from a veterinarian could lead to inappropriate methods
(under/over dosing, inappropriate route) to treat diseases that can be detrimental to animal’s health and well-being.
The licensee, in connection with the attending veterinarian must develop an adequate program of veterinary care
that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
