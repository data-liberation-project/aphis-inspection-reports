Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10-1030 AM on 09-
02-21. The gate was closed and the phone number is not valid. I e-mailed the licensee, honked the car horn numerous
times and waited thirty minutes.

Please contact your inspector #515-851-1268 or john.j.lies@usda.gov
