During the inspection there were ten pigs with health issues identified that had not been reported to the attending
veterinarian or treated due to not being observed. There were six 4-6week old pigs in room #2, and 1 in room #4
that had fluid filled swellings of their left ears. One of the pigs in room #2 also had a swollen left rear hock and was
limping, and 1 pig in room #4 had three of her four legs with multiple lumps/swelling on the right rear hock and both
front ankles along with the fluid filled ear swellings. In the second to last pen in the Pre-Shipment barn there was a
male pig approximately 25 weeks of age that had very large swellings on both sides of his neck and under the chin.
.All animals observed during the inspection with the injuries appeared to be in good health and not in any obvious
pain, however there were signs of discomfort due to limping by those with the leg swellings and some head shaking
from those with the swollen fluid filled ears. Due to the these injuries not being observed until during the inspection,
there had not been any treatment given or veterinarian contacted.
It is very important that any injuries or illnesses are observed as soon as possible in order to prevent a minor issue
from becoming chronic and to decrease the time an animal is in any discomfort or pain. Daily observations of all
animals, especially in large populations (1000 pigs) as with this facility need to be conducted thoroughly.

During the inspection the veterinarian had been contacted and all animals were treated, including all fluid filled ears
drained and treated, and medications provided under veterinary direction for those animals with leg swellings. All
animals are on the facilities treatment log to continue with daily treatment as needed and monitoring until the injuries
are resolved under the direction of their veterinarian.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In a population of 1000 pigs, there were 6 young pigs 4-6 weeks of age in room #2, two pigs in room #4 and two
adults in the Pre-Shipment barn that had some physical health issues that had gone un-noticed until during the
inspection. All of the pigs appeared to be healthy and acting normal except for those with injured ears full of fluidand joint swellings, and one with large swelling of the neck area. All of the younger pigs were recently moved to
their new barn at this site 6 days ago. The animals did not appear to be in noticeable pain during the inspection,
however discomfort was observed by some limping and shaking of the heads.
It is imperative that all animals are checked daily for any signs of illness or injuries in order to decrease the time of
discomfort or pain by a regulated animal. In such large populations of animals it will take more effort to make sure
all animals are observed, however it is important for their health and well being that any injury/illness is identified
before it becomes painful or chronic.
The licensee must continue to work at physically checking all animals on a daily basis for any possible health issues
and making sure all animals are treated in a timely manner.
