HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosures housing five adult dogs were muddy and the water from the snow melt was not draining
from the enclosures. The dogs in the enclosures were unable to stay clean and dry.
The drainage system for the four outdoor enclosures needs to be corrected to prevent the dogs from walking in mud
and water and to minimize the risk of disease hazards.
To be corrected by April 15, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
