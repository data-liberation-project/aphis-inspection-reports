ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2pm on
12-NOV-19.
I arrived at the facility, knocked on the door and called out. I then called the phone number provided twice and left
one message. I waited 30 minutes at the facility and then left.
