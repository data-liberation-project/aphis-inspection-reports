2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several animals are noted to have medical issues at time of the inspection . These include the male camel with
weight loss/diarrhea and the 12 year old wolf with a round mass on the side of his left muzzle and an irritated area
on his tongue. The 16 yr old female Leopard was observed rubbing her face, licking her feet and has chronic hair
loss. A mass in her mammary gland was visible when she was lying down. A facility employee with veterinary
training was aware of the conditions of these animals and had provided some treatment to the camel and leopard ,
however the attending veterinarian had not been notified these animals were having medical issues. It is important
to notify the veterinarian of issues so appropriate treatment plans can be developed and followed. The daily
observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian but a mechanism of
direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,
behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
