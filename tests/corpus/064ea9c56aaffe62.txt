2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male liver and white schnauzer (“Baxter”, microchip 496 578 191E) has a heavy buildup of brown tartar on the
cheek teeth on the right side of the mouth. The tartar on the upper right cheek teeth is entirely encasing the surface
of the teeth and the individual shape of the teeth is no longer identifiable. Nearly half the surface of the upper right
canine tooth is encased in tartar with the thickest buildup located along the gum line. The cheek teeth on the left
side of the mouth also have a buildup of tartar. The gums have become moderately reddened. Poor dental health
could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and could possibly lead to further health issues.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment
plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
