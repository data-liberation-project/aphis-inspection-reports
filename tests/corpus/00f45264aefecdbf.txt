2.75(b)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee does not have adequate records for acquisition of one camel and disposition of one bison and six pigs.
The licensee does not have an acquisition record for one goat and has no disposition records for 14 rabbits.
The current inventory of animals on hand at the time of inspection is inaccurate when compared to the numbers of
animals counted during the inspection by the inspector and licensee.
Records containing the required information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including
those offspring born on premises, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use.
The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly
disclose the required information.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 5, 2022.

Watering.
There are 14 rabbit enclosures containing one adult rabbit each, with water bottles that have brown to brownish-green
material adhered to the inside of the bottles. The presence of this material indicates the bottles are not sanitized
frequently enough. Unsanitary water bottles can contaminate water and cause it to be unhealthy or unpalatable to the


animals, leading to illness. All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty and at a minimum of every two weeks.
CORRECTED AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
In the primary enclosure housing nine pygmy goats and one sheep, portions of the fence near the bottom are broken or
cut, resulting in holes and sharp points with which animals can come into contact.
In the pen housing 17 goats and one sheep, there are sagging fence panels and twisted, sagging chicken wire with sharp
points attached to the inside of the main fence. One panel of this enclosure has openings and/or damage that allow the
goats to pass their heads through into the adjacent pen, which houses an emu and other animals.
Loose wire, sagging fence material and sharp points pose a hazard for entrapment or injury to animals. All enclosures
must be constructed and maintained in good repair to contain the animals and protect them from injury.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 12, 2022.
3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
Under the haybarn used for storage of hay for all of the hoofstock on the premises, there are two bales of hay with areas
of gray to brownish-black discoloration among bales of normal appearance. Chickens were also noted to be nesting in
the hay bales intended for consumption by the animals.
In the indoor storage area used to store bagged feed for some of the animals, there is a bag of dog food split open with
kibble spilled onto the floor.
Birds nesting in food supplies and food supplies that are unwholesome can lead to animal illness or even death. Spilled
feed attracts vermin which can also contaminate feed stored nearby. Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in


facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 5, 2022.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence for the facility is less than 6 feet in height in some areas and is in poor repair, with several holes in
the chain link or under it measuring up to ~10 inches in height by up to ~2 feet in length. Additionally, the perimeter fence
is less than 3 feet from the primary enclosures. The fence is inadequate because it cannot serve as a secondary
containment system for the animals housed in the facility and cannot prevent other animals and unauthorized persons
from entering.
The licensee must modify the existing fence or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 6 feet in height (for
the species inventoried at the time of this inspection), a minimum of three feet from the primary enclosures, and
constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the animals in the facility.
TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 30, 2022.
