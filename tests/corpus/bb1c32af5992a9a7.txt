Facilities, outdoor.
3.127 (d) An approximately 60 ft section of the perimeter fence bordering either side of the gate to the parking area at the
park entrance was less than 8 ft in height. Chain link fencing 6 ft in height was present, and fence posts taller than the
existing fence were present and had previously served to extend the height of the section of fence to 8 ft. Outdoor
housing facilities with dangerous animals must have a perimeter fence that is at least 8 ft high to protect animals from
entry by the public and to serve as a secondary containment for animals housed in the facility. The licensee must ensure
that the perimeter fence is of sufficient height to keep animals in and unauthorized persons out.

Correct by: The facility began corrective action immediately and will complete by 05 December 2020.
