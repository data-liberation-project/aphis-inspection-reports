ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The following expired injectable medication was found among non-expired materials in a lock box during the
inspection: 1 bottle of Euthasol expired 5/2016. Medical materials are often imprinted with an expiration date
beyond which the manufacturer does not guarantee the safety or stability of the item. The use of outdated medical
materials is undesirable as these materials may lose their potency or degrade to toxic byproducts if stored after the
expiration date. This may result in unpredictable outcomes. All expired medical materials must be identified and
properly disposed of or properly labeled and stored in an area separate from non-expired medical materials. A
system which would ensure that the expired items are identified and handled accordingly on a regular basis is
required. This item was corrected by the end of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
