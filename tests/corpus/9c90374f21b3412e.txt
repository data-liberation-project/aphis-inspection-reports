2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Written Program of Veterinary Care.
The licensee has a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) approved by their attending veterinarian; however, it
still lacks capture and restraint methods. An incomplete PVC does not allow the attending veterinarian appropriate
authority to ensure the provisions of adequate veterinary care and to oversee treatment plans and procedures
regarding the animals. Update the written PVC so that it includes capture and restraint methods to ensure sufficient
oversight by the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition Records.
The licensee had an inaccurate acquisition record for the male Muntjac. The animal was acquired from someone
other than the individual listed on the acquisition record. This does not allow for proper tracking of the animal or
ensure it came from a proper source. Maintain complete and accurate records on all animals.
The licensee corrected this by recording the correct acquisition information regarding that animal on their records.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
At the time of the inspection, the camel enclosure still had a wooden rafter with a sharp point towards the end of the
board. There was also a metal post section sticking up from the concrete in close proximity to the water receptacle
that had sharp edges. Sharp points or edges are physical hazards that could cause injury to the animal. Repair,
replace or remove hazards to protect the camel from injury.Licensee corrected these prior to the exit interview.
Structural Strength.
On approximately the weekend of June 21, 2014, an armadillo under the care of the licensee and housed in an
open top outdoor enclosure, disappeared from its primary enclosure. The animal has never returned and there is
no evidence as to the disposition of the animal. Animals must be properly enclosed in such a way that there is not a
potential for escape, and to ensure that the animals are protected from predators. Licensee must ensure that
facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.
Licensee has since taken steps to ensure that the remaining armadillo is properly secured on all sides to prevent
escape or contact with outside animals.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
