HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A door on Monkey Island used to separate monkeys has a broken frame. The middle steel frame tubing of the door
used to confine monkeys during cleaning and maintenance has a broken, jagged portion with sharp points. This
broke area appears to have been part of a door latch. The sharp points and jagged edges could injure monkeys.
Need to repair, replace, or remove this portion of the jagged sharp edges to help insure that monkeys are in a safe
and hazard free enclosure. Correct by 07-25-2014 (Park Supervisor closed this gate during this inspection,
removing the jagged/sharp area of the door from the exposure to the monkeys in this enclosure.)
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The open top tunnel leading from the sheltered housing to the outdoor housing of the bobcat enclosures have
approximately 1 to 2 inches of standing water. It is raining at the time of this inspection and the standing pool of
water appears to be rain water. There is no drain in place to remove this rain water. The animal must walk through
this tunnel when going between different housing units. Housing facilities must be equipped with drainage systems
that are constructed where excess water is rapidly eliminated and the animals can stay dry.. All drains must be
properly constructed, installed, and maintained. Standing puddles of water in animal areas must be mopped up or
drained so that the animals remain dry. An adequate drain for this tunnel must be put into place to help the animal
to stay as dry as possible when moving from different enclosures. Correct by 09-23-2014.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility Park/Zoo Director.
