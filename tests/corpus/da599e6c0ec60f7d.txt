2.31(d)(1) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol number 14390, which involves spiny mice (Acomys species), is classified as Category D, where pain and
distress are treated with appropriate and specified analgesics, anesthetics, and / or tranquilizers. Specifically, for
post-surgical support and treatment of severe fight wounds, the protocol specifies a table of analgesics and
dosages.
The following was noted upon reviewing medical records:
On 3/12/14 in Cage ID "Acomys 2" it was observed that one of two males had several fight wounds, including (cid:28)"right
axillary (very deep, able to visualize muscle)"(cid:29). The Attending Veterinarian recommended carprofen gel, which is
specified in the protocol as appropriate analgesia. The research group (cid:28)requested no treatment(cid:29). Five days later
there is a notation that the investigator requested no carprofen gel due to the mouse having a cranial cap. This is
despite the fact that the protocol lists carprofen as a specified appropriate analgesic for this procedure.
On 3/12/14 in Cage ID "Acomys 10" there is a notation that two males have several fight wounds, and one has a leg
wound with intermittent lameness. The Attending Veterinarian recommends carprofen gel for 5 to 7 days for the
lame mouse. There is a request for the research team to approve this treatment within 20 hours. Two days later
one mouse was euthanized, and the other (cid:28)"recovered"(cid:29). No analgesics appear to have been administered.
On 4/16/14 in Cage ID "Acomys 42B" there were two pups noted with (cid:28)"multiple large surface area lesions
(superficial to moderate)"(cid:29). The Attending Veterinarian recommends treatment with Carprofen gel for two to three
days. The next day the research team replied that they "(cid:28)declined carprofen gel at this time"(cid:29).
In the 5/13/14 IACUC meeting minutes these same researches request a modification to the protocol to "(cid:28)remove
anti-inflammatory agents"(cid:29) for part of the study, in order to "(cid:28)elucidate the differences in inflammatory responses"(cid:29).
These examples demonstrate that the research team was not following the IACUC-approved protocol which
specified treatment for pain and distress. The reluctance of the researches to employ analgesics, and the delay in
treatment, likely caused unnecessary pain and distress to these animals.Unless an acceptable justification is provided in writing for withholding appropriate treatment for pain and distress,
and until the time that such a justification has been reviewed and approved by the IACUC, the researchers cannot
vary from what is clearly described in the protocol.
Animals should be provided with appropriate treatment to relieve pain and distress in a timely manner, as described
in the approved protocol.
A similar issue was previously cited under this section on 11/26/13, and was to be corrected from that time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
