PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Sec. 3.6 Primary enclosures. (c) Additional requirements for dogs--(1) Space.(iii)
**** There are 9 out of 28 pens having wire tops, as the licensee stated the tops are on there to prevent the dogs
from escaping. Those pens only have 3-5 inches height clearance when the dogs are in a normal standing position.
Not meeting the minimum 6 inch height requirement means the dog can not stand in a comfortable normal standing
position. You must design and maintain the pens that meet the minimum 6 inch height requirement and allows the
dog to stand in a comfortable normal position.
