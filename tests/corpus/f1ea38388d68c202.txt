***In the walk through portion, there was an enclosure containing six Ringtail Lemurs. The walls of this enclosure were
constructed of 2"x 4" horse panel. The front of this enclosure also had 1"x 2" coated wire attached to the horse panel from
the roof to the ground. This 1"x 2" coated wire was also around the bottom of the entire enclosure from the ground up to
approximately 3' and from there to the roof on both ends and the back was just the horse panel. There was a large tree at
the back of the enclosure that over-hung the roof of the Lemur enclosure and also the the alligator enclosure. Two of the
Lemurs were juveniles and were observed outside of the enclosure in the tree and on the roof of the enclosure. These
small Lemurs were observed entering and exiting the enclosure through the 2"x 4" holes in the horse panels.
Enclosures that do not provide a secure containment increases the risk of injury or death of animals that can escape. The
licensee must construct this enclosure to contain all of the Lemurs or move the Lemurs to a secure location and ensure
that all animals are securely contained as required.
To be corrected by close of business September 2, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
