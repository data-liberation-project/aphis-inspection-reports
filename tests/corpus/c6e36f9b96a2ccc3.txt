2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
About 5 adult pigs were observed as having overgrown hooves. A few of the toes on the pigs were turning inward
due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities
which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, they must
ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
