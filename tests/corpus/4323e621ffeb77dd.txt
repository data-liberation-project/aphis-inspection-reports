2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While moving through the kennel the inspectors noticed a female Yorkshire Terrier (ID #78) that was carrying the
back right foot. During the entire time the dog was observed by the inspectors she never placed her right hind foot
on the flooring. The pads on the back right foot were mildly swollen and moderately reddened with superficial
abrasions on the pads. One toenail was curled back into the pad, but no lesion was observed where the toenail met
the pad. The other toenails were long and starting to curl back under the right hind foot.
Injured paw pads and long toenails can cause pain and discomfort to the dog and could lead to other veterinary
care issues. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
Diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspectors upon request. Licensee must
ensure that all animals received adequate veterinary care at all times.
The following dogs were evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and received treatment:
Female Yorkshire Terrier (#74)
Male Yorkshire Terrier (#168)
Female Yorkshire Terrier (#84)
Female Yorkshire Terrier (#009)
The following dog was evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is under a treatment plan:
