ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female fallow deer " Penny" was noted to have a firm swelling protruding from the jawline under the ear on
the right side. The swelling was approximately 6 inches in diameter, missing hair from the affected skin, appeared
inflammed, was red and crusted in the center. The licensee stated he first noticed the swelling about one week ago
and had discussed the problem with a veterinarian but the animal had not yet received any treatment.
Abnormal swellings can be a sign of infection, disease or other condition that could adversely affect the health of the
animal and/or cause discomfort if left untreated. The deer must be seen and assessed by a veterinarian and receive
appropriate treatment and follow-up applicable to the diagnosis.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure primarily housing deer, a guanaco and some pigs and goats at the rear of the facility:
*Has fencing on the north side of the enclosure that is bent and broken in two sections. The original height of the
fence is compromised in the damaged areas.
*Has a damaged and bent section of fencing on the west side. The fencing is partially wrapped or attached around a
metal support and has sharp points protruding from the edges that could be accessible to the animals.
*Has two single strands of tightly anchored barbed wire on or next to the ground on the interior of the enclosure.
The barbed wire can be stepped on or tripped over by the animals. The licensee stated the wire was a foundation
for fence construction that had not been completed.
Housing facilities must be kept in good repair to safely contain the animals and prevent injury. The enclosure
fencing should be repaired or replaced and the animals should be protected from contact with barbed wire.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The floor of the coati mundi enclosure is constructed of wood. The floor was damp, appeared soft and was
splintered in some areas. A build up of food, hair and wood pieces were noted on the south end at the junction of
the wall and floor. Eggshell, wood pieces and flies were spread through out the floor. The licensee stated that the
floor is currently cleaned only by flushing with water.
The enclosure floor appears water logged and unsealed and is therefore unable to be adequately cleaned.
Unsealed wood, continuously saturated with moisture, animal waste, food debris, flies and subsequently cleaned
only with water, can become a breeding ground for bacteria and contribute to disease hazards. To protect the health
of the animals changes should be implemented to ensure appropriate sanitation of this enclosure.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Several goats and a guanaco were housed in an enclosed area in front of the facility that contained a storage
building. The building contents were open to the enclosure because one half of the door was missing. Directly
adjacent to and in front of the building were solid metal panels, fence panels, plastic sheets and wire projecting from
a trash can. Accidental access to and contact with these items could result in injury to the animals. Accumulations of
trash, discarded and unused items should be cleared as necessary from animal enclosures to maintain the health of
the animals and protect them from injury.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Excessive numbers of black flies covered the wooden floor of the primary enclosure housing the two coati mundis.
Hundreds of flies were noted in the enclosure, on cage furnishings and the chain link walls. Insects can cause
irritation to the animal by biting or swarming. Flies can also transmit disease causing pathogens. A safe and
effective program for insect control must be established and maintained.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee on June 12, 2017. The exit interview was conducted with the
licensee on June 13, 2017.
