3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The written program of veterinary care is incomplete. There is no plan for sampling dogs for blood parasites and intestinal
parasites, including the number of animals to be sampled. There is also no treatment plan for blood or intestinal parasites.
Parasites are a common cause of disease in dogs and puppies and if undetected and properly treated, can lead to
serious illness and even death.

The facility must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs. The program of veterinary care must be
completed and include plans for sampling and treatment for blood and intestinal parasites. The missing information must
be added to the program of veterinary care to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
