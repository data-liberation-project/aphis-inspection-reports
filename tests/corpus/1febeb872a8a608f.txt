2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** In the native species room, there are two enclosures housing an opossum and two grey squirrels. There is no
barrier that would prevent the public from having contact direct contact with the enclosures and the wire mesh did
not prevent the inspectors fingers from passing through and potentially having contact with the animals. A barrier
needs to be established with sufficient distance between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
