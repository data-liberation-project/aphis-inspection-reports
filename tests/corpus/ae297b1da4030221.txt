FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure containing the feed bunks for the deer has sharp points from broken wires attached to a wooden
corner post and they are located at the level of the animals. There are three deer that have access to this enclosure.
The fence line behind the office is constructed of woven wire and also has at least three broken wires creating sharp
points at the level of the animals. There are six elk and three deer housed within this enclosure. Sharp points can
cause injury to the animals. The licensee must remove all sharp points from the animal enclosures in order to
protect them from injury.
The enclosure containing six elk and three deer is constructed of wooden fence posts and woven wire. There are at
least three wooden fence posts located along the fence line behind the office building that are leaning and are
broken at the base and wobble and move freely when pushed by the inspector.
Broken fencing is not structurally sound and could cause injury to the animals or allow the animals to escape. The
facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals housed within. The
facility must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The licensee must
repair or replace the broken wooden fence posts to ensure the animals are safe from injury and cannot escape.

SANITATION.
The enclosure containing six elk and three deer has a large pond at its center. Behind the pond dam there are at
least five discarded rubber vehicle tires lying on the ground. The tires are partially covered by dirt and leaves.
Contact with the rubber tires could cause injury to the animals.
The premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury and all accumulations of discarded
items must be placed in designated areas. The licensee must remove the tires from the animal enclosure and
ensure that all discarded material and trash is placed in a designated area away from the animals.Exit interview was conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
