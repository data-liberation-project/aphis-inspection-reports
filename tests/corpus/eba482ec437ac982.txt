HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of the inspection of the annex facility there were multiple holes in the floor of at least three enclosures
housing non-human primates. The facility representative stated that these holes had not been noticed. These holes
present a source of possible limb injury to the enclosed animals, and also increase the risk of environmental
contamination with liquid and waste pooling in the holes. Housing facilities for non-human primates must be
designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of non-human primates housed in
them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At the time of the inspection of the annex facility there were 3 young baboons identified as Valor # 13114, Terk #
13014, and Ebenezer # 12614 (approximately 3 months of age per facility representatives) that were wet over their
entire bodies. Two were perched on a ledge in the enclosure, while the third was alone on the floor. This lone
baboon was shivering and clearly distressed. This room had been hosed out earlier and the baboons were sprayed
during the cleaning of their enclosure. Not only was this stressful and uncomfortable to the infant baboons, it is also
a potential health risk. Young baboons are susceptible to hypothermia which can be life threatening if not caught in
time. This stress can also depress their immune systems which puts them at risk for disease. When water is used
to clean the primary enclosure, whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, non-human primates must be
removed, unless the enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals will not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in
the process.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At the time of the inspection a room housing 12 infant baboons ( animal numbers 33547, 33558, 33596, 33579,33580, 33588, 33590, 33565, 33566, 33568, 33581, and 33591) in two separate enclosures had an excessive build
up of grime and waste debris. These primary enclosures and 3 other empty enclosures in this room had an
excessive build up of grime, debris and excreta on the bars and walls. The three empty enclosures had been used
a few days earlier as temporary holding for the baboons but had not been cleaned since. The care staff was asked
to explain the cleaning and sanitizing process used at the facility. The care staff explained how a soap solution was
sprayed in the enclosure and allowed to sit for a bit then rinsed off. The staff did not explain any sanitation process
nor give any indication that a sanitizer was used at all. Indoor primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once
every 2 weeks and cleaned as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, or
disease hazard using one of the methods prescribed in the Animal Welfare Act.
This was corrected during the inspection.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At the time of inspection fo the SPF annex nursery area two of the three rooms housing baboons, had ceiling return
vents covered with an accumulation of dust, debris, and cobwebs. This poses a risk to the health of the animals as
the debris may contain excreta, food waste, and harbor disease. The return vents must be cleaned as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein, to minimize disease hazards and to reduce
odors.
This was corrected during the inspection.
During the inspection of the annex facility there was a valve on a water pipe that constantly dripped onto the roof of
a stainless steel enclosure housing two non-human primates (animal numbers 3013 and 1313). The enclosure was
directly beneath the valve on the pipes supplying water to animals in this room. Their enclosure had a dark black
discoloration on top of the roof along with a white buildup of crusty debris. There was also a black discoloration
along the back inside wall of the enclousure, in the corner located beneath the dripping pipe. Water dripping down
and pooling on the roof and wall of an enclosure may provide a source of contamination or discomfort to the
enclosed animals. Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds,
must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the non-human primates from injury, to facilitate the
husbandry practices required.

3.85EMPLOYEES.
The inspection of the BMSB and the annex revealed training deficiencies involving cleaning and sanitizing
enclosures housing non-human primates. BMSB employees were unclear on existing standard operating
procedures for cleaning, and did not appear to be aware of Animal Welfare Act requirements for sanitization
procedures. In the annex, there appears to be a need for cross-training employees so that individuals working in
unfamiliar areas will have a basic understanding of how to properly clean animal areas while properly protecting the
enclosed animals. Thoroughly trained personnel are critical to safely and effectively care for nonhuman primates.
All employees must be properly trained and knowledgeable in all husbandry and care procedures and requirements.
Corrected during the inspection by an employee training meeting held on 1-22-2015 to go over a cleaning and
sanitizing enclosure protocol.
Inspection conducted on 1/20-22/2015. Accompanied on the inspection by University AV and Director of Animal
Welfare. Exit interview conducted with facility representatives and APHIS personnel on 1/26/2015.
