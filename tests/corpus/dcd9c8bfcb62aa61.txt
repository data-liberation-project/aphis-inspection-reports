2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate methods were not used to diagnose and treat a geriatric female California Sea Lion that was injured in
January 2017. The animal was never treated for a cut that subsequently healed with a large raised pink lesion that
appears to be scar tissue.
Facility records show that the attending veterinarian was called on January 18, 2017 regarding a cut under the
animal's chin. According to staff at the facility no veterinarian ever examined the animal and the only treatment
provided for the cut was isolating the animal and cleaning the wound at the direction of the veterinarian. The
attending veterinarian was contacted on the day of the inspection and stated that he intended to examine the animal
but was very busy and was never able to make a trip to the facility. The licensee never contacted a different
veterinarian to provide care for the animal.
Animals with health concerns should receive prompt veterinary care that is appropriate for their circumstances. In
this case, one attempt was made to obtain care but the animal was never seen by a veterinarian. Appropriate
treatment in this case may have prevented the development of scar tissue. The facility should ensure that prompt
and appropriate veterinary care is provided for the animals.
3.110(d)(2)VETERINARY CARE.
Appropriate medical records were not kept for an injured California sea lion. The only record of the injury was the
date the attending veterinarian was notified that the animal had a cut under her chin, which was January 18, 2016.
There was no date of injury, no description of the extent of the injury, no treatment plan, no notes regarding
treatment recommendations given by their attending veterinarian, and no documentation of treatment. The animal
was never seen by a veterinarian, thus there were no medical records generated by a veterinarian.
Medical record keeping is necessary to ensure that animals are receiving appropriate medical care. It is important to
document the dates and details of injuries and illnesses so that accurate information may be conveyed to the
veterinarian who is making treatment decisions. Incomplete medical records may interfere the ability of veterinarians
to make appropriate treatment decisions and subsequently to provide appropriate treatment for medical conditions.
APHIS officials use medical records to ensure that animals have received appropriate medical care. It is the
responsibility of the facility to ensure that adequate medical records are kept for all marine mammals housed there.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
