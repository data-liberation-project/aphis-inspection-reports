Certifications.
During Center for Disease Control (CDC) veterinary examination,11 dogs were identified as older than the stated age on
the import permit. In addition, there were some medical concerns identified that were not disclosed on health certificates.
Accurate Information, including the dog's age and health status, should be included on the import permits and health
certificates, respectively, to meet the regulatory requirements.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
There were some dogs in enclosures that could not contain them comfortably. Harper, Candy and Franklin could not
make normal postural movements, as all three could not lift their heads above their shoulders when standing. Lengthwise,
Harper's enclosure could not contain him without his front paws being tucked under. Dogs transported in enclosures of
insufficient size can affect their health and well-being.
Gracie’s enclosure was missing 7 screws along the sides of her kennel. Harper’s kennel had a small, cracked area
adjacent to where the metal door latches to the kennel. As a result, a zip tie was used to secure the door. Enclosures
maintained in these manners may not contain the dogs securely.


Primary enclosures should be in good repair and strong enough to contain the dogs securely and comfortably and to
withstand the normal rigors of transportation.
3.15(a)(4)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
There were at least 4 dog kennels identified with zip ties securing their doors. The presence of zip ties on dog kennels
can prevent easy and quick removal of dogs from an enclosure in the event of an emergency.
A system should be in place to ensure dogs can be easily and quickly removed from their enclosure in an emergency.
3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Lily, Pugsley and Erin's enclosures did not have the words “Live Animals,” in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and
with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure. This is to ensure the
contents and position of the enclosure is readily identifiable by personnel handling the enclosures.
A system should be in place to ensure that unless an enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it is clearly
marked on top and on one or more sides with the words “Live Animals,” in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with
arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosures.
3.15(c)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Some dog enclosures on board the plane were stacked in different directions to accommodate all available space. As a
result, some enclosure walls had adjacent enclosures up against them at an angle where the required total surface
ventilation of a wall was reduced. No methods in place identified to prevent enclosures from shifting during transit. Poor
ventilation can result in overheating of animals as well as breathing difficulties, especially to brachycephalic breeds, which


were present on the plane. A system should be in place to ensure ventilation openings of dog enclosures are not
obstructed.
3.17

Food and water requirements.
Documents were not available or attached to the crates of the 31 dogs to certify the date and time they were offered food
and potable water within the 4 hours preceding delivery of the dogs to the carrier. There were no documents attached to
the outside of the primary enclosures with written instructions for the in-transit food and water requirements for a 24-hour
period for the dogs contained in the enclosures. In addition, food and water receptacles were not attached to the
enclosures carrying the dogs during this flight. Filled water receptacles were identified on the plane but not in any of the
dog crates. Dogs should be provided with water at all times and documentation made available to ensure dogs are offered
food and water as required in the regulations, for their health and well-being.
3.18 Direct

Care in transit.
The following medical concerns were identified during the CDC examination of dogs at time of arrival. There were no
medical notations or other observations noted by the transporter. Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officers were present
during the examinations.
-Leo, a pug, displayed labored breathing, including open mouth and rapid breathing, at time of arrival. He was removed
immediately from the plane and examined by the CDC veterinarian.
- Bruno, had 3 lesions on his back and neck that appeared red, raised, inflamed, with some hair loss. One lesion was
approximately the size of a quarter, and 2 the size of a dime.
-A pug was missing his left eye with mild discharge present.
-There was loose stool/ diarrhea of unknown etiology and history present in Jessica and Erin's enclosures.


-Chaplin and Pugsley were noted to have ear irritations that appeared red and inflamed.
-Trio was missing his right foot.
Medical concerns should be fully disclosed and is the responsibility of the transporter to observe the dogs as frequently as
needed, and to ensure there are no dogs obviously ill, injured, or in physical distress. A system should be in place to
ensure the regulations under section 3.18, Care in Transit, have been followed, for the health and well-being of the dogs.
