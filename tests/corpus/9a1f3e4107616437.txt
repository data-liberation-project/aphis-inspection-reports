ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A kitten had been noted by a Thornton Police Detective on 11/1/2014 to be in need of veterinary care due to thin
body condition, lethargy, and abnormal appearance to the rectal area. The facility did not contact a veterinarian in a
timely manner and this kitten was found dead the next morning.
A female albino hedgehog, "Gwen", had been acquired by the facility on 10/2/2014 from a licensed breeder. A
facility representative contacted the breeder on 10/17/2014 and stated that this female hedgehog, "Gwen", was not
doing well, losing weight, and possibly being bullied away from the food and water in the enclosure by another adult
female hedgehog. Two more phone conversations and several text messages between facility representatives and
the licensed breeder indicated that this hedgehog was continuing to decline and would not readily eat or drink. The
breeder traveled over 5 hours to reclaim this animal as well as 3 other juvenile male hedgehogs due to concerns for
their health and well-being. The female hedgehog, "Gwen", died overnight after the original owner attempted to
provide more aggressive therapeutic care. The facility never contacted a veterinarian regarding the condition of this
animal and did not seek appropriate care in a timely manner.
During the inspection, a juvenile pinto-colored female hedgehog was noted to be thin and had some tenting of her
skin. The body weight for this animal was 4.4 oz at the time of inspection. This is a low body weight as compared
to another juvenile female hedgehog of similar size who weighed 6.0 oz at the time of inspection. This animal, and
all of the animals, should be closely observed on a daily basis to ensure they are in good health, eating and drinking
normally, and, especially for juvenile animals, gaining weight and growing properly. This animal should be weighed
daily and should be seen by a veterinarian if she is not steadily gaining weight within the next week (by 11/22/2014).
One of the facility's employees has been taking animals home for "health watch" purposes. This employee took 1
hedgehog on 6/18/2014 and 2 hedgehogs on 11/7/2014 because there was a concern that these animals were "too
small" and not gaining weight appropriately. Neither the employee or the owners have contacted a veterinarian
concerning these animals and there is no indication as to whether they recovered and were returned to the facility
for sale as pet animals.
Weight loss, lack of weight gain in young animals, tenting of the skin, lethargy, and other abnormal signs orbehaviors may be indicating an underlying medical problem. This information must be communicated to a
veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner so that appropriate diagnostics, care, and treatment, if needed, can be
provided.
The facility must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by 11/17/2014.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility is not making, keeping, or maintaining records which fully and correctly disclose the required information
concerning acquisition and disposition of cats.
**One acquisition record was available along with an APHIS Form 7005 that listed 6 kittens acquired from an
unlicensed breeder on 6/5/2014 for sale at this facility. One acquisition record for 6 kittens acquired from an
unlicensed breeder on 8/27/14 did not contain a vehicle license number and State or a driver's license number and
State or other form of official identification from this individual. No APHIS Form 7005 containing the information on
these 6 kittens was made available for review during this inspection.
**Disposition records for kittens reviewed since the previous inspection of 3/13/2014 showed 2 sold in April, 7 in
June, 2 in July, 4 in August, 2 in September, and 1 on October 29 for a total of 18 sold. There were no acquisition
records showing animals acquired prior to 6/5/2014 and only the two listed above that show a total of 13 kittens
acquired so there are 5 kittens for which no acquisition records were made, kept, or maintained.
**A Thornton Police Department detective had reported that three kittens were present on 11/1/2014 at the facility.
One of these kittens was reported to be in need of veterinary care but did not receive care before it died the next
day. Another kitten reportedly was taken back to the owner's property and no kittens were on site during this
inspection. A disposition record made on 10/29/2014 for 1 kitten was reviewed but it is not clear if this is one of the
3 kittens that was seen by the detective or if there were 4 kittens prior to 11/1/2014 or when the disposition of the
third kitten actually occurred since 3 were present on 11/1/2014.
Accurate and complete records for the acquisition and disposition of cats are required to ensure that legal
acquisition and humane transportation and care occur.
Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning each cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her
control.To be conducted from this time forward.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility is not making, keeping, or maintaining records for the acquisition and disposition of animals other than
dogs and cats that contain all of the required information.
**Since the previous inspection on 3/13/2014, records of disposition showed that a total of 24 hedgehogs were sold,
21 were transferred to site 002 for this licensee, 3 were transferred to an employee for "health watch", 4 returned to
licensed breeder on 10/23/14, and 1 died on 6/1/14 (24 + 21 + 3 + 4 +1 = 53 total hedgehog dispositions).
There were 18 hedgehogs on site on 3/13/2014. Acquisition records between that previous inspection and this
inspection showed 20 hedgehogs acquired on 5/13/2014 and 52 on 11/6/2014 (18 + 20 + 52 = 90 total hedgehogs
acquired). There were 28 hedgehogs in the facility at the time of this inspection which leaves 9 hedgehogs
unaccounted for by disposition records (90-53-28 = 9).
**The 4 hedgehogs returned to the licensed breeder on 10/23/14 did not have a record of the original acquisition of
these animals from the breeder and, per the facility representatives' and breeder's account, 12 hedgehogs were
sold to the facility on 10/2/2014 but no record was available for review at the time of this inspection.
**At the time of this inspection, 2 chinchillas were present. At the previous inspection of 3/13/2014, 4 chinchillas
were present. Only 1 record of acquisition for chinchillas was made available at this inspection and it was for 2
chinchillas acquired by the facility on 7/28/13. No disposition records for chinchillas were available for review during
this inspection.
**A record of acquisition of 4 sugar gliders on 3/18/14 was available for review. No sugar gliders were present
during this inspection and a disposition record for 2 sugar gliders on 9/26/14 was available but no other record of
disposition for the other 2 sugar gliders was made or available for review.
Accurate and complete records for the acquisition and disposition of cats are required to ensure that legal
acquisition and humane transportation and care occur.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession
or under his or her control.
To be corrected from this time forward.2.130
MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
The facility had a record of acquisition of 6 kittens on 8/27/14 from an unlicensed breeder that listed the ages of the
kittens as 6 weeks.
Transportation and handling of kittens less than 8 week of age poses a risk to the health of these animals as they
do not have fully developed immune systems and are susceptible to stress and infectious diseases.
No cat shall be transported in commerce by any person, except to a registered research facility, unless such cat is
at least eight (8) weeks of age and has been weaned.
To be corrected from this time forward.
Inspection conducted on 11/13/2014 with owners, employees, Colorado Department of Agriculture PACFA
inspector, and APHIS AC VMO. Exit interview conducted with employee on site.
