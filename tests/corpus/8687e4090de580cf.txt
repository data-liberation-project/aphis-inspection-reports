3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Many of the metal pipes, posts, gates and framework for enclosure fencing housing zebras and camels on the east
and west side of the main facility, are excessively rusted. The excessive rust has resulted in pitting and flaking of
the metal. The licensee indicated this repair project is ongoing.
The licensee has completed repair of most previously identified damaged metal associated with enclosure fencing
in the kangaroo (central) part of the facility. However, at least one kangaroo shelter was noted to have interior metal
supports that were rusted, pitted and flaking.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The majority of the facility dromedary camels are housed on the east side adjacent to the main facility. This primary
enclosure fencing is not completely surrounded by a perimeter fence. The areas lacking the required perimeter
fencing are adjacent to a horse pasture (east) and two private residences (south and west.)
The zebras on the southwest side of the main facility are housed in a primary enclosure that is not completely
surrounded by the required perimeter fence on the west side. This side is adjacent to a private residence.
Perimeter fence construction has been completed in the front (south) side of the main facility. Variance submission
was discussed with the licensee.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
