HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (3) Cleaning.
***On the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, there were two enclosures containing one adult dog each. The
framework around the doorway had a build up of dirt and grime. There was also a self feeder in one of these
enclosures that had a build up of dirt around the edges of the opening and on the door flap. There was also a self
feeder in another primary enclosure that had a buildup of dirt around where the animals eat. Cleaning of hard
surfaces is essential for a healthy environment and reduces disease hazards by eliminating harboring places for
diseases and pests. The licensee must asssure that all hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact are
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of build up
and reduce disease hazards.
This inspection began at 0902.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the licensee.
