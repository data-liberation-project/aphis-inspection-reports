ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
- At approximately 1000 on 29 March 2016, USDA inspectors Michael Tygart (VMO) and Robert Whiteley
(ACI)attempted an inspection at the facility. We were accompanied by an Investigator for the Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission. We identified ourselves to the licensee, Kathy Stearns, and stated that we were
there to conduct an inspection. Ms. Stearns stated that she had made an agreement with the USDA which
exempted her from inspections on Tuesdays. At this time we contacted the assigned inspector for this facility, and
the supervisor for this facility. Both stated that no such agreement existed. When we relayed this to Ms. Stearns
she stated that was refusing to allow an inspection. At this point we asked her to confirm that she was refusing an
inspection, and she confirmed the refusal. At this time the inspectors left the facility.
