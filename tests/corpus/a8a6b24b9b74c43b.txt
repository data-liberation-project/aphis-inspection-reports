Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One adult Dall ram had significantly overgrown dewclaws with profound amounts of crusting and ulcerative lesions
encompassing all four distal limbs. The left forelimb and left hindlimb hooves were noticeably overgrown. The dewclaws of
all four limbs exceeded 3 inches in length. Thick layers of crusting covered the haircoat directly above each hoof,
advancing upward on each extremity. Ulcerative lesions were noted on all four limbs with fresh blood present. Although
the facility representative stated this ram had been mistakenly overlooked, the severity of the animal’s condition on
inspection suggest these ailments have been ongoing for some time now.

Failure to appropriately identify, control, diagnose, and treat diseases can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, pain, and
other veterinary care problems. The inability to maintain necessary foot health can also result in lameness and
subsequent pain.
2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One red fox had a gumball-sized growth on its left forelimb. The skin was intact, with no associated lesions, swelling, or
discomfort shown. When the growth was brought to the facility representative’s attention, they stated the mass had gone


unnoticed until today’s inspection.

Failure to observe all animals daily can result in deterioration of the animal's health, particularly when masses are rapidly
growing, or its etiology is unknown. Daily observation of all animals shall be done to assess their health and well-being.
Timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being noted during daily observations
must be communicated to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided.

Watering.
One dromedary camel did not have clean drinking water. The water receptacle contained murky, dark green water, unable
to visualize the bottom of the receptacle. The consumption of unclean drinking water can cause severe illness and decline
in an animal’s health. Accessibility to potable water is necessary for the well-being and comfort of the animal. All water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.

Corrective actions were taken at the time of inspection.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The enclosures for two Yaks and one kangaroo had excessively overgrown weeds engulfing both outdoor enclosures.
None of the animals could be visualized in their outdoor areas. Although the zoo staff was able to coerce the kangaroo to
present itself, there was very limited ability to wholly see the animal. Accumulation of unwanted wildflowers, grass, and
weeds inhibits the facility’s ability to conduct daily observations and assess pest control within these areas. The premise


(buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury.
