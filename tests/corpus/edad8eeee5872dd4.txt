FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There are two areas at the base of the wire fence for the sheep enclosure that are becoming loose or pushed
apart creating larger gaps that may allow unintended animals to access the pen or the sheep to escape. Some of
the wire has been broken leaving points that may cause injury. The fence shall be repaired and made structurally
sound to protect the sheep.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There is no shelter provided in the enclosure housing the two bulls to protect them from the rain. Shelter shall be

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There is no perimeter fence surrounding the fox enclosure in the back yard. I observed the pet dog "Cody"
running loose in the yard. The dog approached the fox enclosure barking and harassing the fox. The fox got into the
dog house to avoid the dog. A six ft. perimeter fence is required for the fox to restrict animals and unauthorizedpersons from having contact with the fox and to act as a secondary containment fence. A perimeter fence no less
than six feet in height shall be provided to protect the fox.
***The dog was also observed making contact with one of the two bulls that were laying down in their enclosure.
One bull was laying in close proximity to fence. The dog "Cody" was running around the outside of the bull
enclosure barking, he made contact with the bull startling him and causing him to jump up and move away. The dog
shall be prevented from making unwanted contact with the animals in their enclosures.
