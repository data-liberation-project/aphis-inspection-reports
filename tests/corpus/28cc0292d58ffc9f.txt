ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:15pm on
12-Sep-18.
I called Mr. Whitmore when we were on the premise. He explained that he was out of the state. He also informed us
that his wife and kids were also busy and could not come to the facility to conduct an inspection.
