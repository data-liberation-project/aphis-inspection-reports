3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence surrounding the enclosure for the skunks is currently only 4 feet and 7 inches high. There is a
section next to one side of the enclosure is leaning over so is even lower. The perimeter fence must be 6 feet high
and at least 3 feet from the animal enclosure unless approved in writing by the Administrator. All outdoor housing
facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is constructed and maintained so that it protects the animals in
the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with
the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility.
