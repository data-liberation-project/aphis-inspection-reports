2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The current inventory of the animals on hand was not correct. There were no records available which fully and
correctly disclose the required information regarding the acquisition of 2 sugar gliders that were on site during the
time of inspection. The record of disposition for 1 hedgehog sold on 11/05/2014 did not have the name and address
of the person who acquired this animal. Maintaining current records of animals on hand, including those acquired
and disposed of, is necessary in order to be able to accurately track the movement of animals.
Make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding acquisition
and disposition of animals other than dogs and cats.
To be corrected by: Next inspection
Inspection and an exit briefing was conducted with Adrian Martinez, Owner.
