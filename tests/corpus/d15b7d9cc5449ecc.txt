3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wolf-hybrids have created a large den underneath of their rear shelter building. The metal dig guard (fence
panel) is now fully exposed on the interior portion of the earthen floor. Due to their digging of the den, the earthen
floor inside of the shelter has collapsed underneath the dig guard thus leaving large openings present. These
openings are large enough for the wolf-hybrids' feet and legs to fall through and cause injury should they walk in this
area.
A method to shore up the floor must provided to prevent another collapse. Additionally, the shelter must be kept in
good repair to prevent injury of the wolf-hybrids that utilize this shelter building.
