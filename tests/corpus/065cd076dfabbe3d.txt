FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Pens containing several species were found without sufficient shade. The foxes, wolves and coyotes are housed in
pens that have shelters but do not have any additional shade in addition to the shelters provided. The animals had
little space that supplied any shade and were all trying to stay in those areas.
Lack of sufficient shade can cause overheating and discomfort for the animals.
Provide additional shade in the pens of these animals.
