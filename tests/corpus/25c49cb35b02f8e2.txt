2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An abnormal eye condition remains present in the left eye of what is now a 7 month old unidentified female
Pekinese/Pomeranian mix. Though the condition of the eye appears not to have worsened the eye still has not
been evaluated by a veterinarian. The dog continues to squint the eye and wetness continues to be observed in
and around the eye. The current condition of the dog's eye can be painful and can lead to more serious problems
such as infection or blindness if left untreated. The licensee, in consultation with the facility's attending veterinarian,
must address the eye health of this dog.
An adult brown and white female Pekinese tag number 159 and an adult buff colored female Pomeranian/Pekinese
mix microchip number 004317787 are observed to have a hard, grayish-brown material on the surfaces of their front
and cheek teeth. The dog's gums also appear reddened. The licensee states that she has consulted the facility
veterinarian regarding dental health and has been treating the adult dogs with an oral dental medication. However,
the treatment appears to not be effectively working as the material observed on the teeth of the two dogs and the
presence of reddened gums are consistent with dental disease. Dental disease can be painful and can lead to
other health problems if left untreated. The licensee, in consultation with the facility veterinarian, must reevaluate
the effectiveness of the current dental plan and change it as necessary to more effectively treat and prevent dental
disease in these dogs and all the dogs at the facility.
An adult tri-colored male Welsh Corgi microchip number 0048833322 is observed again to have overgrown toenails.
Overgrown toenails can be painful if they become caught or break and can also affect the dog's ability to walk
normally. Correct by addressing the overgrown toenails of this dog and develop and maintain a grooming program
that addresses the toenail health of all dogs at the facility.
The licensee has been deworming the dogs and puppies at the facility with a product labeled for use in goats. The
licensee has not consulted with the attending veterinarian on the appropriateness of using a product not labeled for
use in dogs or puppies. Using an off-label medication can lead to overdosing and other adverse problems. Correct
by discontinuing the use of this medication until a consultation with the attending veterinarian has been made
regarding its use and appropriateness. The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not include sufficient detail to determine if appropriate methods are
being used for routine care of the animals including vaccinations, intestinal parasites, emergency care and
euthanasia. The PVC lacks the frequency and age(s) of administering the listed vaccinations and the frequency
and dose of the medication used for controlling intestinal parasites. The PVC also lacks sufficient provisions
regarding emergency care and the method of euthanasia. The lack of detail does not allow for the proper
evaluation of the methods being used. The licensee in conjunction with the attending veterinarian must update the
PVC to ensure it contains all pertinent information relating to veterinary care provided to the animals.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
A 7 month old female Pekinese/Pomeranian mix remains unidentified with official USDA identification. Lack of
official identification does not allow for the proper identification or tracking of the animal. Identify the adult dog with
official USDA identification.
2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Twelve weaned puppies are not identified by tag, cage card, or plastic collar. Lack of official identification does not
allow for the proper identification or tracking of the animals. All weaned puppies must have some form of official
identification.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Microchip identification numbers for all fifty-two adult dogs currently at the facility have still not been recorded on the
APHIS 7005 inventory forms and twenty-two puppy births have not been recorded on APHIS Form 7005 or on cage
cards. Also, many of the dogs have only partial or no acquisition information recorded on the 7005 forms. Three
disposition dates have also not been recorded. Lack of accurate and up-to-date inventory records does not ensure
for the proper tracking of the animals. Update the facility inventory records with all required information so they
accurately reflect the current inventory of animals.
2.78
HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee has been transporting puppies across state lines without interstate health certificates. Lack of
interstate health certificates does not ensure that the animals have been examined and deemed free of disease or
abnormality that would be a danger to themselves, other animals, and the public. Correct by acquiring interstate
health certificates from the facility's attending veterinarian before any puppies are transported across state lines.
Correct immediately and from this date forward.3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A portion of the wire fencing in the second enclosure on the east side of the inside/outside building has pulled away
from the support frame. The enclosure is no longer structurally sound. A dog may be able to escape through the
opening and the pulled away wire is also a potential injury hazard. Correct by repairing the wire that has pulled
away from its frame to ensure that the enclosure is structurally sound.
3.1(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an accumulation of discarded items such as lights and bulbs, an empty medication bottle and bait trays for
mice on the floor in the entrance area of the whelping building. Accumulations of discarded items can attract pests
and does not facilitate good husbandry practices. The presence of mice bait is a potential injury hazard should a
dog gain access to them and ingest them. Remove discarded items as often as necessary to prevent an
accumulation of such items.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Excessive rust development remains on the metal door flaps in the enclosures of the inside/outside building. The
presence of rust can prevent the surfaces from being properly cleaned and sanitized. Eliminate the rust from the
metal door flaps.
3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sharp wire points remain inside the runs on the west side of the inside/outside building as well as in the second pen
on the east side of the inside/outside building. Sharp points are an injury hazard. Remove the sharp points from
inside the runs.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Wind and rain breaks are not present at the entrance of two outside dog houses. Lack of wind and rain breaks does
not provide the dogs protection from the elements. Correct by providing weather breaks at the entrance of the dog
houses. Correct by September 18, 2015.3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is a lack of adequate bedding in the two outside dog houses. Bedding has been previously provided but it
has since begun to break down and is no longer sufficient in quantity to provide protection from the elements.
Bedding is required when the outside temperature falls below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The outside temperature this
morning at the beginning of the inspection was 41 degrees Fahrenheit. Lack of adequate bedding does not provide
the dogs protection from the elements. Correct by providing adequate amounts of bedding if the outside
temperature is below 50 degrees F. Correct by September 11, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
