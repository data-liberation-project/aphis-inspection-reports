ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The left eye of a 9 month-old female Pekinese/Pomeranian mix (no ID) is abnormal in appearance and has some
discharge around it. The licensee has not had the attending veterinarian evaluate this dog's eye to see if it needs
treatment. Eye problems can be due to many things and may be painful. To ensure that the condition is not painful
and/or receives proper treatment this dog's eye must be evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian to be properly
diagnosed. Documentation of the dog's diagnosis must be kept for future inspections.
A female Pomeranian microchip #005-008-600 has problems with her teeth and right ear. The upper teeth were
covered in a dark hard material and there was a pale discharge around them. Her right upper first pre-molar (the
tooth far back on the upper right side just behind the large tooth) of the mouth was loose to the touch. Her right ear
had a thick brown discharge matted in the hair. Tooth problems can be painful and cause further health issues in
dogs if not treated. The discharge from the ear may be a sign of a problem in the ear and needs to be evaluated if it
needs proper treatment. To ensure that this dog is not in pain and receives appropriate treatment have the
attending veterinarian evaluate it to diagnose the ear and teeth problems and treat them per the veterinarian's
instructions. Documentation of the dog's diagnosis must be kept for future inspections.
A medication labeled for goats (Safeguard--Fenbendazole) is being used for deworming. The licensee has
consulted with the attending veterinarian on the safety of this medication for dogs, however there is no
documentation on the dosage amount that should be used for dogs. Use of medications in dogs that are labeled for
other species (off-label use) must be accompanied by written instructions from the attending veterinarian that
describe the dose/dosage, route (such as oral, injection, etc), and use for the medication.
