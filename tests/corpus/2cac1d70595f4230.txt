2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On November 6, 2014 at approximately 9:00 a.m., an incident occurred in the Big Cat Quarters resulting in the
death of a female jaguar cub. During the process of shifting the animals, the shift gate door between enclosure #15
and #16 was inadvertently left open allowing a two year old male jaguar named Zean to enter the enclosure housing
an adult female jaguar named Stella and her two cubs (one male and one female). The male jaguar was able to get
a hold of the female cub causing injuries that resulted in the death of the animal. Handling of all animals shall be
done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. Measures must be in place and implemented in order to prevent injuries or death to the
animals during handling.
