3.3(e)(1)(iii)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is 1 building housing German Shepherd type dogs.
These dogs have chewed scratched and worn off most of the paint on the wooden surfaces, the upper 2x4s are
scratched and rough, the lower 2x4s are chewed and rough. Also on the outside there is some plastic pulled from
the walls leaving the wood exposed and chewed or scratched.
The wood surfaces need to be repaired or replaced so that they remain impervious to Moisture.
