2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
When tending to the husbandry of the three foxes at this facility, a new employee left the gate open to the primary
enclosure which resulted in the escape of two of the animals. When questioned about this incident, the licensee
indicated that he had made no effort to retrieve or capture the animals. The handling of all regulated animals should
be done in manner that prevents trauma, stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Failure to handle these
animals properly and allowing the animals to escape has caused unnecessary discomfort (stress, hunger, thirst,
possible death). All animals must be handled in ways that prevent any stress or physical harm to their well being.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This facility has a perimeter fence around the primary enclosures for the fox, nutria and raccoon that is comprised of
three sides: panels of sheet metal that are connected to the store entrance which faces the front of the property and
panels of sheet metal fencing on each opposite side, all at least six feet high. There is NO fourth side. This three
sided structure backs up to a wooded swampy area. Recently, two of the foxes escaped from the facility after
getting out of their primary enclosure and exiting the property through this swampy wooded area. This perimeter
fence arrangement or construction does not adequately contain the animals in the facility. Perimeter fences must be
properly constructed as a secondary containment so as to protect and contain the regulated species and prevent
unwanted entry by animals and unauthorized persons.

WATERING.
The nutria enclosure consists of a cement island that is surrounded by pond due to the aquatic nature of the rodent.At the time of the inspection, the pond was completely covered with green algae and vegetation. This was the only
source of water for the animal and the licensee stated that the pond was also utilized as drinking water for the
animal. Dirty water may harbor disease hazards and this poses a health risk to the nutria. With it(cid:25)s pond in this
current condition, the licensee should provide an alternate source of fresh water for the animal. The water that is
used for its drinking must be kept clean.

EMPLOYEES.
The employee who handles the husbandry of the animals at this facility, namely the foxes, has no prior experience
with this species. The employee(cid:25)s lack of experience contributed to animal escapes when tending to the foxes.
Adequately trained employees must be utilized to properly care for the animals present at the facility.
