ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
There were two goats with extremely long hooves. One female tan goat with identification tag number 52 had long
hooves and the left rear medial claw had broken and had jagged edges. The lateral claw on this foot was long and
flattened. The right front lateral claw was broken and had rough edges. The left front lateral claw was extremely
long. This goat did not have a normal postural stance. The second female goat number 53 was black and white.
She had extremely long hooves on all claws. Her gait was abnormal. She high stepped when she walked and she
would repeatedly lift her front feet and then place back on the ground. The licensee representative stated that none
of these animals were receiving treatment. She stated that a daily check was performed during feeding of the
animals. The hoof lengths on these animals were more than one or two weeks old. All animals must receive
adequate veterinary care.
