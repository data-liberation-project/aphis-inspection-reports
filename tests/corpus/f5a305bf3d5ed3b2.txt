Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence surrounding the outdoor primary enclosures for an opossum and a skunk was insufficient due to the
following:
• The perimeter fence height varied from a minimum of approximately 1 foot to 4 ½ feet due to the top rail of the chain link
fence being damaged in multiple areas from tree branches falling on it causing the top rail to sag. Most of the damaged
top rail areas were observed in the perimeter fence facing the back of the main building along the access road.
• One area serving as a portion of the perimeter fence, adjacent to a public sitting area, measured 42 inches in height for
a width of approximately 3 feet.
• A gap in the perimeter fence, where the fence post did not touch the main building’s front corner (located to the left of
the front doors when facing the building from the road), was approximately 5 inches in width.
• Many areas had overgrowth of vegetation, vines and trees, both from within and outside the perimeter fence, growing on
top and through the fence, possibly compromising the effectiveness of the structure.
• Most other areas of the perimeter fence measured 68 to 69 inches in height.

The lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within their outdoor primary enclosures


since there isn’t an adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or
a sufficient barrier to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. This may expose the animals to hazards such as
disease, distress, and/or injury.

The overgrowth of vegetation must be cut back and removed from the perimeter fence, the areas of insufficient height,
and any gaps, must be corrected so the perimeter fence is at least 6 feet high, as well as a minimum of 3 feet away from
the primary enclosures. The facility shall ensure the primary outdoor enclosures are enclosed by an appropriate
perimeter fence, constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the animals in the facility, otherwise a variance, if appropriate,
needs to be obtained and can be requested from the Administrator/Regional Office.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class "C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by MARCH 12, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
