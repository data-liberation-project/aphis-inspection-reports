3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The dome cover over the B-building has a build-up of grayish to black material on the interior surface. The height of
the cover is such that it is not easily accessible for cleaning. Surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and
sanitized or replaced when soiled. The surfaces of housing structures must be constructed in manner that allows for
the structure to be readily cleaned and sanitized. To minimize animal exposure to infectious agents, the surface of
the dome cover needs to be replaced or cleaned and sanitized to remove the built-up material. Additionally, an
effective cleaning method and schedule must be established to prevent excessive accumulation of material on the
dome cover in the future. Correct by September 20, 2019
