2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four 18-week-old dogs (#18170, a male German Shepherd dog; #18173, a female German Shepherd dog, #18174,
a female German Shepherd dog; and #18176, a male Akita dog) were observed with open lesions on their ears. All
four dogs had lesions that were visually similar on both ears. Each lesion was observed to be large (approximately
0.75-1.5" diameter), round to ovoid, reddened, devoid of hair, and with crusted blood at the edges. Fresh blood was
observed with some of the lesions. The Akita dog with lesions was observed shaking its head. The licensee
indicated that his decision to use topical hydrocortisone application for the dogs' ears was not informed by advice
from his veterinarian. After requesting the licensee to consult his attending veterinarian for guidance on the dogs'
ears, the attending veterinarian's office conveyed to USDA that the licensee had only inquired about how to repel
flies from dogs. The attending veterinarian's office specified that the licensee had not asked how he should treat the
lesions that were present on the dogs' ears.
Appropriate methods for prevention, control, diagnoses, and treatments of diseases must be employed as part of a
program of veterinary care, in order to ensure dog health and well-being. The lack of appropriate methods for
treatment of ear lesions can create pain, stress, and more advanced skin health issues.
The licensee must obtain a diagnosis and treatment recommendations from the attending veterinarian of record for
Dogs #18170, #18173, #18174, and #18176.

3.6(a)(2)(v) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two outdoor enclosures did not provide required shelter for the dogs housed therein. One of the two enclosures had
just one piece of metal that was buttressed against the fencing and that served as a makeshift roof, while the
second enclosure was completely devoid of shelter, and had been so for the approximately four weeks of the dogs'housing in that enclosure.
Housing dogs in outdoor enclosures without shelter exposes the dogs to rain, direct sun, and other elements, which
can create a stressful environment and one in which the dogs cannot stay dry and clean, potentially exposing the
dogs to increased disease and pest hazards.
Appropriate shelter structures and areas of shade must be provided for dogs to stay dry and clean.

3.11(a) DIRECT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A substantial accumulation of excreta was seen in approximately 60% of the primary enclosures, making it
extremely difficult for all of the dogs in the enclosures to be out of the waste at the same time. Some animals were
observed with excreta on their lower legs and feet. The excessive feces appeared to be attracting an accumulation
of flies, which were seen throughout the animal areas. Two enclosures contained so much excrement that dogs
would have had to walk through the feces to walk the length of the enclosure. There were feces that had been
mashed into the walls and floors of some enclosures. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is removed
from the primary enclosures daily as required.
Accumulations of excreta and dirt within animal enclosures create an unhealthy environment and can cause health
hazards for dogs.
The licensee must remove excreta from enclosures daily to prevent soiling of dogs and to reduce disease hazards,
insects, pests and odors.
