PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
A 9 wk old mini goldendoodle "Holly" shipped 22 February 2018, on waybill 00829566 on American Airlines from
CMH through ORD to SAN, was shipped in an enclosure that was not correctly labeled. There was no "Live
Animals" marking on the top of the enclosure, and no arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright
position of the primary enclosure on one or more sides, although there was one live animal sticker on the back of
the enclosure. Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top
and on one or more sides with the words "LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high and with arrows
or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure to help ensure proper handling by
transportation personnel.
Carriers and intermediate handles must not accept any dog or cat for transport without proper labels because
improperly label crates used to ship live animals could result in mishandling by transport personnel, which could be
injurious to the animals.
Correct for all future shipments.

A 9 wk old mini goldendoodle "Holly" shipped 22 February 2018, on waybill 00829566 on American Airlines from
CMH through ORD to SAN, was shipped in an enclosure without food and water dishes securely attached inside the
primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the
door.
Carriers and intermediate handles must not accept any dog or cat for transport without having food and water
receptacles attached inside the primary enclosure so that the receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure
without opening the door to prevent escape during transport, especially for a young animal.
Correct for all future shipments.This inspection took place at the cargo office at San Diego airport, accompanied by the contracted ground handling
personnel.
