FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several enclosures housing animals including, but not limited to, the wolves, lynx, bobcats, raccoons, porcupines,
and foxes all have shelters structures in their enclosures. However, the shelters are enclosed on only three sides
and the fronts of the shelters are open. The open fronts have no weather breaks and cannot prevent the wind
and/or snow from blowing into and potentially accumulating within the shelters. Also, the shelter in the enclosure
housing the black buck antelope has only partial wall panels on the south and front sides of the shelter structure.
The partial walls cannot thoroughly block the wind from blowing through the shelter. Modify the existing shelter
structures or otherwise furnish shelters that provide more complete protection from winter weather conditions.
