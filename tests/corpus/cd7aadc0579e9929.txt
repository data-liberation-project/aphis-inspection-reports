ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
An adverse outcome was reported in the IACUC minutes: A female Japanese macaque was undergoing an imaging
procedure under anesthesia. The procedure was necessarily conducted in a darkened room. The animal was noted
to have respiratory distress and the veterinarian was notified, but the animal expired in spite of resuscitation efforts.
It was found that the pop-off valve on the anesthesia machine was left closed and went unnoticed in the darkened
room. This was the first of several animals scheduled to be imaged, but the remainder of the studies that day were
cancelled.
Since the event and prior to resumption of study activities, the anesthesia machines have been modified so that the
pop off valve cannot be left closed - it must be held closed for pressure checking the machine, and it automatically
returns to the open state when the operator releases hold on the fitting.
Correct by: This non-compliance was corrected as described prior to the time of inspection.
An adverse outcome was reported in early July 2013. On June 27, 2013, a total of twenty-one rhesus macaques
were hospitalized and six animals died or were euthanized from a previously stable breeding group of 260 animals
housed outdoors in a one-acre corral. All of the animals were injured as a result of fighting within the group. They
concluded that the event was likely the result of displaced aggression triggered by construction activity - noise and
vibration - on land near the corral. This new construction involved frequent heavy trucks passing around the end of
the row of corrals. The affected corral was the last in that row, with the trucks passing just outside, along the exterior
wall.
The Center responded by halting construction that day and relocating the remaining 233 rhesus macaques to
another outdoor corral further from the construction site. Additional enrichment was added - swimming tubs,
branches, treats - as well as additional monitoring by the Behavioral Services Unit, which studied behavioral trends
and compared them to readings from five noise and vibration monitors placed around the areas of construction and
animal housing. They also developed housing modifications to allow for better social interaction or avoidance as
needed by the animals.
Correct by: This was corrected by responding to the event, as described, prior to the time of inspection.
Additionally, the facility must develop comprehensive plans to address the impact on the animals for all futureconstruction. These plans must include logistics for animal relocation in relation to construction activity if necessary,
increased monitoring of the animals, and intervention to address any escalation of stress activity in the animals.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A large percentage (>50%) of rhesus macaques in all different housing types have significant, non-pruritic hair loss.
Recent response to animals with alopecia has been largely through the Behavior Sciences Unit (BSU). While
studies to identify potential causes in the past have been done, there is not evidence of a comprehensive clinical
diagnostic plan to determine underlying physical causes. The semi-annual physical examination of all of the
non-human primates (NHPs) at the facility was adjusted recently to include alopecia scoring; once they complete a
full year's data set, analysis can begin to analyze incidence by location and season to help with diagnoses.
Hair loss in NHPs is multifactorial. Physical as well as psychological components need to be considered to try and
determine treatable causes. Hormonal influences are currently at their peak since it is birthing season, however
animals of all ages and both genders are affected. Hair loss can be a problem in that it negatively influences the
skin protection and thermoregulation abilities of the affected animals.
Correct by: May 15, 2014. The NHP Resource Veterinarian stated they will have a comprehensive colony plan in
place in 30 days to diagnose and develop a therapy plan for treatable physical causes, to continue the behavioral
therapy, and to implement more complex diagnostics such as food trials or other "response to therapy" modalities.
The most severely affected must be evaluated and treated first.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bedding in the calf hutches in corral 5, and the two corrals set away from the others (Japanese macaque and a
rhesus corral) is dirty. The weather has been very wet, so the bedding has quickly become soiled. High traffic areas
are muddy, such as around the calf hutches, under play equipment, and at the doors to the indoor feeding area in
the rhesus corral adjacent to the Japanese macaque corral. Animals must be able to avoid muddy areas. Clean
bedding is necessary to ensure the animals can stay clean and dry to better thermoregulate.
The calf hutches are placed in the corrals to provide shelter in addition to the indoor feeding areas which are
cleaned daily. Bedding straw is placed in the calf hutches and is changed every two weeks from October through
March, and every four weeks for the remainder of the year.
Bedding changes should be done as needed rather than on a scheduled basis. Additionally, there must special
attention to mud control in areas at entrances to shelters and near food and water access. Correct by: This was corrected at the time of inspection by replacing straw bedding in the hutches and laying fresh
straw over the affected traffic areas.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are cracks in the wall surface and areas of picked paint on walls and defects in the floor coating in four animal
rooms in the colony building (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A) and in runs 5 and 8 in the Harem building. These cracks and defects
make it difficult to clean and disinfect properly.
Correct by: April 25, 2014. The Colony building rooms and Harem run 8 were corrected at the time of inspection by
moving the animals to other locations. Repairs will be made before any animals are placed in the rooms.The room
that still contains animals,Harem run 5, is scheduled to be vacated and repaired by the correction date.
The inspection was conducted April 2-4, 2014 and was accompanied by the NHP Resource Veterinarian and
personnel from the various areas. Records inspection was facilitated by IACUC office staff. Exit briefing with facility
personnel on April 16, 2014.
