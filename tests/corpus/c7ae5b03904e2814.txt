PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the show tent, Rock and Bo were housed in kennels that do not provide sufficient head space. When seated in
front of his kennel, Rock's head extended above the top of the kennel. Bo was unable to stand in his kennel in a
comfortable normal position.
The dogs kept their heads lower when moving in their cages as compared to the other dogs in the room with
adequate cage height. When the dogs were in a normal standing position the tops of their heads were less that 6
inches from the top of the cages. Housing is an important aspect of animal husbandry and plays a significant role in
animal health and well-being. Enclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the health andwell-being of animals being maintained there. The facility should ensure that the cages housing their animals meet
the required minimum interior height set forth in the regulations.
