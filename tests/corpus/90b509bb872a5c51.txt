Facilities, indoor.
Although there was a wall thermometer that read 62 F, the temperature on floor where the guinea pigs were housed in
floor pens ranged from 56 to 58 F as measured with a kestrel. There were wall curtains on each side of the facility and a
roof vent where a draft could be felt.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

Sanitation.
The ledges next to the wall curtains on either side of the guinea pig facility contained a build-up of dirt, grime, discarded
hay, and debris.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dirt and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and may
contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to


facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
