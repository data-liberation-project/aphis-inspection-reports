3.4(b)(1) CRITICAL
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On February 7, 2019 a female Golden Retriever, USDA tag #7, began whelping in the shelter of the outdoor
enclosure. The shelter did not have a floor and had several window openings that were not closed up in any way to
provide adequate protection from the winter weather conditions. Because the shelter was inadequate, four puppies
died of exposure before the licensee realized what was happening and moved the whelping dog into an indoor
kennel enclosure were she delivered three more puppies. Outdoor housing shelters must contain a roof, four sides,
and a floor and must provide the dogs with adequate protection and shelter from cold. Correct by: The licensee
replaced the inadequate shelter the following day with a new shelter structure that meets the requirements and
provides protection from the cold.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
