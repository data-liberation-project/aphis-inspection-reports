Primary enclosures.
At the time of inspection, a review of the IACUC minutes for April 2020 and November 2020 indicated two separate
incidents of escaped Non-human primates. The incident in April revealed that two macaques escaped from their primary
enclosure due to the cage lock not placed in the proper position. In November 2020, two additional macaques escaped
due to a defective lock which did not close properly. In both incidents the escaped primates sustained minor injuries.
The four macaques were immediately identified and treated by clinical veterinarians. This does not constitute adequate
primary enclosures for security and containing the animals.

This was corrected by the facility after the second incident in November 2020. The facility reviewed and updated both
training and husbandry procedures for ensuring primary enclosures securely contain the animals. Laboratory personnel
and Animal Care staff were retrained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conduction from 08/09/2021 to 08/12/2021.
