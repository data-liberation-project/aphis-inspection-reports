2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was one guinea pig with a health condition requiring treatment in consultation with the attending veterinarian.
There was an adult tricolor guinea pig in Pen 22 that was lethargic and moving very little with increased respiratory rate.
The guinea pig's eyes were sunken in and when the skin was tented over the back it remained tented for an extended
period of time indicating possible dehydration. The facility had observed the health condition but was not administering
any treatments and had not contacted the attending veterinarian.
Guinea pigs that appear lethargic and dehydrated may be in pain or distress and their condition may worsen if not
addressed quickly.
The facility must contact the attending veterinarian to develop an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height, during the inspection, there were 5
guinea pigs observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to


access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times
and does not allow them to escape.
3.25(d)

Facilities, general.
In Pen 25, there was a decomposing flattened guinea pig carcass that was infested with numerous maggots.
Decomposing animals infested with maggots can carry diseases, could contaminate the bedding, and could increase the
risk of health hazards towards the live animals.
Provisions shall be made for the removal and disposal of dead animals, waste, bedding and debris. The licensee must
remove the dead animals and any contaminated bedding to protect the health and well-being of the live guinea pigs.

3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens.
The lack of sanitation and presence of debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and may
contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
