2.32(b) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
An adverse event reported in the April 2018 IACUC minutes describes a degu becoming hypothermic during
surgery when a warming plate did not function as expected. Re-warming efforts failed, and the animal was
euthanized when it did not recover from the anesthesia. It was determined that the warming plate had shut off when
a towel was placed between the plate and the animal; the animal is to be place directly on the warmer for it to
function properly.
Lack of awareness of the function of the equipment rendered it ineffective for its purpose, resulting in the death of
an animal.
This non-compliant item was corrected prior to the time of inspection by re-training the research staff on the proper
use of the equipment.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
