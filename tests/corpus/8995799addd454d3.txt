3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
On Monday morning, 12/7/21, two fallow deer were located in a parking area in front of the giraffe enclosure and giraffe
feeding area. This area is not an animal holding area. This parking area contains some trash cans and a portable
lavatory. This parking area is accessible to customer vehicles, and is connected to the main driveway that connects the
facility to the road. The driveway passes through ticket booths and an open gate before reaching the road.
One of the deer was later observed in the giraffe pen itself, and shortly afterwards it was seen the area directly behind the
giraffe barn (outside the giraffe enclosure). This area behind the barn is not an animal holding area, and contains
vehicles, dumpsters, and farm equipment.
On Tuesday morning, 12/8/21, 2 eland and 1 wildebeest were located in the area behind the giraffe barn. This area is not
an animal holding area, and contains vehicles, dumpsters, farm equipment.
Animals who escape from their primary enclosures and enter areas containing equipment, construction materials, traffic,
and dumpsters may become injured or entrapped.
Correct by containing animals within enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals.
3.127(d) Critical



Facilities, outdoor.
Over the spring and summer of 2021, 3 animals at the park were killed by wild coyotes who crossed through or under the
perimeter fence. 1 blackbuck was killed on July 1, 1 blackbuck was killed on July 16, and 1 axis deer was killed in May.
Facility management stated that the cause of death was obviously due to coyotes. Facility management has taken
measures to prevent coyotes and other predators from entering the property and since then no further deaths have
occurred.
Animals that are killed by predators suffer from stress and pain. A perimeter fence is essential for protecting animals from
contact with predators.
Correct by January 30, 2021 by ensuring that the perimeter fence is constructed so that it protects animals at the facility
by restricting unauthorized animals and persons from going through it or under it. Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility management.
