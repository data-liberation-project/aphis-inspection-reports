2.33(a)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A review of facility records for the marmoset (microchip # 004-004-103) which died on 23 Dec 2015 following a
procedure performed on 21 Dec 2015 found that the PI did not follow the approved protocol in regards to IV catheter
placement and IV fluid support as well as amounts and routes of anesthetic and paralytic drugs used during the
procedure. The PI did not follow the instructions of the veterinarian and the procedure continued 10 hours rather
than the veterinarian recommended 2-3 hours. The animal subsequently died ~33 hours post procedure.

The research facility must ensure that the attending veterinarian has the appropriate authority to ensure adequate
veterinary care is provided and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Failure to follow
approved protocols and veterinary recommendations can result in outcomes such as occurred with this animal.

Prior to the inspection, changes to the protocol were made to incorporate corrective measures, and new procedures
were put in place to prevent a recurrence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
