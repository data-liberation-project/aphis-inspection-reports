ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female bulldog named Bubbles, MC# 0A0154478 was observed to have an interdigital cyst on her right front foot.
This area was raised, reddened and swollen and located between her most lateral toes on that foot. The dog did
not appear to be lame. The licensee was questioned about treatment and he stated that the veterinarian had told
him to clean it with soap and water and wait for it to pop. He also added that the veterinarian had said that the
condition was not painful. Documentation provided by the licensee for review by the inspectors gave detailed
instructions for treatment that had been written by the attending veterinarian. These instructions included washing
the area with iodine scrub and the administration of oral cephalexin to the dog. Neither of these medications were
on the premises. The licensee indicated to the inspectors that he was confused about the written instructions. The
licensee had not yet noticed the condition of this dog. The current time was approximately 3:00 PM and the
appropriate medications were not on hand and the licensee did not understand the directions. Inderdigital cysts can
become quite painful when not treated in an appropriate manner. Failure to treat this potentially painful condition in
an appropriate manner could cause this dog to experience unnecessary suffering. The attending veterinarian'(cid:25)s
previously detailed treatment plan must be followed by the licensee and medications for treatment should be on
hand for routine medical conditions. The licensee should contact the attending veterinarian for clarification of
written directions that he does not understand. This dog requires treatment for her condition.

not appear to be lame. The licensee was questioned about treatment and he stated that the veterinarian had told
him to clean it with soap and water and wait for it to pop. He also added that the veterinarian had said that the
condition was not painful. When asked by the inspectors if it had been treated, he stated that no, he had not
noticed the condition as he had not looked at the animals in this area yet. The current time was approximately 3:00
PM. Inderdigital cysts can become quite painful when not treated in a timely manner. Failure to observe this
potentially painful condition could cause this dog to experience unnecessary suffering. Animals must be observed
and abnormal conditions must be communicated to the attending veterinarian or the veterinarian'(cid:25)s previouslydetailed treatment plan must be followed by the licensee.

2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***Six puppies from two different litters were combined into one enclosure. None of the puppies were individually
identified with a tag, collar, tatoo, or microchip. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet
recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must
properly identify these animals and assure that all animals are identified as required.

2.75(a)(1)(6)(3)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
(C) The date of birth or approximate age.
***The APHIS Form 7005 records were incomplete. There were at least five dates of birth that were not listed for the
animals listed on the forms. Appropriate documentation of acquired animals is essential for proper identification of
each animal and each animal must be able to be traced forward and backward. The licensee must complete the
APHIS form 7005 and assure that all documentation is kept as required.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structure; construction.
***In the indoor portion of the English Bulldog facility there were at least three of the chain link panels separating the
dogs, that had holes in the bottom portion where the wire had detached from the bottom rail. These areas had
previously been repaired, yet had holes in them again. Areas of construction that are left unrepaired can lead to
injury to the animals or deterioration of structure. The licensee must repair these areas and assure that all areas are
kept in good repair as required.
To be corrected by November 28, 2014.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (3) Cleaning.***On the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, there was one enclosure that contained one English Bulldog.
There were cinder blocks used as a step for the dog to enter the building. Below the hinged door, there was a large
amount of hair between the cinder block steps and the wall of the building. The hair extended beyond the width of
three cinder blocks and appeared to be approximately three inches high. Waste materials that are not removed from
the enclosures create harboring places for pests and diseases which increase the disease hazards to the animals.
The licensee must remove the hair from this enclosure and assure that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized as
required.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements.
(2) Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they:
(i) Have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs.
***In the indoor portion of the English Bulldog sheltered facility, there were at least two enclosures containing three
adult dogs. The chain link fence in between the enclosures had become detached from the bottom rail. These areas
had been repaired at one time, yet had been pulled away from the rail again leaving some of the repair wire ends
producing sharp points within the enclosures. Sharp edges create a potential injury for the animals within the
enclosure.
The licensee must remove the sharp edges and assure that there are no sharp points or edges in the primary
enclosures as required.
To be corrected by November 21, 2014.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
***In the outdoor facility, there were at least five enclosures containing at least twelve adult Basset Hounds, Beagles
and Boxers that had an excessive amount of feces. The licensee stated that these enclosures had not been cleaned
since 11/15/2014 due to the snowfall and freezing temperatures. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk
of disease by attracting pests, soiling the animals and providing an unhealthy environment for the animals. The
licensee must remove the feces and assure that waste materials are removed from the primary enclosures daily, as
required.
