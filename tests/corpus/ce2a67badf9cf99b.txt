Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A 4 year old female Morkie (tattoo #16B) was found to be heavily matted over most of its haircoat. Large mats were
noted on the front right leg, over the hips, and under the neck area on both sides. The licensee stated he was aware that
this dog needed attention and was planning to groom it in the near future. Heavily matted hair may lead to skin problems
and can be uncomfortable for the dog. The licensee must ensure a plan is in place to ensure all dogs' hair coats are
maintained and properly groomed. Correct this by grooming this dog and maintaining a plan for all dogs' hair coats.

Housing facilities, general.
Many hard surfaces in contact with the dogs in this facility are dirty and required cleaning. Most enclosure walls and
entryways are stained or smeared with dirt and grime. Doggy doors in the whelping building have a buildup of organic
material on them. Structural support beams are covered with feces and organic material between them and the coated
metal wire flooring. There are dust/cob webs in many of the enclosures corners and in the metal wire walls. Other areas
not in contact with the dogs are also in need of cleaning including the tops of the enclosures in the adult dog kennel,
which are covered with a layer of dust and dirt, and the floor of the whelping building. It is obvious that a formal cleaning

plan is not in place at this facility. Failure to regularly clean will result in increased disease hazards for the dogs. The
licensee must develop a cleaning plan to ensure all surfaces in contact with the dogs are spot cleaned daily and that all
other surfaces are cleaned to satisfy accepted husbandry practices.

Feeding
Several metal self feeders in the adult kennel area were found to be rusty and requiring repair or replacement. These
rusty feeders are not able to be properly sanitized in their current condition. This may lead to deterioration or
contamination of the food for the dogs. Correct this by repairing or replacing these self feeders and ensuring all self
feeders are maintained clean and sanitary. In addition, the licensee is using metal catch pans under the self-feeders to
catch spilled feed from the self-feeders. These are also rusty and must be repaired or replaced.

Housing facilities, general.
Many surfaces in contact with the dogs are either rusty or no longer able to be properly sanitized. This includes the non-
coated wire walls and cage fronts of several enclosures in both the adult kennel and the whelping building that are rusted
and in need or repair or replacing. Several outdoor runs in the whelping building also have areas of rust on the solid
metal panels. At least two enclosures in the whelping building have outdoor runs with exposed wood in contact with the
dogs. All of these surfaces must be replaced or repaired to ensure they can be properly cleaned and sanitized.
