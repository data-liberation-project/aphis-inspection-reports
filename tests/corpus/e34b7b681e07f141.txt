Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records including the acquisition and disposition of animals were not available for review. The licensee stated that they
were in Terre Haute, Indiana and were being uploaded into a computer system.

Records must be available for inspection for the inspector to track individual animals such as for monitoring the well-being
of animals. For example, they indicate if an animal dies such that the inspector may determine if such deaths resulted
from natural events or other issues such as handling. Further, as a Class B licensee, they are vital records in tracing
animals such as related to disease outbreaks.

Outdoor housing facilities.
The primary enclosures of the white-headed lemurs and the snow monkey (Japanese macaque) did not have a barrier
between the primary enclosure and the public access areas



Such barriers are necessary in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the nonhuman primates. Without
such barriers, nonhuman primates may injure members of the public by scratching or grabbing the people or their
clothing. Additionally, the animals may be injured by actions of the public.

Barriers surrounding primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be placed in order to restrict physical contact
between the public and the nonhuman primates.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
While there appears to be measures such as environmental enrichment including food enrichment and social interaction
with staff members, the facility has no documented plan for the environmental enhancement adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. Notably absent from the undocumented plan are the social grouping
provisions for a common marmoset and a squirrel monkey, both of which are nonhuman primate species known to exist in
social groups in nature. Both of these two animals were singly-housed without social interaction of conspecifics or
provision of auditory, visual, olfactory or other stimuli from other nonhuman primates.
Adherence to a documented plan that that provides for the environmental enhancement needs of nonhuman primates is
critical for the health and well-being of these animals. If such enhancement is not provided, ill effects on the health of
these animals due to factors such as stress, self-injurious behavior, or stereotypies may develop.
A plan as directed by the attending veterinarian that addresses all sections of this regulation must be developed,
documented and followed.

Facilities, outdoor.
While construction of a perimeter fence with a height of at least 8 feet is continuing to be constructed around the primary
enclosures of the tigers, there is no such fence surrounding these enclosures. Additionally, one wall of the primary
enclosure is made of combinations concrete, wood, and metal fencing, or glass, and are high enough and constructed in
a manner that restricts entry by animals and unauthorized persons, but written approval the Administrator has not been
given.

There is no perimeter fence of at least 6 feet that completely surrounds the primary enclosures of other animals, such as
the badgers, bobcat, lynx and coatis. The licensee stated that a perimeter fence currently surrounds approximately 60%
of the facility.

A perimeter fence around the primary enclosures is necessary to aid in the prevention of animal escape, and to keep
other animals and unauthorized persons out of the primary enclosures. Without a perimeter fence that contains the
animals, they may be injured or killed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
