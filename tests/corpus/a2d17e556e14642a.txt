At the time of inspection primate R11001 showed areas of hair loss along the back. In reviewing the animals record
this was first seen back in Feb 2015 .The next entry in the animals record was in June of 2015 indicating patchy
alopecia. There were no further entries in the animals record since then. The enrichment program of non human
primates indicates that atypical behavior will be evaluated regularly and written in the animals record.
The facility needs to follow their plan and insure atypical behavior is documented and treated.
