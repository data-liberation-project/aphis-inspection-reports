ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
This facility(cid:25)s plan for environmental enrichment of primates is not being followed. The plan states primates will be
provided with enrichment daily. The enrichment logs indicate this is not happening. This facility needs to ensure its
current plan of enrichment is followed or develop an enrichment plan in accordance with currently accepted
professional standards that it can consistently follow.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The baby camel yard had an area where new substrate had been added but not leveled well leaving a couple of
deep holes. These holes could cause injury to the babies if they started running and fell in one of the holes.
Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The area of rutted substrate
needs to be leveled.

The tiger shift door in the rhino hall and the middle wall inside the rhino stall have excessive rust to the point of
pitting in the metal. Pitting affects the integrity of the metal. Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The tiger door and the wall in the rhino stall need to be
repaired or replaced.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. The seal around the door of the freezer continues to be a problem. While standing in the freezer with the door shut
light could be seen around the seal indicating it is not functioning correctly. Paint on the ceiling in the freezer is
chipping and flaking. Food storage areas and/or equipment need to be maintained in good repair in order to
adequately protect against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin or other substances. This freezer
needs to be repaired or replaced.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shade available in the rhino yard was not sufficient to allow the rhino to remain comfortably in a shaded area for
any length of time. At 2:30 pm on the day of this inspection the rhino had to stand horizontal to the building to be
completely shaded by the building. The shade provided by the umbrella structure in the middle of the yard was just
wide enough to allow the rhino complete shade for a limited time. In order to remain in the shade from the umbrella
the rhino would have to move with the shade as the sun shifted.
The shade available in the baby camel yard was not sufficient to allow the camels to remain comfortably in a
shaded area for any length of time. At 2:30 pm on the day of this inspection the only shade available in the baby
camel yard was provided by an umbrella structure. In order to remain in the shade from the umbrella the camels
would have to move with the shade as the sun shifted.

The shade available in the zebra yard was not sufficient to allow all 3 zebra access to shade at the same time.
The shade available for the 2 giraffe females was provided by access to the new giraffe barn however the 2 female
giraffes currently refuse to go into the new barn. Some alternate form of shade needs to be provided to these
giraffes until they are comfortable with the new barn.
All animals kept outside must have access to sufficient amounts of natural or artificial shade. The shade available
should not require the animals to move constantly to maintain that shade.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter available for the female giraffes was the new giraffe barn however the females currently refuse to go
into the new barn. The old giraffe barn is under renovation. The female giraffes currently have no usable shelter.
Shelter appropriate for the species and the climate must be available for all animals kept outdoors. Some type ofshelter needs to be provided for the female giraffe for protection from the elements. The old giraffe barn needs to
be made available or some type of temporary shelter needs to be constructed.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The drainage in the rhino yard does not appear sufficient to keep the yard from becoming a muddy bog after rain.
Although the yard was dry at the time of this inspection the condition of the yard indicated it had been extremely
muddy very recently. Much of the yard consisted of churned up dirt with smooth paths navigated by the animal
through the prior mud bogs. Although rhinos require a mud hole or wallow as part of the yard, 90% of that yard
should not be the mud hole.
A suitable method for rapidly eliminating excess water needs to be implemented allowing this rhino access to more
area without deep mud after a rain.

SANITATION.
The bottom of the fencing inside otter holding had a buildup of grime. Enclosures need to be cleaned as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease and reduce odors. This area should be
thoroughly cleaned more frequently in order to prevent future grime build up.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The commissary floor has areas of spotting along with areas of standing water. This floor does not appear as if it
can be adequately cleaned and sanitized. The ability to clean and sanitize the commissary floors is necessary in
order to facilitate husbandry practices consistent with animal health. The floor needs to be replaced or repaired to
eliminate areas of standing water and allow for adequate disinfecting.
