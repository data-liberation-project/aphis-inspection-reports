3.80(a)(1) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On October 15, 2021, two male rhesus macaques in adjacent cages were injured when a pin in the separating slide
mechanism failed. This allowed the slide to open, and the macaques had direct access to each other. The macaques
fought and injured each other, requiring veterinary care. They were treated for lacerations and abrasions. One macaque
fully recovered in seven days. The other required clinical treatment for an additional week and is still receiving physical
therapy with good results. Full recovery is expected.

All enclosures must be structurally sound to contain the animals and protect them from injury.

This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by immediately removing the affected cage from service. The point of
structural failure was identified. Correction was made. All the joints like the one where the pin failed were welded on all
cages known to have this mechanism to prevent similar failure. The manufacturer was contacted to find out if other onsite
caging purchased from them might have the same mechanism that would also need to be addressed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
