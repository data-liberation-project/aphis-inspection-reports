ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:45 - 6:15 PM
on 02/19/2014.
There was no one at the house. I called the contact number available to me. The licensee did not answer and I left
a message. I waited in the driveway for 30 minutes.
End of report.
