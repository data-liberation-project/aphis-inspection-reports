3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some surfaces in the housing for non-human primates are in need of maintenance, replacement, or repair. In the
Spider Monkey enclosure there are metal supports for perches that have significant corrosion, including a hole
through the metal that is 1/2 inch in diameter. Some animals, such as the marmosets and and brown lemur, have
wooden den boxes that are soiled and porous.
Failure to maintain surfaces in good repair impedes cleaning and disinfecting, which could be detrimental to the
health of the animals. Additionally, corrosion of perch supports could threaten their structural strength, which could
be hazardous.
All surfaces in primate enclosures should be maintained in good repair in order to protect the well-being of the
animals. To be corrected by 5/17/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the zoo administrator.
