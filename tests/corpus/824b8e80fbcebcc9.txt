HANDLING.
On Mar 23, 2019, Delta airline personnel transferred a dog from the holding area on the ramp of the Atlanta airport
to an aircraft. Sometime during the loading process onto the aircraft, the animal was able to escape from its
enclosure. The animal was found three days later.
Airline personnel must ensure proper handling at all times during transport of animals to ensure their safety and
well-being.
A thorough exit interview was conducted with the Director of the Cargo Control Center by phone on 5-2-19.
