ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Yorkshire Terrier with black, brown and gray coat coloration and identified as "Andy" with a DOB 4-22-2017
located in enclosure #44, has a heavy buildup of hard tan material, consistent with dental tartar, on the rear teeth of
both the upper left and upper right dental arcades.
Dental tartar buildup may lead to dental disease. This can then lead to recession of gum tissue, gum inflammation
and tooth loss. It may also lead to pain and discomfort while chewing, decreased food consumption and weight
loss.
The above described dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian by 26NOV2019 for dental assessment and a
treatment plan established for the treatment of the dental tartar buildup.

3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are several areas along the bottom horizontal support tubing of two dividing panels separating two exterior
runs on the south side of the kennel building that are heavily corroded with broken areas of tubing and exposed
sharp edges. The broken and perforated bottom tubing pose an injury risk to the two dogs occupying the two
affected kennels.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges which could
injure the dogs.
The broken tubing affecting the occupied kennels needs to be corrected by 22NOV2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and the licensee.
