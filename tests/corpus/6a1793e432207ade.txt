3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The food is not stored in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation. The door to
the food storage room was open and the door could not be readily closed due to an electrical cord. The food bin
located in the far left corner did not have the lid secured as it was located elsewhere. The other bin located in the
near left corner did have the lid tightly secured. There were four sacks of unopened dog food. Two bags were
correctly on the raised platform and two were not on the platform but were stacked on top of each other to the right.
The bottom bag was in full direct contact with the cement floor.
Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. The bags must be stored off the floor and away from the walls and the food bins must have lids secured
to prevent contamination and deterioration of the food's nutritive value to maximize healthy nutritive absorption for
the dogs and/or puppies. The door to the feed room should be closed when not in use to keep unwanted insects,
rodents, and raccoons from entry and subsequent contamination of the food.
Maintain feed room and supplies to be in compliance with 3.1 (e)
