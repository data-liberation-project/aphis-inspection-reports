2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***A litter of 5 German Shepherd puppies, less than 16 weeks of age, did not have any identification. Weaned litters
of puppies bred at the facility need to be properly identified (by a cage card when maintained as a litter, an official
tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, or an acceptable plastic-type collar). Proper identification is essential when
needing to track an animal throughout its life.
