SANITATION.
In two enclosures, there were leftover construction equipment and debris posing a hazard to the animals within
those enclosures.
-In the Aoudad enclosure by the giraffe barn, there was a large wire fencing panel on the ground and multiple
panels stacked in a trailer within the enclosure. The single panel and the trailer were easily accessible to the
animals in the enclosure and the space between the wires posed an entrapment hazard, putting the animals at a
risk for serious injury. The area containing the panel on the ground was closed off during the inspection.
-In the Safari pasture near the Rhino barn, there was a large pile of discarded fencing posts and cement. The
hoofstock in the pasture were grazing immediately around the pile and there was no barrier to prevent them from
climbing on the materials. This pile posed an entrapment hazard, putting the animals at risk for serious injury.
Enclosures need to be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury. Accumulations of trash and debris
should be removed promptly to protect the health of the animals.

3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There were numerous flies present in the main food storage area and food preparation room. Flies were on all
surfaces in the food prep area, including containers of food. In the food storage area, there was an open trash can
containing waste. None of these areas had any fly control methods in place. Waste and spilled food are powerful
attractants for flies and other pests that can contaminate food and food preparation equipment. To ensure the
animals are fed healthy diets, an effective fly and pest control program must be implemented. All trash cans should
be covered with locking lids. Knives, cutting boards, and other food preparation material must be cleaned in a
timely manner, and maintained in a sanitary condition. This will help eliminate pest attractants. The facility should
also use safe fly control measures and traps as needed.
