2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The licensee is not scheduling regular visits to her facility by the Attending Veterinarian (AV). The licensee's
Program of Veterinary Care states that these visits will occur annually, however, the last visit by the AV was on
04/06/15 according to records supplied during the inspection. Licensee confirmed that the veterinarian has not been
to the facility within the past year. The Program of Veterinary Care has not been reviewed by the AV since 04/06/15.
Facility visits are necessary to ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care is being understood and followed by the
licensee, to check the health and well-being of the animals, and to determine if changes in the Program of
Veterinary Care are needed.
The licensee must employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements that include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the facility.
3.126(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
***Ten hedgehogs (eight adults identified as Piglet, microchip 623730, 36182, 19148, 4807, 8221, 2353, 1754 and
two unidentified babies) died during a night in May when the licensee accidentally left a window next to the primary
enclosures open. During the night, temperatures dropped, there was a snow storm and the next morning the
licensee discovered the deceased hedgehogs. Several others were lethargic due to the cold temperatures, however
the licensee was able to warm them and no vet care was required at the time.
Due to the extreme ambient temperature change caused by the open window and cold temperatures, several
hedgehogs died and others experienced undue stress and discomfort. From this date forward, the licensee must
ensure that temperature in indoor housing facilities shall be sufficiently regulated by heating or cooling to protect the
animals from the extremes of temperature, to provide for their health and to prevent their discomfort. The ambient
temperature shall not be allowed to fall below nor rise above temperatures compatible with the health and comfort of
the animal.To be corrected: June 7, 2017
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
