3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There is still one enclosure along the west side of the barn has chain link that is curling outward, leaving a gap
between the bottom corners of chain link and the ground. This gap is large enough that an animal could get a foot
entrapped in the chain link and cause itself injury. Enclosures that are not maintained in good repair or of sufficient
structural strength to contain the animals poses a risk of escape or injury to the animals housed therein. Correct by
ensuring that the facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals and prevent
them from injury.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
3.127 REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** There is no shelter for one pasture containing at least 16 goats and 1 sheep. These animals are housed in an
open pasture with longer grasses and weeds. Although these longer grasses do give the animals areas to bed
down, it does not provide adequate shelter from wind, rain, and sunlight. Formal shelter structures must be
provided for these animals that will protect the animals from the sun and weather. Correct this by providing shelter
to these animals.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The goats at this facility have access to the metal roof on a pole building. There is also a shade structure built
on the roof of the building that the goats can also access. Both the floor of the shade structure and the roof are still
dirty, although according to the facility representative it has been cleaned once since the last inspection. There is
feces scattered over the majority of the roof and caked in areas where there are boards attached to the roof.
Excessive feces is also present on the floor of the shade structure, which is the most likely place where the animals
will lie down while up on the roof. Correct this by cleaning this area as often as necessary to prevent excessivelydirty conditions.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
***The five animals cited in need of veterinary care on the last inspection were unable to be identified on today's
inspection due to the large number of animals present; however, a record that each of the animals received
appropriate care was made available to APHIS officials for review.
An exit interview was conducted with the son of the owner by Randy Coleman, ACI, and Kathy Campitelli, VMO.
