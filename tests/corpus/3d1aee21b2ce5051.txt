ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspectors arrived at 1:45 PM on 9/17/15 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee was not at home. It was
learned that the Licensee was at an off-site location and would not return home for several hours. An AWA
compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other facility representative available to
accompany the inspectors so a complete inspection of the animals, animal facilities, and the required records could
be conducted.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of the Licensee. Report delivered by email 9/17/15.
