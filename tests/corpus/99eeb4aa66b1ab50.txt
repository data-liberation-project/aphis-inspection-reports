3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility has repaired and upgraded most of the fencing for the animals since the last inspection. In addition,
electric fencing has been added near the barn. However, several deficiencies were noted.
Sections of the wire fence had been bent outward in the center by the animals, thereby causing a small gap to be
formed between the bottom of the fence and the ground. Several sections of the fence had broken or spliced areas
with protruding wires.
In addition, protruding nails were seen where a wooden board in the barn has fallen as well as on a ramp on the
collection chute. A solid sheet metal panel in a currently-unoccupied enclosure had been raised slightly at the
bottom, resulting in an exposed sharp end.
The damaged areas compromise the strength of the fencing and animals could become injured by any sharp edges,
protruding wires or loose nails. Additionally, an animal might escape through the gap under the fence or become
entrapped or injured during such an attempt.
The facility promptly began repairing these issues during the inspection.
A system of routine monitoring and preventative maintenance of buildings, fences and equipment must be
established by the facility.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.Additional Inspectors
