SANITATION.
The litter in the enclosure for the rabbit has become excessively soiled and caked in the area under the water bottle.
The water bottle leaked into the bedding and caused it to cake and harden in that side of the enclosure. The
remaining bedding is in need of a complete change due to feces and urine accumulation.
