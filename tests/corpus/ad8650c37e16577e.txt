3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wash down under the pens on the right side of the building has a significant build-up of deposits. The deposit
layer adds to the odor in the facility. This build-up also attracts flies. The odor and the flies are unhealthy for the
dogs and may cause disease.
The washdown should be thoroughly cleaned and maintained clean to prevent the build-up of deposits and to
reduce the odor in the facility.
