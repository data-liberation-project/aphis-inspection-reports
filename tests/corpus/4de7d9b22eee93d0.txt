ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During inspection there were several rabbits were noted with long toenails, which indicated a lack of appropriate
methods to prevent and treat diseases and injuries. The rabbits are regularly handled for weights as documented
below, and should be monitored for husbandry and health concerns under the guidance of the attending
veterinarian.
*Rabbit 671, first weight recorded on 12/18/17,handled in January and February for weight.
*Rabbit 464, first weight recorded on 10/23/17, handled in November, December and February for weight.
*Rabbit 412, no weights recorded in records.
*Rabbit 290, only weight recorded on 9/4/17.
*Rabbit 111, first weight recorded on 9/4/17, handled in October, November, December and January for weight.
*Rabbit 21, first weight recorded on 9/18/17, handled in October, November, January and February for weight.
Animals with long toenails can catch their nails in the enclosure wire and can result in injury to the animals. At the
time of inspection there was no written guidance from the attending veterinarian to prevent, identify and treat
common injuries or diseases as well as routine animal husbandry issues. Appropriate methods to control and
prevent disease include a system in place to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries, including
animal husbandry issues, such as regular nail trimming.

2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The rabbits have been weighed regularly in order to ensure that the protocol is followed, but individual rabbit
weights were not tracked to ensure an animal has not lost weight too quickly or communicated weight loss or other
health concerns to the veterinarian. Upon reviewing the records, there were several rabbits with weight loss of
greater than 10% in approximately a month (between recorded weights) and the facility did not have a system inplace to identify weight loss in an individual animal or communicate health concerns with the veterinarian. At the
time of inspection, there was no standard operating procedure in place with guidance from the veterinarian for
treating common ailments on site and the veterinarian had not been contacted when animals were losing weight or
found dead.
*Rabbit 224 dropped from 4.9 kgs on 12/11/17 to 4.1 kgs on 1/8/18
*Rabbit 289 dropped from 4.5 kgs on 9/4/17 to 3.8 kgs on 10/30/17
*Rabbit 335 dropped from 4.3 kgs on 10/9/17 to 3.6 kgs on 10/23/17
*Rabbit 443 dropped from 5.3 kgs on 11/20/17 to 4.7 kgs on 1/1/18 and 3.7 kgs on 2/12/18
*Rabbit 499 dropped from 4.6 kgs on 1/8/18 to 3.7 kgs on 2/5/18
*Rabbit 515 dropped from 4.8 kgs on 10/9/17 to 3.6 kgs on 12/4/17 and 3.4 kgs on 1/1/18
*Rabbit 587 dropped from 4.3 kgs on 12/18/17 to 3.4 kgs on 1/1/18
*Rabbit 687 dropped from 4.9 kgs on 1/1/18 to 3.9 kgs on 2/12/18
In further review of the records, Rabbit 515 and Rabbit 454 (weighed at 5 kg only once on 11/27/17) were found
dead on 6 March 2018. The communication within the facility identified several rabbits as having had diarrhea on
that day and common treatments were started without direction or consultation from the veterinarian.
Monitoring weight of individual animals helps identify abnormal trends in order to ensure that animals with significant
weight loss are identified. Daily observation of all animals to assess their well-being, appropriate documentation of
those observations, and direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues
are necessary to ensure that the animals at the facility receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system
should be in place to ensure that all animals are observed daily, any health problems are documented and
addressed, and the attending veterinarian is notified with timely and accurate information.
