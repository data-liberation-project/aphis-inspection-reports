2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30pm on
22-Dec-16.
The inspector was informed that the licensee would not be available for several hours, and there were no other
representatives with adequate knowledge of the facility to accompany the inspection process. Licensees must
ensure that a knowledgeable adult is available to accompany inspection during regular business hours, or establish
optimal hours for inspection with the home inspector. Correct from this time forward.
