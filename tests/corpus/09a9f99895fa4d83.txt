2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45 pm on
02-Feb-17.
No one was home at the facility. I called and spoke to Licensee. She said she would not return until evening.
Licensee re-affirmed she will send hours of availability as often as necessary to prevent recurrence. Approximately
three four hour blocks of available time are necessary during daylight hours each week to facilitate inspection.
