2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
***On the morning of 8/1/17 husbandry staff found 1 bat deceased in its primary enclosure and 1 other bat was
exhibiting signs of serious illness; veterinary staff were immediately contacted and examined the sick animal.
Despite the initiation of appropriate treatment, the condition of bat deteriorated and it subsequently died. Upon
being notified and in response to this information, the IACUC and AV looked into this incident.
It was determined that research staff had separated the 2 bats from the rest of the colony for an IACUC approved
study activity scheduled to take place on 7/31/17. Per the institution’s established feeding procedure for separated
animals, husbandry staff prepared that day’s food ration for the 2 bats and left it for the research staff to give to the
animals after the study activity was concluded. However, research staff failed to provide the prepared food to the
bats on 7/31/17 and the lack of food was the cause of death.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including research staff, should be
done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm, behavioral stress, or unnecessary
discomfort.
The research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Corrective actions included but were not limited to implementing an expanded monitoring and husbandry plan for
the research laboratory and providing additional retraining of research staff on the expanded plan and the metabolic
needs of this species. No additional incidents have occurred.
This item has been appropriately addressed and corrected by the research facility.

NOTE – Inspection conducted 12/5/17 and 12/6/17. Exit briefing held 12/6/17 on-site with facility representatives.*END OF REPORT*
