3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A pen holding camels is not enclosed by a perimeter fence. All enclosures housing camels should have a secondary
containment that is a minimum of 6 feet in height and at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure. The
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility.

This was a focused inspection of the perimeter fence.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
