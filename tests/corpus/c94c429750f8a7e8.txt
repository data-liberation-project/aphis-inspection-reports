3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor of the indoor sheltered portion of the sheltered housing for 3 celebes macaques needs to be cleaned.
Water and excreta have soaked the bedding leading to no dry area for the macaques to rest on inside. Lack of
clean, dry floors will lead to odors, potential disease hazards and may discourage the animals from coming inside
during inclement weather. Hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and absorbent bedding must be raked or
spot-cleaned as often as necessary for the macaques to avoid contact with excreta; contaminated material must be
removed and/or replaced when spot cleaning is insufficient. Correct by 3/20/14.
Exit conducted with facility representative.
