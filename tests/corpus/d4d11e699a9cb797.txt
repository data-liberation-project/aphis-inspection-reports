ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On the last inspection conducted on January 12, 2017, the Program of Veterinary Care that was reviewed did not
address the: fennic fox, porcupines, servals, geoffrey cats, lynx, lemurs, bush baby raccoon, fox & squirrels.
The licensee indicated that the Program of Veterinary Care was still at the veterinarian for completion and has not
yet been completed, therefore it was not available for review to determine compliance if these species veterinary
care have been adequately addressed.
This Program of Veterinary Care shall be completed in a timely manner so that it can be reviewed to determine if all
of the mammals are receiving the necessary care prescribed by your veterinarian.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
On the last inspection, the bush baby did not have a primate enrichment plan. The licensee stated that the plan is
still being reviewed/developed by the veterinarian, and therefore was not reviewed. Additionally, the licensee
recently acquired 2 juvenile marmosets. This species of primate should also be included in the plan and address
the special considerations for juvenile primates.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure in the large lion play yard is 10 feet high with a kick in, but in several locations the kick in portion has
become unattached from its supports and are now upright. The height of this enclosure in these affected areas
pose a risk of escapeIn the tiger/lion enclosure the fence is not straight up and is wobbly & sagging in some areas. The space between
each support pole is too far apart to keep this fence in an upright position. Additionally, one of the vertical support
posts for the fence has broken off contributing to the pliability of the fence. Some of the tree limbs in this enclosure
have grown close to (or are bent towards) the fence-line and now poses a risk of escape if these fully clawed cats
should climb up the tree and onto the limbs.
There is a clawed & splintered wood log in the cougar/leopard enclosure which now has an exposed metal bolt.
These splinters and bolt pose a risk of injury to these cats as they climb/walk &/or claw this log.
The plywood resting board in the 3 kinkajou enclosure is starting to deteriorate. When plywood deteriorates it can
become soft and may not be structurally sound to support the weights of the animals, and the resulting splinters can
injure these animals.
The housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and contain them.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The wood platform that the den is on in the ringtail lemurs enclosure has a large standing puddle of green water.
The dry areas of this platform are stained with green algae. This green discoloration indicates that this area does
not drain rapidly after rainfall and allows algae to grown on these wet surfaces. The lemurs must also pass on this
platform to gain access to this shelter structure.
Another wood resting surface in the back caracal enclosure also has a puddle of water and is green stained.
Algae can also be slippery which might pose a risk of injury to these animals. Standing water also serves as an
attraction and breeding area for flies and mosquitoes. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate
excess water.

FEEDING.
The licensee feeds a mixture of different types of meats and in varying ratios/quantities depending on availability.
The big cat diet is not standardized or uniform from day to day.
The licensee continues to feed this non commercial diet to his cats. There is still no written, veterinarian, approveddiet plan. The written diet should specify the type, quantity, and frequency of any nutritional supplements.
Your veterinarian must approve (in writing) a feeding plan for all big cats to ensure that the cats are getting the
proper nutritional requirements (both for protein as well as vitamins & minerals) considering age, season, weight
and other considerations to prevent metabolic diseases as well as other illnesses.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Bananas are being placed on a soiled wooded platform in the Prevost squirrels enclosure. Numerous ants were
observed on and around this food.
This method of feeding does not minimize contamination of the feed. Some species of ants are known to cause
painful bites, while others may inhibit the animals from eating the food that is provided, and therefore not obtaining
their proper nutrition.
A different type of feeding arrangement shall be instituted or a effective and safe method of eliminating the ants
from the food shall be initiated. Consult with a professional pest control person of needed.

SANITATION.
The small mammal enclosures are dirty to varying degrees. This is especially evident in coatimundi & front caracal
enclosures. The caracal enclosure has several hard, white ash colored feces. This coloration indicates that these
wastes have been there for a prolong period of time (this was removed when pointed out). The coatimundi had
large amounts of old, dried, caked on feces & food on the resting board and between the edge of the resting board
and the enclosure fence. This area also had numerous flies. Other small mammal enclosures has lesser amounts
of dirt , sand, and dried feed on them and are not being cleaned often enough.
The licensee stated that these enclosures are not usually cleaned by himself and are cleaned by
volunteers/caretakers.
All enclosures shall be kept clean to reduce odors, disease hazards, and reduce pests (which were observed in the
Prevost squirrel & coatimundi enclosures. Additional training &/or supervision of volunteers &/or caretakers may be
necessary to accomplish this task.
