3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The shelters in approximately one-half of the 36 outdoor enclosures had an inadequate amount of bedding material for
the current temperatures. The cement floor of the shelters had a small amount of bedding material (shavings) but at least
one half of the floor was bare in most of those shelters. The temperature at the time of the inspection was 47 degrees F
(Kestrel reading) and the overnight temperatures have been less than 35 degrees F (local weather reports). Bedding
material is important to protect the dogs from the cold temperatures and to help preserve body heat. Lack of appropriate
bedding in cold environments increases the risks of sickness and hypothermia conditions. Sufficient clean, dry bedding
material is necessary to provide protection when the temperature is less than 50 degrees F. More bedding material is
necessary when the temperature is less than 35 degrees F for the dogs to have better protection. The owner must
provide sufficient bedding for the dogs and maintain it.

Note: Bedding was being provided before the inspector left the premises.
