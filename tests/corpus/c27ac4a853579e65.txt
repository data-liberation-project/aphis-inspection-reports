2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two dogs in the facility that need to be seen by the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and
treatment of their teeth. A female maltese(#4691) has an excessive amount of brown tarter on all of her teeth, with
receding gums. The left upper pre-molar has an open pocket between the top of the tarter and the bottom of the
gumline that exposes the roots of the tooth. There are several areas between the gumline and tarter on the front
insizers and some of the pre-molars where there is a gray spongy type of material that appears to be pus like in
consistency. There is a strong odor coming from the mouth and alot of salivation when looking in the mouth. There
is a brown poodle (#4695) that has an excessive buildup of brown tarter running along all of the pre-molars
preventing individual identification of each tooth. The back molars had a large ball of white calculous type material
buildup completely covering the two back upper molars. This material came off during the inspection of the mouth,
which showed a red, bleeding gumline underneath. There was an odor to the mouth and alot of saliva while
inspecting the teeth. The teeth had not been observed and the veterinarian had not been contacted for any
treatment prior to this inspection.
The buildup of tarter and debris on the teeth can cause possible health issues if left untreated or managed on a
regular basis.
The licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of any dogs with a large buildup of
tarter or any gum or tooth issues. The licensee should be checking all regulated animals regularly for any health and
dental issues.
