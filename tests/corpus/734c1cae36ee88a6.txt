2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the an open farm event, two separate incidences were observed during which visitors to the facility were
feeding and petting the sheep and camels without any readily identifiable employees present within visual distance
of the animals and visitors. The sheep interaction area is closest to the parking lot and there were no attendants or
employees present.
While the employee was stationed at a booth directly in front of the primary camel enclosure/interaction area, there
were two additional camel enclosures where the attendant could not visually monitor the animal-human interactions.
The mom and younger camel were visually blocked from the attendant by a shelter structure, and three camels
were in an adjacent pen where the interaction area was slightly downhill and blocked by rocks.
Lack of employee oversight of direct interactions between the animals and the visitors may lead to injury to the
humans and/or injury or distress to the animals. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or
attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.
Corrected during inspection by the facility owner as soon as the need for attendants was identified by the inspector
by closing off the camel area and moving the attendant to the sheep area.
The focused inspection on animal handling during public exhibition and exit interview were conducted with the
facility owner.
