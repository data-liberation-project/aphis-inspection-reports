3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There was a strong ammonia-like odor upon entering the whelping room in the indoor housing facility. Twelve adult
dogs and 28 puppies are housed in this room and are subjected to the strong odor. The inspector felt a burning and
stinging sensation to the eyes and nasal cavity while in the room.
Strong odors could potentially cause respiratory problems and cause discomfort and stress to the dogs.
The licensee must provide adequate ventilation or air exchange at all times to ensure the health and well-being of
the dogs.
The licensee turned on a ventilation fan and opened a door in the room. When the inspector reentered the room at
the end of the inspection, there was adequate ventilation and no longer a strong odor.
Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
