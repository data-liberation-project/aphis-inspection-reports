ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
- At the time of inspection the animal inventory was not up to date (inventory on hand was dated May 20, 2014) and
the licensee was not able to provide an accurate animal inventory. There were no Jacob sheep present on the
inventory list and four Jacob sheep were present in the park. Complete and accurate records are necessary to
ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace those animals. The
licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all animals at all times and must ensure those records are
available to the inspector upon request.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

enrichment present in the enclosure. The sharp points consisted of loops of wire that had loosened over time and
had exposed sharp ends. These areas of loose wire with exposed sharp points are a potential source of injury to the
enclosed animals. These sharp points must be removed or repaired. All enclosures must be kept in good repair
and protect the animals from injury.
