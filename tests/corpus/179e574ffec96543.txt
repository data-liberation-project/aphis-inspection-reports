PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
On 19 August 2014, the intermediate handler transported a load of 380 rabbits in 190 cartons (2 rabbits per
enclosure). Upon arrival, 32 rabbits were noted to be dead; several others were observed by the receiving
individuals to be in some degree of respiratory distress (blue discoloration, panting, and frothing at the nose were
observed in an undetermined number of animals). The next day one additional rabbit also expired, which was also
suspected to have been caused by the respiratory stress experienced in transit. An investigation of the
circumstances of the shipment revealed that the primary enclosures used to house the rabbits were of a larger size
than the intermediate handler had anticipated, so the cargo area of the truck was too small to allow adequate airflow
between cages and subsequent ventilation to the animals housed therein. The driver noted the discrepancy in the
dimensions of the boxes that had been ordered vs. those that had been delivered for shipment, but the animals
were loaded onto the truck despite this, and the transport proceeded as planned. The driver stopped to observe the
animals mid-shipment and no abnormalities were noted; however, the 32 rabbits were discovered to be dead upon
arrival at their final destination.
Inadequate space in the cargo space used to transport animals can have a significant impact on their ability to
breathe normally. Additionally, reduced airflow can cause the ambient temperatures inside the enclosures to
become too high, even if the temperatures inside the cargo area as a whole are within range (this was the case with
this shipment, as no temperature alarms were noted -(cid:19) the temperature was recorded within range throughout
transit). Deficiency in airflow and adequate ventilation caused significant animal impacts, i.e., the loss of 9% of the
load (33 of 380 animals).
The primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must be positioned in a manner that each rabbit has sufficient air
for normal breathing. The intermediate handler has taken corrective measures to prevent further incidents,
including re-training all of the drivers and painting a pattern of lines on the walls of the cargo areas of the vehicles
used to transport animals, such that any primary enclosure must be fitted inside the areas designated by the paint
lines in order for there to be sufficient airflow and ventilation. The drivers have been trained and instructed not to
accept a shipment if these criteria are not met.

CARE IN TRANSIT.
The shipment of rabbits transported from Oxford, MI to West Jefferson, OH on 19 August 2014 was loaded and
departed at 9:20am. The driver noted making an observation of the animals at 2:04pm (4 hours and 44 minutes
after previous observation). The driver at that time did not record any comments about the condition of the animals
(i.e., if any were in obvious distress or need of veterinary care). The next observation was upon delivery of the
shipment to the final destination at 3:10pm, where it was noted by the receiving party that the 32 animals were dead
on arrival. The vice president informed the inspector that the observation procedure involves the driver putting a
hand in the space between some of the cages to spot-check the temperature. It is recognized by the handler that
the spaces between cages may become overheated compared to the overall temperature recorded by the sensors
mounted in the cargo area, and so this is the technique used to ensure the ambient temperature does not become
excessive.
The observations made by the driver for this shipment were inadequate. The time between observations was
greater than 4 hours. Additionally, no notes were recorded regarding the condition of the animals, the air supply,
temperatures, or other standards; it is unclear if animals were exhibiting distress at the time of the observations stop
in-transit or not. Animals must be visually observed as frequently as circumstances may dictate, but not less than
once every 4 hours. This is to assure that animals are receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient
temperatures are within limit, and all other standards are in compliance, and to determine whether any animals are
in obvious distress or in need of immediate veterinary care. Failure to observe the animals within the prescribed
frequency can result in unseen stressors or unknown conditions to affect the animals and cause undue stress,
injury, or death. Correct by ensuring the driver or other employee of the intermediate handler will visually observe
all live animals as frequently as circumstances dictate, but not less than once every 4 hours, to assure that animals
have sufficient air and ambient temperature to allow normal breathing. The intermediate handler has instituted
training that drivers must take upon hiring and then once every 2 years thereafter to be able to make adequate
observations to assure the standards for transportation of animals are being met on every shipment.
To be corrected from this time forward.
