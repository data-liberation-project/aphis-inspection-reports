2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One white skunk has a large amount of hair loss over 50% of animal including back, legs and abdomen. A large
area over the back has skin that appears thickened, scaly and cracked. Licensee states that he had not noticed this
animal previously. Skin problems can indicate poor health or nutrition or injury/trauma to the animal. Conditions
such as these may be painful and can lead to further health complications. Appropriate methods to prevent, control,
observe, diagnose and treat diseases or injuries should be in place for all animals. The animal listed above must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the
condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple enclosures have broken wires or sharps points which may injury the animal or allow escape.
Six outdoor fox enclosures have broken wires and sharp points in the multiple flooring and wall areas. The edges of
wire panels around several support posts and where a wire panel had been overlaid have sharp points that had not
been trimmed and are protruding into the living space.
Many ferret enclosures housing more than 60 ferrets have broken wires in the flooring or gaps between the wall and
floor. The broken wire areas are mainly along the back of the cage where fecal material accumulates. Some gaps
between the wall and floor are due to broken or missing clips. Several (approximately three) skunk cages have
broken wires or holes in the floor. The broken wires cause sharp points that are protruding into the living space and
into the holes. Holes and gaps may allow escape or injury.
One raccoon cage with three raccoons has a wire water bowl stand with many sharp points protruding into the cage
open space where the raccoon could come in contact with when drinking.
Sharp points can cause injury or trauma to the animal. Holes can allow animals to become entrapped or escape.
Correction should include ensuring that all housing is constructed of material appropriate for the animals housed
and is maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals safely. Continual
monitoring and maintenance of cage and housing is an ongoing process. 3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two dead ferrets were found in separate ferret enclosures. One dead adult was found pushed into the corner of the
wooden nest box. Two live adult ferrets are in this enclosure. The licensee removed this dead animal during the
inspection. One dead, decomposing, headless juvenile ferret was found incorporated into the fecal material buildup
on the wire floor in the corner of the cage. One live adult and six juvenile ferrets are in this enclosure.
Dead animals in enclosures can increase the risk of disease and pest infestation to the live animals.
Provisions for the prompt removal and disposal of dead animals from enclosures to minimize disease hazards and
pest and vermin infestations should be implemented and maintained.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Within the Ferret Building there is an excessive accumulation of ferret feces present in the back corners of 11
enclosures. The affected enclosures are located along the east wall and contain 23 ferrets.
The licensee stated that the enclosures are cleaned out once a week.
Excessive excreta in primary enclosures can contribute to disease hazards, odors, insects and other pests.
The licensee must ensure that excreta be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Heather Cole, VMO, Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Ann
