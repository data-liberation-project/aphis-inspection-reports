FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cross-fencing between enclosures holding the goats and sheep has been pushed down to about knee-high in a
couple of places. The woven wire is sagging in such a way that it may not adequately serve to contain the animals,
and it becomes a risk of entrapment for the animals inside the enclosures,
The fencing must be maintained in good repair to function properly to safely contain the animals.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
A number of farm implements are being stored in two of the animal enclosures that are accessible to the animals.
Many of these implements have teeth, prongs, and edges that pose a risk of injury to the animals in the enclosure.
Animal enclosures must be kept clear of items that are unnecessary for the care of the animals, and that can
potentially injure the animals.
