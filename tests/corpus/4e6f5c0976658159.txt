3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
An accumulation of brown debris covered the entire length of the perches and/or enrichment items in six enclosures. A
lack of proper cleaning and sanitization can lead to harboring of disease-causing organisms that can produce negative
health impacts on the primates. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come into contact with must be spot-
cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84 of this subpart to prevent accumulations of excreta or disease
hazards.

Sheltered housing facilities.
Upon inspection, multiple sheltered enclosures housing the cynomolgus macaques had recorded temperature readings
outside of the required ranges of 45F - 85F. Per review of facility standard operating procedures (SOPs) regarding
temperatures during extreme weather conditions, staff are instructed to record temperatures at the housing enclosures
when these readings are not within acceptable range. While the day staff and overnight security are supposed to follow-
up, no records were available to confirm these cold temperatures were corrected in a timely manner.


Failure to ensure ambient temperatures are appropriate during cold temperatures can result in hazardous and
uncomfortable conditions for the primates housed. The sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities must be sufficiently
heated and cooled when necessary to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes, and to provide for their
health and well-being. The ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not fall below 45 °F (7.2 °C) for
more than 4 consecutive hours when nonhuman primates are present, and must not rise above 85 °F (29.5 °C) for more
than 4 consecutive hours when nonhuman primates are present to ensure the comfort and well-being of the animals.

3.80(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Sharp projecting edges on a damaged metal plate were observed at the base of an access gate inside an outdoor corral
primary enclosure. The protruding metal pieces may cause injury to the animals contained within the enclosure. Per the
regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that
could injure the nonhuman primates.

3.82(a)

Feeding.
One feed bin in an outdoor enclosure contained evidence of mold and contained a moldy biscuit. Consumption of moldy
feed can cause detrimental effects on the health of the nonhuman primate. Per the regulations, the food must be clean,
wholesome and palatable to the animals.



Corrected during the inspection.
3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The grounds and surrounding area directly below the elevated outdoor sheltered areas has accumulated sludge, excreta,
and food waste. Although the increase in sludge has been impacted by recent rainfall these surrounding areas, the
accumulation has not been addressed by husbandry practices. Additionally, used medical supplies, mechanical
equipment, and general construction debris were found throughout the grounds and in enclosures where primates had
access to the debris.
Increased accumulations of debris and waste foster breeding grounds for pests and can impact the health of the animals
housed in the enclosures.
Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste, and discarded matter. Weeds, grass, and bushes must
be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “B” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant and facility representatives.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 4, 2023, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
