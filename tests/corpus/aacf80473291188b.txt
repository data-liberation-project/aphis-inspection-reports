Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is missing the records for the dates of assumed deaths of 4 young skunks born in 2022 and 1 adult male
sugar glider. The licensee states the sugar glider died a month or two ago and forgot to write it down. The inspector
pointed out the discrepancy in number of young skunks listed on acquisition and disposition paperwork to the number of
young skunks counted during inspection. The licensee stated the animals likely died and does not remember what dates
they died or details of their deaths.
Accurate and up to date disposition records are necessary to identify animals still present at the facility and to correctly
disclose sale, euthanasia or otherwise disposal to ensure humane care of the animals.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information
concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his
or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her
control.

Facilities, general.

The sugar gliders are housed in wire enclosures. One wire enclosure, containing one adult sugar glider is stacked directly
on top of another wire enclosures containing one adult sugar glider. The wire top of the bottom enclosure is sagging and
holding the weight of the top enclosure. Wire surfaces may collapse if they fail to bear the weight of items stored on top of
them which could result in the injury or escape of an animal.
The enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair and protect the animals from injury and contain
them securely.

One outdoor skunk enclosure #5 housing one adult skunk has a hole chewed through the bottom of a plastic barrel, which
is a portion of this animal's primary enclosure. The hole is large enough for the skunk's head or legs to pass through to
the outside of the primary enclosure and cause injury.
Another outdoor enclosure #67 housing a young skunk has a rusted hole in the metal self feeder tray. This hole has
created sharp points where the animal eats from and may cause injury.
The enclosures shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. The
licensee must repair the holes a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the skunks.

Sanitation.
Several outdoor skunk enclosures have a buildup of feces directly in front of the animal's food and water source and
inside their plastic barrel. The licensee states the enclosures were last cleaned approximately 2 weeks ago.
**Enclosure #5 houses one adult skunk. This enclosure consisted of a plastic barrel with a hole cut in the side that is
connected to a wire enclosure. The entire floor surface of this plastic barrel has a thick layer of feces and straw present
with a large mound of feces also present in the barrel.

**Enclosure #18, #62, #68 each housing one adult skunk have an accumulation of feces in front of water bowls.
**Enclosure #65 with one adult skunk has an accumulation of feces in front of the self feeder food bowl.
A buildup of feces may cause the animal to become soiled and is a risk to disease hazards. This proximity of the fecal
piles to the food and water sources may also lead the animal to not eat or drink and cause health issues like dehydration.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. The enclosures and its contents must be
cleaned as often as to prevent an accumulation of feces.
