2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
An enclosure containing 2 adult Zebu had only a metal wire 4-foot-tall fence between the animals and the public, and
there was no attendant in the area. Members of the public were observed reaching over the fence trying to touch the
Zebu. A second enclosure containing 7 goats and 3 sheep had a metal wire 4-foot tall fence between the animals and the
public, and there was no attendant in the area. Members of the public were observed touching the animals and feeding
them feed from a nearby dispenser.
Animals who are touched or fed by unsupervised members of the public may be stressed or injured. Members of the
public may be injured when touching or feeding animals without supervision.
Correct by March 19th, 2021 by handling animals so there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general public as to assure the safety of animals and the
public.
