3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Enclosures that housed rabbits previously and were cited in the previous inspection for wire points now house male
guinea pigs. The enclosures were not repaired prior to moving guinea pigs into them. Also, in a stacked enclosure
the bottom two levels have wire points in a divider. Wire points could injure the guinea pigs. Maintain enclosures in
good repair and free from sharp points to protect the guinea pigs from possible injury.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The enclosures located on the wall that house male guinea pigs have an excess amount of cobwebs and debris
inside of them. Excess cobwebs and debris could cause guinea pigs to get sick and also does not provide for their
well-being. To protect the health of the guinea pigs, enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to
prevent a build up of cobwebs and/or debris in them but no less than once every two weeks.
