SANITATION.
There was a large number of bees present throughout the facility affecting several of the animal enclosures. Traps
specifically for bees have been added to the current pest control program however this effort has had a minimal
effect at reducing or eliminating their large numbers. The facility representative stated that local county authorities
have recently been notified of this situation. Insects such as bees may pose a health risk to the animals through
stings or possible allergic reactions. Additionally insects may potentially contaminate the animals’ sources of food
and water.
Adequate control of insects or other pests is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to
reduce contamination and potential disease hazards. A safe and effective program of pest control must be
established and maintained.
