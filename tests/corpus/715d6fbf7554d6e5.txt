3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The licensee acquired (3) Bush baby primates without an enrichment plan. Bush babies are primates that require
the licensee to develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement. The plan must be
in accordance with the accepted professional journals as directed by the attending veterinarian. An enrichment plan
for primates is important for the health of their psychological well being so they do not self-mutilate. The licensee did
not have the plan available but is the process of developing one for this primate species. The licensee must have
this plan available to APHIS upon request.
