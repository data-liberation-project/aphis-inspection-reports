ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 on
12/17/2015.
The phone number was not updated after licensee moved, so the number on file is now the wrong number;
inspector knocked on the house doors and waited 30 minutes for someone to arrive home.
