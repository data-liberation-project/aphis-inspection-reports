ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45 on
11-MAY-17.The licensee's family member on the premises stated the licensee was not at home and not reachable
by phone, but that he may be arriving home within 30 minutes. There was no other knowledgeable facility
representative available at that time. The inspector waited for the prescribed 30 minutes and the licensee did not
arrive home within that time period.
The licensee must ensure that a knowledgeable adult is available during normal business hours to allow for
inspection. Correct from this time forward.
