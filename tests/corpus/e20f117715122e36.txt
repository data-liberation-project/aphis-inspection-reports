3.4(c) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(c) Construction. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis.
***In the outdoor facility, there were two enclosures containing five adult dogs. The housing shelters in these two
enclosures had chewed edges. The bottom of one hinged door was chewed on one shelter. The other shelter had
metal trim around the doorway that was chewed and bent into the openining. The plastic type board at the bottom of
the doorway was also chewed. These areas all created sharp edges that could injure the animals within the
enclosure. The licensee must repair or replace these areas and assure that all surfaces are maintained as required.
This inspection began at 0913.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
