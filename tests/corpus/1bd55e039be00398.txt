2.38(f)(1)

Miscellaneous.
During the inspection, one rabbit was identified (B48) with an approximately 2-inch x 3-inch area of dark brown discolored
fur over the left thigh region. When questioned, the facility representative explained that the rabbit’s fur was likely singed
when the caging was torched, a process that is intended to remove the buildup of rabbit fur. The brown discoloration
involved only the superficial tips of the fur, and the underlying haircoat and skin appeared unaffected. During the
inspection, the fur was washed by facility staff; The discoloration remained unchanged despite washing, which is
inconsistent with an accumulation of fecal matter.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Cleaning and/or sanitization procedures must be performed
in a manner that appropriately safeguards the animals from stress and potential harm.
To be corrected from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
