2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The facility had Corid and CalPlus solution stored with the other dog medicines. The licensee stated they are
using Corid and CalPlus solution, but these medicines were not listed on the program of veterinary care or the
approved medicine list. Both Corid and CalPlus are labeled for large animals and not dogs. Using medications not
labeled for dogs or using any medications without the delegation of the attending veterinarian, may cause harm to
the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a program that ensures all medications are approved by the
attending veterinarian.
3.9(b) DIRECT
FEEDING.
*** At least three self feeders contained food which had a mold like substance on the food. The contaminated food
in one of these self feeders was located at the opening where 9 puppies had access to the food. This feeder, a
fourth of the opening had a grayish-white mold like material on the food. The other two feeders, one for 7 puppies,
the other for one adult dog, the contaminated food was located in the loading/holding area of the self feeders. The
feeders with contaminated food in the loading/holding area, the food had a grayish-white, mold-like material about
the area the size of a quarter. The two self feeders in with the puppies, the licensee had added water to soften the
food. Contaminated food can decrease the dog's acceptance of the food and can increase the risk of disease and
health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the current moldy feed to protect the health and well-being of the
dogs. The licensee needs to establish and maintain a program to ensure that food is protected from contamination
and that measures are taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration of feed at all times.
