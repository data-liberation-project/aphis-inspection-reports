3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces that cannot be cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn, chewed, or soiled. The wood frames
of the doggy entrance to the whelping part of the enclosure are much chewed, with parts of the screw heads starting
to protrude. This raw chewed wood cannot be cleaned or sanitized. Surfaces must be able to be properly cleaned
and then sanitized to help prevent diseases and maintain a healthy environment for dogs. The owner needs to put
into place a good maintenance program that closely monitors and repairs surfaces before they become a problem
and a hazard for dogs. The owner must repair or replace these chewed surfaces, in order for proper cleaning and
sanitization to take place. Correct by 10-01-2015
