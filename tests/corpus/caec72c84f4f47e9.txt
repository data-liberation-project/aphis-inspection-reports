NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The USDA noted that regulated activity has been conducted from an additional location of this licensee. As stated
by an employee the guinea pigs have been housed at the current location for one year, and were housed at a
previous site before coming to this location. The previous site was also undeclared to the USDA. The licensee
must promptly notify the Animal Care Regional Office of a change in business such as any additional sites within 10
days of such a change.
Correct immediately.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At the time of inspection, there was a medium sized radio inside one of the animal enclosures that contained
breeding females and several young guinea pigs. It was playing fairly loud rock music intended for all of the guinea
pigs in the room. A radio placed inside an enclosure playing music at a fairly high volume could potentially cause
behavioral stress or physical harm to the animals. The radio was immediately put in a place away from the animals.
This item was corrected at the time of inspection.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Many of the animals' enclosures had grime accumulation on the lower edges and corners. The primary enclosures
need to be cleaned often enough to be kept free of a buildup of excreta for the health and well-being of the animals.
