2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection, the steer, Horney Freckles, was in need of veterinary attention. He was reluctant to stand or
walk and when he did walk, he moved very slowly with a stiff gait. The left front foot was dropping in the rear and
the hooves were slightly overgrown. The steer had hair loss and redden skin on the right rear flank (4 inches in
diameter) and dewlap (6-8 inches in diameter). His legs and abdomen were covered in feces and urine and this is
what he was laying in. The facility failed to observe that this animal was in need of veterinary attention. A facility
representative stated that the attending veterinarian is scheduled to come out on Tuesday, 10/10/17 to exam the
animal and to trim the slightly overgrown hooves. There is currently no paperwork showing that the attending
veterinarian had examined this animal in the past year and the facility was unable to provide any documentation
indicating that the attending veterinarian was notified about the current condition of the animal.
Daily observation of the facility animal is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and
well-being are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or
behavior must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure
adequate care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and
suffering and the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate
daily observations of their animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner
and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
