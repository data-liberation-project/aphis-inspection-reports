2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***In the Whelping Building, there was one adult female dog and two puppies contained in one enclosure. One puppy
(DOB 8/12/21) was laying at the back of the enclosure and only moving it's head. When questioned about the puppy, the
facility representative stated that the puppy's back legs turn outward and that it cannot stand up. The facility
representative stated that the puppy was being force fed and would vomit after feeding so they were just going to let it die.
Inspectors then asked if the Attending Veterinarian had been contacted or if the puppy had been seen by a veterinarian.
The facility representative stated that taking the puppy to a veterinarian was not an option due to personal issues. The
licensee stated that when he was at the whelping house a couple of weeks ago, the puppy was up and bouncing around.
The puppy was removed from the enclosure and placed on a flat surface. The puppy attempted to stand, but could only
stand on it's front feet. The puppy's left eye was closed and would not open. There was clear drainage and crusting
around the eye.
The inspection was stopped by the inspectors. The Attending Veterinarian was called and agreed to examine the puppy
as soon as possible. The inspectors left the facility so the licensee could take the puppy to the veterinarian.
Illnesses or injuries that are not diagnosed by a licensed veterinarian can worsen or cause death.
The licensee must have this puppy examined by a licensed veterinarian and ensure that adequate veterinary care is

provided to all dogs as required.
