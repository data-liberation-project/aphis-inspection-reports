3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
***The primary enclosures for the rabbits have a build up of solid waste material in the corners of the enclosure on
the wire and on the wooden frame where the excreta did not or cannot fall through the wire. There is also hair
accumulating in these areas. The enclosures shall be cleaned to prevent excessive buildup of waste and protect
the rabbits from contamination.
***There are several rabbit hutches composed of wood and wire that have wood that has been chewed or gnawed
leaving splinters and exposed untreated wood that cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. The exposed
wood has ground in waste material and liquid stains. Excess excreta creates unsanitary conditions that may
negatively affect the health and well being of the rabbits. The wood shall be repaired or replaced and prepared in a
manner that will allow it to be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to provide for the health and comfort of the rabbits.
