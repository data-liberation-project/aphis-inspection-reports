otherwise acquired; the USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is licensed or registered

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Outdoor Housing Facilities.
The following structural issues were identified for the outdoor pen of the one pig.
**Zip ties had been used to secure the hardware cloth to the hog panel sides of the pen; the ends of the zip ties had
not been trimmed and some of the long ends had been chewed by the animal. The zip tie material can act as a
foreign body if ingested by the pig.**The hardware cloth on the inside of the pen was folded outward along the bottom of one section of the pen and
was sticking out about 6 inches at ground level. About 6-8 inches of the edge of the hardware cloth in the middle of
that section of the fence was not secured to the side of the pen. These structural issues are potential hazards that
may cause injury to the pig.
Per this Section of the Regulations, outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The licensee needs to trim the long ends of all zip ties and make appropriate repairs to the hardware cloth used on
the inside wall of the pig’s pen for the safety and health of the animal.
