OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are four outdoor dog shelters that are provided with some bedding. The temperature at the time of the
inspection was 19.2 degrees F as recorded by the inspector's Kestrel. At this temperature additional bedding is
required. Lack of bedding may not allow the dogs to regulate their body temperature. All outdoor dog shelters must
be provided with bedding when temperatures are below 50 degrees F and additional bedding when temperatures
are below 35 degrees F. Correct by the close of business today.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
