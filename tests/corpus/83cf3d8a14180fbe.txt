3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Excessive flies were present in the barn, inside of the camel stall, and inside of the skunks’ stall. In the camel’s stall, the
flies were concentrated on the animal’s legs and on the floor. In skunks’ stall, the flies were concentrated on the floor, on
the animals’ food dish, and on the transport kennel being used as a hiding space. The facility had three fly attractant bags
in place during the inspection, but they were not effectively controlling the fly population. Additionally, none of these of
these bags were near the stalls where the flies were concentrated. Flies can carry and spread disease.

Ensure a pest control program is in place to effectively control the flies at the facility.
