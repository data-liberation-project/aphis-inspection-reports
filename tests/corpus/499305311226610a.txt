2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30 on
23-MAY-18. The licensee's wife stated she did not have adequate knowledge of the care of the animals, and there
was no other facility representative available at that time. The licensee's hours of availability were discussed and
alternate contact methods were provided.
Lack of availability for inspections hinders the regulatory process. Correct by ensuring a knowledgeable facility
representative is available during normal business hours. Correct from this time forward.
