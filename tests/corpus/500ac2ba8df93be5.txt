3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning of surfaces.
1. Husbandry staff were in the process of performing the daily cleaning of the primary enclosures at the time of the
walk-through portion of the inspection. It was noted that some of the primary enclosures that had just been cleaned
had areas of dark colored dried residue on the surface of the enclosure walls approximately 6 to10" x 8 to12" in
size. This dark colored residue was a mix of fecal matter and bedding material that had come off of the dogs' feet
when they jumped up on the walls of their enclosures. In addition, other enclosures that had already been cleaned
contained dirty bedding material on the narrow shelf along the base of the enclosure walls and at least one of the
just cleaned enclosures contained a plastic kong-like chew toy that had solid excreta inside the toy's crevices and
openings.
Per this Section of the Regulations, hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily
to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.
The walls and other hard surfaces of the dogs' primary enclosures need to be spot-cleaned daily to remove any
build-up of waste material and/or dirty bedding. Any toys that are soiled from the presence of solid excreta on their
surfaces should be removed from the dogs' primary enclosures and replaced with a clean toy(s). Following this
cleaning practice is important for the health of the animals.
