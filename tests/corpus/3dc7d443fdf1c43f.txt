ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white, male gerbil had an area of hair loss with black scabs on its lower back and base of tail. It was housed with
six other gerbils. At the time of inspection, this animal appeared to be active and eating normally. Once APHIS
officials identified the gerbil, facility employee immediately isolated into his own enclosure and administered
treatment as per their written program of veterinary care. Caretakers replaced bedding this morning, but failed to
note the scabs on the gerbil's lower back and base of tail.
It is the facility's responsibility to ensure that daily observations of all animals, in order to adequately assess their
health and well-being, are being effectively conducted. Correct by performing effective daily observations of all
animals so problems are identified and appropriate care is provide as directed by the attending veterinarian. Correct
from this day forward.
Note: Animals identified on the previous inspection report dated May 31, 2017 were examined by the attending
veterinarian and treated.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the president.
