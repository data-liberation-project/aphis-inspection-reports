2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 6y old female (microchip #-5500) dog named Precious was observed to have dental problems that need to be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian. An upper and lower incisor, and her upper left premolar were loose to the
touch with eroded gums and all teeth had plaque. The facility reports that teeth are sometimes checked on adult
dogs, however a regular routine of checking teeth is not in place. Dental problems can be painful and if left
untreated can affect the overall health of the affected dog.
Correction: Ensure that Precious is seen and treated by the attending veterinarian. Develop and maintain a method
of routine observations that include dental health of regulated animals and communicate problems to the attending
veterinarian promptly.
Correct by: 8/20/19.
