Handling of animals.
During this inspection, two groups of patrons were observed by the inspector to be interacting with animals on exhibit,
including the camels, wallaby, alpaca and sheep. No responsible, readily-identifiable attendant was present during these
interactions. Public contact with exhibited animals without appropriate oversight can result in injury to the patron and/or to
the animals. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times
during periods of public contact. Correct by 5/14/2021.

Outdoor housing facilities.
The squirrel monkey enclosure’s public barrier does not adequately restrict physical contact between the public and the
nonhuman primates. The insufficient barrier allows patrons to reach into the enclosure and injury to the primates and/or
the people could occur. Fixed public exhibits housing nonhuman primates must have a barrier between the primary
enclosure and the public at any time the public is present, in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the
nonhuman primates. Correct by 5/27/2021.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.


No 6’ perimeter fence is in place around the following animals’ enclosures: wallabies, kangaroo, and capybara. The
variance in place does not cover these species and/or their current locations. Several gates along the 6’ fence in other
locations are only 4’ tall. The lack of an adequate perimeter fence does not provide for the protection and containment of
the animals held within. All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to
keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6‘ high for these animals must be approved in writing by
the Administrator. Correct perimeter fence/variance deficits by 6/10/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
