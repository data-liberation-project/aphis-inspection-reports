DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
The licensee is housing regulated animals at an unapproved location in Texas. Upon reviewing the records, the
licensee was asked where the six tigers and single cougar were located. The licensee indicated four tigers and a
cougar have been housed and are currently housed at a facility in Texas. The licensee also stated two tigers, who
are currently on a traveling exhibit, have been housed at the same facility in Texas when they are not on a traveling
exhibit. The Texas facility is not approved to house the animals. Finally, the licensee stated that the tigers and
cougar are not and have never been housed at the approved Illinois facility. Housing regulated animals at an
unapproved facility does not ensure that the facility meets the regulations and standards for the care of animals.
Licenses are issued to specific persons for specific premises and are not valid at different locations.
Ensure animals are housed at approved facilities.
To be corrected: Immediately

back for the the exit briefing. The licensee did not respond.
