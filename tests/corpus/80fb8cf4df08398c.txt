PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Twenty six white transport enclosures housing 7 guinea pigs in each did not have the words "Live Animals" in letters
at least 1 inch in height, and with arrows or markings to indicate the correct upright position position of the container
(see air waybill 027 PHL 3621 5480).
Carriers and intermediate handlers must not transport live animals unless the primary enclosure is clearly marked
on top and on more or more sides with the words "Live Animals" in letters a least 1 inch in height, and with arrows
or other markings to indicate the correct upright position. Failure to label primary enclosures properly can result in
animals being transported incorrectly and can put animals at risk for injury.
This inspection was conducted with the customer service agent and exit interview was conducted with the general
manager.
