Primary enclosures.
A black rabbit was observed to be loose within the rabbit house. The rabbit was caught and placed into a secure
enclosure at the time of inspection. Primary enclosures that inadequately contain the animal could lead to animal injury.
The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures for rabbits are structurally sound and maintained to contain the
animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
