235-3594-4624, 235-3594-3784 and 235-3594-3563 were labeled “Please give food and water to AVI upon arrival”
there was no statement regarding the last time the puppies were offered food and water, as required. Additionally,
none of the 25 crates included a signed consignor’s signature regarding the last time the animals were offered food
and water.

enclosure in a manner that makes it easily noticed and read. The certification must include the time and date the

The 18 puppies on waybill # 235-3594-0166, and the 8 puppies on waybill # 235-3594-4215 were arriving with
USDA import permits for adoption or resale. These puppies are required to be at least six months of age in order to
receive such a permit, and the consignor has identified the puppies as six months of age or older. These puppies
were all shipped two per crate, which does not conform with the requirements, which state that no more than one
live dog or cat, 6 months of age or older, may be transported in the same primary enclosure when shipped via air
carrier.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the personnel representing the carrier at the cargo office.
