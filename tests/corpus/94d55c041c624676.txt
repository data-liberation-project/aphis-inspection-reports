*******A container of clean bedding was observed uncovered, without a lid in the kennel area. There were two mice
observed sleeping in the center of the container. Pests can contaminate bedding material and can cause health
issues with the dogs. Bedding material must be stored in in a container with a tight fitting lid and must be stored in a
manner which will protect it from contamination.
******Two unopened bags of dog food are being stored in the kennel area and are in direct contact with the concrete
floor. This can lead to contamination of the food sources and could possibly have a negative health impact on the
dogs. Food must be stored off of the floor in order to prevent contamination and allow cleaning of the floor
underneath.
