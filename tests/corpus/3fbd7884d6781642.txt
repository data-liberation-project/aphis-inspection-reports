ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Maltese, microchip #071381853, was observed breathing rapidly and lying mostly in a prone position in the
enclosure. Upon closer observation of this dog it was observed that he is also very thin. His hip bones, back
bones, ribs and leg bones are easily palpable. The rapid breathing and thinness could be a sign of a medical
condition. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment
plan. The license must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
