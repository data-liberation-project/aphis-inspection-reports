2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult female tri-colored guinea pig (mostly black and white with tan spot on top of back) had a solid mass
approximately 3 cm in diameter under her chin. This animal was in rack 2, second enclosure from the top.

An adult female female guinea pig (mostly white with tan spots) had a firm but moveable mass approximately 2 cm in
diameter under her chin. This animal was in rack 3, third enclosure from the top.

Both animals appeared to be eating and drinking normally. Licensee was feeding timothy hay with barley straw mixed in.
In addition, the animals have access to a self-feeder with guinea pig pellets.

The treatment for masses is not addressed in the program of veterinary care and there is no record that the facility had
identified these two animals prior to today's inspection. A failure to conduct adequate daily observations with direct
communication with the attending veterinarian can result in delay of care provided to animals and prolong animal health
problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health and well-being are conveyed.


The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian about the two guinea pigs with masses and provide appropriate
treatment for these animals as recommended by the veterinarian. Correct by April 30, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
