ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Buddah", an eight year old black and brown King Charles Spaniel male (ID # 027-070-522) has an excessive
buildup of dark brown material on two cheek teeth extending up to the gum line. There's a white creamy material
along the gum line on the remaining cheek tooth in the left side of the mouth. The licensee stated that she was
unaware of the condition.
Dental problems can be painful and lead to a decrease in appetite. The licensee must have the animal examined by
a veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administered. The outcome of the examination must be documented
and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary
care at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
