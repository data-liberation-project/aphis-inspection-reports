3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
**The licensee currently has a 5 month old tiger cub. The cub is being fed approximately 10 bottles per day of a
mixture comprised of esbilac, vitamins and yogurt in addition to raw meat. Although the licensee indicated he had
spoken with the veterinarian regarding the diet, the inspector was unable to verify the feline veterinarian had
reviewed and approved the diet currently being fed to the tiger cub. A diet not properly prepared with consideration
for the age, species and type of animal could jeopardize the health of the animal. It is the responsibility of the
licensee to ensure that the diet fed to the animals has been reviewed and approved by the attending veterinarian to
ensure the animals receive food of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to promote the health and well-being of the
animals as set forth in this section.
