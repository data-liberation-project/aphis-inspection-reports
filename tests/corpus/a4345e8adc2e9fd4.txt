3.78(b)(1)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
- The ring tailed lemurs are currently being housed in a corn crib enclosure with plastic tarps wrapped on the
outside. Inside this enclosure is a small igloo dog house sitting on the concrete floor in front of two portable heaters
located outside the corn crib enclosure. The licensee stated that the lemurs have not been moved inside this winter.
He also stated he had two heaters placed beside each other on two separate breakers. The igloo entrance faces
the heaters to allow the interior of the igloo to stay warm. The ambient temperature outside at the time of the
inspection was 48 degrees F. The ambient temperature inside the corn crib enclosure was 61 degrees F. The
interior of the igloo dog house had a temperature of 85 degree F. However, the igloo is not attached to anything and
can be easily moved around the inside of the corn crib by the enclosed animals, which would leave the primates
without a sufficiently heated shelter structure. This set up is not safe nor structurally sound for the enclosed
Non-human primates. The mesonet map for Garvin county show 5 consecutive days this winter with temperatures
below 32 degrees F, and a total of 28 days this winter with temperatures below freezing. The primates must be
provided a secure, heated shelter or moved to an enclosure appropriate for winter weather.
To be corrected by January 18, 2016.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The enclosure housing the Jacobs sheep has multiple areas which are unsafe. The wire mesh enclosure fence
has curled up at the bottom inside one of the two shelters, in the area where the animals are fed. This is an
entrapment risk, and must be corrected. The long wooden shelter has several gaps, which also contain sharp
points or loops of wire. These areas are a potential source of entrapment or injury to the contained animals. This
shelter in in disrepair and is collapsing in the middle. There were two loose boards on the ground with exposed
nails. These boards were removed during the inspection. All sharp points and loose wires must be eliminated, and
all gaps repaired to minimize the risk of injury to the animals.
