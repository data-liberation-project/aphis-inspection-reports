ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The last recorded site visit by the attending veterinarian was on 5/03/13. Good communication and consultation
between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form of a written program of veterinary care and regularly
scheduled visits to the facility are necessary for the health of the animal. The licensee must schedule a visit with the
attending veterinarian affecting 91 dogs.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) have 46 dogs recorded but there were 91 adult dogs counted by the
inspector. When the records and dogs at the facility don't match it makes the records incomplete. Complete and
accurate records are needed to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability
to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at their facility.
