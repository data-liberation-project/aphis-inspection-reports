FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Main Goat Pen: The enclosure is constructed of board fencing with wire panel fence attached to the lower half of
the enclosure. The wire panel fence is damaged in some sections along the front of the enclosure. Another section
is detached from a support post and extends inward in a manner that a goat leg could become entangled within the
fencing. There is also a section of fence detached from the board fence with the top edge extending into the
enclosure. The wire fence in other sections are broken or bent exposing sharp points or a rough edge. The current
condition of the fence may cause injury to the goats. The wire fence must be replaced or repaired to eliminate all
sharp edges and be constructed in a manner that would prevent injury. Correct by July 21, 2017
