CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In at least 3 of the outdoor sections of the primary enclosures there appeared to be a greater than a daily
accumulation of fecal material. When questioned the licensee stated that it had been a few days since the outdoor
sections had been cleaned. Fecal material and food waste must be removed from the primary enclosure daily to
prevent the dogs from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
