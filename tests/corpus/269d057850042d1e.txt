(c) Surfaces (3) Cleaning. ***** At time of inspection the kennel pens located behind the building to the west of the
main residence, as well as the pens located to the north of the main residence have holes which have been dug by
the animals in the pens which are preventing the proper cleaning of these pens.
These holes need to be filled in and maintained daily during the required cleaning process for each of these pens.
This will help to prevent excreta from becoming trapped in these holes which can lead to a pest and odor problem
which can affect the health and well being of the animals in these pens..
