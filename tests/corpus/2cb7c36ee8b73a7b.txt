ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
•(cid:9)The plan of veterinary care is incomplete. The space on the first page of the plan indicating the frequency of
regularly scheduled veterinary visits was not filled out. The plan does not include capybara, camels, and impala that
are currently housed at the facility. The plan of veterinary care must be completed with all covered species included
as well as a schedule of veterinary visits specified in order to ensure appropriate veterinary care for the animals.
Licensees shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements which include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
•(cid:9)There were a number of animals with physical conditions that need veterinary examination. Conditions included
multiple animals with thin/patchy hair, dry scruffy hair, and/or abnormal skin; several with loose, liquid appearing
feces; a vervet with an abnormal finger; and monkey with an enucleated eye, and camels with tearing eyes. There
were no medical records, history or information on veterinary visits or exams to indicate that any of the animals for
which there was concern had been examined or treated. Additionally, there was a bottle of Vetericyn spray was very
out of date with an expiration of June 2014.
•(cid:9) The following is a list of animals with conditions noted during the visit:
In the middle pen area there were a number of animals with thin/patchy/dry hair: a white-faced capuchin in pen #3,
a cinnamon capuchin in pen #6, a cinnamon capuchin in pen #9/10; and a cinnamon capuchin in pen #14.
In the middle area, pen #8, there was white-faced capuchin with an enucleated eye and there was no history
available to demonstrate if, or what, veterinary care and monitoring had been conducted or recommended.
In the middle area, pen #13, 1 vervet had a rigidly extended finger on its right hand that appeared that it could not
bend. It held its hand near its body in a guarded position and avoided using it when moving around. This may be
signs that it is experiencing some discomfort or pain from this condition. The caretaker stated that this monkey
arrived this way but there were no records to document this statement.In the back primate area there were three cages with a total of seven black and white ruffed lemurs whose feces
appeared loose and unformed.
In the back area in a pen with two ringtail lemurs, one had a section at the base of its tail, approximately three
inches long, that was missing hair all the way around. The skin appeared rough, scaly, thickened and possibly with
some scabbing. (cid:9)
In the camel pasture housing nine camels, two camels had wet areas under their eyes which appeared to be from
tearing.
A number of the conditions observed appear to be long-standing and there is no evidence to indicate that the
attending veterinarian was notified. There is no information on assessments of these conditions to indicated if they
are improving or worsening.
The facility must ensure that animals receive adequate veterinary care and ensure that direct and frequent
communication on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
•(cid:9)The animal records are incomplete. No written acquisition and disposition records were available for the majority
of the animals at the facility regarding who they were obtained from or the date they were obtained. An inventory list
of animals on hand was provided but it only listed the species and sex. The current animal care person stated that
that the majority of the records went missing with the previous animal caretaker. Approximately 170 animals were
currently inspected. There were acquisition records showing arrival of 28 animals but some of those animals were
not present at the inspection and did not have corresponding disposition records (e.g. 3 kangaroos). Additionally,
some animal which were present at the previous inspection were not present at the current inspection and did not
have disposition records. This included: 2 cavys, 2 eastern grey and 3 red kangaroo and possibly 2 capybars
(previously 3 present and only 1 claimed on the current inventory but not observed). Of those missing animals only
one kangroo had a disposition record.
•(cid:9)Based on the discrepancies in inventories, acquisition, and disposition records, it is not possible to track
movement of any particular animal into or out of this site. As a result, it cannot be ascertained if the licensee is
operating as a Class A dealer of Class B dealer.
•(cid:9)Several of the acquisition and disposition records had the name of the current caretaker for this facility rather than
the actual licensee. The caretaker does not have a USDA license. The caretaker explained that the state wildlife
permit for the facility is no longer held by the owner but is now held by her, and that her name and FWC permit
number has to be on the transfer paperwork to meet state regulation. When the transition to her holding the wildlife
permit happened she stated that there was some confusion about how to fill out the paperwork. The caretaker
stated that she has changed how she fills out the paperwork to show the owners name and she puts her information
in the margins. •(cid:9)There was a giraffe on the property which during the inspection the licensee stated belonged to him. The owner
had stated that he could not go into the giraffe barn because the animal was aggressive. However, when records
were reviewed with the caretaker, she stated that she doesn’t have the paperwork for the giraffe because it went
directly to the son of the owner (who holds a separate USDA license for a separate business on the same property).
She stated that she did not have a wildlife permit to have the giraffe. The apparent confusion over who possesses
the giraffe raises serious concerns over who has responsibility for the care of the animal. It also raises concerns
over the separation of the businesses that share the property.
•(cid:9)In addition to confusion about the giraffe, there were a couple of bactrian camels near that enclosure which were
also not accessible according to the licensee. An acquisition form indicated that four bactrian camels were
transferred from Maryland. However, these camels were not included on the inventory and similar to the giraffe it
was unclear who is responsible for these animals.
Accurate, complete and current records must be created and maintained to comply with the applicable regulations
and to protect the health and welfare of regulated animals under the Animal Welfare Act.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
•(cid:9)In a pen housing two Gibbons (front pen #3) there was a hanging rope with dried, caked material that appeared to
be either fecal material or caked food residue.(cid:9)
•(cid:9)In the enclosure housing one celebes (front pen #8) there were numerous flies on the food that the monkey had
dumped out and wetted on the floor. There was food residue accumulated in space between the concrete slabs
under the food bucket.
•(cid:9)In a pen housing a mangaby, a capuchin and 2 Diana monkeys (front pen #9) the nest/shelter portion of the
enclosure had an strong odor of urine and feces. There was an accumulation of feces and wet areas in the shavings
on the floor.
•(cid:9)A pen housing 2 brown lemurs (middle area – pen #1) had wood resting shelves had dark staining and grime build
up. Plastic wind breaks hanging on back and sides were dirty with green staining.
•(cid:9)A pen housing 3 white-faced capuchins (middle area #3) and plastic shade tarps on top that were dirty.
Accumulation of feces and food debris, and dirty surfaces that cannot be cleaned adequately create unsanitary
conditions that may pose health risks and/or attract pests and vermin. The bedding in nest areas must be cleaned
or replaced at a frequency that will prevent the buildup of excessive odors. Floors must be cleaned and maintained
in manner that prevents accumulation of debris. Perches, ropes, shade tarps and other surfaces must be cleaned
and sanitized, or removed, repaired, or replaced when worn or soiled.
3.75(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. •(cid:9)In the food preparation area there were cleaning chemicals stored on a shelf under, and in close proximity to, food
buckets, scoops, and food handling utensils and equipment. Cleaning chemicals were also stored in a sink in the
food prep area. Storage of cleaning chemicals near food utensils and in areas where food is prepared creates a
potential risk of contamination of animal foods. Substances that are toxic to nonhuman primates must not be stored
in food storage and preparation areas. They must be stored in a manner that prevents potential contamination of
food or food equipment.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
•(cid:9)A pen with 2 brown lemurs (middle area – pen #1) had an area in the back cage panel where a patch had been
placed over an old opening. There were segments of the wire that had been cut and the ends that were sharp and
accessible to the monkeys.
•(cid:9)In a pen with 3 white-faced cinnamon capuchins (middle area- combined pens #9 &10) there was a sheet of wire
panel with sharp points exposed all along the edge.
The primary enclosures must be designed and constructed so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the nonhuman primates. Portions of the pens with exposed sharp points must be repaired or replaced.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
•(cid:9)An enclosure housing 3 spider monkeys (front pen#2) had a hollow tube of rigid, black culvert-type plastic
approximately 1-1 ½ feet diameter, sticking up out of the concrete floor to a height of approximately 1 ½ feet. The
licensee stated that the tubing had held a tree previously. The pen housing a mangaby, a capuchin, and 2 Diana
monkeys also had a similar tube set in the floor but not extending as high. These hollow tubes pose a risk of the
animals getting entrapped in the tube, tripping on it, or injuring themselves on the sharp edges of the rigid plastic.
•(cid:9)The enclosure housing 2 Patas monkeys (back area, no pen #) had a section of wire panel exposed where there
was a depression in the dirt floor due to digging or soil errosion. The exposed wire poses a risk of injury if they get
their feet entangled in the wire.
The tubes should be removed or modified to prevent injury to the animals. The expose wire in the floor of the Patas
monkey cage must be repaired or removed so as to prevent the risk of injury.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.•(cid:9)There was no written environmental enhancement plan for nonhuman primates approved by the attending
veterinarian. A document was provided but it was a generic description of what should be in the plan and there was
no facility specific plan developed.
•(cid:9)A pen with four ringtail lemurs (back area- no pen#) had inadequate environmental enhancement. There were no
elevated resting surfaces; the only elevated surface was one nest barrel supported by a metal bar. There were only
two toys in the enclosure with four animals.
•(cid:9)A number of animals had thin and/or patchy hair which can be an indication of over-grooming. Over- grooming can
be a sign of psychological distress associated with insufficient environmental enhancement or other stressors.
•(cid:9)An infant and several singly-housed primates were observed during the inspection. These are situations which
require special consideration and must also be address in the enrichment plan.
Licensees must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
•(cid:9)The camel pasture/paddock housing nine camels had inadequate shelter for sun or inclement weather. The only
shelter in the enclosure was a covered feeding station that could not fully accommodate even four camels at a time.
Other unregulated animals also compete for this limited shelter space.
Adequate shelter from direct sunlight and inclement weather must be provided that is sufficient for all animals to
protect themselves.

WATERING.
•(cid:9)A herd of approximately 51 zebra held in a very large pasture range area had two natural ponds as water sources.
There was no source of clean potable water. A water trough was present but was dry.
•(cid:9)In the camel paddock housing nine camels and several unregulated species the water trough had white buildup on
the inside which appeared consistent with calcium/mineral deposits from well water. No water was visible from the
inspector’s vantage point from outside the enclosure and the enclosure could not be entered due to safety reasons.
If water was present, it was a very limited amount that was not likely to be adequate for all the animals in housed inthe enclosure.
Animals must be provided with sufficient potable water necessary for their health and comfort. Water receptacles
must be cleaned and sanitized.
This inspection was conducted Jan. 19, 2017 and completed on Jan. 23, 2017.
Two Veterinary Medical Officers conducted the inspection. The licensee and an animal caretaker were both present
for the inspection of all the primates and the feed storage and preparation areas. The licensee guided the
inspectors around the range area. The animal caretaker finished the inspection of the camels and records review.
An exit interview was conducted by both inspectors in person with the animal caretaker, and with the licensee on
conference call.
