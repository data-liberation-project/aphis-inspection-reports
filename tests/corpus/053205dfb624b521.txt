Three Pomsky puppies were housed in an enclosure that was too small for them. The enclosure measured 31.5
inches by 24.75 inches for a total of 779.625 square inches of space. Two of the puppies measured 17 inches and
one measured 16 inches. The three puppies together required 1,542 square inches of space and were short
762.375 square inches of space.
Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their cages.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the
minimum floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct
immediately.
