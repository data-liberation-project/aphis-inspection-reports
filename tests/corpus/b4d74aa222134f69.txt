ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:00 pm on
17-May-17.
A teenager at the home told me that the licensees were gone and probably wouldn't return for about 2 hours.
