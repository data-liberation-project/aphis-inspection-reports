Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:20 am on 05-27-
21.
Inspectors arrived at property adjacent to the facility during licensees stated optimal hours. After calling the main contact
number listed, we left a voicemail message that we were there for inspection. We then called the customers cellphone
and were able to make contact. The licensee stated that there was no one available to accompany us on inspection at
that time and would not be available for hours. Inspector informed licensee this would generate an attempted inspection
and the report would be delivered by email. Optimal hours were revisited for update during the call with no changes
indicated.
