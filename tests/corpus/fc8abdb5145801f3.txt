2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The written Program of Veterinary Care for this facility is blank. The attending veterinarian (AV) visited the
facility on April 29, 2015 and filled out the front page of the PVC and signed it but the remaining pages are blank.
The licensee stated the AV planned to return to the facility and complete the form but has not yet. This written PVC
must be completed so that adequate guidance for the veterinary care of the animals is on hand to ensure
appropriate care for all animals at the facility. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the
attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has
accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing
a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** This facility does not have animal on hand records for 2 reindeer found on inspection. The licensee stated that
he failed to add them to the inventory. Additionally, the current number of sheep and goats on hand are less than
those on facility records. The licensee stated that he sold animals in fall 2014 at an auction but had no records of
disposition for these sales. Accurate animal records regarding births, deaths, acquisition and disposition are used
to help evaluate the facility(cid:25)s animal care program and for animal tracking. Every exhibitor must make, keep and
maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals purchased,
acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise
disposed of by that exhibitor, including any offspring born of any animals while in his or her possession or under his
control. Forms 7019 and 7020 (although not required) were reviewed and discussed as one option to assist the
facility to correct this concern. From this day forward correct by maintaining accurate records regarding the correct
number of animals on hand at the facility, and all new births, acquisitions, deaths and sales. Additionally correct by
reconstructing, as much as possible, the missing records by June 1, 2015.** Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
