3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several enclosures were constructed with chain-link or hog panel type material. In several areas there is moderate
to excessive amounts of rust on these surfaces. Surfaces with rust cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. The
Licensee must resurface, replace or repair all areas with rust.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Licensee does not have an acclimation plan approved by the attending veterinarian. There are two areas of outdoor
housing that contain short-haired large breed dogs (Boxers and Rottweilers). These animals do not have access to
an inside area which provides for temperature control and the only shelter present is structures made of plastic
barrels. Animals that are not acclimated to the weather and extreme temperatures can experience stress and
discomfort. An acclimation statement signed by the attending veterinarian is required to maintain breeds of dogs
that cannot tolerate the prevalent temperatures of the area without discomfort in outdoor kennels. This includes (but
is not limited to) short-haired breeds of dogs in cold climates, aged dogs, or dogs of unknown acclimation status.
The Licensee must establish and maintain an acclimation plan that has been approved by the attending veterinarian
for all animals housed in outdoor housing area and do not have access to an inside area.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Licensee provides the dogs with a very small amount of sawdust bedding. In the majority of shelters there was not
enough bedding to allow the dogs to nestle in the bedding. The Licensee stated, on the phone on 12/18/2014, that
some of the dogs will get in the barrel together to try to keep warm. Accuweather states that the temperature for theSugarcreek area on 12/17/2014 was between 42 degrees for the high and 29 degrees for the low on this day. The
temperatures continued to drop for the rest of the week leading into the weekend. The rest of this week(cid:25)s average
highs were mid to low forties and the low temperatures for the rest of the week were mid to low twenties. Given this
point in the season, it is expected to become colder and below freezing as the winter months continue. These dogs
will continue to be at risk for cold stress as the weather continues to get colder. Not providing the dogs with a
sufficient amount of bedding exposes the dogs to the unnecessarily cold temperatures and can lead to discomfort
and possibly predispose animals to the development of disease. The Licensee must ensure that each shelter
structure is provided with an adequate amount of clean, dry bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50
degrees. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees or lower.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On 1/3/2014, the Licensee was cited for three adult Rottweiler(cid:25)s that are housed in the upper outdoor housing
facility without large enough shelters.
During today(cid:25)s inspection, 12/17/2014, all dogs that were housed in the upper and lower outdoor housing facilities
have shelters that are not large enough for the Rottweiler or Boxer dogs that are housed in these enclosures. The
Licensee is continuing to use plastic barrels that do not allow these dogs to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner
and to turn about freely while in these shelters. The Inspector observed one of the larger Rottweiler(cid:25)s in the lower
outside facility struggling to get out of the barrel. The square hole cut into the entrance of the barrel was too small
to allow the dog to get out of the shelter without having to struggle. All shelters in outdoor facilities must contain a
roof, four sides, and a floor. In addition, the shelter must be large enough to allow each dog, at one time, to sit,
stand, and lie in a normal manner and to turn about freely.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Several of the primary enclosures are constructed with wood beams or framing. The Licensee(cid:25)s son was able to
show inspector the sealer container located on a beam above the dogs enclosure in the lower area of the outside
enclosure. Although the material was available and in the kennel, the Inspector was informed by the Licensee andLicensee(cid:25)s son that these surfaces have not been sealed in at least two years. Surfaces that are not properly
sealed/painted on a regular basis do not maintain the surface impervious to moisture and can absorb water, urine
and other liquids. The Licensee must ensure that all surfaces that come in contact with the dogs are impervious to
moisture. In addition, the Licensee must ensure that a maintenance plan for the facility is established and
maintained, to include the sealing/painting of all surfaces within primary enclosures to ensure they are impervious to
moisture at all times.

3.6(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Several of the primary enclosures are constructed with wood beams or framing. There are several areas where the
dogs have chewed on the wood.
Plastic barrels are currently being used as shelter structures for the outdoor housing areas. All of the structures
have chew damage around the rims of the barrel. There are several barrels that have a moderate to excessive
amount of brown to black matter adhered to the areas of chew damage consistent with dust, dirt, feces and other
organic material.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained such that all surfaces in contact with the dogs are readily
able to be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with section 3.11(b). Surfaces with chew damage cannot be
properly cleaned and sanitized. The Licensee must replace, repair or resurface all areas where chew damage is
present.

3.11(b)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outside housing areas are primarily constructed of wood, chain-link and hog panel type materials with concrete
flooring. Several areas of these surfaces have a moderate to heavy accumulations of dust, dirt, debris, food waste,
excreta and other disease hazards. In addition, the Licensee(cid:25)s son informed inspectors that they currently use cold
water for washing the facility. He also informed inspectors that they clean the enclosures less often during the
winter due to the cold weather. All excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures at least daily
and the enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to minimize odors and disease hazards.
Although these areas are considered outdoor housing, these enclosures must be able to maintain proper cleaning
standards even in extreme weather conditions. The Licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces (such as the concrete flooring and chain-link) are cleaned and
sanitized in accordance with one of the following methods listed in 3.11(b)(3) including spot cleaning daily and
washing hard surfaces with appropriate detergent solution to remove all organic material followed by application of
an appropriate disinfect. In cold weather it is important that particular care be taken after washing to ensure that all
enclosures are dried thoroughly to prevent dogs from becoming wet.
