FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two separate areas of missing, splintered wood were observed on the interior wall in one outdoor sheltered
building. Twenty three goats and two sheep are in contact with the affected area. Deterioration of wood surfaces
can affect the structural integrity of the enclosure. Splintered wood could cause possibly injury if accidentally
ingested. The licensee must ensure that outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. Correct by 2/7/17.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* The area surrounding the food receptacle is covered with mud and standing water. Three hoof stock are in
contact with the affected area located in outdoor housing. These animals cannot approach the food receptacle
without walking through the mud and standing water. Standing water and mud can attract pests, lead to hoof or foot
problems and increase the risks of disease transmission and create a reluctance to enter the feed area. The
licensee must provide a suitable method for the rapid elimination of excess water. The method of drainage shall
comply with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of
the environment. Correct by 2/7/17.

* An estimated one foot section of plastic has become detached from the food receptacle and is extending
upwards towards the animals. The receptacle used by three hoof stock animals is located in outdoor housing. A
rough, jagged surface cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized. It could harbor bacteria and other disease causing
agents that could negatively impact the health of the animals. In addition, the section of plastic extending upwards
could cause injury. The licensee must ensure that all receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times.
