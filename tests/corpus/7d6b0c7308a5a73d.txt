2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12pm-1pm on
16-AUG-17.
The inspector was able to get in contact with the Licensee by phone. The Licensee confirmed that she was not
available at that time but she thought that she may be available within 30 minutes and would call the inspector back
to confirm. The inspector waited in the driveway of the facility from 12pm-1pm. During that time, no one came
home for inspection and the inspector did not receive a return call from the Licensee.
