Primary enclosures.
The facility houses nearly all dogs over 12 weeks of age on a slatted floor. This flooring is a heavy gauge rubber or
plastic-coated metal flooring with rectangular openings that are approximately ½ inch by 2.5 inches. This flooring has
been identified on previous inspections to be dangerous because dogs have been found by inspectors with feet / toes
stuck in the flooring.
*** On this inspection a total of 2 dogs were found actively stuck in the flooring to the point that the facility representatives
had to remove one of them from the flooring.
- In Building G1, Room 6, an adult beagle, CHLCSB, was found with his right rear foot trapped in an opening in the slatted
floor. He was quickly and easily removed by staff after being found.
- In Building G1, Room 10, an adult beagle, CHICDM, was found with her right rear foot trapped in an opening in the
slatted floor. She required a couple minutes of manipulation before her foot was freed by facility representatives. The dog
remained calm during manipulation to free the foot. After being freed from the floor and relocated to different flooring, she
was observed and displayed no signs of lameness or pain.
Openings in the floor that are large enough to allow the feet and legs to pass through can lead to entrapment of a dog
which can be painful, distressful, and may result in serious injury to the animal.


Primary enclosures for dogs must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs’ feet and legs from
injury. When floors are of mesh or slatted construction, they must not allow the dogs’ feet to pass through any openings in
the floor. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that eliminates the risk of entrapment and injury and ensures no
feet or legs can pass through the floor openings. The licensee must ensure that all flooring is safe for the dogs at all times
in order to support their health and well-being.
