2.4(d)
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
After completing the review of the inspection report, the licensee and inspectors began to speak about protective
guards for heat lamps in the whelping areas. The licensee stopped this conversation and then said I want to show
you what happens when you walk through the whelping area. He reached back into a cabinet located next to him
and pulled out an object that he threw across the table at the inspectors. One inspector reacted by raising her
hands and the object bounced off her hands and into her lap. The object was a quart-sized clear plastic bag
containing two deceased puppies. The puppies were both large enough to occupy the majority of the space in the
bag. The supervisor stated that it was unacceptable to throw things at inspectors and that the AC personnel would
be leaving. As they walked out the door, the supervisor reiterated to the licensee that harassment, verbal abuse and
other acts of intimidation by the licensee or his representatives were not compliant with the regulations and would
not be tolerated.
Interfering with the inspection process prevents the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal
Welfare Act. The licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, verbally abuse or harass any APHIS official in the
course of carrying out his or her duties.
To be corrected immediately this day forward.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-In the (cid:28)"Brick Building"(cid:29) a female King Charles Cavalier (ID #38) had blood on the last part of her tail. Closer
observation of her tail revealed a small approximately one quarter inch abrasion on the skin with fresh blood on it
and on the surrounding hair. The abrasion also has a black crust on the surface of it. Closer towards the animal(cid:25)'s
body on the tail was another small circular area of hair loss. The veterinarian and the facility representative
indicated that they had no prior medical documentation regarding this problem.
-In the (cid:28)"Basement Building"(cid:29) a female Shiba Inu (ID#041-515-020) was intermittently non-weight bearing on the left
hind leg. Once the inspectors notified the facility representatives of their concerns, the attending veterinarian, who
was present during the inspection, examined the dog. He stated the dog had a (cid:28)loose knee(cid:29). The veterinarian andthe facility representative indicated that they had no prior medical documentation regarding this problem.
Abrasions and leg problems could cause pain and discomfort as well as lead to further health complications. The
King Charles Cavalier must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The
diagnosis and treatment plan for both the King Charles Cavalier and the Shiba Inu must be documented and
available to the inspector upon request.
-In the "(cid:28)Brick Building"(cid:29) a female Shiba Inu (ID #45/0C00021664) that has excessively long toe nails. On the right
front foot the toenail on the fourth toe has grown across the toenail of the third toe. In the (cid:28)"Basement Building"(cid:29) a
male Yellow Labrador with excessively long toenails. On the left hind foot the two inside toenails have become so
long they are extended and lay sideways when the dog places his foot on the floor. Overgrown toenails can cause
pain and discomfort to the dogs. The licensee must trim the nails of these dogs to an appropriate length. The
licensee must develop an effective plan to maintain the toenails of all dogs.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple areas were present in the facility where surfaces needed maintenance:
-In the (cid:28)"Bulldog Building"(cid:29) at least six enclosures, housing at least ten dogs, have wood framing the walls and/or
wooden posts in the center of them. The sections of wood framing along the floor have been excessively chewed
and scratched by the dogs. The lower half of the wooden posts have been chewed and shredded by the dogs.
-In the same building, there are at least ten enclosures, housing at least twelve dogs, which contain blue plastic
feeders that are used as chew toys. These feeders have been excessively chewed and scratched by the dogs.
The chewed and scratched areas are rough and brownish in color. The chewing and scratching damage does not
allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the wooden frames, posts and plastic feeders. This could increase the
potential disease or health risks towards the dogs.
-An enclosure in the (cid:28)"Bulldog Building(cid:29)" containing two poodles has flooring with broken wires creating an opening
and sharp points.
-At least three enclosures housing dogs in the (cid:28)"Brick Building"(cid:29) have areas where the wire floor is rusty, bent and or
broken creating sharp points the dogs.
-The enclosure containing two Shar-pei mix dogs has rusty and broken wire flooring along the top of the wooden
floor support beam near the center. At least one screw is sticking out of the wooden floor support beam
approximately one half inch from where the wire flooring is broken. The small screw that was fastening the wire floor
to the wooden support is creating a sharp point the dogs can come in contact with.
-The enclosure that is housing a Pomeranian and a poodle has wire flooring on the back side that is bent and
creating a sharp point approximately 3/4" inch long that the dogs can come in contact with.
-An enclosure containing two poodles has broken wire flooring along the top of the wooden support beam on theright side. There are at least two sharp wire points bent up on the flooring that the dogs can come in contact with.
-The fourth enclosure from the left on the east side containing two white poodles has wire flooring that is broken
along the top of the wooden support beam. At least 10 sharp points are present that the dogs can come in contact
with. Facility employees started overlaying the affected areas with new flooring material at the time of inspection.
The sharp points could potentially injure the dogs and the rusty surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace, repair, or alter the
wooden posts, frames and plastic feeders in a manner that allows them to be cleaned and sanitized. The licensee
must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are maintained in good repair at all times.
