ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are three adult Schnauzers with excessive mats covering 60-70 % of their body. A white Schnauzer,
identification number, 145271146A, a black Schnauzer, identification number, 4C182A340D, and a Greyish/white
Schnauzer, identification number, 4C17786425. These dogs were matted around the head and face, limbs, back,
and hindquarters. The hair was heavily twisted; the skin could not be visualized in some areas. The matted hair
was soiled and wet, and had debris intertwined with the hair. Excessive matting can cause pain and discomfort to
the animal. In addition, matting can foster skin infections and can hinder the animal s ability to move or defecate
normally. The licensee needs to remove the matted hair and or/groom these dogs. As part of the facility's program
of veterinary care, the licensee must establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all the dogs to
prevent the development of excessive matting. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times. Correct by 09-10-2014.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility owner.
