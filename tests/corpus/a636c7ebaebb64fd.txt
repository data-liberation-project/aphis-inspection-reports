ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 on
23-Mar-17.
Upon arrival I spoke with the licensee who was out of the area and could not return in a reasonable amount of time
for the inspection process. Future hours of operation were discussed.
