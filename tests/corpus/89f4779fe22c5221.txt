An English Bulldog, microchip number 0A0234510, was observed with a protrusion of tissue from the medial corner
of the right eye. This protrusion was approximately one quarter inch in diameter and reddened. Crusty tannish
material clung to the lashes and lids of this eye. The left eye had an accumulation of greenish material covering
approximately half of the area of the cornea. The owner stated this dog had undergone entropion surgery on both
eyes during March with the protrusion of tissue appearing within the last couple of weeks. She stated she had not
been in contact with a licensed veterinarian regarding this condition recently but she was cleaning the eyes
regularly. This protrusion of tissue may cause severe discomfort and stress to this dog as well as increased risks of
infection. A licensed veterinarian must be consulted for an evaluation of this condition. Documentation must be
maintained to outline the treatment program approved by the veterinarian.
An English Bulldog, microchip number 0A01776968, was observed with feet with thickened, reddened skin. The
pad circumference of the feet appear to be at least 50 greater than normal. The skin is reddened around the toes
and extending upwards the leg a short distance. On the left front foot an opening in the skin surface was located
the first and second digits from the outside. The hair in these areas in thinned. The bottom of the feet have been
significantly affected with individual toe pads not readily identifiable due to the thickening and swelling of the tissues.
No apparent lameness or distress was observed during this inspection. The owner stated the attending
veterinarian had examined this dog on June 19, 2015. This condition at that time was identified as a (cid:28)foot infection(cid:29)
with a treatment program of antibiotics prescribed. The owner stated she had followed with a 10 day treatment
program of penicillin. At this time, approximately 4 weeks since the last treatment, the owner states that there has
not been a great improvement in this condition. No further communication with a licensed veterinarian has taken
place since regarding this dog. This condition may cause extreme discomfort and stress to this dog as well as
risking the health and well being of animal. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for further
diagnoses and prognosis. Documentation must be maintained for review by the inspector of findings and treatment
programs.
