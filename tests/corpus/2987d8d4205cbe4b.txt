ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00pm on
05-JUL-18. The facility representative present at the site stated there was no responsible adult available with
adequate knowledge and access to the pertinent details for inspection. Hours of availability were discussed.
Lack of availability and access prevents the regulatory process from functioning. Correct by ensuring a
knowledgeable facility representative is available during normal business hours. Correct from this time forward.
