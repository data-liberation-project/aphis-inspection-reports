2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
* A researcher self-reported to the IACUC that an off-study drug was administered to five animals. There were no ill
effects to the animals. The drug's use had been included on the previously approved study, but not on the renewal.
Research activities must exactly follow approved protocols for the welfare of the animals and the integrity of the
science. This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by approving an amendment to the protocol.
* Two monkeys with head caps were reported by veterinary care staff to have them cleaned monthly. The margins
are clean and without evidence of discharge or discoloration. The IACUC-approved protocol states that head caps
are to be cleaned weekly. There is no part of the protocol addressing care when there is no activity using the posts
or chambers, as is the current situation. Care of research-related implants may be different for active versus inactive
status, but the difference must be addressed in the approved protocol. Correction: the IACUC is set to meet the
week following the inspection, where correction will be addressed.
2.32(a) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
* Two animals were found unresponsive on first check one morning. One animal responded to treatment, the
second did not and was euthanized. Review found that previously drawn-up evening insulin doses for these animals
were dropped and contaminated, and so were replaced by the administering tech. TB syringes were accidentally
used instead of insulin syringes, so the dose was wrong resulting in the complication.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by retraining the employee.
3.75(a) CRITICAL
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A baboon was found to have a fractured hand. It was treated and healed without complication. Upon review of the
injury and the facility, it was determined that the animal had likely been injured by the heavy guillotine door.
Housing facilities must be safe and secure to minimize the chance of injury. Correction was made prior to the time
of inspection by modifying the doors to positively lock in the open or closed position.3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Catch areas of the corrals have excess cobwebs and dust above the secondary containment mesh, and the exhaust
fans are excessively dusty. Room 4 in quarantine North Annex has cobwebs in the vent. Colony runs 1 and 6 have
dirty air vent covers. ASA rooms have dust patterns on the ceiling around the air vents. Keeping the animal areas
clean is important to the health of the animals. Accumulation of cobwebs around electrical fixtures can be a fire
hazard. Correct by March 1, 2017.
This February 14-16, 2017 inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
