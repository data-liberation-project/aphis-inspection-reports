HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- There was standing water and a large amount of waste and old food in a drainage ditch along one entire exterior
side of the primate medical building. The standing water is a result of the waste removed from the inside portion of
their enclosures. There are drain pipes from the indoor portion of the enclosures that drain into an approximately 2
foot wide area directly behind the medical building. The primate shift area is directly above this drainage area, and
the outside portion of this primate enclosure is adjacent to this standing water. This is essentially an open sewer,
and is present due to facility employees not maintaining this drainage ditch in a proper manner. Improper drainage
systems and standing water where the animals are contained may result in noxious odors, spreading of diseases,
insect infestation and other health hazards. All pens housing animals must have an adequate drainage system that
is able to eliminate standing water and waste more rapidly for the overall health of the animals.
Corrected during inspection.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor enclosure housing a single spider monkey "Ricky" the metal roof surface had an area of rust which
had worn through the surface and created a hole with sharp edges This area had been patched with two pieces of
sheet metal which were loosely attached creating gaps and exposed sharp edges. This creates a risk of entrapment
for the enclosed animal, as well as a risk of injury from the sharp edges. The facility must repair or replace this
section, and must maintain metal surfaces throughout the facility to protect the welfare of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- Numerous wasps were observed on a large nest located on the inside roof supports in a Non Human primate
enclosure housing "Ruthie" and "Lucy". The nest was directly over a perch area, and insects were also flying in andaround the enclosure. Wasps can sting and cause injury to the enclosed animals. They can also contaminate food,
water and living areas. Facility must remove this nest, and must ensure proper pest control throughout the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the rear of the park, an enclosure containing 4 wolves has a grate floor that is exposed along three of the sides.
This exposed grate flooring has large 4 inch holes that create a possible injury threat to the enclosed animals.
Licensee needs to remove the grating or replace dirt on top of the grate to ensure the animals are safely contained
and protected from potential injury.
- In a pen in the rear of tha park containing tigers there is an area in the lower hinge side of the holding pen gate
that has rusted through. Facilities need to be maintained in good repair. Licensee must repair or replace this gate.
- In the rear of the park in the fence panel between cages 120 and 125 there is a pole that has significant rust
present, to a degree that may affect the structural strength of the pole. Licensee needs to repair or replace this pole
to ensure the animals are safely contained and protected from potential injury.

WATERING.
- The grizzly bear enclosure contained no water. There were no drinking water receptacles present in the enclosure
and the play water receptacles were empty. The licensee stated that the clips on the drinking water receptacles
were being replaced and that the containers had been removed from the enclosure around 9 am. It was around
noon and the temperature was around 82 degrees. All three grizzly bears were panting. The licensee turned on the
water hose and two of the bear drank aggressively from the water hose. The licensee brought in two small water
receptacles. Licensee was instructed that due to the size and type of animals present those were too small and
would not hold enough water for grizzly bears on high temperature days. Water must be supplied to the enclosed
animals as often necessary for the health and comfort of the species of enclosed animals.3.131(d)
SANITATION.
- A tiger enclosure in the back portion of the park contained rancid meat on the floor of enclosure. At least one piece
of the meat was covered with numerous maggots. Food not consumed must be removed from primary enclosures
as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards
and to reduce odors.
- There was a large piece of meat draped over the enclosure fence in a tiger enclosure in the front part of the park
and a piece of old meat trapped in the feed chute in a tiger enclosure that was next to the camel enclosure. Food
not consumed must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
- Numerous ants were observed on the pipe supports and in the feed chute in the large tiger arena enclosure. There
was a piece of rancid meat stuck in the feed chute that was infested with ants. Ants can sting and cause injury to
the enclosed animal. They can also contaminate food,water and living areas.
