PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The Eastern black and white colobus monkey outdoor enclosure has multiple wooden boards that are not in good
repair. The enclosure has wooden boards lining the interior sides of the bottom portion of the outdoor enclosure.
These boards come into direct contact with the 3 colobus monkeys inside the enclosure. Multiple boards have
varying degrees of deterioration that consist of large splits in the wood, warped areas, and spaces in the planks
where the wood had completely worn away. One plank had a section of deterioration that was approximately 4
inches at its widest point and ran in length approximately 1 foot. The deterioration of the wood not only affects the
structure of the surface but also does not allow the surface to be readily cleaned or sanitized. Additionally, small
wood pieces that break off can cause injury to an animal if eaten. Correct by maintaining the surfaces of the primary
enclosure so they are kept in good repair. Correct by: 11/13/2014

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two off exhibit enclosures used to house two Przewalski(cid:25)s horses nightly and during daily cleaning of the
exhibit. These enclosures are primarily constructed of wooden walls and cement floors. There are several areas
with different stages of deteriorating wood where the walls meet the floor of the enclosure in both rooms. This issue
was identified by the facility prior to the inspection, however; the facility was not able to determine an appropriate
timeline for corrective action for the issue at the time of inspection. While it is admirable that the facility was able to
self-identify the issue, actions were not taken to correct the issue. Deteriorating or worn wood is not able to be
cleaned and sanitized and can harbor harmful pathogens. All surfaces, within the primary enclosure, with
deteriorating wood or surfaces must be replaced, repaired or resurfaced when it becomes in disrepair. Correct by:
