2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A white adult female guinea pig in Pen 19 was observed with
lameness in the rear legs. The animal was unable to support its weight in the back end and walked by pulling itself with
the front legs. The rear legs were stiff and there was no withdrawal response when the toes were pinched. The licensee
stated she had observed the guinea pig in this condition 2 days ago but had not contacted the attending veterinarian and
was not administering any treatment. The attending veterinarian was contacted and stated the facility should have
contacted her about the health condition of this guinea pig.
Lameness with inability to walk using the rear legs can cause pain and distress and make it difficult to access food and
water.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

There were several wall panels near the door that were broken and the underlying insulation was exposed in some areas.
Broken wall panels with exposed insulation cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized.
Interior building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture and can be easily
sanitized.
