Watering.
The water trough in the goat, alpaca, and sheep enclosure is mostly frozen and has an accumulation of bird feces on top
and within the ice around the perimeter. The available water appears cloudy with pieces of feed and other foreign
material. The water trough in the goat enclosure near the nature path has a similar appearance with an accumulation of
ice and bird feces amongst cloudy water. Failure to clean water containers and provide potable water can lead to the
spread of disease and create a reluctance to drink. The water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to ensure the
health and well-being of the animals.
