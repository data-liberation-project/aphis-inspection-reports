3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a lack of perimeter fencing completely surrounding 3 of the enclosures at the facility.
•(cid:9)On the north side of the camel enclosure there is approximately 8 foot of perimeter fence lacking on one side of
the shelter and 30 foot on the other side. Also, on the west side of the enclosure there is about 30 foot of perimeter
fence missing.
•(cid:9)There is no perimeter fence on the north and west sides of an enclosure housing a capybara, Patagonian cavy’s,
and a red kangaroo.
•(cid:9)There is no perimeter fence on the west side of an enclosure housing a wallaby.
Lack of perimeter fence does not protect the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons
from having contact with the animals. Also, without a complete perimeter fence there is not a sufficient secondary
containment system.
A complete perimeter fence must be constructed for these 3 enclosure to keep unauthorized people and unwanted
animals from coming in contact with the animals at the facility. Also, to provide a secondary containment system in
the event of an animal escape.
