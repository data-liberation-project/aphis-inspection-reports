2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are multiple errors in the record keeping in regards to the Acquisition and Disposition paperwork kept by the
licensee. There are 4 ID numbers on adult dogs that are missing on the 7005 paperwork for the inventory, several
puppy records are incomplete without puppy ID numbers or with the date of sale information. Multiple Disposition
records are missing the Transporter information for all puppies sent by air to the buyer. While there are records
being kept, they are incomplete and disorganized and do not allow for proper traceability.
Organized and complete records are necessary for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must keep complete records with adult and puppy ID numbers, dates of sale on both 7005 and puppy
records. Complete Acquisition(7005) forms and complete Disposition (7006) forms, including all transporter
information must be recorded properly.
