2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A goat (ear tag #0064; named Ernie) was observed to have hair loss covering its back. Parts of the back had flaky skin.
In addition, I observed the goat itching itself. The licensee had observed the condition, but had not contacted the
Attending Veterinarian to initiate treatment.

Hair loss during the winter months can prevent the goat from being able to regulate its body temperature when it gets
really cold outside which could result in the death of the animal. In addition, the goat may have a condition that is
contagious to other animals.

The Attending Veterinarian must be contacted and the goat must be treated per his/her instructions.

Note: The Attending Veterinarian has been contacted and the goat is being treated per his/her instructions.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.


All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 10th, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
