3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The end on five enclosures had excessively soiled bedding due to what the facility reports are poorly adjusted water
sipper valves on those five enclosures. Guinea pigs in these enclosures have to stand on wet soiled bedding to eat
or drink. A build up of wet and soiled areas in the enclosures increases the risk for sickness and increases odors in
the building. To promote animal health; spot clean soiled areas more often and ensure proper water valve
adjustments so that guinea pigs have dry access to feed and water at all times.
Correct by 4/29/17.
