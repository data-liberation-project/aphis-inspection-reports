3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There are some areas in need of repair:
Cow Pen:
-Some loose bird netting is on the ground where animals could access it.
-A fallen panel gate is inside the cow pen.
-There is some loose chicken wire between the two shelters in the cow pen.
Fallow Deer Pen:
-The dividing fence has loose wire and points that deer can access.
-The lean-to shelter has some damaged tin with rough edges that the deer could touch.
Loose netting, wire, and rough tin could possible hurt the animals inside the pen. Ensure that the enclosures (pens) are
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to safely contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
