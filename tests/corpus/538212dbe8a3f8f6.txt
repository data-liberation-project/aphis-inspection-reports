2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female tri-colored Beagle (#0A01233177) and a male tri-colored Beagle (#145357586A) both have excessively
long toe nails. Some of the toe nails are laying sideways when the dogs are in a normal standing position.
Long toe nails can be painful and cause discomfort when a dog is trying to walk. The potential for injury exists if a
toe nail becomes caught in the plastic flooring. The licensee must ensure that toe nails are trimmed on a regular
basis.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Heather Cole, VMO and Corbin Ranslem, ACI.
