2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An approximately 2-year-old male Shih Tzu x Poodle, “George”, (Microchip # 93202000580029) was seen acting normally
in his enclosure, however, the inspector saw his left eye completely covered with matted hair. On closer inspection of the
eye the matted hair was mainly the hair above the eye hanging down so you couldn’t see the eye. The mat had brown
crusty material in it with some crusty material on the inner corner of the eye as well. There was also a small amount of
greenish discharge seen on the surface and the corner of the eye. The eye itself looked bright red. The licensee stated
that she was not aware of this dog’s condition. Once made aware of this dog’s condition the licensee, following their
Program of Veterinarian Care, shaved the mat and treated the eye for the time being. This dog’s matted hair around the
eye, crusty material and discharge from the eye could be due to a variety of veterinary medical conditions which may lead
to pain and/or discomfort. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian regarding this dog’s condition in order to
determine an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan which must be followed and documented. The licensee must
ensure that adequate daily observations are performed to assess the health and well-being of all animals. A mechanism
of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,
behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment
can be determined.
