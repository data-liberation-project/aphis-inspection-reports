3.1(a) Critical

Housing facilities, general.
Three wolf/dog hybrids escaped under their enclosure fence, and a small dog was killed during that time. The incident
occurred on 10/19/2021. According to the licensee, the three animals were quickly recalled back to the facility and placed
in a secure enclosure. During the escape, however, the 5-year-old female wolf/dog hybrid named “Celine” killed a small
dog. Due to the local animal control regulations, the facility elected to euthanize that animal.

Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in
good repair, protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. Such
measures assist in preventing possible escape and injury, thus safeguarding their welfare.

To be corrected: from this time forward.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by September 25, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license


fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
