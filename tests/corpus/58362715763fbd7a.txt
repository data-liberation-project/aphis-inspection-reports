2.126(a) Critical Repeat

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
USDA personnel arrived at the licensee’s property at 5:15PM and contacted the licensee by phone. The licensee initially
stated that he was out of the state but that his neighbor would be available in 20 minutes to accompany the inspector on
an inspection. Then the licensee stated that he would no longer allow photographs to be taken on the property and
accused the inspector of being “a problem”. The inspector tried to explain how and when photographs are taken during
the inspection but the licensee became increasingly irate. The licensee stated that he had called his neighbor and told her
not accompany the inspector on an inspection after all. The inspector asked if the licensee was refusing to allow an
inspection today and he replied, “You’re dang right.” The licensee then hung up the phone on the inspector.
Unannounced inspections by USDA personnel are essential for ensuring compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct from this day forth by allowing USDA officials to conduct inspections of animals, facilities, and records without
threats, harassment, or abuse.

This conversation occurred via phone with the licensee while parked in the licensee's driveway.
