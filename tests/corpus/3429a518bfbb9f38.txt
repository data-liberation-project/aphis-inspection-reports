FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Metal structures in two enclosures were in disrepair. In one fox den a metal door, it's track, and a metal cage
containing a heat lamp were rusted. The door also appeared to have paint chipping from the surface. The door into
a raccoon den also appeared to be rusted with areas of chipped paint.
Failure to maintain metal surfaces could lead to more extensive rust damage and the eventual compromise of the
structural integrity of the item. Rusted and chipped surfaces are also difficult clean. The facility should ensure that
defects in animal enclosures are identified and repaired in a timely manner.
