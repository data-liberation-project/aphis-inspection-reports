OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements. (4)
***There were at least three outdoor enclosures housing adult dogs (Pomeranians, Boston Terriers, Golden
Retrievers and a Poodle) with shelters that did not contain adequate bedding. According to the National Weather
Service, the air temperature for the area at the time of inspection (approximately 11:00am) was 40 degrees F.
There was only a minimal amount of bedding material inside the shelters. Some of the shelters had most of the
floor exposed while others had a thin layer of bedding that was fairly evenly distributed on the floor with parts of the
floor easily seen. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing a sufficient source to keep them warm increases
the risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must contain clean, dry,
bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is
required when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower. To be corrected by: immediately on January 26,
2015 and from this point forward.
Note: facility representatives provided bedding to these enclosures during the inspection.
The inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The exit interview was conducted with a facility
representative on January 26, 2015 during which the correction date was discussed.
