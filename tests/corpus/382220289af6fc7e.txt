2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
* An enclosure housing five goats had two unlocked gates entering into the enclosure. There was a coin operated
feeder inside the enclosure. The public was observed going into the enclosure to feed and pet the goats. However,
there was no attendant available in the area when this took place for the monitoring and handling of the animals.
This can increase the risk of harm for the animals and the public.
* Four enclosures did not have an attendant to observe the animals and public or public barrier fence. These
enclosures were: an enclosure housing three llamas, seven goats, one sheep; an enclosure housing 10 rabbits; an
enclosure housing three pigs and an enclosure housing five pigs. The risk of harm to the animals and public is
potentially possible.
Public exhibition of animals or animals the public comes into contact with must be handled so there is minimal risk
of harm to the animals and the public. This will ensure the safety of the animals and the public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The enclosure housing 10 rabbits had chicken wire attached to a wood fence for the primary fencing and around
the bottom of a large tree. In areas, the chicken wire was not securely fasten to the wood fence and was bowing
outward along the bottom. Along the bottom of the large tree the wire was not secure and exposed on the ground
around the tree. These areas had several points protruding into the enclosure at head and eye level of the rabbits
that could cause potential injury. The rabbits could get a foot stuck in the chicken wire covering the ground around
the tree causing injury.
All rabbit enclosures must be maintained and kept structurally sound. This will prevent injury to the animals. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).
This inspection will be sent by both regular and certified mail.
