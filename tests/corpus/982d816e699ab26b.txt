Facilities, outdoor.
The dolphin pools, housing 4 adult male dolphins, do not provide enough shade. The dolphin pools consist of a larger,
irregularly shaped exhibit pool connected by 2 channels to a smaller round off-exhibit pool. When the sun is high, the only
shade available to the animals is a few small shadows along some of the walls of the pools. Previous overhead shade
structures were damaged by storms and were removed. According to facility personnel, portable umbrellas are used
intermittently to protect animals from looking into the sun during training sessions or public encounters. These umbrellas
were not in use during public encounters observed at approximately 2:30PM on 4/13/22, at which time the weather was
bright and sunny.
Shade is important for protecting marine mammals from sun exposure which can lead to discomfort and may contribute to
the development of eye problems.
Correct by providing protection from direct sunlight for the dolphins as appropriate for local climatic conditions. Temporary
correction due by 5/1/22, permanent correction due by 9/1/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian and facility personnel.
