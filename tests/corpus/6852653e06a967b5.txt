3.13

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee does not have a program of veterinary care that includes the requirements in section 3.13. There is no
record of a physical exam by the attending veterinarian (AV), there is no schedule for heartworm testing, fecal testing, and
physical exam by the breeder to include skin, coat, eyes, ears, toenail trims, and teeth. There are no medical records
being kept for the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian.

Ensure that the attending veterinarian completes a program of veterinary care that includes all requirements in section
3.13. Medical records must be kept on all dogs to include vaccination, testing and results, grooming, toenail trims, and
exam findings by the breeder.
