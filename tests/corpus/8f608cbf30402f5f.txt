3.75(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Zoo officials notified the USDA that a male white cheeked gibbon escaped his enclosure a few weeks ago. The
escape occurred at a location on the top of the enclosure where sections of fencing overlap. This animal was also
involved in an escape from the same location in this enclosure in 2014 . He never left the top of the enclosure and
was safely darted and returned to the exhibit. Repairs have been made to the top of the enclosure and a plan is now
in placed to monitor the area until new fencing can be installed.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals securely.
