Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Elsa, a Maltese, with microchip # 95600005212919 born on 11/14/14 was found to have very heavy light to dark brown
buildup which covered the entire surface of most teeth. It covered the teeth on both the right and left upper check teeth as
well as the right and left bottom check teeth. Her gums were also red and inflamed on both sides. The licensee noted that
other than the yearly vet checks she does not have a preventative checking or observation system herself. Elsa’s dental
condition had not been noticed by the licensee and her PVC had not instructed her on dental care. Dental issues that are
not properly taken care of can lead to pain, distress, illness, and disease. The licensee must ensure that this dog be
evaluated by their Attending Veterinarian to develop and follow a treatment plan. The licensee should also add to their
Program of Veterinary Care a written dental plan of preventative care and treatment that is appropriate and effective in
maintaining clean and healthy teeth.

Sheltered housing facilities.
In the outdoor portion of each enclosure housing adults and puppies at the facility there were areas of wood where paint
had been chipped away in large excesses. Wood that is not painted or treated to be impervious to moisture cannot be
properly cleaned or sanitized. Such wood can soak up urine, feces, leading to bacteria and disease. All surfaces in

sheltered facilities that are in contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture.
