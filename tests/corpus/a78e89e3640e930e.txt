3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
In the dog breeding building, the gate latch for one of the outdoor runs is broken. The gate is being secured by a rope,
which allows for a two inch gap between the fencing when the dogs push on the gate. In one indoor enclosure housing
three dogs, a piece of wire that is used to secure the wall panels, is projecting into the enclosure.
Facilities that are not maintained in good repair can allow for entrapment, escape, or injury of the animals.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them securely.
Ensure that the gap in the outdoor area is closed and that the sharp points are eliminated.
