2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
During the inspection, an adult, visitor was observed reaching over the enclosure fence and petting the capybara without
an attendant present. The presence of employees or attendants during public contact helps to ensure animals are
appropriately handled for the safety of the animals and the public. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable
employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.
Correct from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
