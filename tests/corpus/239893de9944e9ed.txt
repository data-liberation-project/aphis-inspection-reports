FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On inspection, one metal chain-link guillotine door in the enclosure of three adult leopards used to permit access to
others sections of the enclosure was determined to be in disrepair and does not protect the animals from potential
injury. The hand operated chain used to lower and raise the door broke a few days before. The licensee used an
unattached metal stake to wedge the door open. Since part of the metal stake is inside the enclosure, the leopards
could move the rod from placement. This is extremely dangerous if the stake becomes loose and dislodges. The
weight of the metal door could easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an animal. There is no
counterweight or secondary mechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force. Repair or replace the
guillotine door to secure the door from sliding down. Additionally, monitor all guillotine doors so the doors can be
operated that protects the animals from possible injuries.

The 2 in. by 1 in. wire enclosure fence for two adult tigers had a hole in the fence where three sharp wire ends
protrude inside the enclosure. According to the licensee, the hole was used as a place for a feeding tube to enter
into the enclosure, but the tube was removed after putting tigers inside this enclosure. Sharp points or jagged
edges could cause injury and pain to an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to break off and be eaten. All
housing surfaces of the facility must be free of all sharp points or edges, and monitor all wire fences to ensure loose
wires are removed and could not injury any animals.
