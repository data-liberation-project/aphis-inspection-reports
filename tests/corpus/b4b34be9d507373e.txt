3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
There is a long(approx 8ft) 3 piece PVC pipe perch at the food counter that is hanging at an almost verticle angle, due to
the brackets having broken. The slant of the perch area does not allow for the primates to perch or sit comfortably while
eating at the counter area. The primates must partially hang while eating.
The flap door located in the loft area has a moderate buildup of black/brown dirt and grime. The door surface is not being
cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent the buildup of grime.


The lack of a proper food station where the primates can eat without having to hang on the fence can be a possible
source of stress and discomfort. The broken shelf area could be a possible source of injury if the shelf broke and fell to
the floor while the animals were sitting on it. The buildup of dirt/grime on the surfaces of the flap door, walls and toys can
be a possible source of disease or other health issues.

All shelves and structures within the enclosure must be structually sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals
from injury or positional stress when trying to sit or eat. All surfaces should be cleaned often enough to prevent the
buildup of dirt/grime or replaced when worn/soiled.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The primary enclosure containing four spider monkeys is not removing old food waste or feces and urine on a daily basis.
While the licensee is cleaning the enclosure every other day, it is not being done on a daily basis per the regulations,
resulting in two days worth of food and fecal waste buildup. There were some wet monkey biskets on the floor that did
have some white mold on it due to the heat from the day before and on the date of inspection at tempeatures in the low
80's. There were two areas where urine was pooled on the floor and moderate amount of feces that had not been washed
out daily that had accumulated from the day before until the time of the inspection.

The buildup of food waste and excreta can be a possible source of disease or health issues if the primates eat
contaminated food or can not get away from odors, pests or other vermin.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily and as often as necessary to
prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates from becoming soiled,
and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
