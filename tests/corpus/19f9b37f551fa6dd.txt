FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sheep pen:
- A shade structure had approximately twelve metal, pole support stakes in the ground with sharp, pointed ends
which have become exposed from soil erosion in this pen. These sharp edges or points may cause injury to the
animals. Additionally, continued erosion of soil around support structures may reduce the structural strength and
stability and potentially cause animal injury.
-- A piece of metal wire with protruding, pointed ends was tied to a T-post and located in an area within contact of
the animals which may cause injury.
**This item was corrected during inspection by removing the wires.
All enclosures must be structurally sound, kept in good repair and free of sharp, protruding points or edges in order
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.
