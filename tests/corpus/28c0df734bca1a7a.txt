Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The skunk, named Stinker, had an area of hair loss approximately 6X9 cm in size and located at the base of its tail. The
skin in this area appeared to be thickened with a dry and flaky surface. The facility representative stated that they had not
consulted with a veterinarian regarding the animal’s condition prior to the inspection. Coat/hair loss can be caused by
problems such as, but not limited to trauma, parasites, stress, behavior, and other dermatologic medical issues. Failure to
observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a veterinarian can result in prolonged pain, suffering,
and even death. The facility representative must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication with a veterinarian, so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,
behavior, and well-being is conveyed. To be corrected before the next re-license inspection.

being of non-human primates. Dealers. Exhibitors, and research facilities must develop, document, and follow an
appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of non-human primates,


it must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by the next re-license inspection.

Facilities, general.
Two primary enclosures need maintenance and/or repair:
• On the right side of the gate, for the enclosure housing two pigs, is a wooden post with a heavy gage U-Shaped Fencing
Staple that has been broken in half. The break produced two sharp pieces that are bent outward. On the inside of the
enclosure there are also 4 screws sticking out of the post approximately 1”. Protruding sharp, jagged edges may cause
injury to the animals as they pass by.
• In the leopard enclosure, there is a crossbeam which helps support the roof netting. This crossbeam shows signs of rot
and decay. The crossbeam appears to be a 4X4 wooden board with numerous pieces missing from deterioration. This
section of wood needs to be replaced to keep the enclosure in good repair for the safety and containment of the animal.

Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by the next re-license inspection.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
A section of the perimeter fence, adjacent to the pig enclosure, has a gate. At the time of inspection, the gate was slightly
opened. Animals and unauthorized people can use this opening to enter and exit the area and gain access to the animals
behind it. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can


function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. To be corrected by the next re-license
inspection.

This is a (1st/2nd) Re-License Inspection for a Class (“A”/ “B”/ “C”) license. The inspection and exit briefing were
conducted with the applicant.

All items must be in compliance within (2 / 1) more inspection(s) or by (date-60 days counted from 1st RL Inspection) or
