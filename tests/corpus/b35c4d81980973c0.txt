FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The large pig enclosure does not provide any dry surface area for the pigs during extensive rain. The only dry
area was observed in the pigs house which is only large enough for them to lay down. The pigs were observed
sinking down into the mud while walking around the pen with no dry area to stand if they want to get out of the mud.
Although pigs enjoy mud they must have dry surfaces as well. Constant exposure to wet, soggy ground can lead to
disease and illness. Proper drainage must be provided to efficiently remove excess water to prevent the muddy
conditions and provide for the health and well being of the pigs. Correct by March 6, 2014.
Focused inspection to address veterinary care. Inspection and exit interview conducted with the facility
representative.
