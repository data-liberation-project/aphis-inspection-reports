ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* "Polly," a 3 year old English Bulldog, (ID#: 006819365), had a one inch wide spot on her right front leg that was
raised about a quarter of an inch. The licensee reported that this was caused another dog biting her days before.
When the swollen area was lightly touched, a pale liquid followed by a reddish clear liquid came out of the open
wound in the center of the swollen area. The licensee reported that this dog was not being treated for wounds and
hadn't thought that the wound was, 'that bad.' Swollen, untreated wounds that have pale discharge and reddish
clear discharge can be painful and may lead to further health problems if not treated.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian on this swollen wound in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document
this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date or had no expiration date: Oxytocin Injection (cid:19) no
date, Oxytocin Injection - 7/2014, Draxxin -1 Feb 2014, Cabergoline 125 mg (cid:19) 7/12/15, Cabergoline 120 mg (cid:19)
7/1/2014, Doxycycline 100 mg - 10/2012, Erofloxacin 22.7 mg (cid:19) no date, Baytril 68 mg (cid:19) no date, Baytril (cid:19) Jun 2016,
Cephalexin (cid:19) 2/31/14, Vitamin K (cid:19) Jan 16, Marquis (cid:19) Oct 13 and Strongid SA no date.
These medications were intermingled with other products on the medication counter top that are currently being
used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Expired drugs and drugs with no known certainty of the
expiration date may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. The
licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled properly in accordance with
standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. This will
promote the health of 31 adult dogs and 27 puppies.
3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.* There were bottles of medication had an accumulation of grey to brown dust and debris on top and sides of the
bottles. These 11 bottles of medication were stored on the medication counter top with other products and
therefore ready for use. This can soil or contaminate the medication affecting the health of the dogs the medication
is used for.
All medications must be stored in an area that is kept clean and in a manner that prevents an accumulation of dust
and debris on the bottles. This will prevent contamination and ensure the quality of the medications used on the 31
adult and 27 puppies.

3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the whelping barn, all the raised whelping enclosures had two horizontal support bars between the sections of
flooring per enclosure. These metal bars were extremely rusty and corroding. This can affect the structural
strength of the supports and possibly injure the animals. These surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized
increasing the disease potential.
All metal surfaces must be free of excessive rust that affects the structural strength and prevents the required
cleaning and sanitization. This will minimize injury, and allows for proper cleaning and sanitization decreasing the
disease potential for five adults and 27 puppies.
To be corrected by, 30-August-2016.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The concrete flooring in the Main Kennel and Hip Roof shed had wet areas on the flooring. These wet areas
where not drying off. This indicates the water or fluid waste was being absorbed by the concrete.
* In the whelping barn, all the enclosures had orange hog flooring. The orange vinyl had come off the flooring, in
areas, exposing bare metal in these enclosures. This was along the edge of the flooring. In these areas, the metal
was extremely rusty and corroded. This allows for waste and germs to get into these areas.
* In the Hip Roof Shed, to the left of the door, two enclosures had a plastic panels for the back wall and a plasticpanel divider. These plastic panels and divider were excessively scratched and chewed in areas. There was
greyish dirt and debris is these scratched and chewed areas. To the left of the door, three enclosures had
approximately ¼ to ½ inch wide by 4 feet long gaps between the panels on the back wall. This allows for waste and
germs to get in between the panels.
All these above mentioned surfaces are not being maintained and cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
Surfaces that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized increases the disease potential for the 31 adult dogs and 27
puppies.
All surfaces must be maintained when worn or soiled. This allows for surfaces to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
Thus, decreasing the disease potential for the dogs.
To be corrected by, 15-August-2016.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* To the right of the door in the Hip Shed, enclosures one through three had an accumulation of hair and damp
reddish-brown waste on top of the concrete flooring.
To the left of the door, two enclosures had chewed or scratched areas in the back wall and a plastic divider board.
These chewed and scratched areas had an accumulation of grey dirt or debris. This indicates that daily
spot-cleaning and sanitization is not taking place. As a result, this can increase the disease hazards for the 10 adult
dogs.
All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often enough for the prevention of disease hazards.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The Hip Roof shed had standing waste water in an area approximately 1 and 1/2 feet wide by 4 feet long at the
end of the center drainage gutter (alleyway). This waste water can attract insects, pests and increase odors and
disease hazards. Thus, this can affect the health of 10 adult dogs.
Housing facilities drainage systems must rapidly eliminate animal waste and fluid waste. This will minimize insects,
pest, odors and disease hazards for the dogs.To be corrected by, 10-August-2016.
3.6(a)(2)(10) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Counting from the door in the whelping room enclosures three, four and seven, all housing two adults and 14
puppies, had gaps in the flooring. These gaps were between sections of flooring and ranged approximately 1/4 to
½ inch wide by 1 to 3 feet long. These gaps can allow for the dogs feet to pass through possibly injuring the dogs.
All meshed and slatted flooring must be constructed for the prevention of the dogs' feet from passing through. This
will prevent injury to the animals and allow for them to walk in comfortably.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative, Dr. Scott Welch (VMO) and
Randall Wagner (ACI).
This inspection will be sent by e-mail.
