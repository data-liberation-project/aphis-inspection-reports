FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure housing one zebu, three sheep, and eight goats the side of the metal shade structure was in
disrepair. Metal wires, which were in place to tie the metal sheet to the post for support, had sharp points that were
protruding out into the enclosure. At the lower edge, the metal sheet wasn't securely tied to the metal post and was
sticking out, creating sharp jagged edges that were facing into the enclosure where the animals could come into
contact with them.
All enclosures and structures within the enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding
edges, holes, and gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and
maintenance should be in place to ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
