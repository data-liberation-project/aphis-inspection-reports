***An adult male black Italian Greyhound, identification number 0A01575021, had dental problems. The dog had
hard lumps on both sides of his face halfway between the corner of the dog(cid:25)s mouth and below his eyes. Upon
examination of the dog(cid:25)'s mouth, the upper molars were completely encased in a hard grayish-white material that
was about the size of a marble, which were causing the lumps that are apparent from the outside. The gum line
above all the upper teeth was reddened. The front teeth have a grayish-brown hard material that is adhered to at
least 90% of the surface of each tooth. There was a creamy white discharge at the gum line of the upper incisors.
The upper canines have a grayish-brown hard material adhered to at least 75% of the surface.
***An adult female blue and gold Yorkshire Terrier, identification number 0A01600159, had dental problems. The
upper teeth had a buildup of yellowish-gray hard material adhering to the teeth. The gum line was reddened and
there was a whitish creamy discharge above all the upper teeth.
Dental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, lead to the development of other health problems, and can
affect the well-being of the animal.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m. on September 17, 2014, to obtain
accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation
must be provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all
diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed
along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when
the medication is administered to the dogs.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of the dog at
that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the need
for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.

***There were at least two dogs that had excessively long toenails. One adult female white and fawn Italian
Greyhound, identification number 010514821, and an adult male black and white Italian Greyhound, identification
number 0A01382449, had toenails that curved excessively and caused the toes to rotate unnaturally.
Toenails that are too long can affect the dog(cid:25)s gait, be uncomfortable or painful, and could cause the dog to get its
feet caught in the flooring and cause an injury.
The licensee must ensure that toenails are trimmed as needed as part of a program of veterinary care
