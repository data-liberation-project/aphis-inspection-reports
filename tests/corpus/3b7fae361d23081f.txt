HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An intern was seriously injured by a reindeer on 9-14-17. The intern was inside the reindeer pasture when a bull
reindeer, in rut, pushed her up against the fence and punctured her with his antlers as per the licensee. The intern’s
injuries required a trip to the hospital and surgery as per the licensee.
The licensee must oversee and assure facility staff have appropriate training, knowledge, and experience with the
species they're working with. The licensee must also assure adequate measures are in place to prevent injuries to
the staff by the animals.
To be corrected: From this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
