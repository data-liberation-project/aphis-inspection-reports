***A male King Charles Cavalier (104-625-525) had long hair with large sections of matted fur on the dog's ears.
These matts had a brownish-black dried material mixed in the fur. Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase
the risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed and establish an appropriate grooming
schedule for all dogs.
This dog also had excessively long toenails. Excessive long nails can potentially cause pain and distress and can
be an injury hazard should they get caught in the flooring. The licensee must trim the toenails. The toenails were
addressed at the time of inspection. A program of toenail maintenance must be established to prevent long toenails.
This dog was observed excessively scratching and rubbing against the wire divider. Along the back of the dog there
was areas of missing hair and penny sized raised- reddened spots. There was areas of slight scabbing in the area
missing fur. These sores could be the result of an injury, infection, or other veterinary medical condition which may
be painful.
A male shih-tzu ( 020-353-084) had a lesion on the left shoulder. This lesion was about 2 inches long, with a black
material caked next to the edge of the lesion, brownish-red material flaking in immediate area, and a dried greenish
material in the lesion. This lesion could be the result of an injury, infection, or other veterinary medical condition
which may be painful.
The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding these animals conditions in order to ensure that
an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
