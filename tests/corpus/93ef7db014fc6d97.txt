3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A wire fence attached to an outdoor run on the American Eskimo dog building is in disrepair. Rusty and broken
wires have created a 6 inch by 4 inch opening in the wire fencing. Two adult American Eskimo dogs are being
housed in this enclosure. There are at least three sharp wire points the dogs can come in contact with. The facility
representative stated that he has another enclosure he could move the dogs to. He also stated he has the materials
needed to replace the fencing.
The potential for injury exists if the dogs come in contact with the sharp points or get caught in the openings created
by the broken wires. The licensee must ensure all enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury
and contain the animals securely at all times.
