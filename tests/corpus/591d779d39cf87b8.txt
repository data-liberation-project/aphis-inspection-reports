Water quality.
Water quality records provided by the facility for the walrus enclosure show the following readings for bacterial coliforms
between January 22, 2021 and February 28, 2021:
The water was tested for coliforms twenty eights times during this time period, and only two of those readings were
recorded as being below 1000 coliforms per 100 ml of water. There were three readings over 1000 (1700, 1700, and
1500), and on five occasions the number was recorded as “1000+”, which was explained by staff as being over 1000 and
“too many to count”.
The coliform bacteria count for a primary enclosure pool should not exceed 1000, and if it does then two subsequent
samples should be taken at 48-hour intervals and averaged with the first sample. If such average count does not fall
below 1000, then the water in the pool should be deemed unsatisfactory, and the condition must be corrected immediately
in order to safeguard the well-being of the animals.
This did not occur during this time period, as the subsequent tests did not fall below the 1000 count level on multiple
occasions, and additionally the “1000+” recordings make it impossible to average later measurements.
Steps should be taken to ensure that coliform bacterial monitoring is accurate and properly recorded. The facility must
maintain water quality which is not detrimental to the health and the well-being of the animals, and must ensure that


appropriate corrective actions are taken when high coliform counts, or other water quality concerns are detected.
To be corrected from this time forward.

This inspection was conducted on site on 6/2/2021 and 6/7/2021.
