Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The applicant stated that the program of veterinary care(PVC) was still being held by the veterinarian. The veterinarian
confirmed that the facility had not been given the PVC. Without veterinary guidance, animals may not receive optimal
care. Applicant shall assure that the attending veterinarian has been granted the appropriate authority to provide the
guidance and oversight of veterinary care for all animals.
The program of veterinary care should provide guidance on proper care including a schedule for vaccination documenting
the type and frequency and any other care required. The program should also include a schedule for on site visits by the
veterinarian at the premise and be available for review during inspection by the USDA.

Feeding.
The food for the 4 rabbits is stored in a used kitty litter plastic tub next to the rrabbit enclosure. The plastic tub is grimy.
There is also a cat litter tray with feces in it right in front of the feed plastic tub. Handling the grimy tub and then the feed
for the rabbits can contaminate the feed and make it unpalatable for the rabbits. Contaminated and unpalatable food puts
the rabbits at risk of illness. Ensure palatable uncontaminated feed is offered the rabbits.

Sanitation.
There are 4 rabbits housed in two enclosures in a corner of one room. On top of the rabbits are two glass terrariums on
top of which are two wire enclosures that house rats. On the right and back side of the rabbit enclosure are walls. On the
left side of the rabbit enclosure are bins with feed and other materials.

Limiting access to all sides of the rabbit enclosures interferes with the ability to properly clean the enclosures.
There was fur and grime seen on the walls and around the enclosure. In addition, there was an accumulation of feces on
the floor outside the rabbit enclosures.

The premises needs to be kept clean to ensure the health and well-being of the rabbits.

Premises shall remain free of accumulations of trash.

3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
There are four singing dogs that are housed in enclosures that have not been adequately cleaned. There is fur
accumulated along the edges of their enclosures. During the inspection, one of the singing dog enclosures was pulled
away from the wall and revealed a large quantity of fur and urine soaked flooring.
There are seven foxes that are housed in enclosures that also have fur accumulated along the edges of the enclosure.
There are two fennec foxes and one pale fox that are housed in an enclosure that has grime on the surfaces of the
resting platform shelves.
There are two ferrets housed in an enclosure that has feces accumulated in the corner of the pen as well as in a separate
litter box.
Proper cleaning of enclosures should be frequent enough to prevent the accumulation of fur, feces and grime. Elimination
of this accumulation will minimize disease hazards and reduce health risks to all the animals.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The regulated animals, ie: 7 foxes; 4 singing dogs; 2 fennec foxes; one pale fox; two ferrets; and 4 rabbits that are used in
exhibition are all housed in rooms of the applicant’s primary residence. The house is a two-bedroom home with
approximately 1100 sq. ft. There are also additional personal pets (11 cats and three dogs) housed in the home. The
rooms remain overcrowded with stored items such as donated animal food, bedding, personal items, and other supplies.
There are lidded bins stacked next to and on top of the animal enclosures, wherever there is space in the room. One
singing dog has a wooden bench stored on top of the enclosure. There is minimal clearance to work with and access the
animals, clean enclosures and housing rooms, as well as to repair and maintain enclosures. Premises shall be kept clean
and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices.
