2.4(d)
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
An attempt was made to inspect Spellbound on Monday, May 4th, at approximately 5:30 pm. The week prior, the
licensee had sent the area supervisor an email explaining that she was in and out and didn'(cid:25)t want (cid:28)"Doris'(cid:25)s
replacement(cid:29)" to waste their time trying to do an inspection. Because of that email, an attempt was made to inspect
later than the common 8 to 5 business hours, but well within the defined business hours in the Regulations which
are from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. According to 9CFR 2.126(a) licensees must allow APHIS officials to enter their place
of business and carry out their official duties during working hours
Ms. O(cid:25)Neal was in her yard with several dogs when I pulled into her driveway. I attempted to crack my car door to
tell her who I was but she started yelling for me to stay in the car. I shut the door and waited while she put up the
dogs. I then rolled down the window and asked if it was safe to get out. Ms. O(cid:25)Neal said yes and then began
yelling that I should have called before driving down the driveway. The licensee was verbally harassing from the
beginning even after I identified myself as an APHIS official. I asked her if she was done yelling at me because if
she continued I was going to write her up for harassment of and interference with an APHIS official. The licensee(cid:25)s
comments were (cid:28)"You do what you have to do(cid:29)", "(cid:28)I don(cid:25)t care who you are, you don(cid:25)'t come down my driveway
without calling....you'(cid:25)re lucky you didn(cid:25)'t get a bullet in you."
The comments and the licensee(cid:25)'s manner were threatening and verbally abusive. I considered the comment about
a bullet to be a threat and a refusal for inspection so I immediately left the property.
Licensee should be more receptive to the inspection process and allow inspections to occur without incident from
this day forward.
