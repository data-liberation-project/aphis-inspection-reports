3.1(e) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The licensee covered mouse entry holes with flashing and put mouse baits in place in areas outside of the food storage
room, however there was some loose feed on the floor, mouse droppings in the corners of the room, and the food was
stored on the floor. A live mouse was also seen running out of the feed room when the licensee moved a bag of feed.
Loose food on the floor and food bags directly on the floor can allow contamination and promote vermin infestation.
Ensure that the supplies of food are stored in a manner that protects from contamination and vermin (mice) infestation.

Note: The licensee cleaned up the loose food and moved bags off the floor onto skids and placed additional rodent control
in the feed room prior to the exit interview.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
