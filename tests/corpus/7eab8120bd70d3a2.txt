3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There was damage noted to one of the walls of the camels’ stall inside the barn. The camels had chewed several holes in
the wooden wallboard, exposing the inner frame construction of the barn wall, and the insulation inside the wall was also
exposed. It was also noted that the bottom corner of 2”x 4” wire mesh at the front of the outdoor camel/alpaca pen fence
near the tortoises' summer pen had detached and was bowing inwards into the pen. The detached corner had sharp
points that could cause an injury.

Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. The Licensee needs to make repairs to the wall of the camel stall in the barn and to the camel/alpaca pen
fence.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 2/17/22 with a facility representative. *END OF REPORT*
