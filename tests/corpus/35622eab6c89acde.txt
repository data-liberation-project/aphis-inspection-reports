2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
At this facility, dogs are identified with a metal tag and collar. At the time of inspection 5 dogs--3 Pomeranians, an Irish
Setter, and a German Short-haired pointer, were not wearing their collar and were not otherwise identified. Correct
identification allows for tracking the movement of dogs and facilitates the inspection process by enabling dogs' identity to
be known. The licensee must identify all live dogs on the premises as defined in section 2.50. To be corrected by 13
August 2021.
3.10(a) Direct

Watering
Dogs are kept in large outdoor enclosures and provided 5 gallon buckets filled with water. In one enclosure containing 2
dogs, the bucket had algae growth and the water was brown and murky and you could not see the bottom of the bucket.
In another enclosure containing 5 dogs, the water bucket had algae growth along the sides and bottom. No other water
was provided to these dogs. Dirty water can be unhealthy for dogs and cause illness. Clean, potable water must be
continuously provided to dogs. Correct immediately by providing clean, potable water on a continuous basis, including
sanitizing water buckets a minimum of every 2 weeks and cleaning more frequently as needed to ensure potability.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
