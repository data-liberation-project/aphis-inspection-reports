2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol 18-021 described implantation surgery
"opening skin/muscle layers to expose the skull", perform craniotomies and implanting the base. The protocol did not
describe removing portions of the skull to attach the base. On 28 November 2018 there was an unintended post surgical
outcome of neurological side effects and seizures the IACUC addressed with the sponsor on 4 December 2018, followed
by an IACUC meeting on 5 December 2018. The sponsor did not document the surgical complications from shaving the
skull nor communicate them effectively to the facility until after the animal was provided veterinary care. The IACUC
documented the adverse effects in a letter to the sponsor, but did not amend protocol 18-021 to document the significant
change in the protocol and include the complete description of what the IACUC approved.

During the IACUC meeting considering the protocol the surgical procedure was discussed, specifically improving
outcomes from previous similar protocols, but it did not list neurological deficits and seizures as a potential adverse
outcomes. After this adverse outcome, the protocol/amendment template was modified to add potential adverse
outcomes of the research activities to the IACUC approved protocol.



Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC Chair and Attending Veterinarian.
