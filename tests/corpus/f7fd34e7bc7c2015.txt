INFORMATION AS TO BUSINESS; FURNISHING OF SAME BY DEALERS, EXHIBITORS, OPERATORS OF
AUCTION SALES, INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS, AND CARRIERS.
On March 15, 2017 a routine inspection was performed at the DFW site of Qatar Airways Cargo. Records for
animal imports and exports were requested. An employee pointed out a couple of file cabinets and boxes and
stated the records for the past 3 months were in the cabinets or the boxes. Records older than 3 months were in a
warehouse somewhere. These cabinets and boxes included all cargo shipped during the past 3 months, not just
animal records. In order to thoroughly review records for animals shipped since the last inspection records for every
piece of cargo handled by Qatar since Nov 2016 would have had to be reviewed. Some of those records would
have been in the “warehouse” and unavailable for review. The supervisor was not available at the time of the
inspection so a business card and a note were left with an employee requesting the supervisor call me so we could
discuss the situation. As of today, Monday March 20, 2017, I have not been contacted by anyone from Qatar about
these concerns.
Providing adequate records in a timely manner continues to be a problem for this facility.
Carriers and intermediate handlers must furnish to any APHIS official any information requested in connection with
the enforcement of the provisions of the AWA.
This inspection was conducted with a facility employee.
