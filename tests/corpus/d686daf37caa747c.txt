3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The metal edging surrounding the entryway to four enclosures is corroded and showing excessive rust. Seven
dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in outdoor housing. The surfaces were rough in appearance.
Excessive rust affects the structural integrity of all metal surfaces. In addition, rusted surfaces cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure that metal surfaces are free of excessive rust. The licensee
moved the seven dogs to different enclosures during the inspection.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, Kendall Lundy ACI and Robert Bacon
ACI.
