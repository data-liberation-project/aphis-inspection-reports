2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. There were no inventory
records or record of guinea pigs that died or were euthanized since July 2022. A total of 103 adult, 140 weanlings, and 72
newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess
the health of the caviary by identifying animal losses by decrease number of guinea pig born or raised. Licensee must
maintain records containing the required information for animals which discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned,
acquired or disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by January 9, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
