2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The exhibitor did not have a written Program of Veterinary Care. The written Program of Veterinary Care should be
available for review at the time of inspection. Unless a full-time veterinarian is employed by the exhibitor, there
should be a written agreement between the attending veterinarian and the exhibitor that covers issues such as
preventive care for the animals, emergency care, euthanasia, and husbandry. This document should be reviewed at
least annually, and ensures on-going communication between the attending veterinarian and the exhibitor, which
promotes adequate care.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 7 year old female Borzoi named "Princess" was holding her right front foot up while standing. Her posture was
hunched, and she appeared uncomfortable. There was swelling of her right carpal joint, and upon palpation it felt as
though there was fluid under the skin. Additionally, she had a moderate accumulation of brown tartar on her teeth,
and excessively long toenails. Two other dogs, had dental issues: "Barzoi", a 6 year old male Borzoi had some
tartar accumulation, and the licensee stated that he has broken some teeth, and "Apache", a 3 year old male Border
Collie, also had a significant tartar build up on his premolars / molars.
The exhibitor should promptly report any health problems to the attending veterinarian, or an alternate if
unavailable. There should be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to a veterinarian. Failure to
recognize and report problems can result in unnecessary suffering and /or a poor medical outcome.
The exhibitor should have "Princess" examined by a veterinarian within 48 hours, and the other affected dogs
examined by a veterinarian within the next two weeks.
3.14(a)(3) REPEATPRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Two of the Borzoi dogs are being housed during transit and while at the venue in an open area of the trailer. This
area is not completely secure, as there is no interior confined space, and there is an upper ledge that is potentially
accessible to the dogs, and some items such as plastic bins, and a fire extinguisher are present in the space. One
of the dogs, "Barzoi" suffers anxiety when confined, but should be accommodated in a space that still meets the
requirements for a primary enclosure. As a primary enclosure the area should be secure and safe for the animals.
While in transit, dogs must be enclosed in a primary enclosure that adequately contains and secures the animal. A
secure enclosure for transport must be provided for the dogs in order to ensure the safety of the animals while in
transit.
An exit interview was conducted in Spanish with the exhibitors.
This inspection was conducted in Melbourne, FL on 11/12/14 and Port St. Lucie, FL on 11/13/14.
