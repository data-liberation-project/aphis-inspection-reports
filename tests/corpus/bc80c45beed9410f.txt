ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male black miniature Schnauzer ("Coal", microchip #7E10007314) has a hairless area on his head. The area is
located within the space between the right ear and the right eye. The skin in this hairless area appears dry and
flaky and numerous small red bumps are located within the affected area. This dog has not been evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian for this condition. Hair loss and abnormal skin conditions can be an indication of an underlying
health issue.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
At the time of the inspection, the licensee contacted the attending veterinarian and set up an appointment for the
dog to be evaluated on December 16, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
