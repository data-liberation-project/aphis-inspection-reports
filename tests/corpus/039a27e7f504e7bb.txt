Watering
In the indoor kennel area one of the plastic water receptacle is excessively chewed along the rim by the dogs who can
access this area from the exercise yard. The water receptacle with the chewed edges has dirt and grime embedded into
the plastic and does not allow it to be properly cleaned and sanitized. All water receptacles must be kept clean and
sanitized. Chewed buckets should be repaired or replaced to allow for surfaces to be properly sanitized.
