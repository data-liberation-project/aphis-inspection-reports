2.40 (b)(2)
***There were several dogs at the facility with lesions between the toes:
-There was a female Shiba Inu (#095*084*573) with lesions between most of the toes on all four paws. Some of the
lesions appeared inflamed, red and/or moist. There were also bright red and moist small pieces of tissue that were
raised and protruding between some of these toes. An approximately 2 inch region of hair loss was also present on
the dog(cid:25)s front left leg. The skin in the area of hair loss appeared reddened. The hair loss could indicate an allergy,
infection and/or other veterinary medical condition which could be uncomfortable for the animal.
-There was a black and tan female Shiba Inu (#089*111*777) with a moist, raised, reddened, hairless lesion
between the fourth and fifth digits on the left front leg. The mass-like lesion was approximately ½ inch in length.
-There was a female Shiba Inu (no identification) with raised, hairless lesions between some of the toes on at least
three of its feet. The fur surrounding most of these lesions was discolored reddish brown. Along the side of the
fourth digit, near the fifth digit on the dog(cid:25)s right front paw, there was an approximately ½ inch hairless area. The
area appeared inflamed and the dog would quickly pull that paw back whenever the inspector attempted to take a
closer look.
-There was a female Shiba Inu (no identification) with reddened, raised and/or moist lesions between most of the
toes on all four paws. The fur surrounding most of these lesions was discolored reddish brown. The tissues
between the middle toes on the left rear foot appeared inflamed and the dog would quickly pull back the foot
whenever the inspector attempted to take a closer look.
The lesions between the toes could indicate injuries, infections and/or other veterinary medical conditions that may
be painful for the animals.
***There were several animals at the facility with eye conditions:-There was a female Shih Tzu (#045*683*267) with cloudy eyes and discharge around both eyes. A dark black to
brown material was noted matted in the fur around both eyes with the heaviest noted around the left eye. A small
amount of reddish brown discharge was noticed in the corner of the left eye. The central portion within the left eye
was bluish grey in color. The surface of the right eye appeared dull and dry compared to the dog(cid:25)s left eye. Most of
the right eye was bluish grey in color and a pinpoint sized circular greyish white lesion was located centrally on the
cornea.
DIRECT -There was a male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (no identification) with eyes that appeared enlarged, dull
and reddened. The eyes also appeared dark with each pupil and iris being difficult to visualize in either eye.
Throughout the white parts of both eyes (sclera), there were several tiny red vessel-like structures present.
-There was a female Shih Tzu (#102*637*000) with a thick, green, mucoid-like discharge noted on and around the
right eye. A small amount of dry, greenish, crusty material was matted in some of the fur surrounding the eye. The
right eye appeared dark with the pupil and iris being difficult to visualize. The surface of the eye also appeared dull
and dry when compared to the left eye. The left eye also had a thin layer of green, mucoid-like discharge on its
surface.
DIRECT -There was a female Shih Tzu (#0A1327854) with a thick, mucoid-like discharge noted around both eyes
and a lesion on the left eye. The fur around each eye was matted with moist discharge as well as a black to brown
dry crusty-like material. The discharge was very heavy around the left eye. On the surface of the left eye, there
was a raised greyish white opaque lesion located centrally.
These dogs' eye conditions could indicate injuries, infections and/or other veterinary medical conditions some of
which could be painful and/or lead to blindness.
***There was a female Bichon Frise (#063*310*123) with its tongue hanging out to the side and wet, discolored fur
noted mostly on the lower portion of its muzzle. Most of the dog's teeth were missing. On the front, right side of the
inside of the dog's mouth, an approximately 1 inch portion of the gum tissue was pink, raised and appeared
mass-like; there were no visible teeth in this region. The surfaces of both upper carnassial teeth were covered with
a heavy amount of brown material. The dog would swing its head away when trying to look in the mouth so multiple
attempts were not made. The abnormal build-up of material on this dog's teeth can cause damage to the gum
tissue and tooth structures. The abnormal gum tissue could indicate an illness or other veterinary medical
condition. This dog's dental condition could be painful, may decrease the dog(cid:25)s ability to eat normally and
negatively impact the overall health of the animal.
None of the animals mentioned above had been examined by a veterinarian for their current conditions nor were
they under any type of treatment at the time of inspection. The two dogs noted as DIRECT, a male Cavalier King
Charles Spaniel (no identification) and a female Shih Tzu (#0A1327854), must be examined by a licensedveterinarian no later than July 26, 2014. The licensee must have the rest of these animals examined by a licensed
veterinarian no later than July 28, 2014 in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate
treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care
program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces--
** The enclosures in the large building with bare wire front were rusted to the point that they were pitted. The rusted
pitted surfaces does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitizing, which can be a disease and health hazard for the
dogs. The rust can also affect the structural strength of the surfaces. The owner must replace or repair the rusted
surfaces to allow for proper cleaning and sanitizing. To be corrected by: 10-24-14.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
** Two enclosures containing mothers with puppies, had frayed carpet for the dogs to lay on. The frayed carpet
cannot be properly cleaned and if ingested by the dogs could cause health problems. The carpet must be replacedto remove the frayed edges. All surfaces must be replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by: 07-25-14.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
** The small building had a brownish residue on the ceiling, wash downs and other surfaces. There was also an
accumulation of old feed under the wash downs and an accumulation of hair on the supports under the enclosures.
This does not demonstrate proper husbandry practices and can contribute to pest, odors, disease hazards and does
not contribute to the health and well being of the animals. The owner must clean the surfaces of the building and
ensure that all surfaces are kept clean. Surfaces of housing facilities not in contact with the animals, must be
cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. To be
corrected by: 08-24-14.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
** The small building housing dogs, had piles of excreta outside of the building with a large population of flies
around each pile and the building had the doors and windows open. This can contribute to pest, odors and disease
hazards. The waste piles need to be removed and maintained to contribute to the health and well being of the
animals and to help reduce the number of flies. To be corrected by: 07-26-14.
3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Ventilation.
** The large building had a strong odor of feces and urine, this can contribute to health problems and pest. The
ventilation must be increased and cleaning out the wash downs more often can help eliminate odor problems.
Indoor housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently ventilated at all times to provide for their health and well-being,
and to minimize odors. To be corrected by: 07-25-14.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
