ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A cynomolgus macaque (animal #10 in study 265.42) was found dead while restrained in a procedure cage during
an infusion study on 10/2/15. Upon inquiring with staff involved, it was discovered that the team carrying out the
procedure that day was short-handed due to a scheduling problem.
The licensee must provide adequate staffing to ensure proper monitoring of animals during use and immediate
intervention to prevent a serious animal welfare issue. Failure to provide adequate personnel could negatively
impact animal welfare; as evidenced in this case. Correct from this time forward by ensuring that there is adequate
staffing so that all animals utilized in study procedures are adequately monitored for pain and distress.
