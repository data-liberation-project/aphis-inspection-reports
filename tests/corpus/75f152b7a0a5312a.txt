FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two camels do not have any shelter from the direct sunlight. Arrived at this inspection at 1:00 pm and both
camels housed in an outside pen on the side of the transport trailer were in the direct sunlight. The ambient
temperatures recorded on the kestrel from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm were from 84F to 85F, and would be higher on the
camels because of the direct sunlight. There are two fans for the camels which they were not using and appears no
signs of being over heated, however so there is no overheating or discomfort sufficient shade shall be provided to
allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
On February 14, 2017, this licensee sent a photo which shows a white canopy installed on the side transport trailer
covering a portion of the pen and camels. I am unable to determine if there is sufficient shade for both camels
under this canopy at the same time. A future inspection will be needed to ensure the canopy is in compliance with
all USDA standards and regulations.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the care taker in Clewiston, FL, and an additional exit
interview with the licensee by phone.
