3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Around the sheltered facility, again, and now around the indoor housing facility, there is an extreme overgrowth of
weeds and grasses. The licensee stated that she does not have access to a mower at this time. Although no
animals have access to the outside portion of the sheltered facility, overgrown weeds and grass create a breeding
ground and living area for pests, rodents, and other vermin that may gain access to the inside of the facilities,
causing possible disease hazards.
These weeds and grasses must be continuously controlled to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for
rodents, pests, and other vermin. The licensee must develop and follow a regular method of premises
housekeeping and maintenance to ensure the protection of the health and well-being of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
