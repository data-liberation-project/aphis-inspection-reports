2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1145 hrs on
18-Aug-16.
The licensee's spouse answered the door and said the licensee was in the city and he did not know when she
would return. He was unable to conduct the inspection because he was babysitting young children. The inspector
then texted the licensee who said she had a doctor appointment with a specialist. She stated she would cancel the
appointment and come back but the appointment had to be made six months in advance. The licensee stated she
should be home by 3:30 or 4:00. The inspector apologized that she could not wait that long and notified the
licensee that she would send an attempted report. The licensee then sought help from two different relatives but
they were also unavailable.
