Feeding.
The licensee is feeding chicken leg quarters to the adult cougars. The licensee is not adding any dietary supplements to
the chicken leg quarter diet.

The food for the cougars must be wholesome, palatable and of sufficient nutritive value to maintain the animals in good
health.

Chicken leg quarters do not contain the correct balance of nutrients when fed alone. Meat alone lacks vitamins, and
minerals to maintain healthy bones, bodies, and body function. A dietary supplement must be added to a diet made up of
leg quarters to ensure the cougars nutrient levels are met.

Sanitation.
There are numerous rat holes in and around the primary enclosures for the two cougars. When the inspectors inquired
about the program to control the rats in and around the facility the licensee stated that he used cats to control the rat
population.


A safe and effective program for the control of mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.

A safe and effective program must be utilized and maintained to control mammalian pests. Rats carry numerous
diseases that can affect the health of the cougars maintained at the facility.
