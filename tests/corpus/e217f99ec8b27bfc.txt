ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are three adult sheep that are in need of veterinary care. A thin Hampshire ewe with green marker covering
her rump and side (Tag #1422) was observed to be toe-touching on her front left leg while she was standing and
was reluctant to move. A Crossbred ewe with a yellow tag (Tag #1791) and green spot on her rump was also
observed to be non-weight bearing on her front left leg and was reluctant to move. Another Hampshire ewe with
yellow marker on her rump (Tag# 1774) was observed to be toe-touching on her rear left leg while standing, was
reluctant to move, and remained lying during the majority of the inspection. The licensee said that he had treated
six to eight of the ewes recently with an antibiotic, but did not contact a veterinarian and had no treatment records or
veterinary instructions in his program of veterinary care.
Failure to use the appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can result in
pain and distress in animals with lameness.
The licensee must maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor sheep enclosure has an accumulation of mud covering the majority of the lot. There are also several
large puddles of standing water within the area. The sheep must walk through deep areas of mud between the
outdoor lot and the barn to reach their only water source. Three severely lame sheep were also observed during
the inspection.
Standing in mud and water can cause distress to the animals and adversely impact the health of their hooves. The
licensee should ensure that adequate drainage is provided to keep mud and water from accumulating in the animal
areas.
