OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The two pairs of wolf hybrids in two separate enclosures were moved to different enclosures since the last
inspection, but the wooden fence posts in these enclosures were not cleaned of the green algae and sealed to be
water impervious. All building surfaces in contact with dogs in outdoor housing facilities must be impervious to
moisture in order to maintain the husbandry standards.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Along the front fence line of the enclosure behind the USDA barn in the deer forest, is a concrete culvert to drain
water from the pasture above it. The dirt has totally eroded from around the culvert leaving a three foot hole. This
area needs to be repaired to prevent potential injury to the animals.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Although holes at the bottom of the perimeter fence along the service road were repaired, there are still multiple
areas of the perimeter fence with gaps, low fencing, or loose tension wires. These areas include: a large tree fell
last week on the fence near the wolf hybrids; the chain link fence near the USDA barn varies from 4 to 5 foot in a
few areas (the perimeter fence variance states the lower fence will be six feet with two additional feet of other
fencing); the two feet of additional fencing consisting of high tensile wire and black coated wire is loose or
unattached in several areas along the entrance road; the bottom of the fence along the entrance road is loose in
numerous places leaving gaps up to a foot. The perimeter fence (cid:19) which also serves as a primary enclosure fence
for many animals in the deer forest (cid:19) needs to be repaired or replaced, and inspected and maintained on a regular
basis. Maintenance of the perimeter/enclosure fence is needed to prevent escapes and to keep animals and
unauthorized people out.
