2.126(b) Repeat

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:30 AM on 8/9/21.

The inspector arrived at 9:30 AM on 8/9/21 to conduct an inspection. The inspector contacted the Licensee by phone and
text and learned that they were not at home but was at a distant off-site location and would not return home until much
later that day. An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility
representative available to accompany the inspector.

This is the SECOND attempted inspection of the Licensee.
