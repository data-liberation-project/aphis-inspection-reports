Facilities, general.
Rodent feces were found amongst the bedding supplies in the small storage shed adjacent to the alpaca enclosure. No
other rodent activity was observed during the inspection of the rest of the buildings and grounds. The presence of vermin
and their feces in a storage area can contaminate supplies which can cause potential disease hazards when introduced to
the regulated animals. Supplies of bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. The facility must either move the bedding supplies to an area which
can adequately protect them or maintain the existing shed so that bedding supplies are protected.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility's acquisition records showed a total of 35 fallow deer, all being designated as born on the premises. However,
no acquisition dates are provided. When the facility representative was asked if these numbers reflected the current herd,
she stated that they did not, that these numbers reflected the herd from previous years.

Additionally, the acquisition and disposition records indicate that there should be three chinchillas but during inspection,


only two were identified. When asked about a third chinchilla, the facility representatives stated that it died within the
previous year but there was no record noting it's death.

Exhibitors are required to keep and maintain records that fully and correctly disclose dates in which animals are acquired,
including births, and animal dispositions, including deaths. Failure to do so inhibits accurate inventory counts, ownership
tracking, and identifying abnormal birth or death rates occurring at a herd level. Correct by including dates of animal
acquisitions and dispositions, including births and deaths. Correct by October 3, 2020.

Facilities, general.
There are several areas of the facility that are in a state of disrepair.
In the fallow deer enclosure, the beams supporting the center of the main barn have large cracks. There are large sheets
of rusted metal attached to the right hand wall which have partially detached from the wall and have sharp edges
projecting into the area animal. There are also several rusted nails and screws projecting into the animal areas on the
interior and exterior walls of the barn. A large sheet of metal roofing has also been detached from the roof and was
observed on the ground in the animal enclosure. The secondary wire fence has also detached from the posts and
remains tangled on the ground. There is also a bench, piping material, and various unnecessary objects in disrepair
scattered throughout the enclosure.
In the alpaca enclosure, the secondary fence has become detached from the posts in several areas and has become
entangled with overgrown trees and weeds. One area of partial fencing, is pulled away from the post and has created a
gap that is approximately 3" wide x 24" long.
In the coati enclosure, there is tan colored material detaching from the ramps used to access the elevated area.



The areas of structural instability, sharp projecting objects, and detached fencing can cause injury to the animals or result
in entanglement. Additionally, the flaking material in the coati enclosure could be hazardous to the animal's health if
ingested. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The facility must remove, repair, or replace the above
mentioned items to ensure the safety and well-being of the regulated animals.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
There are several areas of the perimeter fence adjacent to the alpaca pen, above the llama and goat pen, and adjacent to
the deer enclosure in which excessive vegetation has grown up, around, and over the perimeter fence. This has resulted
in areas of the perimeter fence sagging or bending under the weight of this growth.

Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they prevent animal escape as well as preventing the entry of other animals
or unauthorized persons. The sagging fence areas impact the integrity of the fence by weakening it and potentially
allowing escape or entry of other animals. Correct by removing the excess vegetation and repairing damaged areas of
the perimeter fence. Correct by January 2, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
