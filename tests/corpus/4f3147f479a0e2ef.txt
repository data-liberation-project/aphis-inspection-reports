ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A female Elk in the first section of the park has a large growth hanging under her chest between her front two
legs. The farm manager is aware of the growth but has not had the vet out to examine the animal for diagnosis and
treatment options. When issues are identified the facility needs to have appropriate methods in place to diagnose
and treat the animals. The vet needs to be contacted and this animal assessed for its health and well being.

*** The Llama(cid:25)s in the park are heavily matted and have not been sheared this season. Matted llamas have a
potential to overheat in the summer months and matted fur in the fall and winter does not provide the animals
adequate insulation from the cold. Annual shearing is a appropriate husbandry method that needs to be done in a
timely manner to prevent the development of health issues.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** This is a large ride through Animal Park with approximately 300 animals. Currently when the drivers and guides
tour through the park they will notify the farm manager verbally if they observe a health concern/injury with an
animal. This communication is directed at the farm manager but there is no indication that animal health concerns
are then being conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. Additionally there is no mechanism in
place to track animal health changes (a log book) and how animals are progressing after treatment. Daily
observation and the method that the information is conveyed and tracked between the farm management and the
attending veterinarian needs to be addressed for the health of the animals in the park.

3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** There is a section of primary fence in the first section of the park behind the large hill that has had a tree come
down into the fencing. This section of fence needs to be maintained in good repair for containment of the animals.
*** Additionally there is another section of fence down by the water buffalo/bison feeders that appears to be tied with
blue twine. This section of fence also needs to be maintained and structurally sound for the containment of the
animals.
*** A section of fence in the small animal adventure is also secured with blue twine but there is a large gap in the
fence. This section of fence needs to be secured with appropriate materials for the safety of the animals.

3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** In the small animal adventure the zebra and nilgai do not have access to a shelter that would allow them to get
out of the elements. Per this regulation animals housed outdoors need to have access to a shelter so they have the
choice to get out of the elements. A shelter needs to be provided for their health and well being.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection and the farm manager the
following day.
