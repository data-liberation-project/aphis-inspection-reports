2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The Licensee employs a part-time Attending Veterinarian and the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) available for
review was incomplete. There were no details provided in the PVC regarding for the species of animals, preventative
care, emergency care, or euthanasia.

Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever an exhibitor employs an attending veterinarian under part-time or
consultant arrangements, a written PVC is required. The written PVC should include complete and specific details from
the Attending Veterinarian regarding the preventative medical care and other health topics to ensure that adequate
veterinary care is provided to the animal species maintained by the Licensee.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with
representatives of the Applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 1/7/23 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
