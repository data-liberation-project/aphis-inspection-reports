3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The shade cloth provided in the eastern most Golden Retriever enclosure has been partially torn down from the
support structure. The portions of the cloth within reach of the dogs has been torn and shredded. This shade cloth
should be replaced and steps must be taken to reduce the possibility of the dogs tearing down shade structures in
the future. All outdoor enclosures must have shade structures to protect the dogs from the direct rays of sunlight.
These shade structures must be maintained to be in good repair and structurally sound to accomplish their purpose.
