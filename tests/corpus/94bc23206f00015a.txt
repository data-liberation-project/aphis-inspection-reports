2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee does not have a formal arrangement with the current Attending Veterinarian. The licensee states that the
veterinarian who recently provided veterinary care to their bears is the current Attending Veterinarian. Licensees must
employ an Attending Veterinarian under formal arrangements which must include a written program of veterinary care
(PVC) and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.

Facilities, general.
The brown and black bears had recently escaped out of their housing facility. The animals had dug a hole under the
enclosure wall which enabled the animals to escape. It was later discovered by the licensee that the rebar metal which
ran from the enclosure wall down into the ground was not reinforced in concrete in this area, which permitted the bears to
dig under the wall. Both bears were later returned to the facility unharmed. Housing facilities must be structurally sound
and maintained so as to safely contain the animals. The facility has corrected this item by reinforcing underneath the
enclosure wall with concrete in addition to adding electric wire to inside of the enclosure walls.



*********To remain corrected from this point forward.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility does not have a complete perimeter fence. There was recent occurrence of bears getting out of their primary
enclosure, and a perimeter fence was not present to prevent one of the animals from escaping from the facility property.
A perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility from entry of unwanted animals and
people, as well as function as a secondary containment. The facility has purchased fencing materials and is currently in
the process of the perimeter fence construction. This non compliance was cited on the previous inspection report.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
