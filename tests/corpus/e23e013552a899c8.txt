NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The licensee called me shortly after the last attempted inspection to tell me she was moving and would have to sell
her animals. I let her know she would have to let the Eastern Regional Office that she was voluntarily cancelling her
license in writing and send her license in also. I have not received the cancellation or a change of address on the
licensee and when I visited the facility today the driveway had not been plowed in quite a while and the licensee did
not answer her phone.
A licensee shall promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name within 10 days
of any change.
Notify the Eastern Regional Office within 10 days of any change in business including no longer needing a license
and change of location.
To be corrected from now on.
