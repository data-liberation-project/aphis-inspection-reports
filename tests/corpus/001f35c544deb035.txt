SANITATION.
The enclosure housing two pigs has excessive wet, soiled straw. The area (approximately 2x3 ft in diameter) of
wet, soiled straw is located on the left, front on the enclosure and adjacent to the pigs feeding container. Several
flies were present on/in the soiled straw during the time of inspection. Soiled, wet bedding attracts flies and can
cause animal illness.
Remove and clean the affected area of the pig enclosure to minimize flies and promote animal health.
