2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** “Lola,” an adult, female, wolf-dog hybrid had an accumulation of brown material coating the majority of the
surface of her upper canine teeth. The gum line was reddened and swollen. When the facility owner rubbed at her
upper right canine tooth, the gum surrounding the tooth began to bleed. These signs are consistent with the
presence of dental disease.
Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort, impact the ability of the wolf-dog to eat, and lead to further health
issues. “Lola” must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries.
