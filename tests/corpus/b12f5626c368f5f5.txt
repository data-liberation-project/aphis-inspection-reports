2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a white female Bichon Frise (#330) with hair loss and circular-like skin lesions in the regions of the left
hip and near the right side base of the tail. The areas of hair loss were irregular in shape and extended beyond the
reddened skin lesions located within the regions of hair loss. The lesions appeared to be reddened and scabbed.
The largest sore on the left side was approximately ½ inch diameter and had a few smaller, pinpoint sized lesions
near it. There was also an approximately 1 inch diameter reddened lesion near the base of the tail. A small amount
of fecal-like material was noted in the fur on the right side of the rear leg. The licensee was not aware of the dog's
condition prior to the inspector pointing it out. This dog's condition could be due to an injury, infection or a variety of
other veterinary medical conditions. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding this dog's
condition in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and
followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
****Cleaning.
Throughout the facility there were cobb webs, hair, dirt and grime around and on the enclosures. These cobb webs
were along the front and tops of the enclosures, ceilings, rafters, and windows. Dirt and grime were on the
enclosure framing, water lines, and support chains. The ceiling of the west portion of the building had brown specks
it. Under the weaned puppy enclosures there was a build-up of feces, the facility representative said the floor
underneath was last cleaned Saturday. Buildings and surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly or
often enough increase the risk of disease transmission to the dogs. The licensee must ensure all surfaces in contact
with the dogs are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks. The licensee must ensure all
other surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards.

3.3(c) REPEATSHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Lighting.
***Inside the sheltered facility there was not enough light to observe the animals, maintain adequate cleaning or for
inspection of the facility and animals without a flashlight. Not having enough light prevents adequate cleaning,
hinders observation of the animals for health problems and can affect the well being of the animals. The licensee
has added a sky light and some see-through dog entry doors that have helped with the lighting since the March 23,
2016 inspection; however, the lighting was still inadequate. The licensee must ensure the sheltered housing
facilities for dogs are lighted well enough to permit routine inspection and cleaning of the facility, and observation of
the dogs. Animal areas must be provided a regular diurnal lighting cycle of either natural or artificial light. Lighting
must be uniformly diffused throughout animal facilities and provide sufficient illumination to aid in maintaining good
housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, adequate inspection of animals, and for the well-being of the animals.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
****Sharps.
Throughout the facility there were sharp points in at least 4 enclosures affecting approximately 10 dogs. Some of
these sharp points consisted of wires used for fastening and had sharp ends that were protruding into the
enclosures at the dogs' level. One of the wires was attached to a lixit and the sharp ends were located near eye
level of the dog in the enclosure. Wire panels were coming down into two separate enclosures housing adult dogs;
one had multiple sharp points along its edge and one had a sharp point at the corner. Although these panels were
located above the dogs' heads, they were within reach of the dogs. These sharp points increase the risk of injury to
the dogs. The licensee did fix the sharps that were identified during the inspection. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs at all times.
To be corrected by: Corrected during inspection.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
****Premises
Around the sheltered building, there were tall weeds (approximately 2-3 feet tall) growing all along the outside
portion of the enclosures. There was also clutter (Wood boards, PVC pipe, plastic barrels, and wire panels)
accumulated in this same area. Tall weeds, grass, bushes and clutter can harbor insects, pests, and vermin. The
insects, pests and vermin can bite and irritate the dogs, contaminate the environment, food and water, and increase
the risk of potential disease to the dogs. The licensee must remove the clutter and weeds and maintain them to
prevent or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin.
