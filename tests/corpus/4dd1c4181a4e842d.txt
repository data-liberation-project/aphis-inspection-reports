HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In Chucky the rhesus macaque's enclosure there were fire hoses that had a green film or residue that needs to
be cleaned or replaced. Also his night house had an abundance of dirt and other unknow particles accumulating
that needs to be cleaned. Hard surfaces in which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot cleaned daily
and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards.
***In Pamela the spider monkey's night house there was old feces in the rear of it and had not been spot-cleaned
daily. Hard surfaces in which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized to
prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the primary enclosure containing two tigers, Agitha and Athena, there is a wood post that should be supporting
the right side of the roof of the cage. This post has partially fallen and is no longer attached to the adjacent posts.
This wooden post needs to repaired to keep the roof of the cage from falling and injuring the animals. The primary
enclosure shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
***The primary enclosure for Tabitha the tiger is in disrepair. There is a gap between the top fencing and the bottom
gate wide enough for the tiger to get its head through it. This gap needs to be closed so that the tiger can't get out of
the enclosure. The enclosure shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to contain the
animals.
***The coatimundi's cage has an old rusted wire fence on the inner side of the newer fencing. Parts of this older
fencing has broken pointy ends. The coatimundi's climb all over the cage and the pointy ends could potentially
injure the animals. The fencing of the primary enclosure shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.
***In the grizzly bears primary enclosure there is a large hole that is directly beneath a thin concrete slab. Since the
concrete is so thin and the hole beneath it is so large, with the constant traffic of the bears walking on it, it could
potentially collapse causing injury to the bears. The flooring in the enclosure shall be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
