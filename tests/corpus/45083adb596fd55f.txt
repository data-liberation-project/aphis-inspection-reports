2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was one guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. In Pen 27, there was a black and white adult guinea pig
housed with 10 other guinea pigs that appeared lethargic with labored breathing. The guinea pig was sitting in one place
and not moving and had large chest movements with an audible raspy breathing noise. The licensee had observed the
condition in the animal but was not currently administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care addressed
the condition and provided treatment options.
Respiratory conditions can cause distress and worsen or spread to other animals if not treated.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to evaluate the animal or initiate treatment according to the Program
of Veterinary Care.
