***An adult white rabbit with black ears had a large swelling on the right side of the face, just above the nose. The
skin around the swelling was reddened. The right nostril was inflamed and larger when compared with the left.
Beneath the swelling and near the right nostril, there was a crusted area of dried blood. A yellow discharge was on
the fur underneath both the left and right nostrils.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility.
The facility must have this rabbit examined by a veterinarian by 6:00 p.m on October 27, 2017, to obtain accurate
diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the observed clinical signs. The outcome of this consultation must be
provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all
diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed
along with the dosing instructions. The facility must provide documentation of entries on a log and/or calendar
and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animal.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of the animal
at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the
need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the facility must ensure that all animals at the facility are observed daily and provided with
adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The
program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
