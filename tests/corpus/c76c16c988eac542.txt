2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition records for a serval, 2 fennec foxes, a wallaby, a hedgehog, 5 goats, and a ring-tailed lemur were
missing (missing required information included name and address, USDA license number or vehicle license number
and driver’s license number, the date of acquisition, species and number of animals). Lack of accurate information
on the acquisition and disposition of animals can compromise a trace-back investigation during a disease outbreak.
Every dealer shall make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the following information:
name and address of person from whom the animals were acquired, USDA license number, vehicle license number
and state, and driver's license number.
3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
The Flemish Giant rabbit's enclosure has evidence of debris and fly strike build-up on the walls of the enclosure.
Lack of appropriate cage cleaning and sanitization can lead to disease risks for the rabbit. Primary enclosures for
rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
Correct by 6/13/2019.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wolf enclosure contains an electrical socket on a post and has an exposed electrical cord leading to a working
submerged pool pump plugged into it. Access to electricity, especially with water contact, poses a significant
hazard to the wolf housed in this enclosure. Outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury. Correct from this day forward.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The following enclosures have insufficient shade to allow the animals contained within to protect themselves from
direct sunlight: Kangaroos, coati, wolf, serval, goats, sheep and 3 pot bellied pig enclosures. The inability to protectthemselves from sunlight on this day with temperatures reading between 94 and 96 degrees F at 1330 can quickly
cause significant distress, overheating, and heat exhaustion. When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or
discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or artificial means shall be provided. Correct by 6/5/2019.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The perimeter fence surrounding the property does not reach the ground in many areas (1/3 of fence line). The
gap ranges between 4 and 5.5 inches. The non-secure perimeter fence does not prevent animals from going under
it and having contact with the animals in the facility, which could cause them harm. Per the regulations, the
perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals.
*The wolf enclosure does not have an 8 foot perimeter fence on one of four sides of the enclosure. There is a 6 foot
fence present on that side. Per the regulations, an 8 foot high fence for potentially dangerous animals (wolf) is
required.
Correct by 6/27/2019.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Evidence of rodents (holes and droppings) were noted in the wolf, cavy and fox enclosures and the feed room.
Excessive numbers of flies were present in the following enclosures: fox, sloth, zebra/watusi/cattle/zebu, kangaroo,
camel, three pot-bellied pig enclosures and the feed room. The presence of rodents and flies can lead to disease
transmission, which can lead to illness for the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects,
ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct by 6/13/2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
