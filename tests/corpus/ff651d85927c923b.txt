ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at
8:40am-9:15am on 19-APR-18.
The inspector tried to make contact at the facility and by phone. A voice mail was left on the number on file when
the inspector could not make contact at the facility and again 5 minutes before the inspector left the premise. The
inspector stayed in the facilities driveway for 35 minutes and was not able to make contact with a facility
representative at that time.
