Facilities, general.
A few of the enclosures have had small sections of the primary wire cut to facilitate access to the large water tubs for
drainage. The created openings are large enough that if an animal were to move the tubs they would have access to the
opening and could put an appendage through. Some type of mesh door should be secured over the openings to ensure
that the enclosures are secure to prevent injury and and contain the animals.
