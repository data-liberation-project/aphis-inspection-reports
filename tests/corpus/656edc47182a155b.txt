2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Direct NCI: There is a brown Dachshund male (#20) that has an excessive dark brown buildup on both upper canines and
last upper left molar. The left molar has the majority of its roots showing and is very loose. The dog flinches when the
mouth area was being examined. The pre-molar on the upper left side had a gray puss type material between the tooth
and gum line. The gums were red and inflamed and showed definite recession throughout the mouth. The dog has
multiple teeth missing and has not received any dental care or been seen by a veterinarian.

The lack of timely dental care and monitoring can cause serious dental/health issues that can cause unnecessary pain
and discomfort to the regulated animals.

The licensee must contact a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the dental issues. The use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries are required under the AWA regulation and
standards.

NCI-The licensee has not been providing the monthly Heartworm treatments according to their program of veterinary care
(PVC) as written by their attending veterinarian.

The lack of preventative heartworm methods could allow for the regulated animals to become infected with the parasite,
which if left untreated could be lethal to the animal.

The licensee must follow the program of veterinary care for all aspects of their management of their dogs under the
attending veterinarians direction.
