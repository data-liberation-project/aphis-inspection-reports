All of the health issues identified above are significantly impacting animal health and well being. Daily observation of
these animals is not effective. Thus, health issues are not identified within a timely manner. It is the licensees
responsibility that daily observations are completed appropriately and effectively. Additionally, there must be a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure all health issues areaddressed within a timely manner, to include the animals identified above.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bottom of one enclosure containing an adult female, RN-2751, was identified to be in disrepair. There was a
sharp piece of flooring material, with rusted edges, protruding upward into the enclosure. Dried blood was observed
on the floor. The female contained in the enclosure and the male that had access to the enclosure were examined
and did not appear to have any active/open abrasions or wounds at the time of inspection. Sharp materials within an
enclosure can cause injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.
