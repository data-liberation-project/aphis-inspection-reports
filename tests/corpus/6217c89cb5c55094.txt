2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During inspection, the coati was noticed to have increasing hair loss on the tail (compared to previous inspections) and a
wound on the lateral aspect of the left hock. Additionally, the wolf was seen continuously pacing around the enclosure in
a stereotypic pattern, wearing a deep track into the substrate in the enclosure. The lead inspector contacted both the
Attending Veterinarian and the additional veterinarian that had been out to the facility in the last 2 months to identify
whether the facility had contacted the vet regarding the wound and hair loss on the coati and the behavior of the wolf.
The inspectors spoke with the attending veterinarian regarding his visit focused on hoof care on 7 September 2021. He
stated that no additional concerns have been brought to his attention, but that the additional veterinarian had been out to
the facility more recently. The additional vet had done a walk through visit at the facility on 24 September 2021, but she
stated that no specific concerns have been brought to her attention by the facility.
Direct and frequent communication from the facility to the veterinarian is required so that the veterinarian receives timely
and accurate information on problems of animal health and behavior. Failure to do so may be harmful to the welfare of
the animals.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, the records of acquisition and disposition, as well as the animals on hand were not up to date -
the record of animals on hand had not been updated since May 2021. Only one health certificate was available for
review, and the specific details for the two foxes that had been acquired were not available. Facility was given the chance
to supply the records, as the licensee stated that the records were offsite at the time of inspection. The facility did not
provide the complete records for the foxes or specific dates or details required under 2.75(b)(1) for acquisition and
disposition of other animals.
Accurate and complete records of acquisition and disposition are important to ensure the welfare of the animals.

Correct for all future inspections.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence around the enclosures for the largest carnivores had several items (fence panels, decks, ladder)
leaning up against the fence that decreased the effective height of the fence. There was also a den box adjacent to the
perimeter fence that decreased the effective height of the perimeter fence. Most of the items were moved away from the
fence during inspection, except for the den box. A perimeter fence must keep people and animals from going under or
through the fence and act as secondary containment in the event that an animal escapes from its enclosure. Failure to
maintain the required effective height of the perimeter fence could allow an animal to easily escape the perimeter fence in
the event that the animal is no longer contained within the primary enclosure.
