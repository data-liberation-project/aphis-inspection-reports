SANITATION.
Chapter 3 page 20 and Chapter 6 page 67
Animals on study were housed on covered concrete enclosures containing 4 to 6 animals per pen. The enclosures
contained an excessive amount of waste. The protocol states enclosures will be cleaned typically 2 times per week.
The enclosures were cleaned yesterday afternoon, however, an excessive accumulation of waste was present
during the inspection. Enclosures must be cleaned frequently enough to ensure that the animals are kept
reasonably dry, clean and provided with comfortable healthful surroundings. Corrected during inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
