2.8
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The inspector went to the licensee's site 002 at 1:00 PM and no one answered the door. The inspector called the
number on file for the facility and spoke with a facility representative. The representative told the inspector that this
site is no longer used by the facility and they have vacated the premises. If the licensee does not make APHIS
aware that a site is no longer active, then APHIS will waste time and resources when sending an inspector to the
site for an inspection. Therefore APHIS will have less time and resources to ensure animal welfare at other facilities.
The licensee shall notify APHIS by certified mail that this site is no longer active and needs to be cancelled. The
letter shall be mailed to:
USDA/APHIS/AC
2150 Centre Ave.
Building B, Mailstop 3W11
Fort Collins, CO 80526-8117
