3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height, during the inspection, there were 3
guinea pigs observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times
and does not allow them to escape.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
