ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The brown and white guinea pig from pen 23 was moved to a "sick pen" and treated. The discharge which was
accumulated around both nostrils has resolved and breathing appears normal. The right eye, however, is now
discolored darkly red around the rim of the cornea. The center of the red area is white and opaque.
The right eye of black, white, and gold guinea pig in pen 20 appears resolved. Today the left eye appears sunken
and has a significant amount of yellowish discharge accumulated in the front corner. Some dried discharge and
debris has accumulated on the lids and hair around the left eye.
These guinea pigs continue to require veterinary care for their health and well being. Though their previous
conditions were treated and resolved, additional health concerns have developed. Licensee must use appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. These animals must be examined by a
licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and
plan shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials
Remains Uncorrected
