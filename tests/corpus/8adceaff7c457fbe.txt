*** The alpaca is heavily matted and needs to be sheared. Matted fur can cause skin irritations and does not
provide adequate protection from the elements. This animal needs to be sheared on a routine basis as part of its
preventative husbandry routine for its comfort and well- being.
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The wooden shelter box for the Ring tail lemurs is not sealed and the wood in the back sheltered building for the

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The coyote pen has exposed chainlink wire on the bottom of the enclosure. Exposed wire can entrap a paw and
cause injury to the animal. Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Ensure that the floor wire is adequately covered to protect the animal(cid:25)'s feet and limbs. *** The cougar enclosure has a wood sheltered box that is constructed of plywood. The box is not lined inside with
any material to add structural strength to the sheltered area. This needs to be addressed to assure containment for
the species.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The freezer storing meat for the big cats and exotics at the facility needs to be addressed. There are boxes of
unidentified meat in bags in the freezer. There is one box with a pig covered with a towel stacked on other boxes.
There are no dates on any of the meat and no rotation schedule to assure food is used in a timely manner.
Additionally there is no way to clean the area and there is ice build up along several boxes indicating that moisture
is getting into the freezer area. The method of food being stored in this freezer is not considered professionally
acceptable to assure the food is protected from deterioration and contamination.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Significant amounts of standing water and/or mud are evident in multiple enclosures.
*** The raccoon enclosure contains standing water and heavy mud covering at least two-thirds of the area.
*** The hyena enclosure contains heavy mud and standing water throughout the entire area. The only area that is
potentially dry is inside a dog house shelter. The animal had muddy paws and legs as it walked around the sides of
the enclosure.
*** The lion shelter contains standing water, providing no dry shelter from inclement weather. Additionally, areas in
the main enclosure had areas of standing water and the sand in the enclosure has algae growth due to moisture.
*** All 3 pig enclosures contain standing water with feces and heavy mud. The only potentially dry areas are inside
the housing structures.
*** The enclosure housing three foxes had areas of standing water including under the shelter where their food was
located.
*** The bear enclosure had multiple areas of standing water.***The lion and tiger enclosures also had areas of standing water and the animals had limited areas that were dry.
Standing water and mud can lead to hoof or foot problems and other health concerns for the animals that cannot get
or stay dry. Additionally being wet for extender periods of time may be distressing to the animals and impact their
well being. The facility needs to take immediate action to facilitate drainage in these enclosures for the health of the
animals.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
*** There was an abundance of flies throughout the property and animal enclosures during the inspection. The
excess standing water in multiple enclosures and around the area is a breeding ground for pests and bacteria, as
well as the excess weeds in several enclosures. The facility needs to have a safe and effective program for the
control of insects and ectoparasites for the health of the animals.

EMPLOYEES.
*** Based on the number of non- compliant items in this report and previous reports, it is evident that the facility
does not have a sufficient number of employees to maintain the current professional level of husbandry practices.
The facility needs to take steps to correct this for the welfare of the animals at the facility.
