3.78(d)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The facility has constructed a new outdoor enclosure and perimeter fence since the last inspection. Although the
the perimeter fence is of sufficient height (six feet), it doesn't entirely surround the outdoor enclosure. The
perimeter fence stops approximately four feet short of where it would connect to the facility wall, midway and
perpendicular to a set of concrete of stairs that lead down to the basement. The lack of a continuous perimeter
fence could allow unauthorized persons and animals to access the outdoor enclosure.
Assure the perimeter fence is constructed to prevent unauthorized persons and animals from going around it or
through it.
