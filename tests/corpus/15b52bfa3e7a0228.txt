ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:45 am on
08-Nov-18.
I called the facility at 9:40 am leaving a message stating I was on my way. I arrived at the facility at 9:45 am. When I
arrived the owner;s dog was standing at the door so I called to let them know I was there to conduct an inspection in
which no one answered. I drove up to the rabbit facility to see if anyone was there and no one was available. I came
back to the residence where I waited. I called the owner again at 10:13 am to let them know that I was leaving the
premises and that this visit would be an attempted inspection.
