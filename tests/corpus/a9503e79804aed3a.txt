3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The majority of the 72 white tubs on the racks had fecal material consolidated into a wet pad under the hay inside
the enclosures. There was brown scale and staining buildup on the sides of the enclosures. The licensee stated the
enclosures were last cleaned 10 days ago. Too much feces, liquid waste and staining is accumulating between the
cleaning interval. The accumulation of feces and wet bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections with
bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, wet bedding, staining, and debris. In addition, the enclosures must
be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
