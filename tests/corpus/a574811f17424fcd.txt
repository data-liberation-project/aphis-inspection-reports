2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Patagonian Cavy, "Harvey", was purchased in July of 2015. The licensee had not worked with a veterinarian to
obtain a written program of veterinary care.
The lack of guidance for appropriate methods to maintain the health of the specie can cause preventable injury or
disease to happen and/or the wrong treatment and care for the animal when something does occur. The licensee
must make formal arrangements with an appropriate and knowledgeable veterinarian for any new specie added to
the collection including a written program of veterinary care before or at the time of the acquisition.

Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative and ACI Bartels.
