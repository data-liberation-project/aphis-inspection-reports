2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***At the time of inspection, there was not an identifiable attendant present at all times when the public is allowed
contact with the animals. The public is allowed access/contact with regulated animals such as fallow deer and goats
on a self-guided tour of the facility's grounds. There was 1 attendant present in the ticket booth at the beginning of
the inspection; however, the ticket booth faces away from the animal enclosures. This attendant is responsible for
selling tickets and merchandise, filling food cups and periodically monitoring the animal area. The absence of an
attendant, whose sole responsibility is to oversee public contact with the animals, in these areas endangers the
health of the animals by potentially allowing activity (rough handling, improper feeding, etc.) that is harmful to the
animals. The licensee must ensure during periods of public contact, a responsible, knowledgeable and readily
identifiable attendant is present in these areas at all times.
Corrected at the time of inspection, as a second attendant arrived to oversee the animal areas.

WATERING.
***The enclosure housing 75 fallow deer and the enclosure housing 6 goats had dirty water receptacles. There was
a buildup of green debris on the interior surface of the receptacles along with green debris floating on top of the
water. Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the animals
are provided with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate
hydration. Water receptacles should be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry
practices.
