HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four exterior kennel runs connected to the main kennel building were found to have ends of wire strands protruding
into runs occupied by dogs. The exposed sharp ends of wire are a potential injury hazard to the dogs occupying the
kennels. Any surfaces of housing facilities must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the
animals

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Eight exterior doorways leading from occupied runs into the main kennel building were found to have exposed
wood surfaces.. Wood on some doorways also showed areas of wear and damage with rough surfaces and edges.
Exposed and damaged wood surfaces may absorb moisture and are difficult to clean and sanitize. All surfaces must
be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must replaced or
repaired.
