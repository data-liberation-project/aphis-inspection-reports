2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On or about July 26, 2016, an adult female was injured by a five year old, adult, female, black Spider monkey
identified by the name 'Meya' and microchip number 052-353-838. The injury occurred during an event at a public
park in Iowa. The monkey was on public display and being handled by the public at a picnic table area. The licensee
stated that an adult female approached the spider monkey in a way that spooked it; which resulted in a bite to the
left arm. The licensee also stated she was present and next to the monkey when it happened, but failed to prevent
the incident. There were no public barriers in place during the exhibition and when the injury occurred.
Failure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers during public exhibition can be a safety hazard for the animal
and/or the public. During public exhibition, the animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the
animal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
To be corrected this day forward.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
