2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** At least 6 litters of puppies were found to have incomplete information on their cage cards. The information
provided on the current card included the number of the puppies in the litter and the date of birth. The current record
keeping system does not give each puppy a unique individual number, description of the puppy and other
information described in sections 2.51 and 2.75a(1). Failure to properly identify animals impedes the inspection
process and makes animal tracking difficult to impossible. Puppies need to be individually identified with all
necessary information. Correct this by ensuring proper identification to all adult dogs and puppies at the facility.
