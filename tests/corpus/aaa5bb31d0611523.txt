INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives.
1. Review of Protocol 15-009: The IACUC approved protocol did not contain a written narrative description of the
methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to the procedure that may cause more
than momentary pain and or distress to the guinea pigs that is described in the protocol.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall determine when reviewing a proposal for animal use that the
principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain
or distress to the animals and that the investigator has provided a written narrative description of the methods and
sources used to determine that alternatives were not available. This requirement is important to ensure that the
procedures in the proposal involving animals minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for this protocol.
Correct by 9/15/15.
2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Proposal to conduct activities using animals.
1. Review of Protocols #15-009 & #02-018: Both of these IACUC approved protocols contain research activity that
may result in the local reaction of skin ulceration in the study animals (guinea pigs and rabbits respectively).
However neither of these protocols contains a description of the use of drugs or other procedures designed to
assure that discomfort and pain to the animals will be minimized if skin ulceration develops in the study animals as a
result of the research activity.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a description ofprocedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for
the conduct of scientifically valuable research, including provision for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and
tranquilizing drugs where indicated and appropriate to minimize discomfort and pain to animals.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for these 2 protocols.
Correct by 9/15/15.
