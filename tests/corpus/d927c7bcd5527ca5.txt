ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15 PM on
05-Sep-19.
The inspector arrived at the registrant's address at 1:15 PM. The facility located at the address was a gas station /
deli, called Phin Deli Town Buford, that was out of business with all the doors and windows shuttered with plywood
and locked. No one was found at the location. It was deserted. The inspector then called the number on file for the
registrant. No one answered so the inspector left a voicemail. After 10 minutes someone returned the call. The
person stated that they were not the applicant, and the applicant was unknown to them. The person stated that the
phone number was new to them as of two weeks ago.
