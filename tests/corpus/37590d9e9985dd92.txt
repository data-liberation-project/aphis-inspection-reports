2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Hache-Hi, a 17 year old male wolf, was observed to have a stiff, slow gait. He is on joint supplements, however his
arthritis seems to have progressed enough to require more aggressive treatment to promote his comfort. His stiff
movement and resulting gait abnormalities can cause abnormal nail wear or overgrowth. This can also affect his
gait, resulting in a vicious cycle. This wolf needs to be evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) to determine if
additional treatment can help him to be more comfortable. Correct by contacting the AV immediately to request that
she evaluate this animal within 10 days, by April 21, 2017.
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was written nearly five years ago (7/23/2012) and hasn't been updated.
Some provisions are not being followed, such as annual fecal exams and sedating animals routinely every three
years for a full physical exam. The PVC should be rewritten with the AV and licensee in collaboration. It should be
reviewed regularly to ensure that routine husbandry and veterinary care procedures are fully addressed and that the
plan is being followed as written. Correct within 30 days, by May 11, 2017.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Wapithe,a 17 year old female wolf, has soiling around her perineal area. This may indicate an illness such as a
urinary tract infection. Daily observation to note changes such as the soiling is required so that problems can be
reported to the Attending Veterinarian in a timely manner to be addressed. Correct by contacting the AV today to
schedule a visit within 10 days, by April 21, 2017.
