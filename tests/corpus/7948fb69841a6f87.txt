Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
At the time of inspection, there is not a complete and documented plan for environmental enhancement of primates, to
promote the psychological well-being of all inventoried primate species. The plan, at a minimum, must address social
grouping, environmental enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and restraint devices and their use. The plan
and environmental enrichment must be approved by the attending veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to
the animals on the environmental enhancement plan. Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs
that need to be addressed when in captivity. A written plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional
standards, and available for review by APHIS officials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of these
animals is being appropriately addressed. Licensee must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for
environmental enhancement of all inventoried nonhuman primates that is in accordance with currently accepted
professional standards and as directed by the AV.

Separation.


On July 2, 2021, a 7-year-old castrated male capybara named "Francis" did not recover from anesthesia, which was
induced to examine and treat wounds sustained following interaction with the animal's female sibling, "Spring." "Francis"
was anesthetized previously on June 30, 2021 for surgical treatment of a facial abscess following unsuccessful antibiotic
therapy. Despite reintroduction with no observed aggressive behaviors noted, on July 1, keepers noted that "Francis" had
superficial scratches along his flank, presumed to be the result of interactions with "Spring." Later that day, "Francis" was
found with a large wound and fresh blood along his side, at which time he was separated from "Spring" and given
additional pain medication. "Francis" seemed stressed and did not eat his medicated food or move much overnight, and
so the decision was made to anesthetize him again for further examination and treatment. During anesthesia, "Francis"
experienced difficulty breathing due to suspected pulmonary bruising; although there was no penetration into the chest
cavity, bite wounds were noted on the neck and lateral chest which penetrated deeply into musculature. Despite
supportive care, "Francis" did not recover from anesthesia. Leaving these two animals together in the same enclosure
after initially discovering the superficial scratches allowed aggression to continue, resulting in further trauma to "Francis"
and leading to worse injury, deterioration of his health status, and death. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure
must be compatible. The licensee must ensure that animals are immediately evaluated and separated whenever there is
evidence of incompatibility to prevent distress and injuries that could result.
