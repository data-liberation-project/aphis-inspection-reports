Feeding.
The rabbits are currently being fed pellets and hay on the ground which was scattered and mixed in with feces with no
food receptacle present. The rabbits’ feed is placed where the rabbits’ excreta can contaminate the food supplied.
Contamination of feed by excreta can lead to the spread of disease and/or inappetence. All food fed must not be
contaminated with excreta and, if food receptacles are used, they shall be kept clean and sanitized at least once every 2
weeks.

Watering.
The water receptacle for the rabbits was a plastic bowl on the ground that is being cleaned with water and a sponge only,
without any sanitization. Unclean and unsanitary drinking water can cause illness and disease in the rabbits. All watering
receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty and at least once every 2 weeks.

Feeding.
The food receptacles for the lemurs are hand washed with water and a sponge daily with a disinfecting wipe a couple
times a week. The food receptacles are not being properly cleaned with a detergent or sanitized correctly. Not cleaning
and sanitizing their food receptacles properly creates risk for contamination by excreta, pests and/or disease. Food


receptacles must be kept clean and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the following methods: 1)
live steam under pressure, or 2) washing with hot water (at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit) and soap or detergent, or 3)
washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent/disinfectant product that accomplishes the same purpose, with a
thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove organic material first, and then to provide sanitization followed by a clean
water rinse, or as often as necessary to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
