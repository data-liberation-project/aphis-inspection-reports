3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The front right corner of the perimeter fence surrounding the enclosure housing two large brown bears, was not secured
and bent outward. This created a gap in the perimeter fence which did not meet the minimum height requirement of 8
feet.

Animals and unauthorized people could use this gap in the perimeter fence to enter and exit the area and gain access to
the animals behind it.

The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a
secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.

To be corrected before the next relicense inspection.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
Applicant.



All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 24, 2022, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
