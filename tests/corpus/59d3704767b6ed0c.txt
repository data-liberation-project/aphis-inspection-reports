ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult, male, Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that is irregular in shape,
approximately 4 inches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth had
numerous flies crawling on it. The licensee claims this camel will be going to a veterinary specialist to be evaluated,
to date this has not happened.
***Eight goats, two sheep, and one zebu have overgrown hooves due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to
appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries. As part of the
facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof
care in a timely manner.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility. The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plans for the problems cited above. From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all
animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the
program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In an enclosure housing eleven goats, two portions of the chain linked fencing were in disrepair. The bottom of
the chain linked fence along two opposing sides of the enclosure was not secured to the ground, creating a gap
between the bottom of the fence and the ground. The sharp points at the bottom of the fence were facing into the
enclosure where the animals could come into contact with them.***A portion of the ceiling of the coati enclosure was in disrepair. Several of the wires were broken, creating gaps in
the structure. Additionally, there were loose metal wires with sharp points that were protruding into the enclosure.
***An enclosure that housed both sheep and goats had a broken wood board that was hanging down into the
enclosure. The edges of the broken wood boards were jagged and splintered, and were directly exposed to the
animals in the enclosure and present a risk of injury.
***An enclosure that housed seventeen sheep had broken metal fencing with sharp points and broken wooden
boards with jagged, splintered edges. There were gaps in both the metal and wooden fencing that were large
enough for the animals’ horns, head, or limbs, could become stuck.
***An enclosure housing one Dromedary camel, “Coco,” contained sharp points and had fencing in disrepair. Metal
wires, which were in place to tie wooden boards to the bottom of the chain linked fence for support, had sharp
points that were protruding out into the enclosure. “Coco” was observed by the APHIS inspectors, eating the wood
board that was on the goat side of the fence. Ingestion of this wood can present a risk of injury to the animal.
***The enclosure housing eleven goats in the barn had rust along the lower parts of the metal walls, which extended
up the wall at least 10 inches in height in some areas. The rusted metal exposed many areas of jagged, splintered
pieced of wood underneath. In the areas where the metal was rusted through, sharp metal edges were created and
pointed into the enclosure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in
order to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to
ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There were many flies around the animals on the premises. They were primarily on the chest pad growth of the
adult, male, Dromedary camel, Zo, the eland, and the water buffalo. These insects can potentially transmit bacteria,
viruses, and parasites that can have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals. There needs to
be an effective program for control of insects and other pests where the animals and their food are being stored to
prevent the spread of disease and maintain the animals overall health and well-being.
