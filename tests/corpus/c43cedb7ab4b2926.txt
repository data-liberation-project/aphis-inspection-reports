SANITATION.
CLEANING OF ENCLOSURES-
There continues to be an accumulation of grime and other organic matter on the kinkajou enclosure floor and
railings. Organic accumulations must be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the two
animals, minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
HOUSEKEEPING -
The linoleum tiles, which were dislodged from the floor of the hedgehog room, have not been repaired or replaced.
Additionally, the linoleum floor in the room holding rabbits and guinea pigs is still torn in several locations. Debris
can accumulate in these damaged areas. The damaged linoleum must be removed, repaired or replaced to keep
the floors in good repair in order to facilitate the presecribed husbandry practices.
Additionally, there are accumulations of empty enclosures, tanks, boxes, house hold items, spilled bedding and
other miscellaneous materials stored haphazardly throughout the rear rooms of the facility. Items that are stored in
such a manner create areas that may harbor pests. These areas must be cleared and appropriately organized in
order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. 3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
PEST CONTROL-
Large numbers of flies are again present in the hedgehog room as well as the room housing the rabbits, guinea pigs
and reptiles. Flies are again present around the organic accumulations on the floor of the kinkajou enclosure. Fly
strips are present in these rooms, however, they are no longer effective in decreasing the large numbers of flies. A
safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
