and mildly ulcerated skin underneath.

All of these animals were still in their original enclosures at the time of inspection and had not been identified by the
licensee. Animals with missing hair were not separated as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care and the Attending
Veterinarian had not been contacted about any of the animals with skin issues, eye issues, or a head tilt.

The licensee was also asked about the animals identified on the USDA Inspection Report dated November 23, 2021. The
licensee stated that none of those animals were examined by the Attending Veterinarian. The guinea pig with the rectal
prolapse was found dead in it’s enclosure and the animals with skin issues were treated with Ivermec, not the Miconazole
Nitrate recommended by the Attending Veterinarian for animals with possible ringworm. The licensee stated that guinea
pigs whose condition improved with the Ivermec were returned to their enclosures while the remaining guinea pigs were
sold at auction, including the guinea pigs noted to have the safety pins in their ears.

A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the Attending Veterinarian can result in delay of
care, worsening of health issues, and further spread of disease. Instructions provided by the Attending Veterinarian must
be followed to prevent further pain and distress to the animals as well as limiting the spread of disease.


Correct by observing all animals on a daily basis, following the instructions provided in the Program of Veterinary Care,
and having all of the aforementioned animals examined by the Attending Veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee stated that the animals listed on the USDA inspection report dated November 23, 2021 whose skin lesions
did not improve were sold at auction. However, the licensee had no record of sale of these animals.

Breeders and dealers are required to make, keep, and maintain records which fully disclose animals disposed of,
including those sold to auction. Failure to do so impedes attempts to follow-up on animal care and welfare.

Correct by maintaining records of all animals sold, including auctions. Correct by December 8, 2021.
3.25(a)

Facilities, general.
Three guinea pigs were observed to be loose within the building housing the guinea pigs.

Enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair so as to contain the animals and protect them from
injury. Loose guinea pigs are susceptible to injury and even death. Correct by ensuring guinea pig enclosures properly
contain the animals. Correct by December 18, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
