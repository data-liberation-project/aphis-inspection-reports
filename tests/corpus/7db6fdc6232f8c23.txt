3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The coati mundi is housed in an enclosure that has a floor partially constructed of metal. A metal section of the
floor near the south side of the enclosure has been damaged by the animal with a resulting hole approximately 6
inches in diameter. The rough edges of the hole have been pulled into the enclosure. Continued damage to the floor
can contribute to possible escape and/or injury to the animal.
*The metal shelter used to protect the sheep and goats from inclement weather is deteriorated and dilapidated.
This shelter is in such a state of disrepair that it does not appear safe for animal access because of the risk of injury
to animals. The shelter appears structurally unsound with sagging sides and roof and has a deteriorated back wall
with a resulting large hole.
* The primary enclosures housing the sheep and goats and guanacos and deer has a shared chain link fence that is
damaged. The damaged section of fence, located at the east side of the enclosures next to the sheep and goat
shelter, is partially collapsed.
Housing facilities must be kept in good repair in order to safely contain the animals and prevent injury. The
damaged areas described above should be repaired or replaced.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
