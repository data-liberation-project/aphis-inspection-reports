RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There is one 7006 that has a disposition date of 8/4/2016 in block #1, 8/5/16 in block #12 and 8/4/2016 in block
#5D. This gives the appearance of a 1 day old puppy being sold. Upon further review of pet registry paperwork
shows the sale date to be 10/11/2016. The licensee also marked the wrong puppy as died. Having the wrong dates
and information on the 7005 and 7006 shows the potential wrong doing in the dog business. The 7006 must
accurately reflect the required information on the animals that leave your facility.
To be corrected on all future 7005 and 7006 from this date forward.
3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are four enclosures with heat lamps in them. These heat lamps are at a height that allow the dogs and
puppies to burn themselves on the hot bulbs. There are no covers on the heat lamps to protect the dogs not only
from burning themselves but if the bulb breaks from the glass shards. All enclosures must be designed and
maintained to protect the dogs from injury.
To be corrected by 11-24-2016
