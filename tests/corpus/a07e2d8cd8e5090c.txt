FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
There was a strong ammonia odor during inspection. I could feel a burning sensation in my eyes and throat during
the inspection, which suggests that ammonia levels are too high. There were no methods in place to provide fresh
air flow for the guinea pigs. Strong ammonia odors can cause animals to get sick easier and can cause them
discomfort. While maintaining the animal housing area temperature between 60 and 85 degrees F, fresh air flow
must be provided that minimizes drafts, odors, and moisture condensation.
