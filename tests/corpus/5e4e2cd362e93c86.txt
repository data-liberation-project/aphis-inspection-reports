INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***During a surgical procedure performed for Protocol HN01P (non-survival), procedures were performed that were
not originally included in the protocol. The protocol was approved for minor surgical procedures and additional
tissue harvest post euthanasia but the PI deviated from the approved procedures and entered the abdominal cavity
to harvest additional tissues before the pig was euthanized. When the Veterinary Technician saw the PI opening the
abdominal cavity she immediately notified the Veterinarian. The procedure was stopped and the pig was
euthanized. The event was investigated and the corrective actions implemented are appropriate.
