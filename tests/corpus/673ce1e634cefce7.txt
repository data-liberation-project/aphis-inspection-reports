Watering.
There was brown colored water in the water bowls. The water bowls are being used in addition to automatic water
receptacles in the guinea pig enclosures. Failure to keep water bowls clean can increase health risks. Open containers
such as water bowls must be placed or attached to the primary enclosures in a manner that minimizes contamination from
excreta. All water receptacles must be sanitized when dirty. Correct by February 3, 2023.
