FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is inadequate shade inside the enclosure housing one adult pig named "Magnum P.I.G.". The only shade
that was observed was a small area next to the shelter. There was no other areas inside the enclosure for this
animal to protect itself from the direct sunlight throughout the day. Adequate shade needs to be provided so that
the animal does not become uncomfortable, distressed or overheated. Provide sufficient shade so that it allows all
animals housed outdoors to be protected from the direct sunlight.
