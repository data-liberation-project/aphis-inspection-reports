HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures in the back nursery room had broken wires on a section of the floor panel. This exposes sharp
points that dogs could possiby contact. Sharp points could injure dogs. Maintain surfaces that dogs contact free
from sharp or jagged edges.
Correct by 2/16/14.
3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Ventilation.
The green buidling and the nursery building were observed to have a strong ammonia odor throughout inspection.
Exhaust fans were not running when we entered the buildings and were turned on when we mentioned the the
ammonia odors to the licensees. We noted a burning sensation in our throats in both buildings and in the nursery
our eyes also felt a burning sensation. This suggests that ammonia levels in these areas are too high. High
ammonia levels can make animals sick. For the animal's health, more fresh air-flow must be provided while
maintaining appropriate indoor temperatures.
Correct and maintain adequate ventilation (decrease ammonia odors) by 2/17/14.
Inspection conducted with licensees on 2/13/14. Exit interview conducted with licensee via phone on 2/14/14.
