ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) lacks specific guidance for the use of ivermectin and the drug
Uniprim. The PVC states to dilute 10% ivermectin to a 1:10 solution and use it as a spray. No guidance is included
for amount to spray each guinea pig or how often to treat the animals. Additionally, the ivermectin product produced
by the licensee is 5mg/ml and not a 10% solution. The licensee's wife stated that they are considering using a
syringe to dose each individual animal but have not received guidance from the attending veterinarian yet. The use
of this drug without specific guidance from the attending veterinary can be dangerous or ineffective. Correct this by
contacting the attending veterinarian and follow specific recommendations for the use of these drug.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The following animals were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection:
- Two adult guinea pigs (one brown and white in enclosure 22, and one black and white in enclosure 35) were
found with approximately 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch masses in the lower jaw/neck area. These masses were found to be
smooth and firm when felt by inspectors.
- A juvenile brown and white guinea pig in enclosure 30 was found to be weak and reluctant to move. Even when
approached by other guinea pigs in the enclosure, this juvenile remained almost completely still and not moving.
- A tan and white adult guinea pig in enclosure 18 was observed with a head tilt to the right. This animal was
observed to have a continuous head tilt when walking, drinking, and eating.
- A brown and white adult guinea pig in enclosure 24 was found with a completely opaque right eye. This eye was
dark red around the edges with the center being milky white and appeared to be protruding from the rest of the eye.
- A brown and white adult guinea pig in enclosure 15 was found with a head tilt to the right. This animal was
observed to have a continuous head tilt when walking, eating, and drinking in its enclosure.
- A black and white adult guinea pig in enclosure 26 was found to have an abnormal gait and was bobbing its head
excessively while walking. This guinea pig appeared to have this excessive head bobbing continuously while
walking and drinking in the enclosure.All of these animals are in need of veterinary care. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to have
these animals examined and follow all recommendations for treatment. Failure to provide appropriate methods to
prevent, control, and treat disease and injuries can lead to suffering in the animals.

2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Seven animals were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection, all of which were found by
inspectors and not known by the licensee. In addition, 6 dead animals were found by inspectors during this
inspection that had not been identified or documented by the licensee. Failure to provide daily observation to
ensure there is a mechanism in place to assess the animals well-being and convey information on problems with
the animals to the attending veterinarian may lead to suffering in the animals. Correct this by ensuring daily
observation of all animals is accomplished and all problems with the animals are discovered and addressed in a
timely manner.
Correct from this day forward
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** This facility currently has no records of animals on hand or births. The sale records produced by the licensee
show numbers of animals being sold but many did not include dates of the sales. A calendar is being used to
records death but only for adult animals. There are also no records of total numbers of animals on hand at the
facility. Failure to provide current accurate records impedes the inspection process and makes animal tracking
impossible, which is especially important in the case of a disease outbreak. This facility must develop and maintain
a record keeping system that correctly discloses all required information in Section 2.75.
3.25(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The front walls and some side walls of the enclosures in this facility still measure 6 inches in height.
Additionally, the current design of the watering system allows the guinea pigs to possibly escape as the holes in the
backs of the enclosures are large enough for the guinea pigs to get out. 2 guinea pigs were found running loose on
the floor of this facility. In the top enclosures, guinea pigs were observed freely climbing over the side walls and out
of enclosures into the adjacent enclosures. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are structurally sound,
maintained in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals. Additional height is required for
all of the fronts and sides of the enclosures. In addition, repair or replacement of all areas where the guinea pigs
may escape is required.3.30 REPEAT
WATERING.
** Accumulations of brown debris, bedding and feces around and inside the drain pipe for the automatic water
receptacles continue to be a problem. This accumulation around and inside the drain pipe expose the guinea pigs to
potential disease hazards. Water receptacles including water valves and drain pipes must be cleaned and sanitized
whenever dirty and at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning of the water valves and drain pipes can
result in contamination of the guinea pigs in the same enclosure and other enclosures as the drain pipes are
common to more than one enclosure. The licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water
valves and drain pipes sanitized when dirty, and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** Nearly every primary enclosure in this facility requires cleaning. Many enclosures have a build of dirt and debris
in the corners, a layer of brown scale and organic material on the walls of the enclosures. Failure to adequately
clean and maintain the enclosures on a regular basis exposes the animals to disease hazards and does not satisfy
accepted husbandry standards. The licensee must thoroughly clean all primary enclosures and develop a cleaning
schedule that will ensure all enclosures are cleaned regularly.
3.31(a)(4) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The sanitization schedule in place at this facility is not adequate. The licensee's wife stated during this
inspection that sanitization was done last at least 5 months ago. Failure to provide regular sanitization can lead to
an increase of potential disease hazards to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing a sanitization
program that adequately sanitizes all enclosures at least every 2 weeks as required.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The buckets used to catch water runoff from the automatic watering system are filled with a greenish/black scale
and require cleaning. Hay and spent bedding was found under all primary enclosures and in the corners of the
facility. Failure to maintain the building and premises in a clean condition impedes normal husbandry practices and
makes monitoring for pests difficult. Correct this by maintaining all premises in a neat and clean condition.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.*** There are rodent droppings in a sink in the corner of the facility and in the supply cabinet hanging above the
sink. The licensee's wife stated that have been trying to trap some of the mice they have noticed in the facility.
Rodents can harbor disease which may be harmful to the guinea pigs in the facility. The licensee must develop a
pest control program to effectively control these pests.
