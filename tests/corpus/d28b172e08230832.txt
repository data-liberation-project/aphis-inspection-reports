INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of IACUC records show that during 2017, the Committee met one time in a 12 month period on April 14,
2017. As a result, the facility was not able to meet the following requirements:
(1) Review, at least once every six months, the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals,
using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A--Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation.
(2) Inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research facility's animal facilities, including animal study
areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A-Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation; Provided, however, That
animal areas containing free-living wild animals in their natural habitat need not be included in such inspection.
(3) Prepare reports of its evaluations conducted as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and submit
the reports to the Institutional Official of the research facility.
A system should be in place and maintained to ensure all IACUC activities are completed as required. IACUC
oversight is intended to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Inadequate program
oversight may be detrimental to the welfare of the animals used in the program. The facility should meet at least
once every six months to review their program for humane care and use of animals, inspect all animal facilities, and
perform any other necessary functions required in paragraph (c).
Correct for all future inspections.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosure for the llamas, the chainlink fence had become detached and had curled up along the
bottom, creating an opening where animals could potentially pass through, or become entangled or injured. The
edges of the wire mesh fencing had stiff wires that protrude about a half an inch, and are sharp, and exposed. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. These defects should be repaired in order to protect the animals
from potential injury.Correction date: 2 March, 2018
