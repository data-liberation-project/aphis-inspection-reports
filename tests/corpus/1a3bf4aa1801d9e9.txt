HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several doggy doors in Building #2 that do not have any trim surrounding the insert/wall connection,
resulting is gaps where dirt, debris and fecal material can accumulate. There are 2 door frames where the metal trim
has been chewed and the pointed ends are pulled away from the wall.
Sharp corners of metal trim can be a possible source of injury for the dogs. Any unfinished surfaces or doorway
inserts with gaps can be a possible source of bacteria and health hazards due to an accumulation of dirt, debris or
feces that buildup and are not able to be washed out.
The licensee must repair all chewed or damaged trim or surfaces in the kennel, and fill in the cracks surrounding the
inserts where they meet the wall, or put on some sort of trim to cover that exposed area.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 2 outdoor kennels with 4 dogs that have an insolated dog house on a cement pad, however there has
been no other method of shade provided for the animals. During the heat of the day there is no shade available for
these dogs. There are 1 play yard that is used to house dogs for several hours at a time that does not have
adequate shade for the dogs during the heat of the day or for any inclement weather.
The lack of proper shade and an escape from the sun can cause heat related health risks for the regulated animals.
In addition to the shelter structures, one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large enough to
contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Building #1 has multiple doggy doors that have a buildup of dark brown/black dirt and grime on the surfaces of the
doors. There are several back walls and inside the feeders that have a buildup of dirt and grime that is brown in
color. While the enclosures are being cleaned daily, they need to have these surfaces scrubbed to remove the
grime buildup. There are several kennels that have a buildup of hair along the front of the cages in the rubber
coated wire.
The buildup of dirt, grime and hair can be a source of disease or possible health risks to the animals, as proper
sanitization can not occur with this grime present.
The licensee must increase the cleaning to include proper scrubbing of surfaces on the doggie doors, inserts, back
walls and wire fencing and inside and outside of feeders in order to remove any dirt or grime covering the surfaces.
Only when the grime is removed can proper cleaning and sanitization occur.
