3.80(a)(2)(iii) CRITICAL REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In October 2016 a macaque escaped from its primary enclosure when it managed to enter the primary enclosure of
another NHP located directly above it and the two animals fought. Both macaques sustained injuries and were
promptly separated then evaluated by the clinical veterinarian. Both animals underwent surgery to repair and treat
the wounds, and both made a full recovery.
It was determined that the NHP was able to escape from its primary enclosure and gain entry into the other NHP’s
enclosure because personnel had failed to secure the 2 latches for the waste pan cover panel on the front of the
cage following cage change earlier in the day. This cover panel secures the waste pan that also functions as the
divider between the top and bottom cages.
As a result, the macaque in the lower enclosure was able to push the solid bottom waste pan forward, then subvert
the locking mechanism for the floor of the top cage pushing the floor forward, and then gain entry into the top
enclosure. Each NHP enclosure has 13 separate locking mechanisms for a total of 26 locks for the 2 enclosures; 2
of the 26 locks had not been secured.
Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain
the non-human primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
The research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the event to
USDA and OLAW, and implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Corrective actions included but were not limited to providing additional retraining of all staff involved in care of NHPs
on the NHP cage change SOP following husbandry or medical procedures including confirming security of all
latches, implementation of additional procedures for checking cages and when handling NHPs, and modifications to
enclosure latching mechanisms.
No additional incidents have occurred since these corrective actions have been implemented.NOTE - Inspection conducted 3/22/17 and 3/23/17. Exit briefing held 3/23/17 on-site with facility representatives.
