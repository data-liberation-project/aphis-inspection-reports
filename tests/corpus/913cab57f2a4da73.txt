3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On today's inspection, there were two enclosures that were measured to determine the adequacy of space for the
puppies contained therein.
The first enclosure measured was 31"x22" or 4.74 sq ft. This enclosure contained 3 puppies of alike size. The
puppy measured was 15" when it was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail. According to the
AWA, this puppy and the other two puppies of alike size housed with her would require 3.06 sq ft each or a total of
9.18 sq ft total.
The second enclosure measured was 36"x24" or 6 sq ft. This enclosure contained 4 puppies of alike size. The
puppy measured was 11" when it was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail. According to the
AWA, this puppy and the other three puppies of alike size housed with him would require 2.01 sq ft each or a total of
8.04 sq ft total.
The puppies housed within the enclosure identified above do not have an adequate amount of space. Each dog
housed in a primary enclosure (including weaned puppies) must be provided a minimum amount of floor space,
calculated as follows: Find the mathematical square of the sum of the length of the dog in inches (measured from
the tip of its nose to the base of its tail) plus 6 inches; then divide the product by 144. The calculation is: (length of
dog in inches + 6) x (length of dog in inches + 6) = required floor space in square inches. Required floor space in
inches/144 = required floor space in square feet. This facility must ensure that each puppy within each of their
enclosures have an adequate amount of floor space using the calculations listed above.
