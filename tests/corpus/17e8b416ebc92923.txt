2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On December 13, 2018, at the time of inspection, a male brown spider monkey was observed with a tail laceration;
animal appeared normal in all other respects. The laceration was located approximately at mid-tail, and was
creating a gap of approximately three (3) inches in length. Reddened tissues were observed immediately between
the lacerated edges of the skin. When asked, the facility representative stated that the laceration happened
approximately 30 days ago, and that they were treating the injury by applying once a day a topical antibiotic
medication. Also, the facility representative mentioned that their attending veterinarian (AV) knew about the case,
but could not recall the exact date the AV last saw the animal.
The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) requires exhibitors to perform daily observation of all animals at the facility to assess
their health and well-being. The licensee must have in place a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to
ensure timely and accurate information on injuries/lacerations and health problems so that is conveyed to the AV.
Furthermore, the AWA mandates each exhibitor to use appropriate methods to treat injuries/lacerations, as
directed/recommended by the facility's AV, in order to provide adequate veterinary care to the affected spider
monkey (and all other regulated animals at the facility). The licensee must contact today the AV, to coordinate and
provide adequate medical care/treatment of the tail laceration.
