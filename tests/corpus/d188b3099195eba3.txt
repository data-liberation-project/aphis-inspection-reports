SANITATION.
Inside the MC barn, the floor of the pen housing five pigs was covered in an excessive amount of feces, to the
extent where the front half of the pen was completely covered in a green, paste-like mixture and the remainder of
the pen, including the back wall, had several areas of smeared feces present. The animals were walking and rolling
in the material as they were navigating their pen to access water and food sources.
Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary. Failure to do so can result in an
increased spread in disease which can have a negative impact on animal health. Correct by removing manure on a
frequent enough basis to prevent build-up within the pen itself. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
