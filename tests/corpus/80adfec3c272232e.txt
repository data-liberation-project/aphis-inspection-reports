CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The accumulations of old fecal material in the outdoor primary enclosures, floor tarp and back of the walls housing
four lemurs show that they are not being cleaned on a daily basis. Due to the small openings of the metal flooring
all the fecal material is unable to drop on the floor tarp, therefore either larger flooring material is needed or bedding
to prevent the lemurs from having contact as observed during this inspection.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily and from underneath
them as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the
nonhuman primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIALTY
This inspection was conducted with the facility representative and exit interview with the licensees.
