2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. The facility records include
only the number of weanlings. A total of 702 adult guinea pigs, weanlings, and newborns were counted during this
inspection.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Sanitation.
There were 16 stacked pens housing approximately 175 guinea pigs located next to the walls of the building with a narrow
space between the building wall and the wire netting on the back of the pens. There was a buildup of bedding and debris
between the wall and the wire netting on the back of several of these enclosures. There were also spiderwebs with


bedding mixed in hanging from the ceilings of these pens. There was a crawl space above one of the stacked pens with a
buildup of dust, debris and spiderwebs. The pen closest to this crawl space had several spiderwebs above the pen
between the enclosure and building wall.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
