2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On Sunday night, January 30, 2022 a student caretaker contacted the Attending Veterinarian and the Registered
Veterinary Technician that the rabbit "Hotie" was not doing well. The AV spoke to the student and the RVT went in to the
facility to evaluate the rabbit. After evaluation and consultation, the RVT was directed by the AV to euthanize the rabbit,
and gastrointestinal stasis was determined to be the cause of death on necropsy. In review of the rabbits care record, a
"few notations of low appetite on this rabbit's daily tracking sheet" in the days before he died was not communicated to the
attending veterinarian. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee is implementing process improvements to
prevent this from happening again and ensuring timely and accurate communication from the animal caretakers to the
Attending Veterinarian.

Daily observation of all animals to assess their well-being, appropriate documentation of those observations, and direct
and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues are necessary to ensure that the
animals at the facility receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensure that all animals
are observed daily, any health problems are documented, and the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary.



Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.
