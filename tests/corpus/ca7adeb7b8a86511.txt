2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Current animal records were not available for review at the time of the inspection. While few older records were
available, there were no current records for the animals on hand. A system should be in place to ensure that
complete acquisition and disposition records, including animals born at the facility, are maintained and made
available for examination by APHIS officials.

3.50(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Bags of rabbit food are being stored in a plastic shed. The wooden pallet flooring and cracks and holes in the plastic
sides of the shed would not protect the food against infestation or contamination by vermin. Areas where food is
stored should be in good repair and should be constructed so that the food is protected from infestation or
contamination by vermin.

3.52(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Rabbits are being housed outdoors without shelter from the cold. Some rabbits are being housed in covered but
open sided individual hutches while others are housed in wire enclosures under roofed structures with no sides.
Most of the enclosures have wire floors, thus the animals are exposed to the cold from all directions. The local low
temperature for the last several days has been below freezing. A large icicle was observed adjacent to one rabbit
enclosure at approximately 12:30 on the day of the inspection.
Exposure to cold temperatures may be deleterious to the health of the rabbits and may cause them discomfort.
Shelter from cold temperatures should be provided for all rabbits when the temperature falls below 40 F. Correct by November 24, 2014.

3.52(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Sections of fencing surrounding the outdoor rabbit enclosures are missing or propped open. Rabbits housed
outdoors are vulnerable to attack by predators. The facility should ensure that their rabbit enclosures are fenced or
otherwise enclosed to minimize the entrance of predators.

3.54(b)
FEEDING.
Some rabbit self-feeders are contaminated with what appears to be caked food pellets and hair. Contaminated food
may harbor infectious organisms such as molds and bacteria that may be detrimental to the health of the rabbits .
The facility should take measures to prevent molding, deterioration, and caking of food pellets in self-feeders.

3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Several rabbit enclosures contain excessive amounts of excreta. In some enclosures hay/straw appear to be wet
and caked with feces. Some solid surfaces were covered with feces and what appeared to be urine. Additionally,
the wire sides and flooring in several rabbit enclosures are covered with excessive amount of rust. A piece of baling
twine was found in one enclosure.
Rabbit enclosures should be kept reasonably free from feces and debris such as soiled hay/straw and rust. Failure
to keep the cages clean could increase animal exposure to disease causing agents and be detrimental to their
health.Correct excessive excreta and debris by November 24, 2014.
Correct excessive rust by December 20, 2014.
3.56(a)(3)
SANITATION.
Piles of hay/straw bedding and excreta are being discarded under the enclosures. In some cases these piles nearly
reach the enclosure flooring. The licensee stated that there are worms under the piles, however there are no bins
under the enclosures. If worm bins are used under the enclosures they should be maintained in a sanitary condition.
Excessive amounts of hay and/or straw should not be discarded under the enclosures. Discarding bedding and
excreta appropriately will minimize odors and flies.

3.56(c)
SANITATION.
One rabbit was being housed in an enclosure located directly below a leaking water storage tank. A large icicle had
formed adjacent to the enclosure from the leaking tank. The leak may have eventually led to the rabbit becoming
wet or compromised the integrity of the wood shelf below, allowing the tank to fall on the enclosure. Additionally, a
wagon filled with trash is being stored behind rabbit enclosures.
Premises should be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
The rabbit housed under the water tank was moved at the time of the inspection.
Correct trash accumulation by December 20, 2014.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
