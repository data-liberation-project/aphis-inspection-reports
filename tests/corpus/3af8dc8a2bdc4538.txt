2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Shiba Inu dog (Ruby, 18-70, DOB 9/12/17) was thin with an abdominal tuck. Her mucous membranes were
pale. She was nursing seven 4-week old puppies. The owner stated he had been feeding her an egg every three days
to supplement her and that she was looking better. There was no consultation with a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis
or to confirm that this was the correct treatment for this dog. Poor body condition can be the result of parasites,
inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. Ruby must be evaluated by a veterinarian within 3 days of this
inspection, to know with certainty the problem and the correct treatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended
treatment and delivered treatments must be available to APHIS officials.

Watering
Three water receptacles had green algae coating the sides and bottom of the receptacles. The water had a green tinge
to it. Several other water bowls had a brown color to them. The water may be contaminated but is obviously not potable
drinking water. Contaminated water can cause illness or be unpalatable to animals. All water receptacles must be kept
clean and sanitary and maintained.
