Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Two non-human primates (NHPs) were transferred from an IACAC approved imaging study protocol to a holding protocol.
After the transfer to the holding protocol both NHPs were used by the Principal Investigator (PI) on the imaging study
protocol. On 03-Aug-2022 the PI was asked by the LAR veterinary associate to stop using NHP A under the imaging
Protocol after it was used two times. This non-compliance was recognized again by the LAR veterinary associate on 08-
Nov-2022 with another NPH (NPH B). This non-compliance was recognized again by the LAR veterinary associate on
08-Nov-2022, as the PI had also used NPH B two times under the imaging protocol after it had been transferred to a
holding protocol.

Proposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be
subject to further appropriate review and approval by officials of the research facility. However, those officials may not
approve an activity involving the care and use of animals if it has not been approved by the IACUC.

The facility implemented corrective actions before the time of inspection.
