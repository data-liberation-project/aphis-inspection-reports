2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.

The licensee must identify all live dogs on the premises.
To be corrected by July 29, 2014.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the first sheltered housing building are 14 enclosures affecting a total of 38 adult dogs with excess rust on the
metal bar along the bottom of the front of the enclosures. The rusted surface is rough, flaking with several of the
metal bar deteriorating causing it to lose its structural strength.
On the outside of the "Reefer/Cooler Building" near the dog door in 4 enclosures affecting a total of 25 adult dogs is
an excess amount of rust on the wall which does not allow the area to be properly cleaned and sanitized.
Rusted surfaces prevent adequate cleaning and sanitization which can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must maintain all surfaces in housing facilities so that they are free of excessive rust that prevents the
required cleaning and sanitization.
To be corrected by September 11, 2014.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the "Small Blue Building" the first enclosure (left side) housing 5 adult dogs the plastic sheet on the wall is
ripped/shredded leaving exposed wood. The exposed wood is next to the animals and does now allow for proper
cleaning and sanitizing.
In the "(cid:28)Pug Shed",(cid:29) the wooden guillotine doors on enclosure numbers 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have paint that is worn
off and exposing the wood underneath. These surfaces are no longer impervious to moisture and can no longer be
properly cleaned and sanitized.
Surfaces that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can play a role in disease transmission.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the animals be maintained on a regular basis, and any
surface that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized must be repaired or replaced.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outside run of the Reefer/Cooler Building, the farthest enclosure on the south side housing five adult cocker
spaniels has an excess amount of feces and debris piled up against the fence on the west side.
A buildup of feces causes odors, attracts insects, pests, and other vermin, and is a disease hazard.
The licensee must ensure fecal material and other debris is removed often enough to ensure odors are kept at a
minimum, insects and pests are not attracted, and disease hazards are eliminated.
To be corrected by July 23, 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEATPRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Inside the "Reefer/Cooler Building" the first enclosure (right side) housing six adult Pomeranians and the second
enclosure housing five adult cocker spaniels has rusted wires with sharp edges.
Rusted and sharp edges that are protruding toward the animals could potentially cause injuries.
The licensee must construct and maintain enclosures so that they have no sharp points or edges that can injure the
animals.
3.8 REPEAT
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
At the time of the inspection, there was no excersise plan available for review.
.
An exercise plan must be developed to ensure the dogs are getting adequate exercise.
The licensee must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan and have it approved and signed by the
attending veterinarian.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
Inside the "Reefer/Cooler Building" the plastic feeders inside the five enclosures housing a total of 30 adult dogs
has excess amount of dirt/grime build-up on the outside indicating that the receptacles have not been properly
cleaned and sanitized.
There is one food receptacle with chewed edge inside the "Small Blue Building". The chewed edge is deeply pitted
making it difficult to sanitize. When surfaces are not sanitized they can play a role in disease transmission.
Food receptacles that are not clean and sanitized can lead to disease transmission, decreased appetite, and when
the receptacles become worn or chewed to the point they cannot be sanitized, they must be replaced.
The licensee must ensure all food receptacles be cleaned and sanitized according to 3.11 (b) or replaced when
worn or chewed.
To be corrected by September 11, 2014.An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
