2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
The identification (id) tags do are not numbered, but have names of the dogs instead. The id tags affixed to the kennel
fronts do not necessarily match up with the dog inside the kennel. There are 5 kennels with no tag on the door, or dog
collar with tag affixed to the individual dogs. There are 15 dogs in the kennel that do not have a tag on the kennel, or
around their neck attached to a collar.

All live dogs held on the premises, purchased, or otherwise acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of, or removed from the
premises for delivery to a research facility or exhibitor or to another dealer, or for sale, through an auction sale or to any
person for use as a pet, shall be identified by an official tag of the type described in § 2.51 affixed to the animal's neck by
means of a collar made of material generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a means of identifying their pet
dogs.

Ensure all dogs in the kennel can be easily identified to trace and track the animal movements, and to ensure they can be
identified in case of disease outbreak.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
