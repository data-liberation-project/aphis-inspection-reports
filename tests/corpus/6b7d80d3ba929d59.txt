3.75(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
Excessive rust is present on multiple capuchin enclosures.
*Two enclosures in the housing area behind the house have rusty support beams. The rust on the last enclosure on the
left side has led to the cross support beam breaking apart with about a 9in section of the pipe missing. This leaves rusty
jagged edges exposed that may injure the capuchin in this one enclosure.
*The transfer doors in all six enclosures housing capuchins in the separate monkey building have rusted frames. The rust
is pitted and starting to deteriorate.
*The outside portion of the capuchin enclosures in the separate monkey building have rust developing on the support
beams.
Excessive rust on surfaces indicate that the surfaces can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized. In addition, the
excessive rust can affect the structural strength of the metal. Rusty areas that cannot be treated or that have diminished
structural strength will need to be replaced.
The surfaces of the capuchin enclosures must be free of excessive rust. Correct by 1/21/22.
3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.


The outdoor portion of the capuchin enclosure (housing two capuchins) at the house is in need of repair. The concrete
wall has damage on the left side of the transfer pipe with a hole approximately 1inx3inx 1/2 inch deep and a superficial
half inch wide crack. In addition, this wall needs to be repainted as bare concrete is exposed. Bare concrete and holes in
the concrete cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
The damage to the concrete must be repaired and all surfaces of the capuchin enclosures must be maintained on a
regular basis. Correct by 11/30/21.
3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The sections of the transfer pipes in the outdoor portions of the capuchin sheltered housing enclosures behind the house
are in need of cleaning. The surfaces, both on the outside and the inside of the pipes, are coated with a brown grime. The
capuchins come in contact with these surfaces. Cleaning and sanitizing these surfaces is required to prevent the spread
of disease, contamination of the coats of the capuchins, odors and attraction of pests.
Hard surfaces with which the capuchins come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84
(detergent and disinfectant) to prevent accumulation of excreta and disease hazards. Correct by 10/31/21.
