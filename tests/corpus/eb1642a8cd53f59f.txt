Facilities, general.
On May 18, 2021 a honey badger escaped from its primary enclosure. The enclosure originally housed four honey
badgers, in which one slid through the siding of its enclosure and exited the facility through a window in the room.
Although the licensee stated all doors and windows were closed and secured, the honey badger still managed to
maneuver its way through the window. US Fish & Wildlife were notified, hiring a third party trapper to capture the badger.
Upon arrival to the trap, the honey badger was deceased.


Animals escaping from primary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm and further injury when they are not safely
contained. They also pose a threat to other people and animals if they are not effectively held in their designated
enclosures.
Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals and protect them from
injury. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
