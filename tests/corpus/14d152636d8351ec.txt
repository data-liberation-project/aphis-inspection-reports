During the inspection it was identified that the attending veterinarian conducted the annual physical exam for the
animals on 5 August 2015. During the veterinarians exam seven dogs were identified as having dental disease, four
dogs with grade 3 and two dogs with grade 4 dental disease. In November 2015 one of the identified as having
grade 4 dental disease received dental cleanings and appropriate dental care. According to the program of
veterinary care any dog identified as having grade 3 dental disease shall be seen by a veterinarian for dental
cleaning within three months if the owner is unable to appropriately remove the tartar buildup from the teeth. Any
dog identified as having grade 4 dental disease shall be seen by the veterinarian for dental cleaning as soon as
possible. During the inspection these animals were identified and it was confirmed that they had not yet received
dental cleanings as written in the program of veterinary care.
The current program of veterinary care indicates that the licensee will administer Ivomec monthly for the prevention
of blood parasites. The Licensee(cid:25)s wife indicated that Ivomec is typically only given during summer months and that
the last dose was given in August or September of 2015.
The current program of veterinary care also gives instructions to give puppies Bordetella vaccinations at four weeks
of age and adults annually. The licensee(cid:25)s wife indicated that this vaccine was not given to the puppies at this time.
The Licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors, walls and doors on the outside portion of the primary enclosures were moderately worn. The primary
enclosures in this area are constructed of primarily of coated wire. The wire coating has been worn or chewed off
over portions of the floors, walls and doors. In the majority of these areas the exposed wire is rusted. These areas
of the kennel are no longer in good repair. The areas where the coating is damaged provide crevices that organic
material can become entrapped preventing adequate cleaning and sanitization. Additionally, the rust which has
formed over the exposed wires also prevents them from being readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by repairing or
replacing these damaged areas. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled.
Correct by: 7 February 2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee(cid:25)s Wife and Veterinary Medical Officer, Michael
