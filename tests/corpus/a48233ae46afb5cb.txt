2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Availability of records.
1. Some of the documents and records that are required to be kept under the AWA Regulations were not available
for review at the time of the inspection. The written Program of Veterinary Care was in the possession of the
Attending Veterinarian at an off-site location and the APHIS Form 7005 (Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on
Hand) could not be located.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all documents and records that are required to be kept under the Animal
Welfare Act (AWA) should be available at the time of an inspection so the required records can be reviewed to
determine the facility's compliance with the provisions of the AWA.
Copies of all documents and records required under the AWA need to be on the premises at all times and be
available for review.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE – Exit briefing held 11/22/16 on-site with Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 11/25/16.
