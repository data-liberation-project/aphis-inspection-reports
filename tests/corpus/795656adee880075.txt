PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
This was a focused inspection regarding the escape of a male, Schmidt's monkey. On Tuesday, 6/21/16, a zoo
keeper secured the male and female Schmidt monkeys into the outdoor portion of their enclosure.
The keeper proceeded into the holding area to clean. Once he was finished he came out of the holding area and
only closed the main door. He began to talk to a zoo visitor, and opened the "shift door" which gave the primates
access to the holding area.
The male primate hit the door and it sprung open, allowing the male monkey to escape from the holding area. The
staff member immediately closed the door, slid the slide bolt closed and put the pad lock back on, which secured
the door. The female was now securely contained. However, the male was now loose on the zoo grounds.
The male monkey was successfully re-captured by zoo staff after 2.5 days loose on the zoo and park grounds. The
animal sustained no injuries while he was loose nor during the re-capture.
Primary enclosures for non human primates must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the
nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
Therefore, safety procedures / protocols must be reviewed with all staff members.
A different door knob mechanism may also need to be considered by the facility.
These corrective measures are important to ensure the safety and containment of the animals.
