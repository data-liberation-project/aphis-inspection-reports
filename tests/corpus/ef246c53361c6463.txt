Watering.
There is a buildup of dirt and debris on the inside of the main automatic waterer in the the large sheep pen. The water is
clear and the health of the animals does not appear to be impacted by the condition of the waterer at this point. Failure to
clean water receptacles on a regular basis can deter the sheep from drinking and introduce disease hazards to the
animals. The licensee must clean the waterer at a frequency that will ensure potable water is provided to the regulated
animals in a sanitary receptacle.
