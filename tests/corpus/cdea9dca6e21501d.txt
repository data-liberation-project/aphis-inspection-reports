ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two reindeer ("Wishes"- 14 years old and "Cinnamon"- 12 years old) were observed with overgrown hooves. Over
long toes may alter the animal's gait and put undue stress on tendons and joint structures. In addition, the bottom
incisors of one alpaca ("Biff" - 16 years old) were overgrown and protruding beyond the upper lip. Overgrown teeth
can lead to dental problems such as malocclusion, cause difficulty with prehension of food or chewing and result in
weight loss or poor body condition. The licensee must correct these issues to ensure an appropriate program is
maintained for all aspects of animal care. The facility staff has contacted the attending veterinarian, and plans have
been made for correction by November 25, 2015.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Visitors were observed hand feeding alpaca through the fencing without an attendant present. Public contact could
result in harm to the animals or be detrimental to their health and well-being. A responsible, knowledgeable, and
readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Corrected
immediately by the facility.
This was a focused inspection.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representatives, Carolyn McKinnie, Supervisory Animal Care
Specialist, and Diane Forbes, VMO.Additional Inspectors
