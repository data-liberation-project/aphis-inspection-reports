2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:30 on
11-Dec-17. The owner's daughter stated that the owner was not available and there were no other available facility
representatives to accompany the inspection.
Lack of availability to conduct the inspection makes the regulatory process impossible.
Licensees must ensure a knowledgeable facility representative is available during normal business hours to allow
for conducting the inspection. Correct from this time forward.
