SANITATION.
The enclosure that houses 2 chinchillas has fecal pellets on all surfaces and shelves including the food bowl shelf.
The cleaning schedule for the enclosure is every two days, and is due to be cleaned today according to the facility
representative. Enclosures need to be kept clean to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease, and
reduce odors. Excreta needs to be removed more often in order to keep the enclosure clean.
