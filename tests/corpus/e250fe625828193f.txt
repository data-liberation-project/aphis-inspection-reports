MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
Sec. 2.130 Minimum age requirements.
***During records review, there was an acquisition record that shows two male Great Pyrenees #206 and #207 that
were received and transported on 2/22/14. The date of birth for both of these animals shows to be 12/30/13 (54
days old). The transportation of puppies prior to eight weeks of age increases the health risk of the animals. The
licensee must assure that all puppies or kittens are at least eight weeks of age prior to transport in commerce.
To be corrected from this point forward.
This was a records inspection only.
The exit conference was conducted with the facility representative on February 25, 2014.
End of report.
