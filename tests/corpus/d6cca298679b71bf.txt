INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The ongoing protocol 14-004 and its 5/5/14 amendment describe surgeries and justifications for 4 treatment groups.
Surgery records for 11 sheep were reviewed during this inspection and 6 of the sheep had a different surgery
performed than any of the 4 treatment groups. The principal investigator failed to submit an amendment or
proposed modification to the approved protocol that described what was done to the six sheep. As a result, these
significant changes to surgical procedures were not reviewed by the IACUC. The facility IACUC must review and
approve all proposed protocols and amendments to ensure that animal pain and distress is minimized and that
proposed activities comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. Ensure that all future activities are done in
accordance with the IACUC protocol and ensure that all significant changes to the ongoing use of animals are
reviewed by the IACUC
Correct from this day forward.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The ongoing protocol 14-004 was reviewed during this inspection including the surgery records for 11 sheep. The
surgery description includes the use of a paralytic to relax the intercostal musculature during the thoracotomy.
Standard procedure for the facility is to monitor heart rate and blood pressure for depth of anesthesia when
paralytics are in use since both parameters are known to increase if the animal is experiencing pain. The protocol
calls for a cardiac bypass as part of the surgical procedure. The paralytic was shown in the records to be
administered several times until the end of the cardiac bypass. Animals placed on cardiac bypass can not be
adequately monitored using heart rate and/or blood pressure since the bypass machine is controlling these
functions for the heart. The sheep are under the influence of the paralytic during the cardiac bypass so an
additional method of animal monitoring must be instituted to ensure the sheep are maintained under sufficient levels
of the anesthesia and analgesia while under the effects of the paralytic. See section 2.33(b)(4) below for specific
examples. Adjunctive methods for assessing pain and anesthetic depth such as a peripheral nerve stimulator
should be considered when paralytic agents are being used (especially when heart rate and blood pressure are
unable to be monitored due to concurrent use of cardiac bypass machines or administration of cardio-active drugs).
Surgery must be performed with appropriate analgesics / anesthetics and monitoring to assure that the animal is notexperiencing pain during the procedure with the use of paralytics. Correct from this day forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Protocol 13-028, which is now closed (completed), and all associated records for the 30 study animals were
reviewed at this inspection. The protocol states that "Rabbits will be weighed weekly..." and weighing is widely
considered a good method of monitoring health in rabbits including pain/distress.
Rabbit 10 weighed 8.6# on arrival and 8.4# at surgery 7/16/13. The rabbit was not weighed at the next group
weighing 7/19/13 and was found dead 7/25/13. At that time it weighed 6# according to the records. If the rabbit had
been weighed with the group 7/19 or a week after the last weight 7/23 it might have been identified for treatment in
time for a positive outcome.
Rabbit 15 weighed 7.6# on arrival 7/15/13 and had surgery 7/18/13. By 8/2/13 the rabbit weighed 5.4# but no
treatment was noted in the records for this rabbit. By 8/9/13 the rabbit weighed 4.8# and had suffered injuries from
the other rabbits. Euthanasia was performed 8/14/13 and the necessity might have been avoided with earlier
intervention.
Rabbit 25 weighed 8# on arrival 7/2/13 and had surgery 7/15/13. It was identified as having a luxating patella
7/19/13 and received two days of pain treatment. By 7/26/13 the rabbit weighed 6.6# and maintained this weight
until 8/16/13. No further treatment or special consideration was noted in the records. Although it was weighed
weekly there was no additional diagnostic testing or treatments provided (such as continued analgesics, individual
housing, the addition of soft bedding, nutritional support, additional monitoring etc.) despite weight loss. The rabbit
weighed 5.8# Friday 8/23/13 and there was no record of veterinary examination for this weight loss. The rabbit was
kept through the weekend and until the study ended for that group Tuesday 8/27/13. This animal may have
experienced pain or distress during the period it was maintained without treatment as indicated by 12% weight loss
between weighing 8/16/13 and 8/23/13.
These three rabbits all had weight loss that could indicate pain or distress. Monitoring methods must be
conducted as outlined in the IACUC approved protocol. Additionally, animals exhibiting clinical signs of injury,
illness, or pain (such as significant decreases in weight) must be referred to the attending veterinarian for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Monitoring data must additionally be reviewed for trends that might indicate
problems that would respond to treatment. Treatment must be initiated in a timely manner to assure the animals are
not living with pain or distress that could be controlled. Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs
of adequate veterinary care that include: The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Correct from this date forward.

Section 2.33(b)(4) Veterinary Care: The surgery records of three sheep on the ongoing protocol 14-004
documented signs of pain that were not appropriately addressed by the surgery personal of the principal
investigator.
Sheep B3379 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/11/14. During
the cardiac bypass there was a notation that the animal was kicking. A paralytic was administered with the
analgesic and increase in the anesthetic agent. As stated in the protocol the analgesia and anesthetic should be
allowed to bring the animal to plane III anesthesia before the administration or re-administration of a paralytic to
ensure the animal is not experiencing pain during the surgical procedure.
Sheep B3382 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/11/14. Both the
heart rate and the blood pressure increased after the cardiac bypass and remained at that level until the end of the
surgery, about 45 minutes. The heart rate increased from an average of 73 to 106 and the blood pressure
increased from an average of 79/50 to 102/76. During the 45 minute period with the elevated heart rate and blood
pressure the gas anesthetic was decreased from 2% to 1% for the last 30 minutes. No additional analgesics were
administered during this 45 minute period. An additional dose of paralytic drug had been given during the cardiac
bypass so the sheep would have been under the influence of the paralytic. Pain was then not appropriately
addressed in this sheep, the sheep should have received an agent for pain relief which would lead to a decrease
the heart rate and blood pressure.
Sheep B3386 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/13/14. After the
incision the average heart rate increased from 92 to 144 and the average blood pressure increased from 83/61 to
119/101. An analgesic was given to decrease the pain and the resulting high blood pressure. Five minutes later
the heart rate was 149 and the blood pressure 112/91. Metoprolol (not an analgesic or anesthetic) was given to
decrease the high heart rate and blood pressure. The use of Metoprolol was not included in the protocol. Eight
minutes later the heart rate was 103 and the blood pressure was 106/79 and an additional dose of the paralytic drug
was administered. The cardiac bypass was initiated four minutes later. As the protocol indicates, an increase in
heart rate and blood pressure indicates perception of pain by the animal. The increase in heart rate and blood
pressure were considered signs that the sheep was experiencing pain. Giving a drug that affects heart rate and
blood pressure prevents these parameters from being used to monitor pain when paralytics are used. The sheep
did not have its pain addressed before additional paralytic was given.
Paralytic agents prevent the animal from moving even if it experiences pain. Heart rate and blood pressure often
increase when animals experience pain and are therefore used to evaluate the depth of anesthesia in lieu of muscle
responses such as eye twitch. When heart rate and blood pressure rise during anesthesia, additional pain relieving
(analgesic) and/or anesthetic agent are necessary to assure the animal is not experiencing pain. This is especially
important in animals that are unable to respond due to a paralytic agent. Based on the examples above, theveterinary guidance on use of paralytics to include monitoring with appropriate response does not appear to be
adequate as required by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations. Each research facility veterinarian must provide
guidance on appropriate monitoring and subsequent treatment by personnel involved in handling, immobilization,
anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia. This assures the least pain and distress is felt by the animals.
Correct for all future surgeries.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility Vice President and facility Veterinarian.
