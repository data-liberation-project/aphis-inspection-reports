ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A skunk died at the facility because it was not seen by a veterinarian. There were inadequate provisions for
emergency/after hours veterinary care. The skunk was observed to be vomiting and lethargic on a late afternoon
day by facility staff as per the director of the science center. The staff then notified the director of the science center
about the skunk's condition. The director of the science was unable to contact the veterinarian as the clinic had
closed for the day. The director of science contacted other veterinarians, but they were unwilling to treat/see the
animal. The skunk died a few hours later.
The availability of emergency/after hours care is crucial to assure that animals are provided with veterinary care.
Assure that emergency/after hours care is available to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
To be corrected: Revised emergency/after hours care provisions were made by the facility.
Note: The inspection was conducted with the director of the science center. A thorough verbal exit briefing was
conducted with the facility animal care manager.
