ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The three ring tailed lemurs housed in a single enclosure at the facility appeared thin and had very poor sparse hair
coats. There was no food waste of any kind observed in their enclosure. When each was offered a monkey biscuit
by the facility CEO they all ate eagerly and consumed the biscuits quickly and in their entirety. If left untreated
these animals will suffer needlessly. The attending veterinarian should be consulted regarding the condition of
these lemurs. Documentation of the veterinarian's treatment recommendations and a treatment record must be
maintained and available for review by APHIS officials. This should be done by the end of the day 5-18-16.
Two alpacas at the facility have extremely long rear toes. These toes must be kept at a proper length in order to
prevent joint issues. This can lead to unnecessary pain and suffering by these animals. These alpaca toes must be
trimmed.

The three ring tailed lemurs housed in a single enclosure at the facility appeared thin and had very poor sparse hair
coats. There was no food waste of any kind observed in their enclosure. When each was offered a monkey biscuit
by the facility CEO they all ate eagerly and consumed the biscuits quickly and in their entirety. The attending
veterinarian had not been consulted regarding the condition of these animals. Failure to observe health issues and
promptly treat and/or report them to the attending veterinarian will lead to unnecessary suffering and in extreme
cases even possible animal death. Thorough daily observations of all animals should be made. Animals with known
problems should receive extra scrutiny. Report all health issues promptly to the veterinarian.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The overwhelming odor of rotten and decaying meat still persists in the meat cooler. This odor makes it very hard
to determine if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the cooler, identify the
source of the odor and eliminate it.3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The entire front of the tiger Lilly's enclosure is muddy. The substrate in this area is not draining properly and so
after Lilly plays in her water this area remains muddy and wet. This area needs to be redesigned to drain in a timely
manner to prevent health issues which can be caused by fecal contamination of this mud and water leading to coat
contamination and ingestion of this material by Lilly.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the grizzly bear had a large amount of algae growing in it. This
indicates that it is not being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis. Water receptacles should be kept clean and
sanitary to promote adequate water consumption which is essential for animal health. Clean and sanitize this water
receptacle more frequently.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The Asian black bear enclosure and the American black bear enclosure contained excessive fecal material.
Enclosures for the tiger Hank and the tigers Lenny and Squigy contained excessive amounts of fecal material. The
new tiger Daisy is now housed indoors in a dog kennel area. Several dogs are also housed in runs in this area.
The level of ammonia in this area is very high and caused the inspectors eyes to water. This level of ammonia is
not comfortable for the tiger housed in the area and could lead to respiratory problems. These enclosures need to
be cleaned on a more frequent basis. This excessive feces can lead to pest control issues. The animals can
contaminate their coats when they lay in this material and ingest this material when they groom themselves. Clean
these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health
problems.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
Lack of properly trained workers still remains an issue for the facility. The fact that the condition of the lemurs had
not been reported to the attending veterinarian as well as the persistent husbandry issues are evidence of this. The
facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility and animal conditions
that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Most if not all of the facility issues could be corrected with an adequate
number of properly trained workers. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained workers must beadded.
3.133
SEPARATION.
Daisy the tiger is now housed in an indoor area that also contains multiple dogs housed in runs. These dogs could
be heard barking when the inspectors were not near the area. When the inspectors entered the area the noise from
the dogs barking was relentless. Animals should not be housed near animals that cause them discomfort. The
close proximity of the dogs to Daisy is causing her discomfort. The dogs or Daisy need to be moved out of the area.
Correct by: 5-25-16.
An exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the inspection with the facility CEO and APHIS personnel Kurt
Hammel and Carrie Bongard. Expectations regarding the lemurs were conveyed to the facility CEO at that time. It
was explained and the CEO agreed that the lemurs would be seen by the attending veterinarian by COB on
5-18-19. A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility CEO and APHIS personnel Kurt Hammel and Carrie
Bongard on 5-19-16.
