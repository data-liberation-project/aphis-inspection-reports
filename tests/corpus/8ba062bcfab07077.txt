2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One cream colored adult male Pomeranian (microchip number 0A01276616) has a heavy coating of dark brown
matter on the both sides of the cheek teeth extending up into the gum line. The gums were reddened and inflamed.
The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. These signs
are consistent with the presence of dental disease. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth
and mouth structures, be painful, lead to a decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth affecting the health and
well-being of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment
plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by 1/9/20.
* The following medications used to treat the dogs at the facility have gone past their labeled expiration dates. The
recorded expiration date on one 100 ml bottle of Oxytocin was 03/19. The recorded expiration date on one 100 ml
bottle of Bactracillin G Benzathine was 09/19. In addition, there were no written dosage instructions on the Oxytocin
bottle. These medications are intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are
therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated
animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care.
The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could
be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals
may experience pain, distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms or unexpected side effects. Failure to
properly label medications or other medical products as being expired and storing them with unexpired medical
materials could lead to the unintentional use on regulated animals. The licensee must either dispose of all such
expired medical drugs and materials or segregate them in an appropriately labeled, physically separate location
from non-expired medical drugs and materials. Correct by 1/9/20.
3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Rusted metal was observed along the bottom of an estimated 15 metal enclosure gates. Twenty Five dogs are in
contact with the affected enclosure gates located in sheltered housing. The surfaces were rough in appearance. Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily
cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust affects the structural integrity of all metal surfaces. The licensee must
ensure that this and all other surfaces are free of rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitation, or affects
the structural strength of the surface. Correct by 2/8/20.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 1/8/20 were conducted with the licensee.
