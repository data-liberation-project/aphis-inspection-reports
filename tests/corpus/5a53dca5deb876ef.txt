2.4 Critical

Non-interference with APHIS officials.
(1) USDA officials had received a complaint alleging that a member of the public had been bitten by a sloth during an
encounter at the site of the licensee. At the time of the 8/10/22 inspection, the USDA officials asked the licensee multiple
times if a member of the public had been bitten during any of the sloth encounters. He told the inspectors that “nothing
happened here” and that he did not get any complaint or report of someone being bitten. His answer each time that this
question was asked was “No” he did not know of any bites during any encounter. The licensee also asked his employees
present at the time of inspection, and they agreed that no member of the public had been bitten during an encounter.

USDA officials subsequently received documentation from the Suffolk County Dept of Health following the inspection that
they were notified that a member of the public was bitten and/or scratched by a sloth on 7/24/22 during an encounter at
the Licensee’s facility and the person required immediate medical care by a medical professional. As a result of the
incident, the health department issued an order of “Animal Confinement” for a sloth named “Edward” on 7/24/22 and the
order states: “It has been reported that on 7/24/22 your sloth was involved in an alleged biting/scratching incident. NY
State Public Health Law requires a 30 day confinement of the animal for Rabies observation………If your animal has
neurological symptoms, or is not acting normal, it shall be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian and the Department


must be notified of the findings. The animal must be confined until 8/23/22.” A copy of the order was signed by the
licensee on 7/28/22 which was thirteen days prior to the 8/10/22 inspection.

(2) At the time of the inspection on 8/10/22, the USDA officials asked the Licensee to describe how the public feeds the
sloths during the encounters and he stated that the public uses tongs to hold the food fed to the sloths. The USDA
officials observed the public feeding of the sloths with the food held by tongs at the time of the inspection, but pictures
posted on the Licensee’s social media page the weekend immediately following the inspection show barehanded feeding
of the sloths by two children and one adult who was not the Licensee.

Per this Section, a licensee shall not interfere with any APHIS official in the course of carrying out their duties. The
provision of false information to inspectors at the time of an inspection interferes with the ability of the APHIS officials to
carry out their duties and is considered to be a form of interference. Correct from this date 10/3/22 forward.
2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
According to officials at the county of Suffolk, NY department of health, they were notified that a member of the public was
bitten and/or scratched by a sloth named “Edward” on 7/24/22 during an encounter at the Licensee’s facility and the
person required immediate medical care by a medical professional.

As a result of the incident, the health department issued an order of “Animal Confinement” for a sloth named “Edward” on
7/24/22 and the order states: “It has been reported that on 7/24/22 your sloth was involved in an alleged biting/scratching
incident. NY State Public Health Law requires a 30 day confinement of the animal for Rabies observation………If your
animal has neurological symptoms, or is not acting normal, it shall be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian and the


Department must be notified of the findings. The animal must be confined until 8/23/22.” A copy of the order was signed
by the licensee on 7/28/22. According to the health officials, had the incident involved one of the other more recently
acquired sloths, euthanasia and rabies testing of the sloth would likely have been required for public health purposes.

Per this Section during public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to
the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the safety
of the animals and the public. Injuries to a member of the public during public exhibition have the potential to adversely
affect the health of the animal or to result in the death of the animal.

Correct from this date 10/3/22 forward by ensuring there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between animals and
members of the public whenever encounters with the animals are conducted so that there is minimal risk of harm and to
assure the safety of both the animals and the public.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Licensee.
