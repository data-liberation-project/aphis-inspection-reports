HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On Friday, April 21, 2017, at 8:21 AM a gorilla keeper walked into the building entrance and observed hay on the
ground in the secondary containment/keeper area. The three gorillas were in their outdoor exhibit space at this time.
The keeper secured the secondary containment doors and assessed that the gorillas were contained to their
building. By looking through the containment door window, keepers made the observation that the door leading from
the den to the keeper area/secondary containment was ajar and the lock was locked through the lock hole on the
den. The keepers then made a code red radio announcement.
In the keeper area, where the gorilla’s hay was discovered, there are many items stored related to the care of
gorillas and maintenance of the exhibit such as enrichment items, trash cans, fans, etc. The emergency response
team was assembled. The team leader instructed the keepers to occupy the gorillas’ attention with food and away
from the entrance of the gorilla building. The facility was able to safely secure the den door lock and contain the
gorillas without the use of chemical restraint or shooting/dart equipment.
Following the incident, an investigation determined the gorillas got out of their dens as a result of keeper error. On
the evening of Thursday, April 20, 2017 the keeper who locked the gorilla dens put the lock in place but failed to
latch the lock which allowed the animals to open the den door. The locks on the den door are not in need of repair.
Animals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Though the
gorillas remained within secondary containment, had they gained outside access it could have resulted in serious
animal or human injury. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained to protect and contain the
animals.
Correct by: This day forward.
