ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0730-0825
hours on 05-FEB-18.
I honked seven times because the yard dog can be protective. I called land line and cell number leaving voice
messages on both. The front gate was open and the SUV and truck was parked near the RV trailer.
