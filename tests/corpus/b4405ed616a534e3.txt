PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the guinea pig room, each primary enclosure houses two guinea pigs. Of the 52 (26 cages) guinea pigs present,
all animals are of similar size and appearance. Two animals were randomly selected and weighed. Their weights
were 557, and 563 grams, for an average of 560 grams. The enclosures were measured, and found to have the
following floor space: 12 inches wide x 18 inches long = 216 square inches, minus the floor space of a feeder,
measuring approximately 3.5" x 5" = 17.5 square inches , minus waterer system/equipment measuring 3.5 inches x
12 inches= 42 square inches= total space available is156 square inches.
Since these guinea pigs weigh over 350 grams they are required to have 101 square inches of floor space each.
Since they are sharing the enclosure, they only have 78 square inches of floor space per animal.
The animals should be provided with adequate floor space so as to facilitate adequate freedom of movement.
Failure to provide adequate floor space could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals.
The guinea pigs should be housed in enclosures appropriate to their size.
