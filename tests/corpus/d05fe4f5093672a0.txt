2.50(b)(1)

Time and method of identification.
The dogs were not officially identified at the time of inspection today. The facility is worried the dogs may injure
themselves while wearing the tag. All dogs including puppies must be officially identified in order to be able to legally
identify each individual and to coordinate records and care. All dogs held shall be immediately identified when obtained by
the use of an official tag with collar, a microchip or a tattoo approved by Animal Care. Correct by 8/1/21.
3.3(e)(1)(iii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The construction of the walls of the indoor portion of the dog enclosures includes wood beams running from the floor to
the top of the walls (used to attach fencing/gate metal materials). This wood is no longer impervious to moisture. Water
applied absorbed into the wood. In order to allow for adequate cleaning and sanitation all walls and other surfaces in
contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture. Correct by 8/19/21.
3.6(a)(2)(vii)

Primary enclosures.
No shade was present in the outdoor portion of the dog enclosures at the time of inspection. The building would provide
shade for part of the day but not all of the day (depending on sun's location). Shade is necessary for the comfort of the


dogs and to help protect from overheating. The facility shall provide sufficient shade to shelter all the dogs housed.
Correct by 10/19/21.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with two facility representatives (one for records/exit and one at
kennel).
