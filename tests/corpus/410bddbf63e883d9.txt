CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Fifteen dogs arrived, at the SFO international baggage claim area, in fourteen crates on China Airlines flight CI0004.
Whereas some crates had labels taped on them that said "(cid:28)Feed water Continuously- 1 cup dry food AM, 1 cup dry
food PM(cid:29)", there was no consignor(cid:25)s declaration stating when the dogs were last offered food and water. Other
crates had no instructions. Failure to complete a written consignor's certification could have a negative impact on
the well-being of the animal. The airline should ensure that complete information is provided on each crate, by the
consignor, prior to taking possession of the animal.
To be corrected from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Fifteen dogs arrived, at the SFO international baggage claim area, in fourteen crates on China Airlines flight CI0004.
Some, but not all, of the crates had labels taped on that said "Live Animals(cid:29)", but the writing was variable in size,
and none had letters measuring at least one inch tall. Additionally there were no arrows to indicate the correct,
upright position for the enclosures. Primary enclosures should be labeled on top, and one or more sides, with the
words "Live Animals" in letters at least one inch in height, and with arrows or other such markings to indicate the
correct position during transport. Failure to adequately label the primary enclosure could result in improper handling
of the animal, which could put its well-being at risk.
To be corrected from this time forward.
3.14(f)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Fifteen dogs arrived, at the SFO international baggage claim area, in fourteen crates on China Airlines flight CI0004.
Two dogs were being transported in one crate. These two dogs, (cid:28)"Anita"(cid:29) and (cid:28)"Anne"(cid:29), were documented to be sixmonths old. Transporting two adult dogs, by air, in the same primary enclosure, could be detrimental to their
well-being. Adult dogs transported via air must be in individual primary enclosures.

To be corrected from this time forward.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
Fifteen dogs arrived, at the SFO international baggage claim area, in fourteen crates on China Airlines flight CI0004.
There were no food receptacles present in the enclosures. The absence of food receptacles makes complying with
the feeding and watering instructions difficult, especially in the event that the floor of the enclosure becomes soiled.
Food receptacles should be securely attached inside the enclosure, and accessible for feeding.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with an China Airlines representative at the time of the inspection.
