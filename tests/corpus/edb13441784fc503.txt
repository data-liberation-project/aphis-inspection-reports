The enclosures housing the five tigers in the back pasture are deteriorating.
Fence wire in all enclosures is rusting and breaking such that there are weakened areas and gaps in the fencing.
Due to the broken wires, there is a gap in the third pen where the lower fencing meets the kick-in. The horizontal
tension wire has broken due to rusting in several places such that it is no longer anchored to the fence posts. Some
fence posts have large rust holes that weaken them. Some trees within the enclosures have grown to the tops of the
kick-in fencing. The rust damage to the fencing has weakened the structural integrity of the enclosures. The tree
overgrowth provides a possible route for animal escape. These fencing must be repaired or replaced to restore
structural strength and prevent injury or escape of the animals. The trees must be trimmed and maintained so that
they do not grow near the fence. CORRECT BY: 11/01/2017
