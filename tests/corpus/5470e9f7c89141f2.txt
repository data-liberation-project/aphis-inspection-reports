ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four San Joaquin kit foxes housed together burrowed under the cement pool in their enclosure. Beginning in
January 2016 facility staff failed to observe two of the foxes for days or weeks at a time. The decomposed bodies of
the two animals were found in the burrow in late May 2016. According to the daily caretaker logs one of the two
hadn(cid:25)t been observed for a month as of 5/18 and an unspecified, longer period of time since the other animal had
been observed.
Incidences of delay in reporting health concerns to the attending veterinarian were found in facility records.
On 1/21/2016 staff noted a kit fox walking on three legs. The curator took radiographs of the leg and said that the
fox had either a bone spur or a broken toe and gave the animal an injection of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for
pain. It is unclear from the records when the injury resolved and the veterinarian was not contacted.
On 1/22/2016 a kit fox being treated with eye medication developed apparent inflammation of the eye and was
observed pawing at the eye. The curator was notified who said to continue the eye medication. The veterinarian
was not notified. The drops continued to be administered and on 2/5 one of the caretakers noted that the fox(cid:25)s eye
looked enlarged and asked the curator to look at the eye. The same concern was noted on 2/7 and the curator was
emailed. The veterinarian saw the animal on 2/9 and prescribed medication.
On 5/15/2016 staff noticed a deer with injuries from fighting including a swollen hock and broken hoof. Staff was told
by management to clean the wounds and administer antibiotics. The curator examined the animal the following day
and ordered wound cleaning and pain medication. Staff stated that the animal was very sore. On 5/17 no
improvement was noted in the animal(cid:25)s walking and staff stated they were waiting for the veterinarian to return a call
regarding a different pain medication.
Failure to observe animals on a daily basis and failure to communicate promptly with the attending veterinarian can
be detrimental to the health of the animals and cause unnecessary pain and distress. Daily observation of all the
animals to assess their well-being and direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding
health issues is necessary to ensure that the animals receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system shouldbe in place to ensure that all animals are observed daily and the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A kit fox enclosure housing four animals was not kept in good repair. The foxes burrowed under a cement pool and
two of the foxes were eventually found dead in the burrow under the pool. A staff member stated that it appeared
that one of the animals was entangled in pipes leading to the pool. The curator speculated in an incident report that
the burrow may have collapsed on the animals. Staff had reported being unable to find the animals in the deep
burrow on several occasions but repairs were never made to the enclosure.
Failure to keep enclosures in good repair can lead to animal injury or escape. In this case failure to keep the
enclosure in good repair resulted in the inability to monitor the animals and likely contributed to the deaths of the
foxes.
The remaining animals had been removed from this enclosure before the bodies were located, thus this
non-compliant item had been corrected at the time of the inspection.

SEPARATION.
Three San Joaquin kit foxes were housed with a fourth aggressive fox for several months. Staff repeatedly noted
incidents in the caretaker logs of injuries to less dominant animals, difficulties in ascertaining individual animal food
consumption, the dominant animal blocking animals inside a burrow, and temporarily moving the dominate animal
for brief periods so the others could come out of the burrow to eat and move around.
Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. In this instance two of the three less dominate
animals were found dead in their burrow after approximately five months of being housed with the aggressive
animal. The presence of the aggressive fox may have contributed to the deaths of the two other foxes.

An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
