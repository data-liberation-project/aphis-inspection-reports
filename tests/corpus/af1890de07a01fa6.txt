ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15 AM on
10-Dec-19.
The inspector was unable to gain access to the registrant's unit, because of a locked access gate at the address on
file with APHIS for the registrant. The inspector called the registrant and left a voicemail. The registrant returned the
inspector's call 9 minutes later. The registrant informed the inspector that they have deceased regulated activity and
have moved out of the address APHIS has on file for the registrant. The inspector requested that the registrant
contact the Animal Care office to cancel their registration. The registrant agreed to do so.
