3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility perimeter fence is only 4-5 feet in height in multiple areas. All outdoor housing facilities for
non-dangerous animals must be surrounded by a perimeter fence at least 6 feet in height. The required perimeter
fence height is necessary to help ensure that unauthorized persons or animals cannot access the facility and to
effectively function as a secondary containment system in case of animal escape. Fences less than six feet in
height must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
The current facility perimeter fence must be repaired or replaced to achieve six feet in height throughout or approval
must be obtained.
