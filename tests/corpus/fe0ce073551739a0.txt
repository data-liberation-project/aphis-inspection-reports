HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In Puppy building #1, old wood molding has been removed but wood behind it is still unsealed. Need to finish
sealing surface so that it is sanitizable.
In some places in concrete runs, there are cracks in the concrete although most have been repaired. Need to
finish repairing cracks so that feces/debris do not accumulate and surface is readily sanitizable. Correction date
remains June 30, 2014.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
