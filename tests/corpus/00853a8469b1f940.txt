3.106(b)(3)
WATER QUALITY.
Records for water sample testing were incomplete in that corrective actions for the occasional coliform counts
>1000 MPN (most probable number) per 100 ml of water were inconsistently documented.
Monitoring water quality and maintaining records of the testing is important for the health of the animals. These
records can help determine effectiveness of equipment that maintains water quality, as well as effectiveness of
corrective actions taken if coliform counts rise above 1000 MPN.
Records of sampling and results are to be kept for one year.
Correct within 30 days, by 4/13/2015.
The inspection was conducted on March 10-11, 2015. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility
personnel.
