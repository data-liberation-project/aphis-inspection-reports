3.103(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility does not have a perimeter fence sufficient to keep unauthorized persons and animals out of the facility.
Whereas the fence that encircles the majority of the facility has undergone extensive repairs and improvement,
there are still some places where the perimeter fence falls short of the requirements.
Specifically, the following were observed:
-(cid:9)Some sections of the white PVC fence have large gaps underneath the fence, of four to twelve inches, that could
allow animals to enter the facility.
-(cid:9)There are some openings / gaps / missing sections in the fence-line.
-(cid:9)There were many sections of fence-line that did not meet the six foot height requirement on both sides of the
fence.
Inadequate fencing puts the animals at risk from unauthorized persons, and also from animals which could enter the
facility and come into contact with the marine mammals, posing a risk of injury or disease. Steps should be taken to
ensure that the fencing meets the requirements under 3.103 (c). Fencing should be at least six feet in height in
order to deter trespassers, and the fence should be maintained so as to keep animals and unauthorized people
from passing under or through the fence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
