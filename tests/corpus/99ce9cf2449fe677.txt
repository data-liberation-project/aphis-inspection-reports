Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
None of the approved protocols provide assurance from the investigator that the activities do not unnecessarily duplicate
previous experiments. This assurance needs to be provided for proper IACUC review and approval.
To be corrected by September 20th, 2021.
2.31(e)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Some required information was missing from the 6 teaching protocols:
- None of the protocols had an explanation for the appropriateness of the species and number of animals used.
- Four of the protocols (VETY3924, VETY2844, VETY3934, VETY2893) did not contain a complete description of the
proposed use of the animals. Specifically, the skin scrape, spay/neuter, blood and urine collection procedures were not
described.
- All but one of the protocols did not describe the method of euthanasia to be used when necessary.
Protocols describing the conduct of activity involving animals must contain all of the required information for proper
IACUC review and approval.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Many of the rabbits and dogs had long nails. Three of the rabbits, Grunt (female brown lionhead), Dutch (male brown and
white Dutch) and Luka (male gray Havana), had the longest nails, extending approximately 1 inch to 1.5 inches beyond
the nail bed, curving sideways, growing outwards and splayed from each other. Of the dogs, Ursula (Microchip #
837371055), had the longest nails, extending approximately 1.5 to 2 inches beyond the nail bed, curving downwards and
slightly sideways. Adequate foot care is needed in order to prevent abnormal nail growth or additional disease conditions
which can be painful to the animal. The facility must implement a preventative care and treatment plan per the attending
veterinarians’ guidance to ensure properly trimmed nails for the rabbits and the dogs.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During the inspection, 2 dogs were identified with conditions affecting the feet:
Champ (Microchip # 837378864), a brown and white dog, had both front feet affected. The hair on top of the feet were
wet and brown staining could be seen on the white hairs over the toes. The skin along all of the digits, at the nail beds and
on the webbing between the toes was red and inflamed. Brown/red staining could also be seen on the 3 exterior nails of
both the left and the right foot, extending approximately 0.5 inch from the nail bed onto the nail. Champ also had an
approximately 1 inch in diameter circular red hairless and raised lesion on the back of his right rear foot.
Blake (Microchip # 837380847), a white dog with black spots, had all four feet affected. Brown staining could be seen on
the white hair covering all four feet. The skin along all of the digits, at the nail beds, on the webbing between the toes and
covering the foot pads, was red and inflamed. On both of the front feet, near the dewclaw, there was an approximately 0.5
inch in diameter circular red moderately hairless and slightly raised lesion. On Blake’s left hind foot, at the juncture


between the foot and the leg, there was an approximately 1.5 inch in diameter circular red hairless raised lesion.
The facility had not identified the condition affecting these two dogs, therefore had not contacted the veterinarian for
guidance on care. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress in animals
with such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to properly
assess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for
timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. These two dogs need to be seen by a veterinarian for an appropriate
diagnosis and treatment plan.

Primary enclosures.
8 dogs were being housed individually in temporary primary enclosures that do not meet the minimum floor space and
interior height requirements.
Two dogs measured 30 inches from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail requiring a minimum floor space of 9 square
feet. The primary enclosures they were housed in only provided 6 square feet of floor space. The other 6 dogs were of the
same size or larger than the 2 measured yet still housed in the same type of enclosure. Therefore, the minimum floor
space was insufficient for all dogs.
For approximately 5 dogs, the interior height of the primary enclosure was not 6 inches higher than the head of the dog
when in a normal standing position.
The inadequate amount of floor and head space may not provide enough room for the dogs to comfortably make natural
postural movements. Enclosures that are too small can have a negative impact on their health and well-being. Each dog
housed in a primary enclosure must be provided a minimum amount of floor and head space as required by the Animal
Welfare Act.


The facility representative informed us that the dogs will be returning to their adequately sized primary enclosures the next
day since repairs are now done.

Sanitation.
All 8 of the guinea pig enclosures had an excessive accumulation of feces. Feces collected in piles in the corners and
were evenly distributed along the bedding to the point that there was nowhere free of feces for the guinea pigs to walk on.
Most of the feces were dry and appeared old. A layer of darker used bedding could be seen beneath the fresher bedding
in the majority of the primary enclosures. The accumulation of feces and dirty bedding can result in illness and discomfort
thus having the potential to negatively impact the well-being of the guinea pigs. Primary enclosures must be cleaned and
sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta.

3.56(a)(1)

Sanitation.
A strong odor of urine and feces could be appreciated upon entering the room housing 9 rabbits. The trays underneath
approximately 5 of the enclosures had puddles of urine and an excessive accumulation of feces, piles ranging from 1.5 to
2.5 inches in height in some areas. In approximately 4 of the enclosures, some areas of the flooring were stained a
brown/red color. The accumulation of feces, unclean enclosures and unpleasant odors can result in illness and discomfort
thus having the potential to negatively impact the well-being of the rabbits. Primary enclosures must be kept reasonably
free of excreta, hair, and other debris by periodic cleaning.
