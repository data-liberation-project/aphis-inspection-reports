Watering.
In one cage containing two guinea pigs the water bowl was almost empty and contained feces and bedding. When clean
water in a new larger bowl was provided the two guinea pigs drank rapidly and continuously for over a minute. Dirty water
that contains fecal material may reduce the potability of the water and can present a health risk to the animals. Clean
water must be provided daily, and all water receptacles must be kept clean and shall be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks to ensure the health of the animals. The licensee must develop and maintain a program to ensure that animals
have daily access to clean water.

Sanitation.

gliders in each cage, there were dirty plastic exercise wheels covered with caked on feces. The removal of excreta and
the cleaning of the cages and the materials within them must be done as often as necessary to prevent contamination of
the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odor. Adequate measures must be taken
and maintained to promote the overall health and well-being of the animals.
