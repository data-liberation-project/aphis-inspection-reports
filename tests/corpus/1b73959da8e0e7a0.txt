FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The damaged and bent fencing on the west side of the front enclosure cited on the last inspection report has been
repaired. However, a heavy gauge wire used in multiple areas to secure the fencing to a metal post has long, sharp
points protruding into the enclosure area at the level of the animals.
*An unused wooden building in the back enclosure, accessible to multiple species, has many large nail heads and
sharp nail ends protruding from a side and the rear of the building. The nail heads and points are at the level of the
animals.
Housing facilities must be kept in good repair to safely contain the animals and prevent injury. The sharp points
should be removed from potential animal contact.

WATERING.
Two water receptacles, one metal and one rubber, were noted in the wallaby enclosure during this inspection. Both
containers had confluent green algae on the bottom and the metal enclosure had confluent green algae on the
sides. The licensee stated he cleans the water receptacles every third day.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary to prevent unnecessary bacterial and fungal contamination
and protect the health of the animals. Water receptacles should be cleaned as often as necessary to minimize algal
growth.

SANITATION.
The wooden shelter for the wallaby has an excessive accumulation of dirt and cobwebs on the interior surfaces,
floor and ceiling. The licensee states that the area is not cleaned on a regular basis. To minimize disease hazardsand protect the health of the animal this shelter should be cleaned frequently enough to prevent accumulations of
cobwebs and dirt.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
