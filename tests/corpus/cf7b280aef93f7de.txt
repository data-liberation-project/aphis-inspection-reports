HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
****The sheltered spider monkey facility is constructed of cement flooring. There is a large crack running across the
floor. It was indicated that the crack in the flooring was sealed 4 years ago. Cracked surfaces can lead to potential
disease hazards, odors, and cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized. All surfaces in direct contact with the animals
must be maintained and repaired consistently when worn. Correct by 9/15/2014
**** The sheltered lemur facility has significant rust on the lower rails in the indoor portion of the enclosure. The rust
has caused sharp jagged edges on the bottom rail of the indoor portion of this enclosure. The metal base of the
enclosure has rust that flakes off when touched. These rusted surfaces can cause injury are unable to be
adequately cleaned and sanitized . The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the animals are in
good repair to prevent injury and must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization.

**** The interior portion of the sheltered spider monkey enclosure contains a public veiwing window with a wood
window sill. The window sill has deteriorated to the point that it is falling apart and needs to be replaced. These
moldy, rotten, wood surfaces can cause injury because they are no longer structurally sound and are unable to be
adequately cleaned and sanitized . The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the animals are ingood repair to prevent injury and must be able to be cleaned and sanitized.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
**** There was not an adequate environmental enhancement plan (EEP) on hand to address the phychological
well-being of the nonhuman primates. The EEP must be reviewed and approved by the attending veterinarian.
There is no plan denoting the daily enrichment and no log book or calendar showing that enrichment takes place.
The animals do have different items in their enclosures, but there was no written plan and no schedule of rotating or
changing the items in the enclosure. The items in the enclosure were not on a written plan. The enrichment must be
documented on the environmental enhancement plan, and the plan must be followed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** The loop area housing a pony, mouflon, aoudad, goats and domestic sheep has had significant surface erosion
resulting in 12' to 18 ' of rough, jagged, exposed concrete around the perimeter of the enclosure and around each
fence post of the enclosure. The sharp, jagged edges could potentially cause injury to the animals. The licensee
must ensure that enclosures are kept in good repair including substrate addition to cover the sharp jagged concrete
within the enclosure.
