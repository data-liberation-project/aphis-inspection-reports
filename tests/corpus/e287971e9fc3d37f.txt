Facilities, outdoor.
5 adult guinea pigs were house in an outdoor facility. The enclosure was constructed of wood posts, wire walls, and dirt
floor. The enclosure contained a plastic shelter structure which did not provide temperature (climate) control.
Guinea pigs are very sensitive to heat and cold, and may experience poor health if exposed to temperatures that are too
hot or cold.
Correct by housing guinea pigs in indoor facilities that provide adequate climate control to support the health of the
animals. Correct by June 28, 2021.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
Three adult patagonian cavy's and one adult African Crested porcupine are housed in primary enclosures that are
outdoors. The facility's perimeter fence is 4 feet tall and composed of horizontal strands of barbed wire.
A perimeter fence keeps unauthorized people and animals away from animal enclosures, and also acts as a secondary
containment system in the event an animal escapes.
Correct by installing a perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet tall and sufficient to keep unauthorized people and animals
from having contact with the primary enclosures containing exotic animals, and that will act as a secondary containment


system for animals at the facility. Temporary correction due by August 1, 2021; permanent correction due by December 1,
2021.
