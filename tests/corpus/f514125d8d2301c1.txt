INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In IACUC approved protocol #4272, the stated that the animal would be anesthetized using ketamine HCl given in
combination with the atropine sulfate, masked with isoflurane, intubated and maintained at a surgical level of
anesthesia with isoflurane. According the facility’s anesthesia logs, dates ranging from 11/5/2016 through 9/1/2016,
the cats did not receive the pre-anesthetic combination listed in protocol instead they were anesthetized with only
isoflurane without complication, as per the PI. The PI implemented the change in procedures based on scientific
justification without prior IACUC approval. The IACUC should ensure that an animal procedure is conducted as
described in the approved animal care and use proposal to avoid or minimize discomfort, pain and/or distress to the
animals. Any significant changes should have IACUC approval prior to implementation.
