TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Two enclosures containing puppies in the whelping building did not have appropriate identification either on the
puppies or the enclosures. These weaned puppies must have an approved means of identification either on the
puppy or on the enclosure with the necessary information. Proper identification is essential in providing basic
animal husbandry such as vaccinations and dewormings. To be corrected by: 08/14/15
