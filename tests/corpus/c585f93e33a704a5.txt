Veterinary care for dogs.
The written program of veterinary care does not address all of the requirements for adequate veterinary care of dogs.
There is no frequency listed for a complete physical exam of each dog. There is no written plan to sample and test
animals for fleas, heartworms, intestinal worms, coccidia, or giardia. There is no written plan for preventative care to
maintain healthy haircoats, trimmed nails, clean eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. A thorough written program of veterinary care
is essential to ensuring the health and welfare of dogs. Correct by 12/31/22 by ensuring that the written program of
veterinary care meets the requirements set forth in the regulations.
