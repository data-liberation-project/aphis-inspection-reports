***In the outdoor enclosure, there was a male Rottweiler identified as "Wolf" that had protruding hip and spine
bones. The facility representative stated that the male had recently been with a female and is getting extra food now
that he is back in the enclosure by himself. Signs of bone protrusion left unattended by veterinary intervention may
worsen and lead to a serious condition in the animal.
***There was a female Rottweiler, identified as #26 that was observed eating grass and there were several piles of
loose substance (red and brown in color) in the enclosure that contained grass. The facility representative stated
that he believes that she has had a miscarriage. It is unknown whether the substance is stool, vomit or another
discharge. This dog was also limping on her left front leg. Upon further observation, there was a pad that had a
laceration. She also had an area on the top of her head approximately the size of a quarter in diameter that had hair
loss. This area was red and appeared to be wet in the center. The facility representative stated that "she had a little
hot spot." Hair loss is an abnormal situation that could indicate a serious medical condition. Loose substances
within the enclosure can be an indication of a serious medical problem. Limited weight bearing or non-weight
bearing limbs are an indication of discomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the risks of further deterioration if
not properly diagnosed and treated or left if left unattended.
***There was a female Rottweiler, identified as #4 "Damsel" that had a raised area on the top of her head
approximately the size of a quarter in diameter and raised approximately .5 centimeter. Raised areas can be an
indication of a serious medical condition and could cause pain or discomfort to the animal.
The licensee must have these three animals evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by July 22, 2014, follow the
treatment plans and assure that all regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.This inspection began at 1115.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
