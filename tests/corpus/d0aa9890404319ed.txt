2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The fennec fox enclosure has no barrier fence in front of it. A couple of toddlers were seen grasping the primary
enclosure fence.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
Erect a barrier fence in front of the primary enclosure or add a solid surface to the front of the enclosure to prevent
people from grasping the primary enclosure.
To be corrected by May 16, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Director of Business Operations.
