2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**During the inspection a 3 year old male Yorkie (#20, known as “Tommy“) was observed to have an excessive
buildup of brown tarter that encased multiple teeth and obstructed the view of the normal shapes of the teeth in
addition to receding gum lines. The teeth had not been observed by the licensee and the attending veterinarian had
not been contacted for any treatment prior to this inspection. Upon contacting the attending veterinarian, he
confirmed there had not been contact with the clinic regarding the animal’s dental issues. The buildup of tarter and
debris on the teeth can cause possible health issues if left untreated or managed on a regular basis.
**The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of any dogs with a large
buildup of tarter or any gum or tooth issues. The licensee should check all regulated animals regularly for any health
and dental issues. In addition, the licensee must have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with his
attending veterinarian on all animal health issues, to include dental issues, that are observed within the facility.
