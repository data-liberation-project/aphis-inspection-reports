ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three adult female deer appear very thin with ribs showing. One of these doe is emaciated with ribs, hip bones and
spine visible. This doe was drooling from its mouth during this inspection. These three deer are over 10 years of
age, currently shedding their summer coat and had fawns in June and early July. The co-owner called the attending
veterinarian about the three deer on Tuesday (9/18/18), at which time he recommended the deer be dewormed by
putting Strongid C in the feed. Treatment for the thin deer was started on Friday (9/21/18).
The co-owner of the facility stated she knew about the three deer being thin this summer, but did not call the
attending veterinarian until Tuesday (9/18/18). The written Program of Veterinary Care on file states that the deer
will be dewormed yearly and more often if necessary. There were no records present to determine when the deer
were last dewormed, observation records, or treatments given to the deer as of Wednesday (9/19/18).
Daily observations must be done on the animals to assess their health and well-being. The attending veterinarian
must be consulted when there are problems with animal health, behavior, and well-being. Failure to call the
attending veterinarian when there are problems with animal health may result in worsening of the condition and
prevent treatment from being started in a timely manner. The licensee must ensure that the attending veterinarian
is consulted when there are problems with animal health, behavior and well being. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection was conducted with the caretaker and exit interview was conducted with the co-owner.
