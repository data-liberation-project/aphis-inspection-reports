ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility does not have an appropriate plan for environment enhancement and could not demonstrate that
enrichment was being provided for nine lemurs. Lack of a developed plan and not providing a variety of enrichment
could negatively affect the psychological well-being of the lemurs. Develop, implement, and maintain as directed by
the Attending Veterinarian an appropriate environmental enhancement plan for the lemurs. Correct by 2/21/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
