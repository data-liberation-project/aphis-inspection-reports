FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a very strong odor in the sugar glider room. The air conditioning vent in the sugar glider room is closed
and there is no exhaust fan so the air is not circulating adequately. Insufficient ventilation can cause illness. The
ventilation shall be improved in the housing area to protect the health of the sugar gliders.
