2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One senior female Fallow Deer was observed to be limping on her right front leg. Lameness can be caused by a
variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and
affect the health and well-being of the animal. This animal also had overgrown hooves, the toes on her right front
leg were longer compared to the others. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities
which could be painful or cause injuries.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The
program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
