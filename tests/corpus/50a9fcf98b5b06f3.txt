Minimum age requirements.
One puppy born on 4/6/21 was shipped on 5/29/21. It was shipped three days prior to the 8 weeks minimum age
requirement. Another puppy born on 6/16/22 was shipped on 8/10/22. It was shipped one day prior to the 8 weeks
minimum age requirement. Puppies younger than 8 weeks of age are more susceptible to stresses that occur from
travelling and being placed into a new facility. Their immune systems are more susceptible to becoming compromised
which could cause them to become sick and even die. The licensee must not sell and transport any puppies under 8
weeks of age. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
