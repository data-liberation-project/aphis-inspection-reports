2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* According to facility records, one employee worked at the facility from 9-11:30am on Tuesday, 23 December 2014.
No other employees/volunteers/interns worked at the facility that day and no one worked the 24th or 25th of
December. Although there was no supporting documentation, the licensee stated he came in over those days to
check on the 42 mammals. In addition to the mammals, there are hundreds of other birds, reptiles, fish, and
amphibians housed at the facility. On 26 December 2014, when the employees returned to work, the anteater was
observed on exhibit to be "very listless", "not moving, eating, or opening its eyes". The animal was described by the
licensee to be basically "in a coma". The animal was pulled off exhibit and placed in a large pet carrier on a counter
in the kitchen. The only documentation of the treatment provided to the animal was one-way text messages (with
no visible responses) from the licensee to the Attending Veterinarian on the licensee's cell phone. According to that
text record, the "anteater (was) not moving but still alive" at 2:40 pm on Friday, 26 December 2014. The caretaker
believed the animal was dehydrated so the licensee "suggested injecting it with 100mL saline". There were no
other treatments documented, but the licensee claims an antibiotic was administered. The animal's condition never
improved. It passed away on Saturday evening, 27 December 2014, without ever being examined by a
veterinarian. A necropsy was performed by the Attending Veterinarian who determined the anteater died from renal
failure. Renal failure can make animals feel very miserable and requires extensive medical care to help relieve
some of the painful symptoms. This animal should have been examined by a veterinarian as soon as it was
dicovered to be so ill so it's painful condition could have been managed appropriately.
** The licensee must ensure all animals receive appropriate veterinary care (including appropriate documentation of
that care) at all times. TO BE CORRECTED: By 20 February 2015

WATERING.
* The water in the guinea pig enclosure was cloudy and contaminated with feces, bedding, and some unknown
brown-colored organic substance. The guinea pig could become ill if it drinks contaminated water.
** The licensee must ensure the guinea pig is provided potable water daily and ensure receptacles are sanitizedwhen dirty. TO BE CORRECTED BY: This noncompliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.

SANITATION.
HOUSEKEEPING.
* There was a large, thick cobweb covered in dust in the upper right corner of the guinea pig enclosure as well as
other cobwebs along the ceiling of that enclosure. There was also a utility closet directly adjacent to the guinea pig
enclosure. There was an accumulation of junk and trash cluttered inside this utility room. The door to the closet
was kept shut but it was a couple inches off the ground leaving a large gap between the door and the floor. Just
inside the door there was a utility shelf. A couple inches off the ground, on that shelf, there were some soiled fish
nets and a dirty, deteriorating box that was covered in mold. There was also evidence that generalized cleaning in
the building was not occuring, such as on overhead pipes and underneath enclosures. Unsanitary conditions in or
near the guinea pig enclosure poses a health risk for the animal.
** The licensee must ensure the facility is cleaned often enough to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards
and practices. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 26 February 2015

SANITATION.
HOUSEKEEPING.
* There was a large fan directly above the rabbit enclosure. The fan had a build-up of dust and cobwebs. There
was also a utility closet directly adjacent to the rabbit enclosure. There was an accumulation of junk and trash
cluttered inside this utility room. The door to the closet was kept shut but it was a couple inches off the ground
leaving a large gap between the door and the floor. Just inside the door there was a utility shelf. A couple inches
off the ground, on that shelf, there were some soiled fish nets and a dirty, deteriorating box that was covered in
mold. There was also evidence that generalized cleaning in the building was not occuring, such as on overhead
pipes and underneath enclosures. Unsanitary conditions in or near the rabbit enclosure poses a health risk for the
animal.
** The licensee must ensure the facility is cleaned often enough to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards
and practices. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 26 February 2015
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
STORAGE.* There was an open bag of cat food stored on the top of an open shelf in the kitchen. The cat food was used to
feed the genets and otters. There was evidence (such as pellet droppings and insulation chewed out from the wall)
that indicated rodents had been present just below the shelf. Open bags of food invite unwelcome disease-carrying
pests and can result in the food becoming contaminated by rodent excreta. The dryer which was full of bedding and
towels used by the mammals had the door wide open and bedding hanging out during the inspection. Several feet
away from the open dryer, amongst the clutter in the room, there were multiple rodent droppings on the floor.
Bedding and towels located near areas with rodents could also easily become contaminated with rodent excreta.
** The licensee must ensure that supplies of food and bedding are stored in a manner which protects them from
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 21 February 2015

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
AMBIENT TEMPERATURES.
* The heater in the building was broke and not producing any heat. As a result "the Jungle" enclosure housing a
kinkajou and a two-toed sloth had an ambient temperature of 52.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The water receptacle for
those animals was on a ledge with a surface temperature ranging from 49.5 to 52.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The main
source of heat provided in the fairly large enclosure was coming from just two heat lamps hanging from the ceiling.
Other than when the completely empty food bowl was replinished with fresh produce, over a period of nearly seven
hours, the sloth did not leave its location directly under the heat lamp. The sloth was as close as it could get to the
lamp and had its arm hanging on the lamp, in direct contact with the bulb. The kinkajou, unable to get as close to a
heat lamp, laid curled in a tight ball on one of the 49.5 degree ledges and was observed shivering. When animals
are exposed to uncomfortable temperatures, they can become stressed, resulting in weakened immune systems
and possible health problems.
** The licensee must ensure the ambient temperature in the enclosures do not fall below nor rise above
temperatures compatible with the health and comfort of the animals. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 20 February 2015.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
VENTILATION.
* The enclosures for one genet, 12 degus, and 11 sugar gliders all had a strong, stale odor of urine and waste
material. The degu enclosure had a screen top but it had a heavy amount of dust on it, hindering the flow of clean
air into the enclosure. The sugar glider enclosure also had a screen top but there was a solid ceiling just a fewinches above it, again hindering the flow of fresh air into the enclosure. The genet enclosure had its vent closed off
with a piece of cardboard in order to try to mainain heat in the enclosure which was 61 degrees Fahrenheit. The
vent in the second genet enclosure was open but had a build-up of cobwebs on it indicating it hadn't been cleaned
in quite awhile. None of the vents were actively pushing air through the enclosures since the heating/cooling
system broke some time ago, according to employees. Adequate ventilation is necessary to reduce the risk of
harmful contmainants (such as ammonia) from building up in the air.
** The licensee must ensure the facility is adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means to provide for the
health of the animals at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2 March 2015.
3.126(c)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
LIGHTING.
* The overhead light in one of the genet enclosures was not on during the inspection. The facility representative
attempted to turn the light on but was unable to and stated that the light had not been working properly. Facility
records indicated that the problem with the light was noticed by the care staff back on 12 January 2015. Without the
overhead light, the enclosure was fairly dark and the inspectors had to use a flashlight to appropriately observe the
enclosure. It was noted by a facility representative during inspection that the genet housed in that enclosure had
not consumed any food or water from its bowls in the past 48 hours. Sufficient light in enclosures is necessary to
adequately observe the animals and their enclosures daily.
** The licensee must ensure there is ample lighting in all enclosures to permit routine inspection and cleaning. TO
BE CORRECTED BY: 26 February 2015
3.126(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
DRAINAGE.
* The drain pipes for the pools in the otter enclosure and in "the Jungle" enclosure housing the kinkajou and the
two-toed sloth were reportedly frozen and not working properly. As a result, the water in those two pools had not
been drained or replaced in 11 days, resulting in murky water. In "the Jungle", all the feces from the sloth and
kinkajou from the past 11 days was hosed into the pool and there was a thick, brown sediment covering the entire
bottom. Properly functioning drains are necessary to minmize the animals' risk of coming in contact with
contaminated water.
** The licensee must ensure that all drains are kept in good repair. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 26 February 20153.130
WATERING.
* The water receptacle for the 9-banded armadillo was completely filled with wet, contaminated mulch that was used
for the ground substrate in the animal's enclosure. The water in the enclosure housing 12 degus was cloudy and
contaminated with bedding material and feces. The water receptacle for the two otters was completely dry. They
have a secondary source of water in their swimming pool but the drain in that pool was malfunctioning so that water
had not been changed in 11 days and was very murky. Sufficient potable water is necessary in order to keep the
animals healthy.
** The licensee must ensure that all the animals have access to potable water as often as necessary for the health
of the animals. Furthemore, the licensee must ensure that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary. TO
BE CORRECTED BY: This noncompliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.
3.131(a) DIRECT
SANITATION.
CLEANING OF ENCLOSURES.
* Both genets had an accumulation of feces in their litter boxes taking up over 1/3 to 1/2 of the boxes. The amount
of feces and the dried consistency of some of the stools indicate their litter boxes had not been emptied in weeks.
The food and water receptacles are kept just inches away from the heavily used litter boxes. Upon inspection, it
was noted by an employee that one genet had not eaten any food or drank any water for approximately 48 hours.
The enclosure housing one chinchilla also had an excessive accumulation of feces. The chinchilla's fecal droppings
were covering the inside of the log which the animal used for a resting surface. They were also found on the
chinchilla's rocks, throughout the ground in its bedding, in its dust bowl, and in its empty food receptacle. The litter
box for the raccoon was filled with substrate material that was completely saturated with urine. The inner sides of
that litter box were covered in urine stains. The enclosure containing 12 degus also had an excessive accumulation
of feces. The feces was scattered throughout the animals' bedding and was observed in their water bowl. There
were piles of feces located behind and underneath several of the large rocks used for enrichment. Many of those
rocks which were originally naturally light colored had turned dark brown due to a coating of some type of organic
substance. The sugar glider enclosure kept on the kitchen counter had a nesting pouch containing the two animals,
multiple fecal droppings, urine stains, and a very strong waste odor. The feces dropped by the sloth and kinkajou
get hosed into the pool at the bottom of their enlcosure. The drain pipe for that pool was frozen over the previous
weekend. As a result, fecal material from the past 11 days was present in the pool in the form of a thick sediment
covering the bottom surface of the pool. Failure to routinely remove excreta from enclosures poses a health risk forthe animals.
** The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from enclosures as often as necessary to minimize disease
hazards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 20 February 2015
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
HOUSEKEEPING.
* The janitor who was paid to clean the facility four days a week was no longer employed by the facility. The
licensee did not hire anyone to fill that vacant position but rather had the caretakers, volunteers, interns, and himself
take over those cleaning responsibilities. There were multiple areas throughout the facility which were not getting
cleaned appropriately. There was trash, dust, dirt, and grime located under some enclosures which were housing
reptiles but located in very close proximity to the mammals. There was a build-up of dust and dirt on overhead
pipes like the one directly above the armadillo enclosure. There was also a heavy amount of dust built-up on top of
several enclosures such as the armadillo enclosure and the degu enclosure. The exhaust fans used to help
ventilate "the Jungle" enclosure were also covered in dust and cobwebs. The washroom used to clean towels and
bedding used by the mammals was completely filled with clutter and rodent droppings were observed just a few feet
from where the mammal bedding was located. The floor of the kitchen area, especially in the corners, had an
excessive build-up of dirt, dust and debris, as well as evidence from droppings and chewed insulation material that
rodents had been in the room. Facilities which aren't kept reasonably clean can easily become a welcome
environment for rodents and other disease-carrying pests.
** The licensee must ensure the facility is cleaned often enough to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards
and practices. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 26 February 2015
3.132 DIRECT
EMPLOYEES.
* Since 1 December 2014, the licensee significantly cut back the hours of his four full-time paid employees who act
as curators and the primary caretakers for the animals. The lead curator went from 40 hours down to 24 while two
others dropped from 40 hours per week down to 14. In addition, the paid janitor who was working 4 days a week is
no longer employed by the facility. According to documentation, there have been approximately 10 days since 1
December 2014 when none of the employees/volunteers/interns came to the facility. The licensee stated he came
to the facility on those days to ensure the animals had food and water and to spot clean their enclosures. According
to the licensee, he is at the facility 7 days a week. There have been approximately 16 days since 1 December 2014
when there was only one worker present at the facility besides the licensee. Some of these days (Mondays and
Tuesdays) the facility is closed, but others are days the facility and its exhibits of hundreds of animals are open tothe public. On those days, one person has a responsibility to tend the front desk while the other has to often give
tours throughout the day. In addition to operating the facility with very few man-hours, the licensee stated one of the
four curators is not adequately taking care of the animals and on occasion the animals have not been fed because
of that employee. The day before this inspection, only the licensee was present at the facility. The conditions found
the next morning during the inspection (numerous empty food bowls, contaminated water receptacles, apparent
failure to spot clean, filled litter boxes, and general lack of cleaning throughout the facility) indicate that the facility
does not have a sufficient number of adequately trained employees.
** The licensee needs to ensure there is a sufficient number of adequately trained employees working a sufficient
number of hours to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 27 February
2015
The inspection was conducted on 18 February 2015 with a facility representative and the licensee. An exit interview
was conducted on 20 February 2015.
