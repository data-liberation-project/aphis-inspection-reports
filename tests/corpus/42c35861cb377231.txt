Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Four adult babydoll sheep are in need of shearing. The sheep have thick wooly coats covering much of their body. One
sheep has dried fecal material stuck to the wool under the base of its tail. The expected high temperature today is 95
degrees Fahrenheit. The facility usually shears the sheep in May, and hired a sheep shearer who came to shear the
sheep earlier this month but the clippers broke down before the sheep could be adequately shorn. Sheep who have thick
wooly coats in hot weather may experience stress, overheating, and discomfort. Correct by having the sheep shorn by
June 1, 2022 or prior to your next scheduled relicense inspection, whichever comes first.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
Applicant.
All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by July 19, 2022 or the Applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection. Regulated
activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
