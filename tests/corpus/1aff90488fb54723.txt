CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
* Three enclosures (containing three dogs) have a significant build-up of fecal material. The dogs were seen to be
walking in/through the feces. This type of build-up can increase soiling of the dogs, pests, odors and disease
hazards. Licensee must ensure that feces and other waste are removed from the enclosure on a daily basis to help
prevent or reduce soiling of the dogs, odors, pest and disease hazards.
