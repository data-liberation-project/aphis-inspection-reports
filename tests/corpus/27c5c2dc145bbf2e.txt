MISCELLANEOUS.
In March 2014 a rabbit died soon after surgery while still in the recovery area. The cause of death was blood loss
which happened during and after surgery. The facility addressed this incident by initiating changes, including but
not limited to; administering fluids to an animal if blood loss occurs and ensuring the animal has achieved
hemostasis. This incident has not recurred.
The facility has addressed this item and this was a self-reported incident to the USDA.
This inspection was conducted on July 21-22, 2015 with an exit briefing with a facility representative.
