FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
Chapman's back fence-

The wire mesh at the bottom of the split rail fence is curling into the pig enclosure. Sharp points are present that
could potentially cause harm to the pig. Additionally, the vertical posts are rotted and leaning. These damaged
areas leave the fence structurally unsound.
These damaged items must be repaired or replaced to prevent animal injury and to maintain the structural strength
of the primary enclosure.
