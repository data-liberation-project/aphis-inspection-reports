ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A pregnant female dachshund # 016 was in the the whelping box and appeared very thin with a visible spine and
prominent hips bones. She had pale soft tissues around eyes and mouth which could be a sign of illness. This dog
is due to whelp soon and her condition should be communicated to the attending veterinarian for guidance in how to
best support her body condition through the whelping and nursing process.
