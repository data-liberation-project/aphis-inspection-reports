2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. It has not been signed off by the licensee. The goats aren't listed
on the Program of Veterinary Care. The ectoparasites section, intestinal parasites section, and emergency care
sections are all blank. In addition, the Attending Veterinarian has not visited the home site in the past year. An
incomplete Program of Veterinary Care and the Attending Veterinarian not conducting regularly scheduled visits to
the premises doesn't ensure that the animals are received optimal care. All sections of the Program of Veterinary
Care must be completed and the Attending Veterinarian must visit the premises to inspect the animals. Correct by
12/14/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
