Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Golden retriever (tag #142) has a severely emaciated body condition. The dog's hip bones, ribs, shoulder blades
and back bone are clearly visible and there is little to no fat or muscle covering the animal. The dog had arrived at the
facility in early April and was observed by the inspectors to be in poor body condition, but was under veterinary treatment.
APHIS officials had visited the facility again in late May and the dog's body condition had gotten worse and she had not
been re-evaluated by a veterinary at that time. Currently, the dog has not been re-evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for
her emaciated body condition. An emaciated body condition could indicate a serious underlying health issue, and if left
untreated, could result in the death of the animal.

Female brown Cocker spaniel (no ID) has an enlarged, swollen abdomen. The dog was observed walking around the
enclosure in a hunched position for approximately one minute. The dog appeared to be straining to defecate, and was
finally able to release some liquid feces. The licensee stated that he does not believe the dog is pregnant and she has
not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. Swollen abdomens and trouble defecating could indicate a serious
underlying health issue.

Female Cavalier (tag #296) has an abnormal appearance to the left eye. A large amount of brownish colored discharge

was located around the upper and lower eye lid and going down the face from the corner of the eye. The white of the eye
is slightly reddened. A small red area is located on the surface of the cornea. The dog is not currently under any
veterinary treatment. Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.

Female Cavalier (#352) has an abnormal condition to both eyes. A large amount of greenish-yellow discharge is attached
to the hair around the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes. The inspector observed the discharge stuck to the surface of
both of the dog's eyes. The white of the right eye was slightly reddened. The licensee stated that the dog had been
under treatment for the eyes before, but was not currently under any treatment from a licensed veterinarian. Abnormal
conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the animal.

Male Bernese Mountain dog (no ID) has an abnormal condition to the left eye. A large amount of greyish colored
discharge is located along the bottom of the dog's eye. The dog is not under any treatment by a licensed veterinarian.

Female Bernese Mountain dog (no ID) has an abnormal condition to the top of her nose. The top of her nose is raw, dark
red and has areas covered by a scab-like material. The licensee had not noticed the condition of the dog and she was
under no veterinary treatment. Wounds to the nose could cause pain and discomfort to the animal.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The licensee had the dogs evaluated by a veterinarian at the time of the inspection.


Cocker spaniel (tag #386) has a heavily matted hair coat along the underside of neck and onto the chest. The mats have
formed into large, solid brownish colored balls of hair that are held tightly to the skin. Matted hair can cause pain and
discomfort as well as lead to further health issues.

The licensee must have the matted hair removed from the Cocker spaniels hair coat. The licensee must ensure that the
hair coats of all dogs remain free of matted hair at all times.
2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
One male Bernese Mountain dog, one female Bernese Mountain dog, and one female Cocker spaniel do not have an
official form of identification. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog does not allow the inspectors to
identify the dog and could interfere in the ability to connect medical records and other documentation to the dog.

A class "A" dealer can identify all live dogs using the following methods: An official tag affixed to a collar around the dog's
neck, a microchip, or by a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator. The licensee must provide each dog with
an official form of identification and ensure that all dogs have proper identification at all times.

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee has been housing dogs in two buildings on the property, but has failed to present the animals and their
enclosures for inspection. The licensee did not notify APHIS officials that he was housing dogs in these buildings during
previous inspections. Inspection of these two buildings found the sanitizing requirements, watering, veterinary care, pest
control and housekeeping of the buildings and enclosures to be noncompliant with the regulations of the Animal Welfare
Act. At least 17 adult dogs and 19 puppies are housed in one of the buildings and 9 adult dogs are housed in the other

building. Two dead dogs were found in one building and 1 emaciated Golden retriever was found in the other building.
Failure to allow APHIS officials to inspect all animals and their enclosures does not ensure the animals are kept and cared
for in conditions required by the Animal Welfare Act which could cause the welfare of the animals to suffer.

Each dealer, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect and photograph the facilities, property and
animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act, the regulations and the standards.
The licensee must present all regulated animals and their housing for inspection by APHIS officials in order to ensure the
welfare of the animals.

To be corrected by: From this day forward the licensee must present all animals for inspection.

Handling of animals.
A heat advisory has been issued for the area and several adult dogs and puppies located throughout the facility were
showing signs of heat stress including:

Female poodle is contained in a transport crate at the time of the inspection. The dog is open mouth breathing, has a
high respiration rate, and the tongue is extended out of the mouth beyond the teeth. The dog began crying out while
being observed by the inspectors. The temperature taken by the inspectors Kestrel is 95 degrees F with a heat index of
119 degrees F.

Female Boston terrier is housed inside the sheltered housing building. She is open mouth breathing, has a high
respiration rate and the tongue is extended out of the mouth beyond the teeth. The temperature inside the building

according to the inspectors Kestrel is 92 degrees F with a heat index of 112 degrees F.

In the large Whelping building there are numerous puppies below the age of 8 weeks that have high respiration rates and
open mouth breathing with tongues extending out of the mouth and beyond the teeth. The temperature throughout the
building, according to the inspectors Kestrel, was 95 degrees F with a heat index of 117 degrees.

Heat stress could have a detrimental impact on the health and well-being of the animal and can even result in death.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must alter the temperature to a level that is
comfortable for the dogs. The licensee must ensure the dogs are maintained in appropriate climatic conditions at all
times.

Housing facilities, general.
A loose Pomsky was noticed running around the outside of the covered outdoor enclosures. The Pomsky had direct
access to the road. The licensee stated that the employees were not able to catch it. During the inspection, a beagle was
observed by inspectors to jump on top of the shelter and then jump into other enclosures where it could potentially come
into contact with incompatible dogs. In the horse barn the dogs are housed in horse stalls. In at least on of these
enclosures there is a hole in the stall wall and a dog was observed to stick its head, neck and forefeet through the
opening and come into direct contact with the dogs in the next enclosure. In another enclosure in the horse barn, a horse
stall containing 10 puppies had a dug a hole beneath the stall wall and were observed going through the hole and

entering the next enclosure which contained trash and debris which could harm the puppies.

The previous inspection report contained a citation for a dog which had escaped its enclosure and was killed by other
dogs. Failure of the enclosure to contain the dogs could result in injury, escape and even the death of an animal.

Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals
from entering.
3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Seventeen dogs and 19 puppies are housed in a horse barn. Each enclosure contains numerous pieces of trash and
waste materials. The trash consists of hay netting, empty bags, wooden boards, metal horse shoes, and countless
pieces of shredded cloth. Areas of the alleyway of the barn is covered in loose hay along with unused wooden pallets and
empty bags.

Ten adult dogs are housed in another building which contains a large amount of clutter and waste material. Numerous
empty bags and pieces of plastic are located in the alleyway of the building and in unused enclosures. One unused
enclosure contains a large number of stored metal gates. A large pile of used wood shavings is sitting on the floor of the
alleyway in front of dog enclosures. The areas around these cluttered items are dirty with a buildup of hair, organic
material and used wood shavings. An excessively large number of flies are also located in the building.

Clutter and trash could increase odors as well as attract pests such as flies and mice which could increase the risk of

disease towards the dogs.

Housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste
material, junk, weeds, and other discarded materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free
of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and necessary for
cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices and research needs. The licensee
must remove the trash, waste, and unused materials from the housing facilities in order to support the health and well-
being of the dogs.
3.1(f) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
In the building housing 10 adult dogs there is an open sack of trash sitting on the floor. Open sacks of trash could create
odors and attract pests such as flies and mice.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The licensee must place the trash sack in leak proof container with a tightly fitted lid.

Primary enclosures.
The facility has removed sections of the raised plastic flooring in the covered outdoor enclosures leaving a section of
concrete exposed. After the facility washes out the enclosure the concrete remains wet and any feces deposited on the
concrete becomes wet and runny. The hair coat of one female Golden retriever (tag #801) is excessively wet and
contaminated with feces. The hair coat covering both hind legs, the tail, and the abdomen are wet and the hair is coated
in feces and felt gritty to the inspectors touch. The licensee stated that this dog likes to lay on the wet concrete to cool

down. The inspector observed wet, runny feces on the concrete in numerous covered outdoor enclosures. A wet and
feces contaminated hair coat could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dog.

The primary enclosures must be designed to enable the dogs and cats to remain dry and clean. The licensee must alter
the enclosure in a manner that will keep the dog clean and dry in order to support its health and well-being.

Watering
Numerous dogs throughout the facility have no potable water. Approximately 2 adult dogs housed in the sheltered
housing building and 8 dogs housed in the horse barn had no water in their water receptacles. Approximately 22 dogs
housed in the outdoor enclosures had either a large amount of dirt in their water receptacle or the water receptacle had a
coating of green algae with small pieces of algae floating in the water. The dogs were observed standing and sitting in
their water receptacles along with digging the water out of the receptacles. The dogs were also observed drinking the
contaminated water. The temperatures taken throughout the facility ranged from 92 -97 degrees F with a heat index up to
119 degrees F.

Failure to provide potable water could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs. The licensee must provide potable water to the dogs and
ensure they have access to potable water at all times.
3.11(b)(2) Direct Repeat


Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Ten adult dogs are housed in a building across from the horse barn and there is a thick, heavy buildup of hair, spilled
food, moldy food, used and unused wood shavings, organic waste and liquids along the front edge of each enclosure. An
excessively large number of flies were located on this buildup of material.

Seventeen adult dogs and 19 puppies are housed in horse stalls inside a barn. The floors of the enclosures are consist of
a thick layer of dirt mixed with old dog feces, fresh dog feces, bits of straw, and what appears to be old horse manure.
The dirt and feces mixture covers the entire floor space and the dogs have no ability to escape from this contaminated
flooring material and must be in contact with it at all times. None of the dogs have access to a clean, sanitized floor
space. The dirt, straw and feces cannot be sanitized and sunlight is unable to hit the flooring in any of the horse stalls
resulting in the dogs potential being in direct contact with disease causing agents at all times.

The upper half of the horse stalls consist of metal bars which have an excessively large amount of cobwebs attached to
them. The cobwebs are brown and appear to have trapped a large amount of dust and dirt. Failure to properly sanitize
the enclosures could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that allows for sanitizing of this surface in order to decrease the
risk of disease towards the dogs. The licensee must remove the buildup of waste materials and sanitize all surfaces as
well as ensure that all surfaces of primary enclosures are capable of being sanitized at all times.
3.11(d) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

The licensee is housing 10 adult dogs in a building which has not been presented to APHIS officials at previous
inspections. An excessively large number of flies are located in this building. The majority of the flies are located near
the front of each enclosure where there is a large amount of organic material, spilled food and moldy food, and spilled
water. The flies were observed on the gates of the enclosures, on the walls, in the food receptacles and on the dogs.
The inspector did not notice any fly control methods in place inside the building. An excessive number of flies could
increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective form of fly control in order to
decrease the risk of disease and support the health and well-being of the dogs.

Veterinary care for dogs.
Female Pomsky (tag #135) has a broken leg which has been treated by a licensed veterinarian. No medical record exists
of the treatment this dog received.

A small, red poodle puppy is under veterinary treatment, but there is no medical record that exists of the treatment plan
for this puppy.

Documenting veterinary care concerns assists APHIS officials in confirming that problems have been identified and
treatment has been sought in a timely manner, as well as establishes a documented medical history for the animal.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records which include the date and description of the problem (such as disease,

illness, or injury), examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed.
The licensee must create a medical record for the Pomsky and the poodle puppy which includes a description of the
animal’s problem, the date the problem was identified and the plan to treat the problem. The licensee must ensure that all
veterinary care concerns are documented and maintained in a medical record and available for APHIS inspection.

Terminal facilities.
A female poodle is contained in a transport crate sitting along the driveway in direct sunlight. The dog is showing signs of
heat stress and the ambient temperature is 97 degrees F with a heat index of 119 degrees F according to the inspectors
Kestrel. A heat advisory has been issued for the area. Failure to provide protection from the direct rays of the sun could
cause the dog to become overheated which could have a detrimental impact on their health and well-being.

Shade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the dog from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that
all dogs housed in transport enclosures have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun in order to
support their health and well-being.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
