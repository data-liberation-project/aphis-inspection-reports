Sanitation.
There is a buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the plastic sides of the guinea pig enclosures. The weekly
cleaning process is not effective in removing this buildup on the sides of enclosures. Inadequate cleaning can expose the
guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and parasites. The presence of organic material on the
sides of enclosures makes disinfectants ineffective. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and
that enclosures are sanitized at least once 2 weeks. Correct by February 20, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
