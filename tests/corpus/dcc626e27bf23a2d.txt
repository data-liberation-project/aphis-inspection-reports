ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
** In the Equine Therio Barn there were three bottles of medication (Sucralfate 4/16, Gentamicin 4/16 and
Phenylbutazone 3/16) that had expired. The use of medications that are past the expiration date printed on the
label may not be safe or efficacious and is not considered to be an acceptable practice. The facility needs to review
their current procedures for monitoring drugs and medical supplies to ensure that all medications to be used on
research animals are not out-dated. It was corrected immediately by discarding the expired drugs.
** At the Pathogen-free Swine facility there were two pigs (#344/#341) that had an altercation. Pig #344 acquired
bruising to the right shoulder area in a circular fashion about 10 inches in diameter Pig #341 had superficial cuts on
the top aspect of his nose extending right beneath its eyes. The facility must have these animals examined by the
attending veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. The facility must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon
request. The applicant must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times and in a timely
manner. Correct from this day forward.
At the Sugg facility there was a male Jacob sheep that had a third horn that had grown in a hook like fashion. The
sheep could potentially catch the horn on the fencing and injure itself. The facility needs trim the horns and maintain
them at a safe length to prevent injury. The facility must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at
all times. Correct by 5/20/2016

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** At the Satellite Equine facility, in the pasture with the horses, there was fencing wrapped around the trees that
had pointy ends. This wire could potentially injure the animals and should be removed and/or repaired.
The inspection was conducted with the University Veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted with the University
Veterinarian and the Assistant Director.
