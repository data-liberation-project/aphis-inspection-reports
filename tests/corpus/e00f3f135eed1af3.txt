ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*One Patagonian cavy was noted moving slower and in a more gingerly manner than the other cavies. The cavy
appeared thinner than the others with a more pronounced spine. This cavy also had an abnormal, ungroomed
looking haircoat. There were patches of hair missing especially on both sides of the back half of the body and on the
face, patches of hair clumped together and adhered to the skin and some hanging tufts of hair. Where the hair was
missing the skin appeared thickened and reddened. The hair remaining in these worst affected areas appeared
glued together in small clumps with a black material. The cavy was noted to periodically make low vocalizations.
*The muntjac was missing hair and had shortened/broken hairs on its right side. Mid right side was a 3in by 1 1/2in
area of skin that appeared thickened, darkened and crusted.
The cavy and the muntjac have not yet been provided adequate veterinary care. Abnormalities such as abnormal
movement, hairloss, abnormal haircoats, and irritated skin require the animal to be evaluated by a veterinarian for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The cavy and the muntjac shall be evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis
and treatment.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection today members of the public were present for tours and viewing the animals. The inspectors
noted that several of the animal enclosures did not have sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and
the public. A section of the wood barrier comprising half of the length of the enclosure was missing from in front of
the nilgai enclosure. The wood and rope barrier in front of the muntjac and deer enclosure was missing the rope in
front of half of the muntjac enclosure and all of the deer enclosure. The addax enclosure did not have a barrier
along one side of the enclosure. The addax was noted to be extremely active on this day-he was noted running
rapidly around the enclosure and even bluff charging the enclosure fencing. The section of fencing between the
drive through portion and the walk through zoo portion of the park adjacent to the entrance to the drive through
portion does not have a barrier. During the inspection it was noted that members of the public were viewing the
zebra up close at this fence section. Lack of sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the public
can lead to safety issues for the animals and for the public. During public exhibition all animals must be handled sothere is minimal risk of harm to the animals and the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the
animals and the viewing public. Correct by 4/14/14.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*There is a 2ftx3ft section of skirting wire fencing material on the ground on the inside of the mouflon enclosure
(houses 6 mouflon and 1 alpaca) at the far end of the enclosure that is no longer buried in the ground. It now
protrudes loosely up and out from the ground. The animals may get tangled in this material leading to injury.
*One side of the enclosure housing the addax (side with the gate) is constructed of wood, welded wire, woven wire
and barbed wire. This side is visibly leaning inwards. When handled, the entire side is loose. Loose, structurally
unsound fencing may lead to escape of the animal or injury to the animal.
*In the drive thru portion of the facility at the top of the tour and adjacent to the tour road there is an approximately
10-12 ft long section of 8 ft tall fencing extending perpendicular from the enclosure fencing toward the tour road.
This fencing consists of wire fencing material about 6 ft high and an additional 2 ft high set of barbed wire strands
above it. Something has occurred that has damaged this section and pushed the wire fencing material to the ground
folding it partially in on itself. The barb wire strands are hanging loosened between the two posts. The animals may
get caught in the loose wire fencing or some of the taller animals may bump their heads on/become entangled in the
barbed wire if they get close to this area leading to injury.
*The front of the enclosure housing four fainting goats (two adults, two kids) is made of welded wire metal fencing
of two different size openings. The two kids were noted placing their heads and necks through these openings to
reach outside their enclosure as was the male goat with horns. The goats may injure themselves if they get caught
or twist themselves in the openings.
The facility fencing materials must be constructed of such material and such strength as to be structurally sound for
the animals housed and shall be maintained in good repair.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The muntjac enclosure has an excessive accumulation of excreta in the shelter structure and in the outside areas
adjacent to the shelter structure. Some of the accumulated fecal material is starting to show white mold like growth
on it. The muntjac is currently being fed hay on the ground so the hay is contaminated. This muntjac also has a
skin/hairloss issue. The caretaker the inspectors talked to agreed this enclosure needs cleaning and states that the
person responsible for cleaning enclosures has been told that it needs to be cleaned but has not yet done so.
Excreta needs to be removed regularly and as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and the
hay, to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. Correct by 4/3/14. Direct citations 2.40b2 and 3.9 from the 25 February 2014 inspection have been corrected.
