2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at approximately
between 2:45 and 3:15 PM on 31-JUL-18.
No one answered after ringing the door bell and knocking on the door. I called the contact phone number and was
unable to contact anyone. I left a message on the voicemail stating I would wait for one half hour in the event a
responsible person was available. No one returned my call.
