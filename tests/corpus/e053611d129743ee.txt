2.40(a)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 19 year old tiger named Caesar was observed with a bloated abdomen on June 30, 2016. The attending
veterinarian visually examined Caesar and indicated that additional diagnostic information could be obtained if
Caesar were to be sedated for a more thorough exam. Records indicated that the board of directors did not want
Caesar to be sedated. Caesar was subsequently administered therapeutic treatment prescribed by the attending
veterinarian on July 7, 2016, and continued to be monitored. Caesar was found dead on July 13, 2016.
The records suggested the attending veterinarian did not have appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care in this situation. The licensee must ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate
authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care.
The facility has updated relevant animal and veterinary care policies affirming the authority of the attending
veterinarian.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
