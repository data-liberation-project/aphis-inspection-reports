3.53(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Rabbit enclosures numbered 5-3, 8-2, 8-3, and 8-4 each have holes in the corners of the wire floors. These holes,
which are approximately 2.5 inches to 3 inches across, have developed due to rust and urine, thus leaving openings
with protruding, sharp points. The openings, as well as the jagged, sharp edges, could cause injury to the rabbits
housed therein.
The damaged flooring, in these four enclosures, must be replaced to maintain structural strength and to protect the
rabbits' feet and legs from injury.
All enclosures floors should be assessed to determine if rust damage has begun.

SANITATION.
There is an excessive accumulation of rabbit hair present on the tops, sides and hanging beneath the rows of
hanging wire enclosures. Additionally, the nest box for enclosure 8-1 is full of excreta and hay. Excessive
accumulations of hair and fecal material must be removed on a more frequent basis to prevent such accumulations
and to reduce odors and disease hazards for the health of the rabbits.

The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
NOTE: A routine maintenance program for the repair and/or replacement of wire flooring should be established so
that early signs of enclosure damage can be addressed before they become problematic.
