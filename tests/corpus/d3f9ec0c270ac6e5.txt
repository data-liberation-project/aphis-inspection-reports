ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10 AM on
05-FEB-20.
The inspector arrived at 10:00 AM on 2/5/20 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee’s vehicle was not on the
premises. The inspector contacted the Licensee by text and learned that his/her schedule had changed and as a
result, he/she was at a distant off-site location and would not return until later that afternoon.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility
representative available to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections are used to evaluate compliance with the AWA Regulations and Standards.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 2/5/20.
