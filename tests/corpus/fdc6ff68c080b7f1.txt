2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Proposals to conduct an activity involving animals.
1. Review of Protocol #2014-039: At the time of the inspection, the inspector observed an animal under general
anesthesia under this protocol. According to facility personnel, the injectable pre-anesthetic medications
administered to the study animals are telazol and xylazine. However the protocol approved by the IACUC
described the administration of ketamine and xylazine as the injectable pre-anesthetic medications.
2. Review of Protocol #2012-014: The 2/19/14 modification approved by the IACUC added a new animal use
procedure that also included different anesthetic agents than the anesthetic agents that were approved by the
IACUC in the original protocol. The 2/19/14 modification that was approved by the IACUC did not include a
description of the dosages for the new anesthetic agents.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal for animal use must contain a description of procedures designed to
assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited in order to minimize discomfort and pain to the animals. A
description of the analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs is required in order for the IACUC to determine that
the proposed activities are in accordance with all of the requirements of this subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address this item as identified for both of these proposals.
Correct by 5/30/14.
NOTE - Exit interview held 5/15/14 on-site with facility representatives. Report delivered by e-mail 5/19/14.
