3.75(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.
The holding cage adjacent to the primary enclosure is rusted through. In the far-left corner of the primary enclosure there
are three pipes with rust on them. The T-joint of the primary enclosure is rusted through and halfway down the support
pipe is also rusted. The rust along these pipes and t-joint and the holding cage affect the structural strength of the
primary structure and makes it difficult to clean and sanitize. All surfaces must be free of rust that prevents the required
cleaning and sanitization or affects the structural strength of the enclosure. Correction date 12/22/21.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence of the facility was measured to be 84.5 inches. There were branches growing through the fence that
affected the structural strength of the perimeter fence. The height of the fence recorded was less than 8 ft (98 inches)
which is too low for an exhibitor with potentially dangerous animals. The perimeter fence functions to keep outside
animals and unauthorized persons from entering the facility as well as a secondary containment system for the animals in
the facility. All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals
and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to
large felines, bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants must be approved in writing by the Administrator. Correction date
12/22/21.
