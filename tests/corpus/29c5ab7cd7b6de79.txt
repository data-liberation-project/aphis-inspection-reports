ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1720 on
22-Jun-17. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn. I
then called the licensee and left a message asking her to call back. I did not receive a call back. I waited 30
minutes and left the property.
End of report.
