SANITATION.
There was a moderate to heavy amount of excreta in one enclosure at both the beef and sheep units. Although the
facility has a cleaning schedule in place at both units, it does not appear to be often enough to remove excessive
amounts of excreta, for the amount of animals currently housed in these enclosures.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
