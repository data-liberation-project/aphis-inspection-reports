RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing federally required information on acquisition, addition and/or disposition of
these, were incomplete at the time of inspection. The required records on the recent acquisition of a raccoon need
to be updated and completed. The facility shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly
disclose information on purchased or otherwise acquired animals, and that are in its possession/control. The
Record of Animals on Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or Transport of Animals
(APHIS Form 7020) are forms which may be used by the licensed facility to keep and maintain the information
required by federal regulations. The facility needs to obtain and maintain the required information on the recently
acquired raccoon, and it should be available for inspection.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On February 19, 2016, approximately at 10:00 pm, a male African Hunting Dog (AHD) named "Evander" escaped
from its primary enclosure by climbing / jumping the enclosure's moat wall into the a main public area. Both
veterinary and armed keeper teams responded, and the AHD was quickly and effectively darted / sedated. The
need to dart and sedate the AHD during the incident subjected the animal to behavioral stress, unnecessary
discomfort and potential harm which could have been prevented. After the incident, facility management proactively
reviewed safety aspects and enclosure containment plans and as a result, hot wire arrangements within the
enclosure were modified and updated.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Mr. Matthew James, Chief, Animal Science Division, and
with Ms. Deidre Flaherty, Zoological Supervisor.
