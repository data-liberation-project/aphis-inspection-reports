2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An Opossum was at the veterinary housing and was being treated for a tail injury with a topical spray. The topical
spray bottle had an expiration date of 2012.
Exhibitors shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, and treat injuries.
To be corrected immediately.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A tiger enclosure had rotten wood that had exposed screws that could potentially harm the animals contained in the
enclosure and it compromises the structural integrity of the enclosure.
The bear enclosure had a piece of rotten wood log embedded in the concrete and this could potentially accumulate
debris, and waste water creating a potential disease issue.
The wire mesh fence containing the cow was bent over to the inside and it was not properly attached to the vertical
poles.
The deer fence was bent inward creating a space between the eroded ground and the fence which could potentially
create an escape route for a a baby deer if it decided to go under the fence or allow other animals in.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several enclosures (Lions, Tigers, etc.) had natural shelter from sunlight provided by trees but it didn't provide
shelter from the heavy rain when the rain is continuous and for a couple of days.
Two coyotes within the enclosure were in a separate area divided by a fence which didn't have any shelter from theelements.
Shelter from the natural climatic elements shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection
and to prevent discomfort.
To be corrected by 9-25-2015.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Most of the enclosures were dry considering the late rain in this area during the last couple of weeks but few tiger
exhibits had accumulation of water and the tigers couldn't lay on the ground without getting muddy or wet which
indicates a deficient draining system.
In order to avoid skin and/or disease hazards a suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.
To be corrected by 9-25-2015.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The freezer was extremely dirty and had a buildup chicken/meat on the floor. The boxes were in disarray on top of
each other making it difficult to inspect the bottom boxes. The back portion of the freezer couldn't be inspected
because the boxes were in the center of the unit.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination to maintain all animals in good health.
To be corrected by 9-15-2015.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The Llamas metal water container was dirty and it was exposed to the sun. Ducks were observed bathing in the
water and the sun could potentially heat the water so it would not be appropriate or palatable for the llamas to drink
in hot environment like in the state of Florida.
In order to avoid disease issues, water shall be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the
animal. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The shelter box for the kinkajou had debris under the box coming through the spaces of the wood slats and also
urine/waste water stains were observed running down the wall where the box was attached. The top of the box had
screws which didn't allow for inside inspection but it was obvious that debris and stain of urine/waste water was
coming form the inside of the shelter.
Shelters must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and tominimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
This inspection was conducted by Dr. Luis A Navarro and ACI Megan Adams.
