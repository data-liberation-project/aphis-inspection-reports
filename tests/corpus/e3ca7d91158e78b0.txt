3.13(b)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
A 3-year-old male Bernese Mountain Dog with microchip ending in 2347 developed a quarter-sized, red, raw area of skin
on the neck several days prior to the inspection and has been undergoing treatment; however, medical records
documenting the date the problem was identified, a description of the problem, and the treatment plan have not been
completed. Medical records are important for maintaining animal health and welfare by confirming that a problem has
been identified and is undergoing treatment, as well as establishes a medical history for the animal.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records which include the date and description of health problems, exam and test
results, treatment plan and treatments performed, as well as ensuring that these records are available for APHIS
inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by December 24, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
