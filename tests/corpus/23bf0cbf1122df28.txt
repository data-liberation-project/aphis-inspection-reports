FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In April of 2016, the remains of one kid (goat) were found in a facility pasture used by the goats. Goats have access
to a pasture during the day and are brought in during the evenings.
The facility representative stated that coyotes have been observed within the perimeter fence of the facility(cid:25)s
pastures and farmland and believes the kid remains resulted from coyote predation.
The facility took immediate corrective action and the remaining goats are now tended to by student farm workers
(SFW) while out on pasture during the day and are brought in when SFWs leave for the evening.
Failure to appropriately construct and/or design animal housing facilities which prohibit entry of unauthorized
animals pose risks or hazards to animals at this facility.
Housing facilities for goats must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other
animals from entering. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure this.
To be corrected from this day forward
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
