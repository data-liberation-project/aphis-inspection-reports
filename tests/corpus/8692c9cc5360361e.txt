3.25(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the upper and lower buildings, there was an excessive amount of dust, debris and cobwebs on the walls of the
buildings. Build-up of dust, debris and cobwebs increases the risks for vermin infestation, sickness, and create a
fire hazard. Areas outside of enclosures must be cleaned routinely and kept free from a build-up of dust, debris and
cobwebs.
3.26(a)(2)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Many enclosures had wet and soiled bedding around the watering area in a manner that makes the guinea pigs get
their feet wet when they need to drink. Not having dry access to water could cause skin problems on the guinea
pigs(cid:25) legs and feet or cause them to not drink enough water and become sick. Guinea pigs'(cid:25) access to water must
be maintained dry on a daily basis to protect their health.
