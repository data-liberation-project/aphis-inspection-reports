2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives.
1. Two of the protocols reviewed during the inspection did not include a consideration of alternatives for all of the
more than momentarily painful or distressful procedures described in these protocols. Specifically: Protocol #144-5
did not include a consideration of alternatives to the procedure median sternotomy and Protocol #698-17 did not
include a consideration of alternatives to the procedure of vascular cutdown.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more
than momentary pain or distress to the animals, the investigator is required to consider alternatives to all of those
procedures and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available to those procedures.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for these 2 protocols.
