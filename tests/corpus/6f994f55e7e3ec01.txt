2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility’s program of veterinary care did not include written provisions and outlined care for the newly acquired
species. The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian regarding the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written
program of veterinary care is available for review during all USDA inspections.
Each facility shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the facility.

Facilities, outdoor.
The back side of the primary enclosure housing one raccoon is only one foot away from the surrounding perimeter fence.
While the current enclosure is purposed for temporary housing, the back side is less than three feet away from the fence
line nearby.



Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
going through it or under it, permitting contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Non-dangerous animals
housed in outdoor facilities require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around their enclosure and must be at least 3-feet away
from any enclosures or buildings.
