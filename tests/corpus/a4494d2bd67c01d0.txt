ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:25 p.m. on
11-May-17.
In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I check out at the kennel premises, knocked on the door, honked my vehicle horn
and call the phone number provided.
