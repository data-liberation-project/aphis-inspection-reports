2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On April 8, 2014, a few students were playfully nipped by two, 3 month old lion cubs during a visit, which was part of
their internship. No skin was broken and injury was minor. However, because individuals were harmed, the staff did
not adequately handle the cubs while they were on display. Lion cubs, as well as any animals, must be handled so
there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.
