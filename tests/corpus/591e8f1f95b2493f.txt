3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were two outdoor enclosures housing three American Eskimos and two Cocker Spaniels which contained a
gravel floor. The gravel appeared to have fecal material compacted into its bottom layer and was attracting a
numerous amount of flies. There were also at least eight dog doors and wall panels both inside and outside of the
sheltered building which had a build-up of a brown, grimy material. The licensee stated the enclosures were being
cleaned every two weeks. However, the inspector took a ruler's edge to the brown material and easily scraped
away a layer of grime, indicating the enclosures are not being properly cleaned/sanitized. The electrical conduit on
the ceiling of the sheltered building used to be white but at the time of inspection was almost 50% brown due to a
material covering it which appeared to be fly speck. Although this conduit was not in contact with the dogs, it was in
close proximity to the tops of their enclosures. Enclosures and housing facilities which are not properly cleaned and
sanitized pose a health risk to the dogs. They also attract pests such as flies which can spread disease. The
licensee must ensure that contaminated gravel floors are replaced whenever spot cleaning is not sufficient to
prevent or eliminate insects or pests. The licensee must also ensure that all hard surfaces which come in contact
with the dogs are spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b). Lastly, the licensee must ensure that
all other surfaces of the housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One of the outdoor enclosures housing three adult American Eskimos only had one medium dog house that did not
provide adequate shelter space for all of the dogs in the enclosure. Only two dogs could lie in the shelter at one
time. The licensee must ensure that outdoor facilities for dogs include one or more shelter structures that are
accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter
structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 7/29/2016

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were multiple areas in the sheltered facility that had sections of metal with sharp, jagged edges. There weretears/holes in the metal walls of some enclosures (at dog height) resulting in sharp, jagged, metal edges. At least
three enclosures also had metal pipe at the base of the divider panels which was excessively rusted and had jagged
edges of deteriorated metal. Sharp, and/or jagged metal edges can cause injuries to the dogs. Primary enclosures
must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp or jagged edges which could injure the dogs. TO
BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 11, 2016
This inspection and an exit briefing were conducted by Ms. Kelly Roberts and Dr. Amanda Owens with the licensee.
