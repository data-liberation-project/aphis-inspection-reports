2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1450 on
20-JUN-17. We went to the licensee's house and no one answered. I called the licensee and left a message on
her voicemail. We waited 30 minutes. I called her again and she did not answer. We then left.
End of report.
