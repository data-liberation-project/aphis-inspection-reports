FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The plywood ceiling in the theater back room is showing signs of water leakage. The plywood is soft, porous,
darkened, white in several areas and is no longer structurally sound nor in good repair.
Additionally, the white & darkened areas might indicate a mold or fungal growth which can be irritating or hazardous
to the respiratory tracts of the animals that are housed in this room.
The roof structure shall be examined to determine the areas of leakage, and both the roof & ceiling shall be
replaced or repaired to prevent water leakages, deteriorations, mold or fungal growths.
