FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several areas of fencing were damaged such that animals could become entangled in the fence or incur injury.
These areas included the fence line at the southwest corner of the fallow deer pen, the fence line between the
juvenile camelids and the ducks, and northeast corner of the yak enclosure.
All enclosures or facilities for all the animals must be constructed of such material and of such strength as
appropriate for the animals involved. All facilities must be structurally sound, free from sharp, protruding points or
edges, and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to properly contain them. A
system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to ensure the health and
well-being of all animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
