2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Boston terrier named Beau-D (m/c# OAO1650961) had an eye injury of 2 days duration according to the
licensee. The cornea of the right eye was cloudy, had a blue color, and had a ring of red around the center of the
cornea. The "whites" of the eye had numerous engorged blood vessels extending to the edge of the cornea. Eye
problems can progress rapidly, can be painful, and can result in loss of vision. The licensee must have this dog
examined by a veterinarian. The licensee must keep records of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care and
must make these records available to the inspector upon request. If the animal's condition does not resolve with
treatment or if it returns, the licensee must consult a veterinarian for further evaluation and treatment.
