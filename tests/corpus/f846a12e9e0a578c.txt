On or about October 18, 2014, there were children allowed to run outside the front of the adult tiger enclousure
without a barrier present. Children were observer running back and forth the enclosure while the tiger did the same.
The children were only a few feet from the tiger's chain link fencing enclosure which may have resulted in injury if
contact was made.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public. With group exhibits especially with children, an attendant cannot ensure the
public has sufficient distance to assure thier safety from these tigers without barriers. There are other areas the
public can observe these tigers safely, however they are not being used.
If barriers are to be placed in these two areas, they must be completed by November 21, 2014.
