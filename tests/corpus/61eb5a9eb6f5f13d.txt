2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). The available version
of the PVC does not have any information related to all the species such as the pigs, cows, alpacas, sheep and
goats. For other species, such as dogs, the information provided is incomplete.
-The PVC for dogs lists "Trifexis once a month" in the parasite control program. There is no other information or
directions such as dosage, route of administration or concentration listed on the PVC for these treatments.
-The PVC also indicates "Euthasol IV" for the method of euthanasia without any other details regarding dosage or
information regarding the class of drug. This information needs to be specified to ensure that the solution used
meets the requirements of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a complete and accurate written program of
veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility for all species. The written program of veterinary care will
ensure that there is accurate communication between the licensee and the attending veterinarian and ensure that
all routine treatmens provided to the animals by the licensee are performed with the direction and knowledge of the
attending veterinarian.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The primary enclosure for a Labrador retriever dog contained multiple hazards, such as sharp points from fencing
mesh and other building materials, stored chemicals (paint, fertilizers, grease gun), heavy tools stored above where
dog could knock down, and there was a moderate accumulation of feces within the run.
The hazards present could cause trauma or otherwise adversely impact the health of the dog. A system of
maintenance must be in place to ensure there are no possible hazards to the animals housed in any area.Correct by : February 20, 2017

WATERING.
The water receptacle for the guinea pig enclosures had bedding in it, such that no drinking water was available. A
second water-bottle receptacle was laying on the ground.
The availability of clean water receptacles are essential for promoting good health to the animals and reduce the
risk of disease.
All watering receptacles shall be kept clean, in good working order and sanitized to assure that animals have
adequate supply of potable water. Open containers used for dispensing water to guinea pigs shall be so placed in
the primary enclosure as to minimize contamination from excreta. All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when
dirty and at least once every 2 weeks.
Corrected during the inspection.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Standing water was observed in multiple primary enclosures, notably those housing goats, cows, sheep, pigs and
alpacas. Due to the recent rains, the water has accumulated and adequate drainage did not exist. Although the
facility is in the process of adding sand to the primary enclosures, multiple animals were present in enclosures with
markedly inadequate drainage.
Adequate drainage is required to allow a dry surface and to protect the fur and skin of animals from wetting to allow
maintenance of normal body temperature.
Adequate drainage must be restored and a program of drainage maintenance is required.
