2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** When I arrived at the facility I was greeted by the Assistant Director. At that moment he was attending the front
desk. As we started the inspection he called the lead zookeeper up to relieve him. During the inspection there was
an attendant that stood watch in the center of the larger petting zoo area. There were several large groups of people
as well as a group down by the llamas enclosure. These llamas were out of the public attendants viewing range and
the public interactions were not being monitored. This area has been blocked off from public contact but the llama
were still able to stick their heads through the gate to be fed by the public. If there was one other attendant in that
area then the facility would have had an adequate number of attendants to properly monitor all the animals during
public contact in the petting zoo. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must
be present at all times during periods of public contact for the safety and well-being of the animals and the public.
By the end of the inspection the gate was pushed back to achieve enough distance to keep the public from feeding
the animals.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** When we inspected the otters enclosure we noticed that they were not on the exhibit. We then inspected the
lock-in only to find out they were not given access. The otters had been locked in a space that had a metal roof and
the misters were not on since earlier that morning when their enclosures were cleaned. When they were let out they
quickly ran to the water and they were bone dry. The outside temperature was 78 degrees F without the tin roofs so
in that space with tin roofs you could assume they were higher. The animals readiness to get in the water shows the
impact that the temperature, humidity and time had on the animals. When climatic conditions present a threat to an
animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An
animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to the
animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, overall
health status, and acclimation. They corrected this by giving the animals access. However, it was discussed that
while they were locked in for cleaning to provide the misters just in case they are subjected to that space for a
lengthy time to keep them cool and moist.3.131(d)
SANITATION.
** In the fox enclosure there was an old fallen down tree with a numerous amount of bees swarming around it. The
trunk was not far from the shelter and there is concern that the fox could repeatedly be stung. For the fox health and
well-being this needs to be removed and/or relocated to prevent injury. A safe and effective program for the control
of insects shall be established and maintained. Correct by April 21, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Assistant Director.
