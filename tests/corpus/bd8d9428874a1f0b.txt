ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white adult female mc #087015639 had an unkempt hair coat with loose matts and hardened fecal material
covering her buttocks. Unkempt hair coats that are matted and dirty can cause discomfort and may lead to serious
health issues and skin conditions. The licensee shall provide routine grooming to all animals at the facility using a
proactive approach so that the dogs do not become matted , have excessively long hair or nails or have soiled hair
coats. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2/25/2016
A black and white adult female mc #093564811 had hair loss across her back. The bare skin appeared dry and
rough. The licensee was not aware of the condition and the animal was not receiving treatment. The licensee shall
have the dog examined by a licensed veterinarian to obtain a written diagnosis and treatment plan and should
provide care as prescribed. Written documentation of the diagnosis and treatments should be made available at the
next inspection. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2/25/2016

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.1 (a) Structure; construction
There were multiple areas of the kennel in need of repair. The 1st enclosure on the bottom right side had a long split
in the coated wire flooring. The wire had broken leaving an opening that the dogs feet and legs could be caught in.
Additionally, there were at least 4 enclosures that had broken coated wire divider panels that the dogs could stick
their feet and legs under to the adjacent enclosure. These broken sections of the enclosures allow potential for
injury or escape. The licensee shall ensure that the enclosures of the facility are kept in good repair, that they
protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. The un-used
enclosures on the top level of the facility do not appear to have broken wires and can be used to temporarily house
the animals while more permanent repairs or replacement are made. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2/27/2016This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
