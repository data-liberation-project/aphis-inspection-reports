FEEDING.
The rabbit enclosure food receptacle has old caked rabbit food at the bottom and feces inside of the food
receptacle. Contaminated food receptacles directly expose the animals to harmful bacteria that affect the health
and wellbeing of the animals. Measures must be taken to prevent the molding, deterioration or caking of the feed to
prevent the contamination of the fresh feed. Food receptacles shall be located so as to minimize contamination by
excreta. Licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized to minimize disease hazards.
