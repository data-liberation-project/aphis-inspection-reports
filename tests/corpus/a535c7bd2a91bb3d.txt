The Semi-annual Report to the Institutional Official references only the Program Review function in its title, and
contains no information relating to the facility inspection function of the committee. The report is intended to
encompass all functions of the committee and must provide information on both the semi-annual program review
and semi-annual facility inspections that have been completed during the reporting period.
All future reports must meet the regulatory requirements.
