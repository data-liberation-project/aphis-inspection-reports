HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f) Waste disposal.
* The food storage room/chiller which contained food for the nonhuman primates had a large receptacle containing
food waste and trash which did not have a lid. There were also a few small flies and rodent droppings observed in
this food storage room.
** Trash cans without lids in food storage and preparation areas can attract disease-carrying pests and vermin
which increase the chance of having contaminated food.
*** The licensee must ensure that all trash containers located in areas used for nonhuman primate food
preparation/storage are leakproof and have a tight fitting lid on them at all times. CORRECT BY: 10 February 2014
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
