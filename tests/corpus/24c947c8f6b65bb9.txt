2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A seven year old, female, white-faced capuchin monkey named Kaytee, bit an adult male person on July 17, 2017
while on public display. The licensee stated that the incident occurred when an adult male entered the business an
unknowingly stood too close to the area where the capuchin was located. The licensee also stated that the capuchin
was startled by the distracted person who stepped back into the public barrier. It subsequently bit the person on the
back of the left leg, leaving multiple bite wounds above the ankle. The monkey was on a leash behind the public
barrier which consisted of a single chain attached to plastic posts. The chain had enough slack or was loose
enough, to allow the person to unintentionally enter the animal area.
Failure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers during public exhibition can be a safety hazard for the animal
and/or the public. During public exhibition, the animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the
animal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public
so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
To be corrected by: 5:00 PM on July 19th, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
