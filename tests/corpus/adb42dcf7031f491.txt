SANITATION.
There is a moderate accumulation of excreta in the sow pens.The facility representative stated these enclosures are
not included on the cleaning schedule that is used for the other pig enclosures. Accumulations of excreta can attract
flies and increase disease hazards in animal areas.
A system should be in place to ensure excreta is removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to
prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
