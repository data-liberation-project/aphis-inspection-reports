2.126(a) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The inspectors arrived at the facility at approximately 1:20 pm on June 2, 2015. Upon arrival, the inspectors made
contact with the licensee(cid:25)s girlfriend. She stated that the licensee was not home, but she called him and let him
know the inspectors were there to do an inspection. She let the inspectors know that he would return to do the
inspection. She stated that the licensee said one inspector could do the inspection but the other inspector that did
his last inspection would have to wait in the car.
At 1:26 pm the inspectors called the licensee. The licensee stated that the inspector that did his last inspection was
not allowed on his property. He stated that one inspector could do the inspection but the other inspector could not.
One inspector advised the licensee that refusing to allow all inspectors on the inspection would be a refusal of
inspection and would be cited. The inspector asked the licensee if he was (cid:28)refusing to allow the inspection(cid:29). He said
(cid:28)yep(cid:29). The inspector told the licensee that he was getting cited for refusal to allow inspection since he was refusing
to allow all inspectors on the property and that it would be sent in the mail.
Failure to provide APHIS officials with access for inspection upon request interferes with the ability of the officials to
protect the welfare of the animals and prevents the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal
Welfare Act.
The licensee must provide all inspectors access for inspection when requested by APHIS officials.
