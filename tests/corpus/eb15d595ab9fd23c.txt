3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The Sheltered kennel building had excessive feces in 12 enclosures. Three of these enclosures had 23 puppies and the
flooring was at least 50% covered in smeared feces and the solid resting surfaces were mostly covered. Eight adult dog
enclosures with 34 dogs had packed, smeared feces covering 60-80% of the outside flooring. Some of those enclosures
had brown matter on the doorways, walls and the inside flooring. These enclosures made it difficult for the animals to
move around without getting into feces. An outdoor enclosure with 5 dogs had many piles of feces, the licensee stated his
tool used to clean had broken. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the risk of
disease hazards for the dogs and puppies. The licensee must remove the accumulated fecal material from these
enclosures and ensure that all excreta is removed daily from primary enclosures to prevent soiling of the dogs contained
in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.

3.3(e)(1)

Sheltered housing facilities.
There was a Golden Doodle and her 6 puppies on concrete floor that was not sealed. The licensee set up a temporary
wire paneling inside the sheltered facility on the concrete floor for a whelping enclosure. The licensee stated the floor had
not been sealed. Although the floor isn't impervious to moisture, there was some saw dust on the floor to help absorb

some dog waste, but not enough to prevent contact with the concrete that can absorb moisture. Flooring that is not
impervious to moisture can harbor diseases. The licensee must ensure all surfaces in contact with animals are impervious
to moisture.

3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Outdoor enclosure with 5 dogs does not enough have enough space in the shelter. The inside of the dog shelter does not
have enough space to allow the dogs to sit, stand, and lay down in a normal/comfortable position.. Adequate shelter
space is required to protect all the dogs from the elements, allowing each dog to make normal postural adjustments and
for their health and well-being. The licensee must provide adequate shelter space at all times.

3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
There were 4 chewed plastic self feeders inside four enclosures with sharp edges. The chewed edges of the feeder had
sharp, jagged edges. The dogs possibly would have these sharp points and jagged edges poking them while eating their
dog food. The licensee must ensure the primary enclosures have no sharp points or edges which could injure the dogs.

3.10(a)

Watering
Two enclosures with 6 dogs had empty water bowls, with no other water available.. When water was presented, the dogs
took a quick lick. Lack of water could cause the dogs to become dehydrated or other health issues. Having water
available at all times is important to the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure all dogs have access to potable

water at all times.
Corrected during inspection.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility did not have written documentation for the frequency of the hands on exam and the preventative care.
Although the licensee had the attending veterinarian do a hands on exam a few months ago, these were not recorded in
the program of veterinary care. Failure to have these plans could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of
the animals. The Program of Veterinary Care must include a frequency of hands on exam, and appropriate plan of
preventative care and treatment to maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe nails, and healthy
teeth, ears, eyes and skin. The licensee must add the missing plans to the Program of Veterinary Care in order to ensure
the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
