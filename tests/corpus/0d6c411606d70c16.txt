Cleaning and Sanitizing of primary enclosure
****
In an outdoor enclosure, housing 2 dogs, the shelter had an accumulation of old bedding, dirt, and gravel. When
questioned the licensee stated that it had been "about 3 weeks" since it had been cleaned and sanitized. This
accumulation of old bedding, dirt, and gravel could pose a health risk to the dogs. The licensee must clean and
sanitize this shelter and ensure that all enclosures are cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks, or
more often if necessary, to ensure for the health and well being of the animals.
