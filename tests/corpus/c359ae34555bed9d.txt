Facilities, general.
In the enclosure housing two servals, a wooden support bean extending along the top of the fence had cracked and left
large jagged pieces of wood exposed.
In the enclosure housing one caracal, there was a splintered wooden platform that was beginning to reveal exposed
screws near the edge of the platform.
In the enclosure housing a lion and tiger, the back board of a wooden den had detached from the bottom of the structure.
Additionally, a perch platform was noted to be leaning at odd angle. In the same enclosure, a plastic enrichment barrel
had exposed sharp edges from sustained use by the animals.
Wearing wood and poorly maintained structures or objects within primary enclosures can cause injury to the animals if not


regularly maintained. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
