RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of acquisition and disposition were incomplete and did not contain all of the required information. The
acquisition forms for the warthog and brown lemurs, in addition to the animals acquired from the auction(s), do not
have the USDA License number nor the driver's license number as required. The brown lemur acquisition record
does not contain the full name of the seller. There were no records available at the time of inspection for the
muntjac nor the male and female olive baboons. Incomplete records hinder the ability of APHIS Officials to track
and monitor the movement of animals and prevent the illegal movement of animals. All acquisitions and disposition
records must contain the required information.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several nonhuman primate enclosures that had accumulations of feces and some discarded food debris
on the floors. The indoor solid platform for the young male chimpanzee had spots of hardened fecal residue. The
male olive baboon's enclosures had a large accumulation of feces toward the rear. Accumulations of feces and
waste residue can attract unwanted pests, including insects that can be a nuisance and a disease hazard to the
nonhuman primates. There were swarms of flies observed inside and outside of the nonhuman primate barn, and in
and around the enclosures. Feces and food debris may also harbor bacteria that may be hazardous to the animals.
For the health and well-being of the animals, the enclosures must be spot cleaned daily and cleaned and sanitized
more frequently to reduce the exposure the nonhuman primates have to excreta.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A large number of flies were observed in and around all of the nonhuman primate enclosures. There is a
depression nearby the nonhuman primate barn containing the liquid wastes, solids and dirt washed from the
enclosures inside the barn which was attracting flies. Insect pests can expose the nonhuman primates to disease
and be an uncomfortable nuisance to the animals. Eliminating the waste filled depression, in addition to aneffective pest control program to control insect pests such as flies, must be established and maintained for the
health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The 3 javelina and 6 black buck do not currently have the required perimeter fence. The blackbuck's enclosure has
2 sides without perimeter fencing, one facing the public roadway. The other side which is also the side that the
javelina face is currently an overgrown, thick brushy area. The licensee is in the process of planning and installing
a perimeter fence on this side of the enclosures. All mammal enclosures are required to have a perimeter fence of
at least 6 feet high except dangerous animals must have an 8 foot high perimeter fence and it must be 3 feet from
the primary enclosures. The perimeter fence acts as a secondary containment and restricts access by unwanted
people and animals that may cause harm or expose the contained animals to disease hazards. The required
perimeter fence must be installed or a written request must be made to the administrator and approved for any
variation of the requirements in this section.

SANITATION.
The fenced enclosure for the zebra had large accumulations of feces surrounding both of the circular hay feeders.
The zebras would have to stand in the waste to access the hay. The potential for contamination of the feed is a
concern.
The kangaroo and muntjac indoor stall had an accumulation of feces on the floor.
Waste from the animals may harbor bacteria which could cause injury to the animals. Accumulations of waste also
attract unwanted pests including flies which were observed in large numbers in and around the animal enclosures.
Insect pests are irritating to the animals and may carry disease which could sicken the animals.
The enclosures must be cleaned more frequently to protect the health and welfare of the animals.
