FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Underneath the rabbit cages, there is an excessive amount of feces that has built up covering 80 percent of the
surface area and the feces is starting to form a mound underneath each rabbit enclosure. Licensee informed the
inspector that the feces have not been cleaned in over a week. Most of the feces have become greyish in color.
Animal waste can contribute to unsanitary conditions, varmint infestation, odors, and disease hazards. The licensee
must ensure that animal waste is removed often enough to minimize any potential contamination, odors or disease
hazards.

WATERING.
There are three rabbit cages that did not have any water inside the watering receptacle. The inability to have access
to potable water can compromise the health and well-being of the rabbits. Sufficient potable water shall be provided
daily to give adequate nutrition and protect the health of the animals enclosed.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by USDA/APHIS personnel with the facility representative.
