2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Availability of records.
1. At the time of the inspection, all of the documents and records that are required under the AWA Regulations (i.e.
the written Program of Veterinary Care, Plan for Environmental Enhancement for Non-human Primates, and the
records for the animals) were in the possession of the Attending Veterinarian at an off-site location. As a result,
these required documents and records were not available for review at the time of the inspection.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all documents and records that are required to be kept under the Animal
Welfare Act (AWA) should be available at the time of an inspection so the required records can be reviewed to
determine the facility's compliance with the provisions of the AWA.
Copies of all documents and records required under the AWA need to be on the premises and available for review.
Correct from this date forward.
