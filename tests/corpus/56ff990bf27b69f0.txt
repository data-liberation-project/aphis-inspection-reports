FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are areas by the perimeter fence where eroded dirt has resettled next to the fence resulting in a height
measured on the inside of the fence of less than 8 feet. The following sections of perimeter fence were found to be
less than 8 feet high: behind the commissary was 7 feet 5 inches high; near the hay barn was 7 feet high; near the
old gate by Poliska Lane was 7 feet 7 inches, and along the south fence was 7 feet 6 inches. Also, there were three
places along the west and south sides of the perimeter fence with gaps at the base of the fence that show evidence
of animal activity through the gap. Perimeter fences with gaps at the base or of insufficient height can allow
unauthorized people and animals access through or under the fence and may not function as secondary
containment for animals inside the facility. Given the types of animals present, this facility must ensure that the
perimeter fence is at least 8 feet high in all places. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going though it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals
in the facility. To be corrected by 23 November 2016.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 23 August 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
