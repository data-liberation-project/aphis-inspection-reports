2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***There were not an adequate number of attendants present at all times when the public is allowed contact with the
animals. The public is allowed to walk through the facility, unescorted, on designated paths. The public is allowed to
contact the animals either through their enclosure fencing (goats, sheep, llama, pigs) or while they are free roaming
(fallow deer). At the time of inspection, only 1 attendant was present to watch the public through the entire facility
(approximately 8-10 acres). An adequate number of attendants is needed to ensure the health and safety of the
animals and to decrease the likelihood of activities (rough handling, improper feeding, etc.) that are harmful to the
animals.
To be by 7/11/14.
