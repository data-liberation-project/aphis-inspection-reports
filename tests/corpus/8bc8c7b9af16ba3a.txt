ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1823 on
14-Sep-16.I went to the licensee's house and the gate to the driveway was closed and I was unable to pull up to the
house. I contacted the licensee by phone. The voicemail had not been set up on the first number I called and I left
a message on the second phone number I called. I honked my horn a half dozen times and then waited for 30
minutes. No one responded to my horn and I did not receive a phone call back. I left after waiting 30 minutes at the
end of the driveway.
End of report.
