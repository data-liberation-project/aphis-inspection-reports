2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC's report to the Institutional Official dated 13 January 2015 and 6 May 2015 concerning the outcome of
the program and facility review contained a paragraph outlining that minor deficiencies were identified in the facility's
physical facilities. The report did contain a reasonable and specific plan for correction; however, did not supply a
schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency. A reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for
correcting each deficiency is required in order to ensure that all deficiencies are addressed in a timely manner to
protect the health and well-being of the animals. The registrant must ensure that all future facility and program
review reports contain a specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency identified.
