RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Sec. 2.75 Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
No records were on the premises to be inspected at the time of the inspection. Without accurate and complete
records, there is no way to adequately tell if animals are receiving the proper care, treatment and observation that is
required. A copy of all records must be made available during the inspection to ensure that accurate annotation of
required information is being preformed.
