ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female Siberian Husky named Snowflake (m/c# 0A0 249 5554) was very thin. The outlines of the ribs
and vertebrae were clearly visible and the hip bones were protruding. This dog was nursing 8 puppies that were
about 4 weeks old. The dog's diet consisted of free choice adult dog food. Poor body condition can be a result of
inadequate nutrition, parasites, or an underlying medical condition. The licensee must consult a veterinarian about
this dog's condition, follow the veterinarian's instructions, and be able to produce written documentation upon
request by the inspector.
***The licensee had dog vaccines that had expired August 25, 2015. These vaccines were stored with her other
vaccines and were ready for use. Expired medications or vaccines can lose their effectiveness and their ability to
prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all medications and vaccines are within their
expiration dates at all times.

2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee is not properly identifying puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Fifteen puppies that were from two
separate litters did not have any form of identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet
recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must
properly identify puppies with an acceptable form of identification, which include a cage card (if litters are not
comingled), a microchip, a collar and tag, or a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written.
