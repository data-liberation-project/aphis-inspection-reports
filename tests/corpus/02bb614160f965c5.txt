Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee was using a state form for the facility’s Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) that did not include some of the
required information. For example, the written PVC did not include preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and
unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin and teeth. Although the PVC included
some preventative care and/or treatment instructions for parasites, the form did not include written instructions for
sampling of parasites and other pests (including fleas, intestinal worms, coccidia, giardia and heartworm). Also, the PVC
did not contain a rabies vaccination schedule for the dogs. The written program of veterinary care helps to ensure that
there is accurate communication between the licensee and the attending veterinarian and ensures that all routine care,
such as medications and vaccinations, provided to the animals by the licensee are done with the direction and knowledge
of the attending veterinarian. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to develop a complete and
accurate written program of veterinary care that addresses the requirements for adequate veterinary care, reflects the
practices at this facility, and is signed by the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by: September 28, 2022
