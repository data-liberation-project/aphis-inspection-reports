A female Standard Poodle, unable to obtain ID, was observed with a heavily matted hair coat on her chest, legs and
abdomen. These matts appear to be bound closely to the skin. There are also areas on this dog's chest, legs and
abdomen that have clumps of dirt entangled with the hair.
Matting of the hair coat can be painful, lead to the development of skin infections, and reduces the ability of the
coat to insulate the dog. These poodles were identified on the previous inspection report as needing hair coat
maintenance performed on them by 12:00pm on October 31, 2014. The follow-up inspection conducted on
November 5, 2014 revealed that none of the above stated dogs had received any hair coat maintenance. Licensee
must remove the matted hair from these poodles and establish an effective program of hair coat maintenance for all
dogs.
