- The licensee stated that the female common marmoset gave birth to two babies. The licensee further stated that the
female marmoset dropped one of the babies and was seen attending to the baby, but the baby died. The attending
veterinarian was never notified of this, and therefore was not able to offer a diagnosis and treatment to possibly prevent
the death of the baby common marmoset.
- A neutered, male squirrel monkey, housed with 3 other squirrel monkeys, has a poor, thinning hair coat, consistently
scratches himself, is thin, and has overgrown nails. This squirrel monkey had a physical with blood workup in December
2019. There is little to no improvement in the condition of this squirrel monkey since the exam and bloodwork. There are
currently no recommendations in the written Program of Veterinary Care for any NHP.

All exhibitors must establish and maintain programs of veterinary care that include daily observation. If these daily
observations are completed by the licensee a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.

The attending veterinarian must be contacted at any time there is a problem of health, an unresolved problem with health,

behavior or well-being noticed with the animals on hand. The attending veterinarian must be contacted to diagnose the
problem, and offer a treatment plan for the animals to prevent suffering, and possible death.

current and valid USDA, APHIS, Animal Care license.

Facilities, general.
- The licensee lost approximately 15 prairie dogs from them digging out of their primary enclosure. The licensee did not
originally burry wire to prevent the digging and escape of the prairie dogs. When excavating the prairie dog exhibit to add
wire to the bottom only 1 deceased prairie dog was found.

- The outdoor shelter for the cavy is in disrepair from the cavy chewing. Nail/screw heads are protruding approximately
1" on the front of the shelter.
- The red kangaroo exhibit area has a nail sticking out of the wall left of the opening to the inside enclosure. This nail
sticks out approximately 2".

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.

Primary enclosures must be built to contain animals housed in the enclosure. The licensee has already excavated and
added wire below the prairie dog exhibit. All enclosures housing animals must be kept in good repair to prevent injury to
the animals contained.

Feeding.
The main diet for the 2 bobcats, caracal and 2 Canada lynx is chicken leg quarters. The keeper stated some canned and
dry cat food is offered, but the cats do not care for the dried cat food. There is currently no vitamin and calcium
supplementation used with the chicken leg quarters.

The food shall be of sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.

Vitamin and Calcium supplements must be utilized with an exotic feline diet that is comprised of mostly chicken leg

quarter to maintain healthy bones, and bodies.

contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
