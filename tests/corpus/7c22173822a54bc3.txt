OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is an outdoor primary enclosure area that contains 2 dogs a beagle and Pug that has a shelter box but no
additional shade structure for the dogs to get out of the direct sun or elements. The shelter boxes of 2 outdoor
enclosures need to have more bedding added to provide adequate insulation for temperatures that have been
below 50 Degrees at night and during the day for the past week.
It is important for there to be other shade options available in the outdoor enclosure to allow the regulated animals
to get out of the direct rays of the sun. There needs to be enough bedding added to the shelter boxes to provide
enough insulation between the dogs and the ground in order to prevent the animals from getting too cold in low
temperatures.
The licensee must provide one or more outside areas of shade, large enough for all animals to be able to occupy
and lie down and turn around in order to get out of the direct rays of the sun. Additional bedding should be added
when temperatures are below 50 degrees, and even more when temperatures go below 35 degrees.
