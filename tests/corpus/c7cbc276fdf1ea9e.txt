2.126(a) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
**On Thursday, August 7, 2014, at approximately 9:45 AM a call was placed to the contact number listed, however
the licensee indicated he was currently on the road and wouldn't be available for inspection for two weeks. Although
there were several cars in the driveway at the time of arrival, the licensee indicated no one else was available to
accompany the inspector for the animal welfare inspection. The licensee indicated the optimal hours of availability
were variable and could not designate a time for future inspections. The licensee was told that this would be a
repeat attempted inspection and would receive the inspection report via certified mail.
