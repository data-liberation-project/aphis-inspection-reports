Recordkeeping requirements.
There was no acquisition record available for the black and white cat currently at the facility that contained all of the
required information for the cat and for the source that the cat was acquired from. Per this Section, every research facility
shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning
each live dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in their possession or under their control:
the name and address of the person from whom the dog or cat was purchased or otherwise acquired; the vehicle license
number and State, and the driver’s license number and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered under
the Act; the date of acquisition; the official USDA identification number assigned; and a description of each dog or cat.
Records containing this information are important to document the sources of the animals used by the veterinary
technician program. The facility needs to prepare a record for this cat containing the required information and ensure that
a record containing the required information is prepared for all future cats acquired by the program. Correct by 10/20/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
