FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several areas throughout the housing facility that are not in good repair.
There is a wire fence surrounding the pond within the enclosure housing five white tail deer and a goat. There is a
section of this fence near the "(cid:28)winter housing facility"(cid:29) that has multiple areas with either sharp points that protrude
into the enclosure and/or gaps in the fence. The gaps are created where the connections between the top and
bottom sections of fence have come undone. In some places, the top of the fence is falling/leaning over.
The enclosure fence surrounding the "(cid:28)valley"(cid:29) has several areas with large gaps between the bottom of the fence
and the ground. In some areas, the holes are large enough that animals the size of small to medium-sized dogs or
other wildlife could pass through. There are three white tail deer located in this portion of the facility.
There is a wooden structure covering the feed bunk located in the "(cid:28)valley"(cid:29). The top of the structure has a metal
roof that is located at about head level for the three white tail deer located in this enclosure. The front edge of the
metal roof has torn and jagged edges.
These items are not in good repair and present an injury hazard to the animals. All facilities must be structurally
sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

FEEDING.
There is an excessive amount of bird feces present on the hay feeders and on the walls immediately adjacent to the
feeders within the shelter for the goat and five white tail deer. Failure to protect feed and feed receptacles from
contamination by birds can lead to disease hazards for the animals. Food and food receptacles shall be located so
as to minimize contamination and the feeders shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times. To be corrected by: March 29, 2016
