2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was one rabbit with a health condition requiring treatment in consultation with the Attending Veterinarian. An adult
brown lionhead rabbit in Pen A7 had yellow discharge under the nose and was observed to sneeze repeatedly. The
rabbit appeared alert and in good body condition. The licensee had not observed the health condition in the rabbit and
was not administering any treatments. The condition was not addressed in the Program of Veterinary Care.
Nasal discharge and sneezing can cause discomfort, spread to other animals if infectious, and worsen if not treated.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate this rabbit and determine an appropriate plan
for diagnosis and treatment.
3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Although the walls of the guinea pig enclosures were at least 7 inches in height, there were 4 guinea pigs observed out of
their enclosures on the floor of the facility.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.


The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.26(d) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
In the guinea pig housing facility, there were support beams that were wood that was not painted or sealed.
Unsealed wood is not impervious to moisture and cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized.
Interior building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can be readily
cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.
3.53(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The wire screening used on the rabbit enclosures was broken in several areas resulting in gaps as large as 3 3/4 inches
in diameter.
Broken wires with gaps can cause injury to the animals or result in escaped animals.
Primary enclosures for rabbits must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury
and to contain the rabbits.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
