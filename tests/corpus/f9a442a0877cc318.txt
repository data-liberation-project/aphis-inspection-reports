Minimum age requirements.
Six puppies born on 10/25/21 were sold and transported on 12/17/21 which is 53 days after they were born. Puppies
younger than 8 weeks of age are more susceptible to stresses that occur from travelling and being placed into a new
facility. Their immune systems are more susceptible to becoming compromised which could cause them to become sick
and even die. The licensee must not sell and transport any puppies under 8 weeks of age. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

End of report.
