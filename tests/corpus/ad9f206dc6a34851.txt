2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
According to the licensee, 3 dogs were added to the kennel two months ago. These three dogs have not been
added to the inventory of dogs on hand records. Accurate and complete records are essential to track dogs. All
dogs present in the kennel must be added to the official APHIS form 7005. Correct by 10 November 2015.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One lower metal support pipe between two enclosures in the west side of the kennel is still rusted to the point that
sections are missing. Rusted surfaces cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized and can affect the structural
strength of the material. All surfaces must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and
sanitized and remain structurally sound.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an accumulation of feces and wet material on the floor of one of two shelter structures in one outdoor
enclosure. The feces are covering about 90% of the available floor space of this shelter structure. An accumulation
of feces can lead to odors, pests, and can contribute to disease transmission. In this case it is likely leading to these
dogs not using this shelter structure. The licensee must ensure that excreta and other food waste is removed from
primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the dogs, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
To be corrected by 5 Nov 2015.
