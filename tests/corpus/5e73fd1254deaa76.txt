HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor portion of the dog kennels is full of lumber, tools, and various stored items. The items are piled on top of
the indoor kennels, along the walls and in the walkway. The accumulation of the these materials in the animal
housing facility may harbor vermin or cause injury to the dogs. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be
kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually
used and necessary for cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices.
This area must be cleaned and organized and items not used for the care of the dogs removed.
