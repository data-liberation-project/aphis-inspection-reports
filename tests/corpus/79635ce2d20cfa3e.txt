INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A dog used on an IACUC approved research study did not receive the full length of post-operative analgesia as
described. On the second full day of post operative recovery, this dog was noted as being in pain by a research
associate, but analgesics were not given to the animal nor were veterinary services notified to conduct treatment.
The dog received approximately 24-36 hours of analgesia not the minimal 48 hours as required by the protocol.
The IACUC must ensure that the description of procedures designed to assure that pain and distress are minimized
are followed as approved. The IACUC has corrected this item by retraining the staff involved with this protocol.
This item has been corrected.
This inspection was conducted on July 1-2nd 2014 with an exit briefing on July 2nd with the Director of Preclinical
Services.
