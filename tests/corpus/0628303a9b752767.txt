ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Upon observation one female sea lion maintained closure of its right eye in and out of the pool. The manager
claims this animal had a whisker from one of the other sea lions touch her eye two days ago and began closing it at
that time. The manager has not contacted a veterinarian and has been giving this animal aspirin to control any pain
its in. The closed eye behavior could be a sign of discomfort. It is up to the manager who is responsible for these
animals while in transport to maintain direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian with any
injury that occurs, so that adequate veterinary treatment is given in a timely manner for the health of the animals.
