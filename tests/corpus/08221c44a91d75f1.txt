RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was not an accessible and updated list of animals available for inspections. Required information and details
relating to source and/or disposition of many of the animals was not provided at the time of inspection. Individual
information on the acquisition of just a couple of animals was made available (one juvenile baboon and one camel).
No disposition records were provided.
Every dealer and exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.

HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
Two young olive baboons (one approximately 8 months old, and one infant) did not have interstate health
certificates available for them at the time of the inspection. These nonhuman primates, according to the owner, were
obtained recently from a facility in Georgia. A health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian within 10 days of
shipment must accompany any nonhuman primate that is transported in commerce by a licensee or registrant.
Correct form this point forward.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outdoor dog kennel had inadequate shelter from the elements. There was a torn and frayed shade tarp that
was hanging from the top of the kennel but its torn and deteriorated state did not provide for adequate shade from
direct sun. There was one igloo-type dog house for all three dogs but there was no other shade and in direct sun the
igloo would get hot inside. One shelter for three dogs is no sufficient for all of them to seek shelter from rain and
wind. The lack of shelter from sun, wind and rain can cause animals to suffer from heat, wet, or cold conditions
which may cause health and welfare impacts on the animals. Adequate shelter from the elements must be providedand this must provide protection from the direct rays of the sun and the direct effect of wind and rain. Shelter must
be for adequate size to shelter all animals at one time.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an outdoor kennel with three toy Australian shepherds that had excessive fecal accumulation on the
concrete floor of the kennel. Accumulation of excessive feces can attract pests and vermin and may cause health or
disease problems in the animals. Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily and from
under and around primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of feces and food
waste, and reduce disease, insects, and pest hazards.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple nonhuman primate enclosures had maintenance and structural deficiencies. Examples included but were
not limited to:
* The enclosure housing two olive baboons that had a gap at the base where apparently the animals had been
digging. There was no buried wire along the base of the enclosure. If the baboons succeeded in digging a gap large
enough they would be able to escape.
* Multiple macaque enclosures had deteriorating and/or sagging platforms, splintering and broken wood, and
enrichment items that were excessively worn or broken . Some enclosures had wood with exposed screws. Poorly
maintained surfaces with splinter and sharp objects can pose an injury hazard to the animals. One macaque
enclosure contained a toy ball that had a large hole in it that the animal could get his head stuck in and potentially
suffocate if trapped.
* A capuchin enclosure contained a hanging plastic platform that the rope broke and was frayed, and the platform
was left dangling. A loose string cord was hanging in that cage also which could pose an entrapment or
strangulation risk to the animals.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

3.75(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. The food storage shed had debris and garbage near the stored animal food. There was a partially used open bag of
primate food near the door. The storage shed contained various other equipment, tools and supplies around the
nonhuman primate feed. The accumulation of debris and disorganized tools and supplies can harbor pests and
pose a risk of contamination of the feed. Contaminated or spoiled feed can cause illness and health problems for
the animals. The open bag of feed may have a risk of pest infestation or of becoming contaminated or moldy. All
food and bedding must be stored in a way that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and
around the supplies. Open food and bedding must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
spoilage and contamination. Potentially toxic substances must not be stored in food storage and preparation area.
3.82(d)
FEEDING.
There were several nonhuman primates (including, but not limited to, enclosures with patas monkey, ring-tailed
lemurs, and a vertvet) with food bowls that were dirty and food was excessively wet. Some food bowls were full of
water and with the remnants from prior feedings mixed in the bowls contained a foul looking slush. In several
enclosures the food bowls were also next to accumulations of feces. Some enclosures did not have any shelter to
protect the food receptacles from becoming inundated with water when it rained. Wet or contaminated feed can
attract pests and vermin, can cause illness or health problems for the animals, and may prevent them from
obtaining necessary nutrition.
Food and food receptacles must be located so as to minimize any risk of contamination by excreta and pests. Food
receptacles must be kept clean and must be sanitized in accordance with the procedures listed in Sec. 3.84(b)(3) of
this subpart at least once every 2 weeks. The facility must ensure there is no molding, deterioration, contamination,
or caking or wetting of food placed in self-feeders.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Multiple nonhuman primate enclosures had accumulation of significant amounts of fecal material on the floors,
resting platforms and other surfaces. Nonhuman primates affected by the dirty surfaces, excessive accumulation of
excreta and food waste included macaques, capuchins, ring-tailed lemurs, patas monkeys, and baboons. In some
enclosures there were a significant number of flies being drawn to the waste. Many platforms, toys, and other
surfaces were dirty and had an layers of grime and debris. Accumulation of excreta and food waste can cause
health and disease problems in the animals. Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside each indoor
primary enclosure daily and from underneath them as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of
feces can food waste, to prevent the primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests
and odors.

EMPLOYEES.
According to the owner, he has one employee who is supposed to come three times per week to clean cages but
who has not come to work for about a week. The owner indicated that he and his wife are the only other staff. There
are not an adequate number of employees to adequately maintain the facility in accordance with the regulations.
Accumulation of excreta and food waste was observed in multiple enclosures and most surfaces in the nonhuman
primate enclosures had not been appropriately cleaned or sanitized according to the required standards. Multiple
maintenance and repairs requirements were also noted.

FEEDING.
A pen housing two wallaby had a bowl, that contained dirty, cloudy, brown water, with floating debris in it. The
owner indicated that this was their food bowl. The food bowl was placed in an open unprotected area where rain
could wet the food. Contaminate food and food receptacles can cause disease or health problems. Food and food
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times Adequate measures shall be taken to prevent molding,
contamination, and deterioration or caking of food.

WATERING.
A water bowl in the wallaby enclosure had green colored water (appeared to be algae). The water bowl had a broad
ring of green stain that extended above the water line. Dirty or contaminated water or water receptacles can cause
illness or health problems for the animals. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
Multiple raccoon enclosures had excessive accumulation of feces. Unclean enclosures can be detrimental to the
health and welfare of the animals and increase risks of disease and pest problems. Excreta shall be removed from
primary enclosure as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION. A camel was housed in a yard area with accumulations of building supplies, pipes, wire, wood, machinery
equipment, tractors, and other debris. The camel had access to all of this material and to what appeared to be an
equipment shed. Access of the camel to all of this material, equipment and debris poses numerous hazards that
could injure the animal (tripping, entanglement, puncture wounds from sharp objects, etc.). Access to the shed and
various farm equipment could expose the camel to potentially toxic substances (oils, grease, etc.) that could cause
illness. The premises must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals form injury.
Accumulations of trash and debris shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the
health of the animals.
