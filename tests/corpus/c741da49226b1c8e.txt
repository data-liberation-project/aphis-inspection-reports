material coating the entire surface of the upper cheek and canine teeth. At least one upper incisor was noticeably
loose and wiggled when touched. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease which can impact
the ability of the dog to eat, affecting the health and well-being of the dog. Dental disease can be painful, lead to a
decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian no
later than 25 January 2015 and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be
documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive

* The left eye of an adult female blue and fawn Chihuahua ( microchip number 109 831 779 ) was dry, crusted,
and appeared darker and smaller than the opposite eye. The dog is not currently being treated for this condition,
and has not been recently evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. An eye problem of this nature can be painful and
lead to secondary eye problems as well. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian no later

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Metal edge flashing in four enclosures is corroded and showing excessive rust. In addition, multiple galvanized
divider enclosure panels are showing excessive rust. Fifteen dogs are in contact with the affected areas located inoutdoor & indoor housing. The surfaces were rough in appearance. Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal
surfaces to the point that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized because a smooth
surface no longer exists. Excessive rust affects the structural integrity of all metal surfaces. Licensee must ensure
that this and all other surfaces are free of rust and of good structural strength. Correct by 2/15/15.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on three fiberglass divider wall boards. The enclosures are
located in outdoor housing. Five dogs are in contact with the affected surface area. The affected area covers
approximately 25 to 50 percent of the wall surface. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could
lead to potential disease or health risks. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta
and other disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at
least once every two weeks or more often if needed in accordance with section 3.11 B. Correct by 1/16/15.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* There was fecal waste and hair collecting in the expanded metal flooring and on the two by six inch wood support
frame in two outdoor enclosures housing six dogs. It indicates an unsanitary living condition exists and could lead
to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must ensure that excreta are removed from the primary enclosure
on a daily basis to reduce any disease hazards. Correct by 1/16/15.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* A variety of materials are being stored outside behind the food storage barn. This area is located between the
elevated outdoor kennels and the outdoor runs. The storage area is disorganized and has numerous items not
being properly stored. There were several piles of carpet bedding squares along with various other materials were
observed. This could be a potential living area for insects, rodents, and other pests which might impact the nearby
animals. The licensee must ensure all areas of the facility are kept clean to facilitate normal husbandry practices.
