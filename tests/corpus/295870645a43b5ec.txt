Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:56-3:30pm on 15-
SEP-22. I arrived at the facility at 2:56pm. There was no answer to a knock on the door. I called the licensee at 2:58pm
and left a message. The licensee called back at 3:25pm and stated that they had closed their business and were no
longer conducting regulated activity and would be canceling their license.
