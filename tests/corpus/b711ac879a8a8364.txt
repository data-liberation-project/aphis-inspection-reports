2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult tri-colored (mostly white, with a black face and tan rump) guinea pig in enclosure # 5 had a mass approximately
1.5 inches in diameter under her chin.

An adult tri-colored( black, tan, and white) guinea pig in enclosure # 9 had a mass approximately 1 inches in diameter
under her chin.

Both animals appeared to be eating and drinking normally. Licensee was feeding timothy and alfalfa hay along with
pelleted feed.

The treatment for masses is not addressed in the written program of veterinary care and there is no record that the facility
had identified these two animals prior to today's inspection. A failure to conduct adequate daily observations with direct
communication with the attending veterinarian, can result in delay of care provided to animals and prolong animal health
problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health are conveyed.


The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian about the two guinea pigs with masses and provide treatment for
these animals as recommended by the veterinarian. Correct by October 2, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
