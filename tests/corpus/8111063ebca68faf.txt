3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is a 29 year old female black bear that is living in one of the corn cribs that has multiple piles of feces, and
surrounded by wet/dirty straw. While inside of her hide, it was observed that all of the straw was soiled, wet and had
feces in it. As the bear came out of the hide, her back legs were soaked through, with a buildup of feces between
her legs. It has been three weeks since the cribs have been cleaned.
A build up of feces, dirt, debris and wet bedding in the enclosures can be a source of illness and discomfort for the
regulated animals if not removed in a timely manner, before the buildup.
The licensee must increase the cleaning of the bear pens more often to prevent the buildup of feces, old food, wet
straw and debris that can cause the regulated animals discomfort or inability to move freely without coming in
contact with the debris. All wet bedding must be removed and replaced with dry.
The licensee cleaned out the adjoining corn crib and supplied it with dry straw by the end of the inspection. The
bear was moved into the clean area immediately.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
