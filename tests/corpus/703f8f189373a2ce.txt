OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In 6 enclosures, 9 adult dogs and 1 puppy lacked sufficient outdoor shelters. The ambient outdoor temperature at
the time of inspection was approximately 45F. The temperature in the kennel was approximately 51-52F. The facility
consists of a pole barn type structure with a roof, 2 solid, permanent walls on opposite ends, and a cement floor that
is heated by a boiler. During the winter, the licensee hangs plastic to cover the open air walls and enclose the
structure. The licensee was notified at the previous inspection that his facility is classified as an outdoor facility and
he would need to add shelters to each of the enclosures. Shelters are a vital component in outdoor facilities to
provide warmth and comfort to the animals. Without them, exposure to extreme temperatures can stress the
animals and threaten their health and welfare. Correct by providing shelters sufficiently large to allow each animal in
the enclosure to fit and maintain normal, comfortable body posture. Correct within 60 days.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
