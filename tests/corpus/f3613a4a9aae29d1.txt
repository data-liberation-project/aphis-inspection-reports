INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The concrete floors in the main kennel need to be resealed. If the floors are not sealed the floors are no longer
impervious to moisture which does not facilitate sanitizing of the kennel. The kennel must be kept in good repair to
maintain the health of the dogs.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The top support beam of the enclosure to the left of the door was not properly secured. The dogs were observed
jumping on the mesh causing it to bend forward in an extreme manner. The structural integrity of the kennel is an
important part of maintaining the animals safety including preventing escape or possible injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The whelping kennel had an accumulation of debris and dust as well as miscellaneous items not pertaining to the
care of the dogs. Dust was noted on the rafters, windows, and a coating was noted on the walls. Excess food and
shaving was found along the walls. The building and kennels are not being cleaned appropriately which is
necessary to maintain a healthy environment especially in the case of newborn animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several swarms of the flies were noted both in the whelping and main kennel. No screens were noted on the open
windows and doors. Insects must be controlled to prevent the spread of disease. The door to the whelping kennel
was being left open and food was being placed on the floor for farm dogs. This encourages vermin to take up
residence in the whelping building. An effective pest control program is necessary to maintain the health and
well-being of the animals as well as prevent the contamination of the area by pests.
