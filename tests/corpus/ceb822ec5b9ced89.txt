ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00 PM on
07-OCT-19.
When I arrived to do a facility inspection I observed the inside of the building was empty.
Mrs. Bozinos later called back to report about a week ago she decided to discontinue Olathe Pet Paradise and was
no longer conducting regulated business. I discussed with Mrs. Bozinos how to cancel her USDA license. In
addition, I told her what to write on her USDA license certificate prior to sending it to the regional office. I told her to
send her USDA license certificate to:
USDA, APHIS, Animal Care
2150 Centre Ave., Building B
Mail Stop #3 W11
Ft. Collins, Co. 80526-8117
* Copy of the attempted inspection report was sent by electronic email.
