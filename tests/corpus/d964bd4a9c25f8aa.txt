3.3(d)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The ambient temperature outside at the time of the inspection was 12 deg F. The indoor portion of the sheltered facility
was approximately 68 deg F during the inspection. The sheltered boxes for the dogs are fully enclosed with a top that lifts
off and inside the box there is a metal shift door that opens to the outdoor portion of the run. For three sheltered boxes,
the shift doors were propped open with a wood block to assist dogs going in and out of the box. When a kestrel handheld
reader was left in the box for 10 minutes, the temperature in the box read 35 deg F. In keeping the door propped open,
this shelter does not adequately protect the dogs from the elements at all times to protect their health. Doors provided
need to be able to open and close appropriately to maintain heat in the box.

The licensee stated they would move dogs who could not work the doors effectively to the heated whelping building by
end of day.

3.6(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.

*** There are still several sections of wood inside the shelter boxes that are heavily worn through chewing or scratching
directly over the feeders. These areas no longer enable the surfaces to be readily cleaned and sanitized and are not in
good repair.

*** Several sections of the plastic paneling over the wood in a few boxes are in disrepair and are cracked and chewed
causing sharp points and exposing surfaces that cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized.
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*** The shelter boxes in the main kennel are not being spot cleaned daily and a few have excess food that needs to be
removed and one box had excess feces and food that needs to be removed and cleaned. Fecal and food waste must be
removed from primary enclosures daily to keep the enclosure clean and for the health of the dogs.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
