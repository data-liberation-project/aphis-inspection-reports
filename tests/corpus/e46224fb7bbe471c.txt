FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The premises includes a stairway that would be easily accessible to the animal, in the event that it were to escape
its primary enclosure. Once at the top of the stairs, there is the potential that the animal could leap over a railing and
the perimeter fence.
Two gaps under the perimeter fence measuring up to three inches were observed. The openings could potentially
be enlarged by digging in the dirt.
The perimeter fence should prevent people and animals from passing under or through the fence. People or
animals entering the premises could harm the exhibit animal, or introduce disease. Additionally, the perimeter fence
should act as secondary containment for the exhibit animal, in the event that it escapes from its primary enclosure,
in order to protect it from harm.
Steps should be taken to prevent access to the stairwell, and to close any gaps under the perimeter fence.
This was a new site inspection. No animals were present.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee's representative.
