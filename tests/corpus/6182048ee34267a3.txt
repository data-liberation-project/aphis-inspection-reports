NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The licensee renewed the USDA license 6 July 2015 and did not indicate any change of address. Upon arrival for
inspection 7 January 2016, the inspector was informed by the current resident that the licensee no longer lived or
operated at that location. Failure to promptly notify Animal Care (AC) of changes in operation does not allow officials
to inspect for the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by notifying the AC Regional Director by certified
mail of any change in the name, address, management, or substantial control or ownership of his business or
operation, or of any additional sites. To be corrected by: 18 January 2016.
