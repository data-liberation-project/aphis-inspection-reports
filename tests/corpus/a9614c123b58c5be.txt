2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult male Shih Tzu with chip number OAO222824 ("Jack") has dental disease and a heavily matted and dirty coat.
There is a thick accumulation of dental calculus on the upper premolars ("cheek teeth") on both sides of the mouth.
Two of the upper premolars have recessed and red gums as well. These findings are consistent with dental
disease. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of the jaw
supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the overall
health of the animal. The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.
The coat was generally matted on his whole body but the mats were especially thick on the limbs and face. Soiled,
matted hair can cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted coats do not provide complete
protection against the elements. The licensee must clean this animal's hair coat and remove the matted hair. As
part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat
maintenance to ensure that animals are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is
removed on a regular basis.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are three gates with deteriorating metal that has resulted in a defects with a jagged edge at floor level.

3.9(b)
FEEDING.
Several of the large metal self-feeders in the outdoor enclosures have a build up of grime on the interior surfaces.
Insufficient cleaning of food receptacles can lead to contamination and deterioration of food. The licensee must
ensure that If self-feeders are used, they must be kept clean and must be sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b)of this subpart. To be corrected by 29 January 2020.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The feces have not been spot cleaned from the outdoor enclosures daily resulting in a collection of feces on the dirt
floors. Also, while the feces have been scooped within the last day from the outdoor enclosures that have cement
floors, many of these areas are wet and soiled with feces, resulting in soiled dog coats. One outdoor enclosure also
has a thick coating of excreta, dirt. and hair coating a post and the surrounding fence. Insufficient cleaning can play
a role in disease transmission and result in dogs with soiled wet coats which is uncomfortable. The licensee must
ensure that excreta and food waste be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats
contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. To be corrected by
16 January 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
