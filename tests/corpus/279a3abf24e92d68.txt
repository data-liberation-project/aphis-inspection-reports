PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the left-hand rabbit enclosure (north) when entering under (cid:28)"Bunnyville(cid:29)" sign, there is an electrical outlet at a
height accessible to the rabbits with two cords plugged into it. There is no protective measure to prevent the rabbits
from chewing on the cords. Chewing on the cords could cause injury to the rabbits by ingesting the coating on the
cords, or by electrical shock.
The licensee must construct and maintain in good repair the primary enclosures to protect the rabbits from injury.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the right-hand rabbit enclosure (south) when entering under the "Bunnyville" sign, there is a feeder surrounded by
water that has a tube present allowing the public to feed the rabbits. The rabbits do not have convenient access to
the feeder due to the amount of water and mud they would have to walk through to get to it.
The licensee must construct and maintain the enclosure to have convenient access to clean food and water.

FEEDING.
In both rabbit enclosures in "Bunnyville" the remnants of hay that was in the enclosure had been fed directly on the
ground and had been rained on. The pans used as feeders had an accumulation of rainwater and leaves. The
licensee stated that he places bales of hay directly on the ground and they remain there until they have been
consumed, and that they would dump the water and leaves out of the pans before adding any grain/pellets. There
are no alternative options for the days that have inclement weather. The public feeding of the animals did not allow
for emptying of water and debris in the pans before food was provided. The feeding methods in the enclosure are
not free from the contamination of dirt, water, and excreta. Dirty, wet, and contaminated food could lose
wholesomeness, palatability, sufficient quantity present and nutritive value.
The licensee must provide feed receptacles for all foods and ensure that when the rabbits have access to food that
it shall be free from contamination and ensure that it is wholesome and palatable and the nutritive value has not
been compromised.
