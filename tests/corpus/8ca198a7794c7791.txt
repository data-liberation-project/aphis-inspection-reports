FEEDING.
The food receptacles (hay manger, sealed concrete platforms) are not provided in sufficient quantities for the 20
goats. So, some of the goat(cid:25)s hay is being fed on the ground. Food receptacles shall be sufficient in quantity and
located so as to be accessible to all animals in the enclosure and shall be placed so as to minimize contamination.
Any food receptacle, hay manger, or platform used is to be sanitizable (the ground is not considered sanitizable).
This feeding situation can negatively impact the health and wellbeing of the animals. A feeding system needs to be
created to ensure the goats are fed in a manner that minimizes contamination.

SANITATION.
The Wildlife Program(cid:25)s trailer has numerous cracking floor tile squares and many corners have broken off with the
wear and tear. The marlite (thin vinyl sheet with press board backing) walls over the sink has at least 5
(3/4(cid:29)approximately) round holes (where something had been attached).
Also, this outer vinyl coating above the sink and to the sides is starting to disintegrate. This leaves numerous areas
where the backing is exposed to water and other elements. When surfaces are no longer sealed, the floor and the
walls cannot be properly sanitized.
Buildings shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animal(cid:25)s health and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices. The system to routinely monitor and repair the facility(cid:25)s buildings, and other
structures needs to be intensified.
