2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The current program of veterinary care indicates that for all hoofstock species, except Blackbuck and Nilgai,
succinylcholine will be the sole agent used for capture, transport, and chemical restraint for procedures such as
exams and lameness treatment. During conversations with facility representatives it was ascertained that
succinylcholine is the sole current drug being used to immobilize hoofstock. Bottles of succinylcholine were present
at the facility. The veterinarian-approved instructions discuss the care and monitoring of the animal during the use
of the neuromuscular blocker but makes no mention of the fact that during immobilization with neuromuscular
blocking agents the animals remain fully conscious and are sensitive to pain, stress and stimulation. Succinylcholine
is a paralytic agent that has no pain relieving or tranquilizing properties. In addition, this type of drug paralyzes
respiratory muscles causing decreases in respiration rate that can be severe enough to lead to death if the animals
are not ventilated appropriately. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities or training to intubate or
mechanically ventilate animals if they stop breathing. Neuromuscular blockers such as succinylcholine should not
be used without concurrent appropriate use of anesthesia/analgesia and support measures (ventilation and
monitoring) to avoid the distressing effects, respiratory depression and enhanced risk of death due to paralysis of
respiratory muscles. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which are able to
chemically restrain animals without causing paralysis while providing anesthesia and analgesia. The licensee must
maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods of immobilizing and restraining
hoofstock that are consistent with currently accepted professional standards of adequate veterinary care.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public is permitted to walk directly up to the primary enclosures containing several species of animals
including goats, sheep, zebu cattle, llama, and camel. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the
walk through area (for the sheep, goats, zebu, and llama) and the wagon loading area where one camel is housed
in a horse stall. There are no barriers or signs present at the walk through area to discourage public contact and
the guests can feed food sold at the entry gate. There are no attendants present during public contact and guests
may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals since primary enclosure fences are made of material withspaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public contact does not
ensure safe public interaction with the animals. The licensee must ensure that during periods of public exhibition
animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so
as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these
animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the
safety of both the public and the animals.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Guests are permitted to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendants are present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. During this inspection, the inspectors noticed
guests feeding animals through car windows and other than wagon drivers, no other employee staff were noted. A
pick-up truck in the drive through park was noted to have 4 people (children and adults) standing and sitting in the
bed of the truck. They were feeding the animals, which included bison. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the
entry gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding. Allowing guests to
feed from vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a
barrier or distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public
contact.
The giraffe veterinary care issue cited on the previous inspection report has been corrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
