2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was no documented program of veterinary care present. The written program of veterinary care is needed
to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care
of regulated animals. It outlines preventive veterinary care practices, such as deworming and vaccinations. The
facility should ensure that the written program of veterinary care is available for review during all USDA inspections.
