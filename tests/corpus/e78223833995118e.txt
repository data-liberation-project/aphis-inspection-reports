2.31(c)(7) CRITICAL
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 1047 describes intravenous administration of 8.0 ml of contrast material to an anesthetized rabbit using a
power injector. On November 30, 2016 an experienced operator accidentally injected 70.0 ml of contrast material
resulting in the immediate death of a rabbit.
The protocol deviation and incident was reviewed and addressed by the IACUC. Appropriate corrective measures
have been implemented including user checklists, signage and re-training. This non-compliance was corrected prior
to the inspection.
The inspection was conducted with multiple facility representatives including veterinarians, associate director
animal facility and dept. chair veterinary medicine and surgery.
The exit interview was conducted with the dept. chair of veterinary medicine and surgery.
