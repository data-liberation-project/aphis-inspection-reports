TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Three litters of puppies in the whelping area have no form of identification (i.e., cage card, ID tag, collar, or tattoo).
Live puppies less than sixteen weeks of age shall be identified by one of the methods listed above. It is important to
identify all animals, even puppies born on the premises, to ensure that records are easily traced back in the event of
disease or other issue that needs to be investigated. Licensee shall identify all puppies under 16 weeks of age by
one of the above methods. Correct by: October 20, 2014.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS 7005 Forms included 9 dogs currently held on the premises; however, 10 dogs are missing from these
records. It is important to keep records of acquisition of adult animals to facilitate tracebacks in the event of disease
or other investigative issue. The Licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of each dog owned, including the
information listed in 2.75(a)(1)(i-ix). Correct by: October 20, 2014.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The whelping area does not have any form of ventilation; the odor in this area was moderate to severe. The air in
this building does not have any form of escape through windows, fans, or vents. Ventilation is important to allow
circulation to minimize the presence of odors, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation. Ventilation shall be
provided by windows, doors, vents, fans, or air conditioning. Correct by: October 29, 2014.
3.3(e)(1)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.

Non-impervious surfaces pose a health hazard to animals because they can harbor disease agents such asbacteria or viruses. Licensee shall ensure that all surfaces with which the animals come into contact are impervious
to moisture. Correct by: November 15, 2014.
