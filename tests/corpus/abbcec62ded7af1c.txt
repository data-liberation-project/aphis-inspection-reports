ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A male Cavalier identified as # 183 was heavily matted behind the ears, underneath neck and behind the rear
legs. Once the fur becomes matted, it pulls and separates from the skin causing potential skin irritations. This dog
needs to be groomed on a routine basis to prevent matting and for the comfort of the dog.
A bichon identified as #157 was favoring the right rear foot and upon closer observation the skin between the pads
was red, irritated and swollen. The inside of both ears were red with brownish grainy discharge. Scabs were present
at the base of both ears, likely from scratching. This dog should be assessed by the attending veterinarian for
diagnosis and treatment options.
