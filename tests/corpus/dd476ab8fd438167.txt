2.32(c)(4)

Personnel qualifications.
An adverse event occurred on 12/13/2018 that negatively impacted the welfare of an animal at this facility. This event was
unforeseeable, but revealed an enclosure deficiency that needed to be addressed for the safety and well-being of the
animals in enclosures of the same type. Facility staff and the attending veterinarian responded appropriately and
established immediate corrective and preventative measures, but the deficiency was not reported to the IACUC until
approximately 10 months later, in October 2019. The methods for the reporting of deficiencies in the animal care and use
program, including facility issues like the one identified in this enclosure, were not clear to the personnel involved, which
delayed IACUC review of the incident and limited timely IACUC oversight of the incident and the subsequent corrective
and preventative measures. The research facility must ensure that training and instruction of personnel includes guidance
on the methods whereby deficiencies in animal care and treatment are reported.

To be corrected by 10/24/2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
