ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:18pm on
04-Jan-17.
A telephone message was left for the licensee at time of this attempted inspection. She returned my call at 4:56pm
and left me a voicemail message that she was out of state and the usual animal caretaker was on vacation. The
interim caretaker is feeding early AM and PM so this is way no one was available at the time of day I was there.
