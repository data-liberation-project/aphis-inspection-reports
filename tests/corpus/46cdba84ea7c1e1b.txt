Primary enclosures.
1. In one outdoor enclosure there was a piece of wood which was acting as support. The wood was observed to be
jagged and worn with exposed screws. This could cause injury to the dogs.
2. A metal cap on a dividing wall was observed to be chewed and jagged on both sides, which affected both adjacent
enclosures. This could cause injury to the dogs. Enclosures must be maintained in good repair.

3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
An excessive buildup of feces was observed in most of the outdoor runs. Excess waste can harbor disease causing
agents and potentially cause health issues. Excreta must be removed daily from primary enclosures, including outdoor
runs, in order to prevent buildup of waste, reduce disease hazards, and to prevent soiling of the dogs.
3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The area around the outdoor enclosures was observed with weed overgrowth, and accumulations of construction debris
and miscellaneous items. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products, and discarded
matter. Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and


to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
