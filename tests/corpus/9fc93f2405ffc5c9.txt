3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The enclosure containing the Artic Fox had exposed metal subfloor grating where holes were dug. The dug out areas
were in the left front corner by the gate and by the feeder and igloo shelter. This exposed sub-floor has openings
approximately 4 x 2 inches wide that creates a risk for limb entrapment to the enclosed animal.

This exposed metal and loss of dirt underneath creates a potential hazard that could result in injury by trapping a limb or
foot. A trapped limb can result in a fracture or soft tissue injury that can be painful and become infected.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
