FEEDING.
*** There is a mixture of dirt and grime caked on the interior trough of four plastic feeders in four different
enclosures. The feeders are located in the multi-level building, eleven dogs are in contact with the feeders. The
affected area was covering 30 to 40 percent of the interior trough. It can harbor bacteria and other disease causing
agents that can affect the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are
kept clean and can be sanitized at all times.
*** Seven metal feeders had an excessive buildup of bird feces on the tops of the feeders. The receptacles are
located in the outdoor housing area, fifteen dogs are in contact with the feeders. Surfaces caked with bird
droppings cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Feed contaminated with droppings is not healthy to be
consumed, affecting the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are
kept clean and can be sanitized at all times.
