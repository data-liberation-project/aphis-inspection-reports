HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This facility has a primary enclosure housing forty-seven deer in which the public can walk freely about the
enclosure. At the time of the inspection there was no employee or attendant present in the deer enclosure while
members of the public were out among the deer. Not having an employee or attendant present while members of
the public are among the deer does not ensure for the safety of the animals and the public. A readily identifiable
employee must be present at all times while members of the public have access in the deer enclosure. Correct by:
