Facilities, general.
Although enclosure walls were at least 7 inches in height, during the inspection, two guinea pigs were observed to be out
of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Primary enclosures.
On approximately 10 of the guinea pig self-feeders, the metal prongs attached to the feeder were protruding at the back
end resulting in sharp points present inside the enclosures.
Sharp wire tips can cause injury to the animals.
Enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
