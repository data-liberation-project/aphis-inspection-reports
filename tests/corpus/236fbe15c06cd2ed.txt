3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
At the time of inspection, the two rabbits were still housed in an enclosure that was covered in cobwebs on all four
walls and ceiling of the primary shelter. The cobweb accumulation is a potential for disease hazard and creates a
favorable environment for insects and other pests. The primary enclosure must be cleaned and the licensee must
maintain a cleaning program that will prevent an accumulation of cobwebs from being excessive.
3.56(a)(3) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was a large accumulation of rabbit feces and flies underneath and around the rabbit enclosures. If primary
enclosures are equipped with wire or mesh floors, the area under such enclosures shall be cleaned at least once
each week. The area should be maintained in a sanitary condition and to control the amount of fecal matter.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility manager and APHIS personnel, Dr. Simone
Tomlinson, VMO.
