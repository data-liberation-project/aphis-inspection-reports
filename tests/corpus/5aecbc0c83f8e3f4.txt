2.40(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A sea lion identified as "Hike", was observed swimming, revealing several large (5-6 inch in diameter) patches of alopecia
on his abdomen. Two other sea lions appeared to have hair loss on their flippers. Although observed by the keeper staff
several days ago, it was not communicated to the attending veterinarian. The facility must ensure that there is a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so concerns of animal health are
conveyed. Delaying such information may delay treatment impacting animal welfare.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
