Sanitation.
In the off exhibit holding area, there remained a large pile of construction debris composed mostly of fencing materials.
The barn area was cluttered and full of debris. Almost the entire non-public area adjacent to the "d" street enclosures had
large cardboard boxes, with no cover or top, full of donated supplies. Many of the supplies were exposed to the
environment within the boxes and needed to be sorted and discarded or stored appropriately.

Buildings and grounds shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate
the prescribed husbandry practices.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager.
