ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1455 on
28-Mar-19. I went to the licensee's place of work. He was not available to do an inspection as he was busy at
work. I told him I would try again another day.
End of report.
