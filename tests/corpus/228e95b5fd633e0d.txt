ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An inspection was attempted on 2/10/2020 based on the date and address listed on the licensee's itinerary.
However, upon speaking to the licensee via phone after it was determined that he was not at the location indicated
on the itinerary, it was discovered that he was in another state and had not submitted an update to his itinerary.
The itinerary must be accurate in order to adequately track and inspect animals when not at the home site. Submit
any updates to the itinerary within 24 hours of receiving this inspection report.
This exit interview was conducted via telephone with the licensee.
