Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

refrigerator for over 1 hour for an accurate temperature, the Kestrel read 46.7 degrees Fahrenheit. NeoVac DA2 and
Neopar vaccines state they must be stored at 35-45 degrees Fahrenheit. Vaccines and medications not stored at the
appropriate temperature as listed on the label may not protect the dogs from the diseases and illnesses the vaccines and
medications are used for.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure all vaccines and medications are stored at the appropriate temperature that is listed on the products label.
