Item primary enclosures 3.15 a 6
On 4-June-2021, Egyptair transported a kitten on flight 985 to JFK airport in New York as checked baggage. At JFK, it
was discovered the animal arrived deceased. There were no “Live Animals” in letters on the primary enclosure used to
transport the animal nor any arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure.
The airline must ensure that primary enclosures used in transport of live animals are adequately marked to maintain the
correct position, care, and safety of animals during transport.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Item Primary Enclosures 3.15 a 8
On 4-June-2021, Egyptair transported a kitten on flight 985 to JFK airport in New York as checked baggage. At JFK, it
was discovered the animal arrived deceased.
The bottom half of the primary enclosure used to transport the kitten had been covered in solid plastic wrap which
obstructed and prevented the flow of air and ventilation to the animal. This kitten was a short-nosed breed which further
required unobstructed ventilation.


The airline must ensure proper ventilation is provided, in that there are no obstructions of the ventilation openings of the
primary enclosure that will inhibit the free flow of adequate ventilation to the animal.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Item Primary Enclosure 3.15 a 9
On 4-June-2021, Egyptair transported a kitten on flight 985 to JFK airport in New York as checked baggage. At JFK, it
was discovered the animal arrived deceased. Upon arrival, the kitten’s hind legs, fore limbs, chest, and muzzle were wet
and there was no absorbent material in the kennel to cover excreta or urine.
The airline must ensure that primary enclosures used in transport of live animals contain enough previously unused litter
to absorb and cover excreta and that the material is safe to the animal.

Food and water requirements.
Item Food and water requirements 3.17 c
On 4-June-2021 Egyptair transported a kitten on flight 985 to JFK airport in New York as checked baggage. At JFK, it
was discovered the animal arrived deceased. The primary enclosure used to transport the kitten did not have food and
water receptacles attached.
The airline must ensure that food and water receptacles are securely attached inside the primary enclosure so the
receptacles can be filled during transport without opening the door to fulfill the food and water requirements of the animal.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
