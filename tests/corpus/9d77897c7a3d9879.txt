2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Review of records and conversations with facility employees show that daily observations of animals to assess their
health and well-being are being conducted but that problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are not
being conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner for some of the research and teaching areas of the
facility.
*Records show that a cow used in a veterinary teaching lab in Sept. 2014 was noted to be lame the next day by
students/staff. A clinical veterinarian was not contacted until five days later at which time the cow was diagnosed
with a cruciate tear. No drugs were given and the cow remained lame in the herd until the next market day six days
later. There was no documentation to show that the attending veterinarian had been notified of the cow(cid:25)s condition.
*Records show that a bear with decreased appetite and foot pad ulcers on both front paws due to pacing
(stereotypical behavior) was immobilized and evaluated during study procedures. There was no documentation to
show that the attending veterinarian was consulted until several weeks after signs were noted. The state game
department was consulted and the bear was released.
*During this inspection pig I-42 was noted by the inspector to be obviously limping on the right front leg and had a
bright red abraded area of skin about ¾ inch wide and 1 ½ in high on the outside surface of the left rear foot. Facility
staff indicated that he had noticed the limping that day and had treated the pig with Banamine (documented on
medical record). When asked about contacting a veterinarian, he stated that the issue wouldn(cid:25)t be reported at this
stage and that the clinical veterinarian would review the pig(cid:25)s care at the next scheduled clinical rounds visit. Staff
stated that the clinical veterinarian would only be called if it got worse. No documented SOP was available for
review re foot/hoof care issues.
The facility must ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure provision of adequate
veterinary care. To ensure that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and
well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian, there must be daily observation of all animals and there must
be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication of daily observations of animal health and well-being issues
to the attending veterinarian. Correct by Sept. 30, 2015.
2.36(b)(5)ANNUAL REPORT.
The fiscal year 2014 Annual Report submitted to Animal Care by the facility listed 34 dogs used in category C.
Review of acquisition records of dogs acquired between Oct. 1 2013 and Sept. 30 2014 shows that an additional 34
dogs were obtained for a total of 68 dogs used in category C. Properly identifying animals used in research on the
annual report is necessary to inform the Institutional Official and the Animal Care Regional Office of the scope and
extent of the animal use at the facility. The 2014 annual report needs to be amended and resubmitted to the
Regional Office with all animal use data included. Correct by Sept. 30, 2015.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence at the BBRC Facility housing black bears in the fall through spring seasons is not currently
adequately constructed and maintained. The height of the front fence along the road is six feet high and should be 8
feet high for bears. The two corners where the front 6 ft. high fence meets the side 8 ft. high fences are not
structurally sound as the fences do not join each other directly. The large gap created at one corner has been filled
by a section of wire fencing about 4 ft. high placed between the two fences and partially held in place by beams of
wood leaning against it. There are numerous large trees adjacent to and within a couple of feet of the perimeter
fence that a bear could use to climb over the fence. Along a portion of the back fence and the side fence furthest
from the entrance are so many trees, bushes, brush and weeds that the fence cannot be walked along to check its
condition. Adjacent to the bottom of the fence there are piles of leaves. When these leaves were raked away from
the fence, it was noted that there is a large gap almost 6 inches high in places between the bottom of the fence and
the ground. In December 2014 a black bear that had escaped from its enclosure was able to leave the facility by
going under the perimeter fence. The bear ran into the woods. The perimeter fence must be constructed and
maintained so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals such as bears must be approved in writing by the
Animal Care Administrator. Correct prior to housing bears in the facility.
