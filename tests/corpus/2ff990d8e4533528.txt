HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
The registrant transported two Pug puppies that did not have valid Health Certificates. The registrant received the
two puppies on May 31, 2015, but their Health Certificates had expired on May 26, 2015. She then transported the
puppies from Iowa to Missouri on June 01, 2015 where they got a new Health Certificate that was valid for 10 days.
The puppies were transferred to a different transportation company, which transported the puppies to a pet store in
New York. However, the pet store rejected the puppies and they were picked up the following week to be returned
to the owner. The registrant received the two puppies in Missouri on June 15, 2015 for transport back to the owner
in Iowa. However, by then the Health Certificate issued on June 01, 2015 had expired and the registrant again
transported the puppies without a valid Health Certificate. Dogs must be examined by a veterinarian and
determined to be free of infectious disease or physical abnormality within 10 days prior to the beginning of transport.
The registrant shall ensure that all dogs are accompanied by a valid Health Certificate from a veterinarian prior to
accepting them for transportation in commerce. TO BE CORRECTED BY 6/19/2015.
