Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Six puppies traveled on Turkish Airlines flight TK 185 from Istanbul, Turkey to Chicago O’Hare (ORD) on 8/8/22. The six
puppies were transported in two kennels. The Turkish Airlines (TK) representative was asked if either transport kennel
had a certification attached to it indicating the puppies were offered food and water during the four hours prior to delivery
to the carrier. The TK representative indicated neither kennel had a certification attached. A certification must be
attached to the transport kennels of dogs and cats and must contain the following: the consignor’s name and address,
time, and date the animal was last offered food and water, specific instructions for the next feedings and waterings in a
24-hour period, the consignor’s signature and the date and time the certification was signed. The absence of this
certification on the transport enclosure does not establish a timeline of when the feeding and watering of the puppies
should occur. It is the responsibility of the carrier and intermediate handlers to ensure a certification containing the
required information as set forth in this section is securely attached to the outside of the transport enclosure in a manner
that makes it easily readable and noticed.

**On 8-August-2022 Turkish Airlines transported 6 Boseron puppies on Flight 185 to O’Hare airport in Chicago as
checked baggage. The puppies with a birth date of 03/28/2022 were transported in 2 separate carriers each containing 3
puppies. It is the responsibility of the airline to ensure that no more than 2 puppies between the ages of 8 weeks and 6
months, weighing 20 pounds or less are transported in the same primary enclosure to provide sufficient space allowing for
normal postural movements.

Food and water requirements.
Six puppies traveled on Turkish Airlines flight TK 185 from Istanbul, Turkey to Chicago O’Hare (ORD) on 8/8/22. The
flight time was almost 12 hours when the aircraft arrived at 10:30 am at Chicago O’Hare per the Turkish Airlines
representative. The puppies were not offered water for the duration of the flight as they traveled in the cargo hold of the
Turkish Airlines aircraft. The Turkish Airlines (TK) representative was specifically asked what time the puppies had been
offered water after their arrival at O’Hare (ORD). The Turkish Airlines (TK) representative indicated the puppies had been
offered water just prior to 12:00 pm. According to this timeline, the puppies had not been offered water for approximately
13.5 hours. Inadequate access to water could result in the animals becoming dehydrated during transport. All dogs and
cats must be offered potable water at least once every 12 hours.

Food and water requirements.
**On 8-August-2022 Turkish Airlines transported 6 Boseron puppies on Flight 185 to O’Hare airport in Chicago as
checked baggage. At O’Hare, it was discovered that one of the primary enclosures used to transport the puppies did not
have food and water receptacles attached.
It is the responsibility of the airline to ensure that food and water receptacles are securely attached inside the primary
enclosure to allow access to food and water during transport without opening the door as set forth in this section.
