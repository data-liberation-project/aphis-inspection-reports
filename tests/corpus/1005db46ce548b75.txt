ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary Care: There was an enclosure with six live gerbils that appeared unthrifty housed with
three dead gerbils. The hair coats of the live gerbils were rough and dull. The animals appeared listless. No
treatment was being provided for these animals. Once APHIS officials identified the condition of the gerbils a facility
employee moved the live gerbils to a clean enclosure and gave them part of a potato. These animals were recently
weaned and may not have learned yet how to access water from the automatic water nipple. The animals started to
eat the potato and appeared more active. Prompt veterinary care may have prevented the death of the three
gerbils. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care as directed by the attending veterinarian for the health
and comfort of the animals. Correct by July 17, 2015.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(3) Veterinary Care: There was an enclosure with six gerbils that appeared unthrifty and listless with
three dead gerbils. There were two other enclosures with a dead gerbil with five live gerbils. There were five dead
Chinese hamsters found in five enclosures: three were housed alone and two were with a live Chinese hamster.
Once APHIS officials identified the effected enclosures, the employees moved each of the live animals to clean
enclosures. The facility employee taking care of the Chinese hamsters and gerbils informed the APHIS officials that
the animals were cleaned once a week and given food. The employee did not mention that the animals were
observed daily. Daily observations are either not being performed or are not being performed adequately as
evidenced by the unthrifty gerbils and dead animals found on this inspection. All animals must be observed daily
to access their health and well-being so that problems with animal health can be addressed by the attending
veterinarian in a timely manner. Correct from this day forward.
3.26(b) DIRECT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Section 3.26(b) Ventilation: The ventilation system for two rolling racks was not in use for 478 Chinese hamsters
and their offspring. These racks were designed to have the ventilation system running when animals are housed in
the plastic enclosures on the racks. The enclosures and racks were noted to have a buildup of condensation andhumidity. The food on top of the wire lids was wet and numerous enclosures had moldy feed. Once the APHIS
officials identified the effected enclosures, the licensee hooked up the ventilation system. The licensee must ensure
that hamsters are provided with adequate ventilation to provide for the health and comfort for the animals so that
enclosures do not have a buildup of humidity and condensation. Correct from this day forward.
3.29(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Section 3.29(a) Feeding: There were about 110 Chinese hamsters with their offspring housed in 55 enclosures with
either no food or wet/ moldy food. Hamsters must be provided with sufficient quantities of food that is free of
contamination to meet their normal daily requirements. Eating molding food may cause the hamsters to become ill.
No food may cause fighting and distress for the hamsters. Both conditions may result in death. The licensee must
ensure that sufficient quantities of wholesome uncontaminated food are provided to the hamsters to protect the
health of the animals. Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(2) DIRECT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(2) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: There were 30 Chinese hamsters with offspring
housed in 18 enclosures with excessively wet bedding and/or dirty bedding. The excessively wet and/or dirty
enclosures had little or no clean dry bedding for the hamsters for standing, nesting or burrowing. There were ten
Russian hamsters with offspring housed in five enclosures with excessively wet and dirty bedding. The excessively
wet enclosures had the hamsters standing on top of wet soiled bedding. There was no dry bedding for standing,
nesting or burrowing. Once APHIS officials identified the effected enclosures, employees moved each animal to
clean dry enclosures. Animals housed on wet bedding may become soiled, chilled and/or ill. The licensee must
ensure that the animals in wet and/or dirty enclosures are moved to clean dry enclosures to ensure the health and
comfort of the animals. Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(3)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(3) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: There were ten previously used guinea pig
enclosures with fresh bedding and hay ready to house new guinea pigs arriving at the facility. There was a buildup
of a white to brown roughened scale and debris in the corners, on the sides and around the bottom of the
enclosures. The cleaning process utilized does not seem effective in removing this buildup. Housing guinea pigs in
dirty and used enclosures exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral
diseases. The licensee must ensure that enclosures will be cleaned and sanitized prior to the introduction of guinea
pigs into previously occupied enclosures. Correct from this day forward.3.32
EMPLOYEES.
Section 3.32 Employees: At this facility one employee is primarily responsible for caring for the 562 Chinese
hamsters and 309 gerbils (See citation Section 3.132). During this inspection several direct non-compliances were
identified regarding the Chinese hamsters. Daily observations are not being done adequately, Chinese hamsters
were housed in enclosures on two racks without adequate ventilation, these hamsters had wet/moldy food or no
food, and hamsters were found in wet/dirty enclosures. These conditions pose a significant health risk to the
Chinese hamsters and are not within currently accepted husbandry standards. The significant failure to provide an
adequate level of care for these animals indicates that there is an insufficient number of employees to care for these
animals or that this employee is not sufficiently trained and/or supervised. The licensee must ensure that there are
a sufficient number of adequately trained employees present to care for the hamsters so that appropriate animal
health and husbandry are maintained. Correct by July 23, 2015.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(a) Cleaning of enclosures: There were about 150 gerbils in 18 enclosures with excessively wet
bedding and/or dirty bedding. The excessively wet enclosures had the gerbils standing on top of a wet pack of
bedding. There was no dry bedding for nesting or burrowing. Once APHIS officials identified the effected
enclosures, employees moved each animal to clean dry enclosures. Animals housed on wet dirty bedding may
become soiled, chilled and/or ill. The licensee must ensure that the animals in wet and/or dirty enclosures are
moved to clean dry enclosures to ensure the health and comfort of the animals. Correct from this day forward.

EMPLOYEES.
Section 3.132 Employees: At this facility one employee is primarily responsible for caring for the 562 Chinese
hamsters (See citation Section 3.32) and 309 gerbils. During this inspection several direct and indirect
non-compliances were identified regarding the gerbils. Daily observations are not being done adequately, gerbils
were not receiving adequate veterinary care, and gerbils were found in wet/dirty enclosures. These conditions pose
a significant health risk to the gerbils and are not within currently accepted husbandry standards. The significant
failure to provide an adequate level of care for these animals indicates that there is an insufficient number of
employees to care for these animals or that this employee is not sufficiently trained and/or supervised. The licensee
must ensure that there are a sufficient number of adequately trained employees present to care for the animals so
that appropriate animal health and husbandry are maintained. Correct by July 23, 2015.
