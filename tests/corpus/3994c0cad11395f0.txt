ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** One dog #20 had a patch of hair loss and an apparent injury just underneath the tail potentially a bite from the
cage mate. This dog should be isolated from the cage mate and treated appropriately for the injury after
consultation with the attending veterinarian.
*** Several of the cocker spaniels have dirty ears with a strong odor coming from the ear. The licensee has ear
cleaner but it does not seem to be effective or is not being used often enough. Dogs with longer ears like cocker
spaniels need to have their ears checked and cleaned on a routine basis to prevent potential ear infections. This
needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** Several of the dogs at the facility do not have official tags on them and cannot be identified. A few of the dogs
are micro chipped from a previous facility but the licensee does not have a reader that can be used for id purposes.
In addition there are no id numbers listed in the records of animals on hand. This needs to be addressed and the
dogs given official tags for id and record keeping purposes.

2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Several of the dogs at the facility have matted fur around the body and face. Once the fur becomes matted it
pulls and separates from the skin causing irritation and is an unnecessary discomfort for the dog. In addition several
dogs have long nails that are curling under which is also an unnecessary discomfort and the nails need to be
trimmed. Proper handling of animals includes grooming and trimming nails on a routine basis and as needed for the
comfort and safety of the dogs. Correct by: Sept 20, 2014
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
