* One male black and white colored Miniature Australian Shepherd ( No Identification) has a heavy coating of
dark brown matter on the cheek teeth on both sides of his mouth extending up into the gum line. The gums were
reddened and inflamed, and had a creamy white discharge at the gum line. The abnormal buildup of material on
teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. in addition, one upper cheek tooth on the right side
was loose and could be easily moved. It can be painful, lead to a decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth
affecting the health and well-being of the dog. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by the end of business November 19, 2014 and
have an appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and
provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care
at all times.

side of its upper neck / cheek area The wound approximately an inch in diameter was circular in shape, reddened
and moist looking and was hairless. The licensee stated that this was the first time the wound had been noticed.

3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An estimated one to two inch gap exists between the divider fencing and enclosure flooring in one enclosure.
The metal clips used to secure the fencing have torn through the bottom of the divider fencing thus creating the gap.
Four dogs are in contact with the affected area which is located in shelter housing. This affects the ability of the
enclosure fencing to contain the dogs securely and could lead to potential injury.
*************************
* An estimated five to six inch gap exists between the enclosure fencing and the enclosure frame on one
enclosure. One dog is in contact with the affected fencing located in outdoor housing. It can lead to potential injury
causing stress or discomfort if the dogs get caught in the gap area.
*************************
* One wire gate does not close securely against enclosure fencing. An estimated one to two inch gap exists when
the dogs jump on the enclosure gate. Two dogs are in contact with the affected gate located in shelter housing.
The potential for injury exists causing stress and discomfort if any dog gets caught in the gap area.
The licensee must ensure all enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals form injury and contain the
animals securely at all times.

must repair or replace all surfaces that can not be readily cleaned and sanitized when worn. Correct by 12/1/14.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
* There is a brownish looking greasy substance coating four metal door food receptacles used by eight dogs. The
brownish substance is covering an estimated 30 to 50 percent of the surface area of the receptacle. Lack of
cleaning and sanitization of the receptacles could promote bacteria growth and other disease causing agents which
could increase the risk of contamination of the feed. The nutritive value could be affected if the feed becomes
spoiled or contaminated. This could potentially lead to health risks for the dogs. The licensee must ensure all food
receptacles are kept clean and sanitized at all times for the health and well-being of the dogs. Correct by 12/1/14.
