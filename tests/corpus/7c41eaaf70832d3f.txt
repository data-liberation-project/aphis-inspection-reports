FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The large deer enclosure has a shelter that is falling apart. Large pieces of broken wood and a large piece of the
roof with shingles on it are lying on the ground. One of the pieces of wood appears to have nails protruding from it. It
is possible the deer could step on, or ingest, pieces of the wood or shingles and cause injury to themselves. All
shelters must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

WATERING.
***Both of the self-waterers in the deer enclosure and the one self-waterer in the buffalo enclosure had a layer of
grime and algae on the bottom of the water pans. Infrequent cleaning of water receptacles can lead to water that
can contaminate and harm the animals. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.
