3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fourteen perimeter enclosures in use in the "whelping building" housing thirty dogs, and the forty nine
enclosures in use of the other two raised enclosure buildings housing seventy three dogs, for a total of sixty three
enclosures housing one hundred three dogs, have a greasy brown build-up on the dog doors and the walls
surrounding the doors. Approximately half or more of the surface area of each of the doors, and the walls to the
bottom and sides of the doors, since the doors open upwards ,have the greasy brown build-up. The licensee stated
that she has fallen behind on cleaning and is working on "shearing" the dogs and plans to start cleaning the week of
August 24, 2015 and it could take her several weeks to get the cleaning caught up. A build-up of organic material
can harbor disease and attract pests. The licensee must clean the surfaces that the dogs come in contact in
accordance with 3.11(b) of this subpart.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
