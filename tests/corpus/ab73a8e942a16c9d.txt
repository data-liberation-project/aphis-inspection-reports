3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are at least two enclosures with wood supports that have been chewed so that there is a rough, jagged
surface exposed. Rough, dry chewed wood is unable to be adequately cleaned and sanitized which can play a role
in disease transmission. The licensee must maintain all surfaces of housing facilities so that they can be readily
cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 7 July 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The corner of coated metal flooring in one enclosure has been turned up and has two metal points exposed.
Exposed metal points can cause injury. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed so
that they do not have sharp points or edges that could cause injury. To be corrected by 14 May 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
