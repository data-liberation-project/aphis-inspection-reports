3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence along the back side of the facility is no longer the required 8 feet in height in 2 areas. This is
the result of vines and tree branches growning onto the top of the fence and pushing it down. There is also one
area on the front side of the perimeter fence (near the barn) that is also not 8 feet high due to a small tree branch
that fell on it.
The vines, tree limbs and other debris shall be cleared away from the fenceline to facilitate its' inspection and to
ensure that the entire fenceline remains 8 feet high.
The perimeter fence shall be 8 feet at the non compliant areas.
