3.50(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In rabbit barns 1 & 3, uncovered light bulbs are hung over a portion of the rabbit enclosures, particularly over food
receptacles. The fluorescent lights in Barn 8 have been covered with a plastic sleeve in case of breakage. In the
event of breakage, rabbits could be injured by shattered glass. A system should be in place to ensure light sources
in animal facilities are maintained in a manner that doesn't pose a risk to the animals.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to
protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.
3.51(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In Barn #1, 30% of the older rabbit enclosures are moderately covered in rust. The presence of rust may prevent the
required cleaning and sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the
animals.
The facility is currently replacing rabbit primary enclosures, food receptacles, wood beams, and other structures. It
was noted that two barns were completed last year and only one barn of research animals (#1) still has rusty
enclosures. The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that
they are substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.
3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In approximately 10-20% of the older cages in Barn 1, the wire floor of the cage is damaged, with rusty sharp points
protruding into the primary enclosure and creating holes in the floor. The floors of the primary enclosures shall be
constructed so as to protect the rabbits' feet and legs from injury, and a system of maintenance shall ensure that the
enclosures are kept in accordance with the regulations.
The facility acquired new cages and is in the process of replacing the older cages, with two barns (8 & 3) completedand the last research barn, #1, scheduled to be completed within 3 months.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Barn 1 has a variety of older enclosures of various sizes. When asked, the facility representative believes all
enclosures were acquired after 1990.
In a row of enclosures providing 10 ft square of space, there were 24 enclosures with 6 rabbits, on average 4.5 lbs
weaned earlier in the day (rabbits weigh at least 4.3 lbs before weaning per facility) in preparation for shipment
tomorrow. Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 ft square of space, so a maximum of 3 rabbits over 4.4
lbs can be housed in an enclosure providing 10 ft square, or 6 rabbits all less than 4.4 lbs.
Facility has been working to meet the space requirement, and all enclosures in Barn 8 and Barn 3 for research
rabbits now meet the space requirements.
Adequate floor space in primary enclosures is essential in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the
rabbits. Overcrowding can result in stress, disease, and injury. Primary enclosures should be measured and the
rabbits weighed so that rabbits can be redistributed into housing where they have adequate floor space and suitable
companions.
