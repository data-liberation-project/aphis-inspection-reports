ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Female brown and white Shih-Tzu (#71) was found with a reddish-purple, fluid-filled swelling between the toes of
the right front and right rear feet. There was a small amount of reddish-clear discharge from this mass on the right
front, the mass on the right rear appeared to have ruptured and had no obvious discharge. The mouth of this dog
had excessive tartar, gum recession, and reddened gum lines mostly noticeable on the left side of the mouth. The
licensee immediately began treatment on the feet according to his written plan of veterinary care. Failure to
provide timely treatment for medical conditions can lead to pain and suffering in the animals. Correct this by
contacting your attending veterinarian and following the guidance that is provided for both the feet and future dental
treatment.
