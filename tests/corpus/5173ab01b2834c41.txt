EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The kennel facility consists of one indoor housing building. Over time the dealer has had multiple small breeds.
The dealer is now raising mainly French Bulldogs and Wirehair Jack Russell Terriers. During the inspection the
kennel contained twenty-two adults. The raised wire enclosures located in the center of the animal housing room
was measured and showed they provide eight squire feet. Six of the contained animals were measured and five
showed they did not have the required exercise space. The affected animals are the following:
Affected Animal required sq ft available sq ft
French Bulldog # 0A01260766 9 8

French Bulldog # 4B7B4D4E79 10 8
French Bulldog # 487E225F42 10 8

The dealer must insure all of the individually contained animals have two times the required floor space for exercise
to provide for their health and welfare.
