2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A yearling female red deer was observed to be emaciated, weak and depressed during this inspection. Muscle
atrophy was obvious in both hind legs. The hooves were overgrown on all four feet contributing to an abnormal gait
and standing posture noted in this animal. The licensee stated that this animal had been sick for at least 2 weeks
and that his veterinarian had been notified but not yet seen the animal.
Each exhibitor must maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent,
diagnose and treat diseases and injuries and timely medical intervention. This deer appears to be critically ill and
must be examined by a veterinarian today.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Recently a female red kangaroo had a front leg amputated because of injuries sustained from a dog attack. A pet
dog was able to reach the kangaroo through the primary enclosure fence. This animal was subsequently found
dead approximately 10 days after surgery. The cause of death was unknown. Primary enclosures must be
appropriate for the species involved and constructed to protect the animals from injury. Correct by:
Immediately.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The kangaroo, woodchuck, porcupine, prairie dog, coati and cavy enclosures are not completely surrounded on all
four sides by a perimeter fence at least six feet high. Three sides are constructed of 8 foot high fencing but the
fencing on the fourth (back) side is only four feet high. This non-complaince remains uncorrected from two previous
inspections and was first cited on February 28, 2013.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
