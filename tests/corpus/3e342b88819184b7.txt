2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were no records of the current number of guinea pigs on hand at the facility. Records containing the required
information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired, and
disposed of are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to identify animal losses through death
or disease in the facility that affects the number of offspring born and raised. Correct by March 11, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager.
