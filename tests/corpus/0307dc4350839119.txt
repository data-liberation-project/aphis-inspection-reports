ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three hedgehogs are in need of veterinary care.
*The female hedgehog (#7) cinnamon and snow in color was noted scratching excessively. Her skin along her sides
and on the outer rear legs appeared reddened.
*The female hedgehog (#14) brown and white in color also had reddened skin on her abdomen, sides and legs.
*The female hedgehog (#70) albino in color was missing quills and her body condition appeared thin.
Several skin problems are commonly seen in hedgehogs. These three hedgehogs need to be evaluated by a
veterinarian to ensure a correct diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment instituted.
Correct by 7/30/31.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Multiple hedgehogs were purchased from a breeder who was getting out of the hedgehog breeding business. The
records included the date of purchase, the number of animals purchased and the person's name but did not include
the address or USDA number for the individual (or drivers license number/state and vehicle number/state if not
licensed). The facility shall make, keep and maintain records which fully disclose all the required information
concerning animals purchased or otherwise acquired. Correct by 8/15/17.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The water bottles in several cages are leaking. At least three enclosures were noted to have bedding (shavings)
completely wet/soaked and others were partially soaked. In one enclosure (#7) the female and her young were
moving around constantly as if they couldn't find a comfortable place to sleep. The female was noted to have
reddened skin and was scratching. Living on wet shavings is uncomfortable to the animals and may lead to skin
issues. Large amounts of water leakage/accumulation can lead to injury or death. The owner reports that the facility
has been working on designing a different type of water bottle system and that they plan to switch to it. The waterbottles needs to be repaired or replaced and all wet bedding needs to be replaced with dry bedding.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Several housekeeping items still need attention in the new hedgehog room:
*There is a large build up of cobwebs, dust and grime on the the walls, the ceiling components directly over the
enclosures and the fans.
*Insulation is protruding from the junction of the ceiling and outside wall directly over the top shelf holding open
enclosures. Insulation could fall into the enclosures.
*The stacked materials in the room including the feed and bedding containers are dirty on the outside.
*There are bird cages in the same room and a large amount of bird food debris and other debris has built up on the
floor under and around the bird cages.
This dust and debris may attract pests into the room and may contribute to spread of disease.
The hedgehog room shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the hedgehogs from injury and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owner.
