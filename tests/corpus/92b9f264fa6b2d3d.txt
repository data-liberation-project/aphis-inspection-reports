2.76(a)(4)

Records: Operators of auction sales and brokers.
During both the September and November 2022 exotic auctions the records made and kept were not complete as they
did not include the driver's license number and state and the vehicle license number and state of multiple persons
consigning animals who are not licensed under the Animal Welfare Act.
During the September 2022 auction this included the following individuals: WB who consigned ten hedgehogs (tags 1211-
1220) SC who consigned eight guinea pigs and seven ferrets (tags 394-403), SH who consigned three chinchillas (tag
6508), RR who consigned six hedgehogs (tags 029-030) and RW who consigned two chinchillas (tag 172). During the
November 2022 auction this included LK who consigned two cavies (tag 74, 75), one kangaroo (tag 4238) and one camel
(tag 4236).
Accurate and complete records are necessary to provide information regarding animal ownership and identification. The
auction operator shall make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose all the required information
including the driver's license number and state and vehicle license number and state of the persons consigning animals
who are not licensed under the AWA. Correct by Dec. 1, 2022.
2.132(d) Repeat

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.


Review of the November 2022 auction records shows that LK consigned and sold the following animals without a valid
USDA license: two female Patagonian cavies (tag 74, 75), one male red kangaroo (tag 4238) and one four year old white
bull camel (tag4236). This consignor did not hold a current, valid USDA license under the Animal Welfare Act as required
to sell these exotic animals. No one time exemption was noted on file. The auction facility may not consign any animal
from a person required to be licensed but who does not hold a current valid unsuspended license.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
