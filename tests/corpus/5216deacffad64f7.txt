FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Heating. The ambient temperature recorded in the middle of the room was 52.3 degrees F. at time of this
inspection. Guinea pigs were huddled in corners during this inspection. The outside temperature was 37 degrees
Fahrenheit. There was no heater present inside the room at the beginning of this inspection. Licensee brought a
propane tank with burners into the room, but she could not start the heater.
The ambient temperature shall not be allowed to fall below 60 [deg]F. nor to exceed 85 [deg]F in rooms housing
guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are very sensitive to drafts and changes in temperature. Animals may become ill if
temperature is not closely monitored and kept between 60-85 degrees Fahrenheit. The licensee must ensure that
the temperature is maintained at acceptable levels throughout the entire facility regardless of changing conditions
outside. A reliable heater must be provided to prevent ambient temperature falling below 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Correct from this day forward.
3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are still guinea pig enclosures with broken and/or detached wire on the doors. The following enclosures are
in need of repair:
1) Enclosure # 10 housing 10 adult guinea pigs and their offspring has large holes and broken wire on the front door
next to the self-feeder.
2) Enclosure # 11 housing 30 weaned guinea pigs has large holes and broken wire on the front door .
3) Enclosure # 15 housing 8 adult guinea pigs and their offspring has large holes, broken wire, and wire pushed
inwards on the front door.
4) Enclosure # 16 housing 15 adult guinea pigs and their offspring has holes and broken wire on the front door.
5) Enclosure # 30 housing 9 adult guinea pigs and their offspring has a detached front door with a 3 inch gap
between the front door and the enclosure frame.
All enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.The above enclosures must be repaired or replaced to prevent the guinea pigs from getting injured from broken
wire, holes in wire doors, or from falling out of enclosures. Licensee must ensure enclosures and structurally and
maintained in good repair.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is a heavy buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the floors and sides of enclosures. Majority of the
floors have fecal material consolidated in a moist fecal pad on the floor especially by the self-feeders and by the
water source. The accumulation of debris, feces, and wet bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections
with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures are clean and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, wet bedding, and debris. Additionally, ensure that the primary
enclosures are sanitized at least every two weeks. Correct by December 8, 2018.
