2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC reviewed the animal use facility and program on 10 October 2013 and then again on 24 April 2014. The
IACUC did not send a report of its evaluation to the Institutional Official for review at the time of the October 2013
review. This information was sent to the Institutional Official on 22 May 2014, at the same time as the most recent
review. The IACUC must communicate timely and accurate information to the Institutional Official who is ultimately
responsible for the appropriate care and use of animals in regulated activities at the institution. Without timely
receipt of these reports, the Institutional Official may not be aware of the activities of the IACUC and the conditions
of the animals and facilities. The IACUC must prepare and submit reports of its evaluations conducted as required
by paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section to the Institutional Official of the research facility. These reports must be
updated at least once every six months upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations. To be corrected
with the next review of the animal use facility and program.
2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC approved protocol 13-022 calls for the use of approximately 10 animals but does not contain a rationale for
the numbers of animals to be used in this activity. Protocols require a rationale for the numbers of animals to be
used in order to prevent the unnecessary use of animals in research. The IACUC must ensure all principal
investigators provide a rationale for the numbers of animals to be used. To be corrected by 16 June 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC Chairperson.
