FEEDING.
***There are open cardboard boxes with fruits and vegetables in them both in the kitchen and outside. It was a rainy
day and the cats were noted resting in the boxes of food and some of the boxes outside were uncovered. Food
should be kept free from contamination. Cats that roam free may carry fomites or disease that could potentially
contaminate food. Food exposed to the inclement weather can lose their nutrient value or spoil. A method to prevent
contamination of food from the cats and inclement weather must be established. Correct December 5, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
