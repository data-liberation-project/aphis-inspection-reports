3.6(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
One adult female Doberman pinscher has an outdoor, primary enclosure run with damaged areas in the chain link
material. There are two damaged areas, measuring 8-12" wide by ~6" tall. Some of the broken chain link wires are sharp
and/or pointed inward so that an animal could come into contact with them.
Broken wires can cause injury to animals. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and
maintained so that they have no sharp points or other surfaces that could injure the animals; the enclosures must contain
the dogs securely and prevent the entrance of other animals.

3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
A wooden primary enclosure housing three adult and five newborn guinea pigs has interior surfaces where the impervious
coating is peeled off, revealing unsealed wood that is damp in some places. Unsealed materials are not impervious to
moisture and therefore cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized; they also absorb liquids and can be a source of
mold/mildew, strong odors and a harbor for harmful microorganisms that can cause illness in the animals.
The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are maintained in good repair and that they are constructed of smooth


material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture.

3.28(c)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
There are three dwarf hamsters and nine Syrian hamsters housed in a total of five drawer-type enclosures, each
measuring approximately 4.5" in height. The insufficient height of these enclosures can prevent the animals from
performing their full range of normal movements, which can lead to inadequate exercise, discomfort, stress, and
incompatibility.
The licensee must ensure that the primary enclosure height for all hamsters is at least 6".
