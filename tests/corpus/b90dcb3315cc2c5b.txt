FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were approximately five rebar (steel) stakes each protruding about 1 foot above the ground in one section of
the bear enclosure. A facility manager stated that these stakes were placed in the ground about 3 months ago and
remain from an unfinished project. Steel stakes which are protruding upright in the ground and located in an area
within contact of the animals may potentially cause injury or harm the animals. Housing facilities for the animals
shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals. A system of timely facility maintenance and repair must be in place to ensure the health and well- being of
the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was an opening or gap along the bottom of an approximate 4 ft. long section of the perimeter, chain link fence
surrounding the bear enclosure. The opening has resulted from a separation of the fence from the bottom support
bar. An opening or gap of this size may potentially permit animals or unauthorized persons entry into the facility and
contact with the animals. All areas of the perimeter fencing should be repaired for the protection and well-being of
the animals. Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they protect the animals in the facility by restricting
animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
