2.31(d)(1)(8)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An adverse event was reported in the February 18, 2014 IACUC minutes. Two animals (30789 and 30790) suffered
burns from an electric heating pad used during a procedure. Other animals that underwent the same procedure on
the same day were unaffected. Both affected animals were treated by the facility veterinarians; one was allowed to
heal by secondary intention, the other required more extensive treatment including surgical debridement. Both
animals made a full recovery.
Policy at the time of the event recommended the use of circulating water heating pads or Bair Hugger® forced air
heating pads for thermal support of anesthetized animals, and discouraged use of electric heating pads. The facility
representatives were not sure if the Primary Investigator (PI) was trained on this issue. The IACUC was unaware of
the use of electric heating pads in the animal labs because the researchers did not store them in the lab, but
brought them in only when the procedures were taking place. Therefore, the items were not present during
inspections of the lab.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by making two policy changes. First, the thermal support policy
was changed so that the use of electric heating pads was not just discouraged, but banned. Second, all equipment
that will be used in animal work must be made available for inspection and will be inspected by the IACUC. All
personnel from all labs have been retrained according to the new policies. The facility needs to ensure all
employees are trained on current policies.
The inspection was conducted on 7/29-30/2014 and was accompanied by the NHP Project Resource Veterinarian,
animal area personnel, and IACUC office personnel.
The exit briefing was held on 7/30/2014 with facility veterinarians and IACUC office personnel.
