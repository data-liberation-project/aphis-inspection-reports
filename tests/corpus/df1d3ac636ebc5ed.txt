2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The inspector reviewed Protocol 3738 and six medical records relevant to this protocol The protocol states that
"animals will receive .005-.01 mg/kg of buprenorphine IM once a day for 3 days post-operatively. All animals will
receive antibiotics pre-operatively (3-5 mg/kg of Cefazolin IV and post-operatively 3-5 mg/kg of ceftiofur IM twice a
day for 3 days)". None of the animals received the drugs as specified in the protocol but better, longer- acting pain
medications: a sustained release opiod, a sustained release NSAID (Meloxicam) and Enrofloxacin (Baytril)
antibiotic were used with veterinary discretion to minimize the stress from handling and restraint necessary to
medicate the pigs post-operatively. This significant change regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing
activities was not brought to the attention of the IACUC after the Attending Veterinarian administered the drug
regimen after the first pig’s surgery. It is the IACUC’s responsibility to review and approve, require modifications in
to secure approval or withhold approval of proposed significant changes to a protocol in order to ensure that animal
care and use are in accordance with legal requirements. Correct by seeking IACUC approval for significant changes
to a protocol.
Correct from this day forward.
