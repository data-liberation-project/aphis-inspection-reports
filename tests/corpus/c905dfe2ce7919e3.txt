3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although
an 8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, several mature trees remain within 3 feet of the
perimeter fence that have no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the perimeter
fence. A substantial perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required
for all outdoor housing facilities that contain potentially dangerous animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals
in the facility by ensuring in the event of an accidental escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to
prevent the animal from leaving the property and endangering public safety thereby placing the animal's life in
jeopardy. Correct by removing or altering trees in a manner ensuring the perimeter fence can adequately function
as a secondary containment system.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED.
