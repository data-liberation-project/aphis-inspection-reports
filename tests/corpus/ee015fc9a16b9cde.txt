ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The licensee does not have a written primate enrichment program for the marmoset currently on exhibit and
individually housed at the facility. An envornmental enhancement program is followed by the licensee but the plan
has not been documented or approved by the attending veterinarian.
To ensure adequate provisions are in place to promote the psychological well-being of non-human primates at the
facility an enrichment plan must be developed, documented, followed and approved by the attending veterinarian.
Special considerations must be included in the plan for individually housed non-human primates that are unable to
see or hear other non-human primates of their own or compatible species.
