PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Training of personnel.
(1) In March 2015 it was discovered during a routine review of records and documents kept in the surgical area that
in November 2014 the injectable pre-anesthetic, administered to 3 pigs prior to the maintenance inhalant anesthetic,
was almost 6 months beyond the medication'(cid:25)s use by date. A review of the anesthesia monitoring records for the
animals showed that there were no adverse effects on the animals as a result of the use of the outdated
pre-anesthetic.
Upon being notified by veterinary services staff and in response to this incident, the IACUC determined that a
member of the veterinary technical staff had mixed the medication correctly but had not labeled the bottle of
pre-anesthetic with the date of reconstitution and the use by date, and had subsequently administered the outdated
pre-anesthetic to the 3 pigs.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all personnel involved in the anesthesia of animals should be qualified and
appropriately trained in the proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers for the species of animals that
the personnel will be working with.
The IACUC acted promptly to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and
USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions
included but were not limited to providing all veterinary technical staff with additional training on proper drug
handling and use, adding drug handling and use to ongoing annual training requirements, and implementing new
recordkeeping requirements.

MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
(1) On 10/31/15 a rabbit underwent a routine procedure under sedation and local anesthesia during which the
animal moved and vocalized. The procedure was halted to allow additional time for the local anesthetic to take full
effect then the procedure was completed and the rabbit was returned to its enclosure. No lameness or other
abnormality were observed in the rabbit at the conclusion of the procedure or after it was back in its enclosure. The
following day the rabbit was noted to have difficulty moving and was immediately examined by veterinary staff who
determined the animal had paralysis and had no deep pain perception in both hind legs. Spinal fracture was
diagnosed and the rabbit was euthanized.
The incident was reported to the IACUC by veterinary technical staff and an investigation was conducted. Although
it could not be determined exactly how the spinal fracture happened, the IACUC concluded that it most likely
happened during the routine procedure or when the rabbit was returned to its enclosure.
Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The IACUC acted promptly to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and
USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions
included provided re-training of personnel in the restraint and handling of rabbits. No additional incidents have
occurred.
Item (1) has been corrected.
(2) During the inspection of investigator laboratory space, laboratory personnel described the steps taken when the
animals are brought to the laboratory. They stated that the gerbils (contained in an appropriate primary enclosure)
are placed inside a cabinet for several minutes following the administration of injectable anesthetic while the drugs
take effect. There were a variety of laboratory items stored inside the cabinet including containers of chemicals,
gallon bottles of solutions, glassware, and other miscellaneous supplies.
Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause behavioral stress or unnecessary discomfort. It is not appropriate to place enclosures containing animalsinside cabinets that are being used to store equipment and supplies. Animals should be housed in areas of the
facility designated for animal housing that are kept neat and free of clutter, equipment and stored materials.
Item (2) was corrected prior to the end of inspection by the IACUC requiring the investigator to immediately
discontinue the practice of placing gerbils inside the cabinet while the anesthetic drugs take effect and to put the
animals in an area of the laboratory space designated and appropriately maintained for the temporary housing of
animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Indoor housing.
(1) On 7/9/14 facility personnel discovered a ferret dead in its enclosure and its cage mate was noted to be in
respiratory distress. Veterinary staff immediately evaluated the ferret that was in respiratory distress and
euthanized the animal. Upon being notified by veterinary services staff and in response to this incident, the IACUC
determined that the bottom latch on the enclosure door had been properly secured but the top latch had not
engaged. The failure of the door to be securely latched allowed the 2 ferrets to try to squeeze out of the partially
latched door of the enclosure resulting in pulmonary damage in both ferrets.
Per this Section of the Regulations, indoor housing facilities should contain the animals and protect them from
injury.
The IACUC acted promptly to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and
USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions
included modifying standard operating procedures (SOPs) pertaining to ferret caging, re-training of staff on the
modified SOPs, and replacement of all ferret caging at the institution with a type of caging that had a different
latching system.
This item has been corrected.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 4/14/15 thru 4/16/15. Exit interview held 4/16/15 on-site with facility representatives.
