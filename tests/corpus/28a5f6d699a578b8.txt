ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection the female lynx was observed being totally non- weight bearing on the right foreleg. There
was no documentation of what happened and what was initially done, until it was written down during this
inspection.
The licensee states the two Siberian lynx were separated due to a fight during a breeding attempt 3 days ago. The
owner was out of town but told her husband to separate the cats which he did. Then he noticed the female cat had
a swollen right paw. When the owner returned two days after the injury, she examined the paw and stated she
could not find any wounds, and she started the lynx on antibiotics which she had for one of her dogs. The owner
states the swelling is improved and that the cat is acting normally besides being totally non-weight bearing on the
right front leg.
When an animal is injured the attending veterinarian is to be consulted so that appropriate veterinary care can be
provided on a timely basis. This is to prevent unnecessary suffering and pain. The veterinarian should have been
called as soon as it was observed the animal was injured and needed medical examination and treatment. Even
after starting antibiotics, the licensee did not consult with the veterinarian to tell him the lynx is still non weight
bearing after 3 days. The lynx may need additional treatments. The veterinarian was notified during this inspection
and the licensee is waiting for a return call. To be corrected by 3-9-16.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
