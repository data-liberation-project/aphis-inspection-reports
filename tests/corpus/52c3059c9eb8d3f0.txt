Housing facilities, general.
There is loose dog food kibble on the floor behind the palate food bags are stacked on and there are rodent feces mixed
in. One bag, where the majority of the loose food and feces in located, has a corner chewed out of it. The licensee stated
that some of the bags had rips in them when they were delivered which caused food to fall on the floor around the storage
palate and may have attacked the rodents to enter the building.
The presence rodents and other vermin in facilities and food storage areas leads to contamination of the area with their
feces and urine which may contain infectious organisms that can cause illness in dogs. Supplies of food must be stored
in a manner that protects the supplies from contamination and vermin infestation. The loose food and fecal material was
cleaned up at the time of inspection and the open bag was disposed of.
