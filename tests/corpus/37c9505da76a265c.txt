Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

veterinary care documenting this arrangement. A written program of veterinary care is important for ensuring that
adequate veterinary care is provided for the animals on site. Correct by February 10th, 2021, by documenting a written
program of veterinary care in collaboration with the attending veterinarian.

Primary enclosures.
Within two primary enclosures housing 3 ringtail lemurs and one ringtail lemur respectively, wooden boards along the
enclosure flooring are decaying and have jagged edges. Housing structures in disrepair could cause harm to the animals
if not well-maintained. Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they have no
sharp points or edges that could injure the nonhuman primates.

Sanitation.
There were rodent droppings on the floor in the feed storage room and on the floor of one lemur enclosure. Pests such as
rodents can spread disease and contaminate stored food or bedding. Correct by maintaining an effective program to
