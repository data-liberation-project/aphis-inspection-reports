2.31(d)(8) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On August 9th 2021, a Yorkshire pig # Y306 was administered a contrast agent during a study related MRI and died soon
after. The facility’s internal investigation concluded that the most likely cause of death was a severe allergic reaction to the
contrast agent. The contrast agent in question was not included in the approved protocol for this study and the Principal
Investigator had not submitted an amendment to the IACUC for this change. Without thorough IACUC review and
approval of all aspects of study related procedures, safe and judicious use of animals cannot be guaranteed. Proposed
activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be subject to
further appropriate review and approval by officials of the research facility. However, those officials may not approve an
activity involving the care and use of animals if it has not been approved by the IACUC.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
