2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
The 10/24/2019 meeting minutes described an incident where a Rhesus Macaque escaped from his enrichment cage into
the main animal room. The room was composed of 6 cages housing other Rhesus Macaques. The escaped animal bit the
finger of another through the cage door resulting in a fractured digit. The bitten animal was anesthetized, and the digit was
amputated. Following surgery and treatment, the animal healed without complications. The escaped macaque voluntarily
returned to its home cage and was found to only have minor abrasions that did not warrant treatment. Upon further
investigation, the facility found all latches and locks to be functional, therefore concluding that the exterior latch on the
enrichment cage might not have been fully engaged allowing the animal to force it open. The inappropriate containment
within the enrichment cage did not allow for safe handling of the animal and further resulted in serious injury to another.
Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm.
This item was corrected prior to this inspection. Corrective actions and preventative measures were implemented.
2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
In the last three semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official (IO), there were multiple minor deficiencies noted from the
facility review. Many of the deficiencies were not assigned a specific plan for correction, nor a scheduled date of


correction. All that was provided was the date the deficiency was corrected. Without a specific plan or scheduled date of
correction on the report, the IO is not informed on how the deficiencies will be corrected and cannot verify that correction
was completed on time. All reports to the Institutional Official must identify departures from the regulations or standards,
and provide a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
To be corrected by December 2020.
2.31(e)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals to be used is not given for the following protocols:
o Protocol # 2013-0525
o Protocol # 2008-0086
o Protocol # 2020-1024
The Principal Investigator proposing animal activity shall provide a rationale for the number of animals to be used for
review and approval by the IACUC. By not providing a rationale, an unnecessary amount of animals may be used for
covered activity. Protocols must contain a rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals to be used.
To be corrected by December 1st 2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
