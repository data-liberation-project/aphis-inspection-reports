2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Two bottles of Tramadol tablets with an expiration date of 7/2017 and one bottle of Dopram with expiration date of
7/1/2017 were found during the inspection in the safe and on the drug shelf respectively. The Dopram bottle was
immediately disposed of and the Tramadol tablets were marked expired and moved to the expired medication
portion of the drug safe. Expired medications may have compromised efficacy and potency and use of such does
not constitute adequate veterinary care. The facility needs to ensure that medications are not being used past their
expiration date. Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
