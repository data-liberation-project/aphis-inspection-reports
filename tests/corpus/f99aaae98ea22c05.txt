2.33(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Two sheep housed in the Veterinary Teaching Sheep Barn required medical assessment:
- Ewe MT24 was observed limping and shifting weight off of the right rear leg when standing.
- Ewe CMP01 was underweight. The loin area appears to be shallow under the transverse processes of the spine due to
lack of fat.
There are no records showing that either issue has been observed by caretakers or reported to the veterinary staff.
Failure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a veterinarian can result in prolonged
medical conditions and ongoing pain. A facility representative must observe all animals daily and then ensure a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems
of health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed. These animals were assessed by a veterinarian at the time of
inspection.
3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On Saturday, April 30th, 2022, animal care staff found a fallen tarp in one of the bat rooms which resulted in the death of
16 bats and the euthanasia of an additional 4 bats. The tarp had been changed on Thursday as part of routine cleaning


and hung across a metal bar with binder clips holding the edges closed. The facility staff stated that this is how the tarps
are normally arranged and they suspect that the tarp slipped due to the weight of bats roosting on one side.
Failure to properly secure structures within an enclosure can lead to injury and even death of the animals. The housing
facility for the bats must be structurally sound and constructed in a way that protects the animals within from injury.
To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
