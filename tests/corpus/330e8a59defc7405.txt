HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The plastic containers in the main animal area containing the fruit and vegetables used in the non human primates'
diet were found to contain deteriorated food that had attracted a number of flies. A un-refrigerated yogurt was also
seen in the food prep area. These fruits and vegetables must be kept in a manner to prevent spoilage and
infestation of pests. Any dairy products requiring refrigeration must be put back in a timely manner. The feeding of
spoiled food can cause the animals to become ill. The food provided must be nutritious and stored in an acceptable
manner.
