2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An approximately 13 year old, reindeer steer, named “Dumas,” was lame on the left hind limb. While standing in
the enclosure, the reindeer alternated between standing with both hind limbs tucked underneath his body and being
non-weight bearing on the left hind limb. At the walk and trot, when the reindeer placed his left hind limb on the
ground, he would shift his body weight onto his other three limbs, creating a “hopping” movement to his gait. The
licensee stated that he had first noticed the lameness yesterday evening. The reindeer had not been given any
medication by the licensee to address the lameness and he had not notified his veterinarian about the issue. The
licensee stated that his veterinarian was located several hours away near his home site location, and he did not
have a veterinarian in the area.
***An approximately 10 year old, female, reindeer, named “Comet,” appeared to be standing uncomfortably in the
enclosure. She was constantly shifting her weight between different limbs while standing. Additionally, she would
raise different limbs off of the ground for periods of time while at rest.
Lameness and non-weight bearing is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes
including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis
and treatment of this lameness can result in delays of appropriate care. Injuries, diseases, and medical conditions
that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be worsened and can lead to prolonged suffering.
The licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by
a veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the licensee must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the
animals at the facility. The licensee was notified verbally that he must have both reindeer examined by a
veterinarian by no later than 5:00pm on December 4, 2017 to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment
plans to address the soundness issues cited above.
The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation
should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by
the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions and entries on a log and/or calendarand/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animal. There should also be an
entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each animal at that point, to indicate
a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the need for follow-up and any
further veterinary care prescribed.
Additionally, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as
described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate
veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and
injuries.
