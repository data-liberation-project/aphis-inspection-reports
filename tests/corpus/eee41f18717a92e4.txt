3.6(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The outdoor enclosures of the sheltered housing facility are constructed of metal fencing and metal gates. At least 5
enclosures housing approximately 10 dogs have rusted spots on the metal frames. In 3 enclosures, the entire vertical end
of the frame has rusted off leaving protruding sharp edges. In the other places, the round pipes that form the frames have
rusted away leaving irregular holes two to three inches wide in several spots.
The rusted areas on these frames weaken the structural integrity of the dividers. In addition, the broken ends create sharp
edges that could injure the dogs.
Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable material so that they are structurally sound. The
primary enclosures must be kept in good repair to ensure that the animals are kept safe and contained securely.
