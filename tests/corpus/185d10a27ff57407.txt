3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the larger indoor kennel building, an elevated bank of cages had an excessive accumulation of hair on the
bottoms and sides of several enclosures. Some of the hair was coated with a layer of grease and grime. This is a
potential source of contamination to the enclosed animals. These cages must be cleaned, and need to be cleaned
more frequently to prevent this buildup of hair and debris.
