2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One plastic bottle containing a brownish looking fluid has no written directions for how and at what rate this drug
is to be administered. This drug is intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and is
therefore ready for use. The licensee stated that the contents in the bottle were an Albon mix. Medications must be
labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents and dosage rates of the
container can be known with certainty and not used past their expiration date. The licensee must ensure that all
medications are labeled with dosing instructions specific for the species of the animal being treated.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* There was no record of inventory present on "unweaned" puppies born at the facility. No inventory information
was attached to four enclosures containing 19 "unweaned" puppies. If any puppy born on the premise has been
recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the enclosure must have the following information attached to it:
dealer's USDA license number, the letters (cid:28) USDA (cid:28) and the number identifying each puppy in that litter. If no
offspring have been recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the following information must be recorded and
attached to the enclosure. The dealer's USDA number, the number identifying each puppy, the date of birth of the
litter, the dam's ID number, a description of each puppy ( breed, sex, color and any distinctive markings ). The
inventory information records must be maintained with all corresponding 7006's for one year. If the licensee
chooses to identify the "unweaned" puppies with official USDA identification ( collar, tattoo or microchip ), then no
inventory information is required on the enclosure. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure that
every puppy's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The licensee must
maintain complete and accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility. Correct by 5/28/15.
* The facility inspection done on 4/28/15 and the exit briefing done on 5/1/15 were conducted with the licensee.
