FORM OF OFFICIAL TAG.
The dogs and cats did not have official identification. Whereas many ID tags were present they did not have
"USDA" and an individual animal number on the tag, in addition to the exhibitor's certificate number.
Dogs and cats should have official identification that is displayed on their enclosures, and attached to the animal
when it leaves the premises, in order to safeguard the animal from becoming lost, and so that animals can be
accurately recorded and traced as needed.
To be corrected by 7/1/16.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was not a Record of Acquisition and Disposition for all dogs and cats on hand. Records were incomplete.
Records should be maintained for at least one year following the departure of animals. Acquisition and Disposition
records help to enable the inspection process, and to provide traceability of animals, which can help to protect their
welfare. Records should be created and maintained for all dogs and cats. APHIS Form 7005 has been provided to
the exhibitor for this purpose.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures for the dogs and cats had surfaces that have not been well maintained, and impede adequate
cleaning and disinfecting.
The cat enclosures had paint peeling off of the welded wire panels comprising the walls of the enclosures. The
metal door frames had peeling paint and rust. Some wooden enclosures inside the dog or cat enclosures haddeteriorating wood.
Surfaces which are peeling, deteriorating, or rusted cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected, and could create
an unsanitary environment for the animals. Surfaces in the animal enclosures should be maintained in good repair
in order to facilitate appropriate husbandry.
To be corrected by 8/1/16.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representatives on site.
