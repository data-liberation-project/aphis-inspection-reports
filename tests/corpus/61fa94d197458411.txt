Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 PM on 8/26/21.
I called the licensee's cell phone, honked the vehicle horn, and waited at the facility for 30 minutes in attempts to contact
the licensee. All attempts were unsuccessful.
