Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Emergency veterinary care was not available for an acutely injured zebra (auction tag 4901) unable to get up or move its
back legs on Thursday March 3, 2022. The inspectors returned from a short lunch break and determined that an adult
zebra had been acutely and severely injured during the time of their absence. The zebra was lying down on its right side.
The zebra occasionally violently moved its front legs and neck but could not move the back half of its body. It cried out
when moving. The inspectors were told that the zebra had been sharing a stall with other zebras (arrived together) but
that fighting broke out and he was placed in a separate stall. Auction personnel stated they think he jumped/kicked and
fell and broke his back. The attending veterinarian was not on auction grounds and the auction representative stated that
the plan was to wait until the currently ongoing buffalo auction was completed then once the animal corridors were empty
euthanize the zebra via gunshot and remove him from the barn. The inspectors asked to see the PVC to see what the
attending veterinarian had designated as approved emergency and euthanasia procedures. The auction facility
representative could not find it. Two hours later the zebra had still not been attended to. The inspectors spoke with the
auction representative and stated that something needed to be done to address the acute pain and suffering of the zebra
and asked if she had called the Attending Veterinarian to see if any medications could be administered for pain if the
zebra could not be immediately euthanized. This was done an hour later. Lack of accessibility to appropriate and timely


emergency care led to additional pain, distress and suffering for this zebra. The facility must establish and maintain
programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to treat injuries and the availability of
emergency care. Correct by ensuring appropriate emergency care/euthanasia for the zebra by the end of the day March
3, 2022.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A zebra (auction tag 4906) was noted on Thursday March 3 with a fresh looking wound crossing diagonally across the
front of the lower left leg between the fetlock and the knee. The wound was approximately 2 inches long and ¾ in wide at
the center and bright red in color. The tissue appeared bright pink red and glistened. No thickened tissue was present.
The zebra was weight bearing on that leg and seemed fine otherwise. The facility representative stated that they were
aware of the wound and that it was an old wound that the zebra had arrived at the auction with. On Friday March 4 the
inspectors noted another wound lower down on the front of the same leg just above the hoof. The wound was about 1 in
by ¾ in in size. Both wounds appeared to have recently clotted blood on their surfaces. The facility representative and the
attending veterinarian were both asked about the additional zebra wounds on Friday. The facility representative and the
veterinarian were unaware of the current condition of the wounds. Daily observation of all animals is necessary to assess
their health and well-being; if any problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are noted, they must be conveyed to
the attending veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner in order to allow for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Records: Operators of auction sales and brokers.
The auction record for consignment tag number 283 did not correctly and fully disclose the consignor of the animal. A
munchkin cat (adult female tortishell) consignment tag number 283 was consigned by AK just before the warm room


auction started. The rabies certificate stated that the cat had been given a Rabies vaccination by a veterinarian on 3-3-22
in Ohio and listed CK as the owner (CK is USDA licensed). During the auction the auctioneer stated that AK has been
breeding munchkin cats for over 20 years and that this particular cat had been bred to a Persian munchkin cat and might
be pregnant. Review of the consignment form identified the consigner’s name as RG from Tennessee. There was no
mention on the form of either AK or CK. A discussion with AK confirmed that she had brought the cat with her from Ohio
to be sold at this sale. Auction records must be complete and fully and correctly disclose all required information in order
to provide the required information regarding legal ownership and to allow for animal tracing. The operator of the auction
shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and correctly disclose all required information concerning each animal
consigned for auction or sold including the name and address of the person who owned or consigned the animal for sale.

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The auction did not have their written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) available for review during this auction inspection
(Thursday and Friday March 3 and 4). On Thursday the inspectors returned from a short lunch break and determined that
an adult zebra had been acutely and severely injured during the time of their absence. The attending veterinarian was not
on auction grounds so the inspectors asked to see the PVC. The auction facility representative could not find it. The
representative was asked about the PVC again later on Thursday and on Friday. The PVC was not available either day
for review by the USDA APHIS inspectors or for use by the facility representatives to identify guidance approved by the
Attending Veterinarian regarding emergency situations and euthanasia methods. Correct by allowing APHIS officials to
examine records required to be kept by the Act and regulations during business hours.
2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.


Handling of the bison in the auction ring was not done as expeditiously and carefully as possible. On Thursday March 3
the inspectors watched the auction of bison and other hoofstock. One teenaged male auction helper was noted opening
the door at the east end of the auction ring to allow the bison to enter the ring and then shouting out the auction tag
numbers on the bison. He was observed able to get behind a swinging protection door to get out of the path of the
animals if they came near his end of the ring. In some cases instead of using this door, he was observed waving a long
(approximately five foot) stick with a black flag at the end at the advancing bison. If the bison got close enough to him, he
was seen hitting the bison directly on the face/head with the flagged end of the stick. Hitting and mishandling of animals
causes behavioral stress, discomfort and can result in injury to the animals or to the humans nearby. All animals shall be
handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical
harm or unnecessary discomfort. Correct by April 30, 2022.
2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
There were insufficient distance and barriers between the public and a young camel (auction tag 5074). The camel was
noted to be calm on Thursday but by Friday morning it was showing signs of agitation including swaying back and forth,
rocking in place and occasionally vocalizing. The camel was housed in a temporary pen in the ‘baby animal’ area of the
arena at the end of the row. Two sides of the pen were adjacent to public walkways. The size of the pen was such that the
baby camel could not get out of reach of the public (depth just a bit more than the length of the camel with length twice the
camel’s). Multiple members of the public were observed petting the camel and taking up close photographs. No readily
identifiable employees were noted in the area observing these behaviors. A lack of distance and/or barriers between the
public and animals can lead to safety issues for both the animals and the public and can cause stress to the animals. Any
animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or
barriers between the animal and the general public. Correct by April 30, 2022.

Handling of animals.
During this inspection none of the employees/attendants/auction personnel working in the animal areas were readily
identifiable. Members of the public were observed petting young goats that had escaped from their pens (were running in
the public walkways) and a young camel. No readily identifiable employees were noted anywhere in the vicinity. The
goats appeared stressed and were trying to run away from the petting. The camel was also showing signs of stress.
Readily identifiable employees/attendants need to be present at times when the general public has contact with the
animals in order to protect both the safety and well-being of the animals and of the members of the public. A responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact.
3.15(c)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
The enclosure housing one cat (auction tag 283) was of wire mesh on top and on part of all four walls. It did not have
projecting rims or similar devices located on the exterior of each wall having ventilation openings to prevent obstruction of
the ventilation openings. Cat enclosures must have projecting rims large enough to provide a minimum air circulation
space of 0.75 inches between the enclosure and anything the enclosure is placed against. Correct by April 30, 2022.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
Many of the auction enclosures need repair as the wooden rails/structures and the metal fencing rails have been
damaged and broken by the animals or suffered wear and tear and have not been repaired or replaced. The broken and
damaged areas are an injury hazard to the animals and can lead to escape of the animals. Specific examples noted
during this inspection include:


*Two kangaroos were housed in a small enclosure in the main covered barn. The outside wall of wood and wire panels
had a damaged wood section and a damaged wire just above the floor leaving a large enough opening for the animals to
put a body part through/get entrapped.
*An electrical cord was dangling at camel head height in an enclosure in the main covered barn.
*Several small goats were noted to have escaped their enclosures and were running in the public walkways in back arena
barn annex. The openings of the wire panels were too large to contain the small goats in one pen. In a second pen, the
gate did not close completely allowing the small goats to slip out.
*One metal panel enclosure housing goats and sheep in the back arena barn annex had separated from the wall. Several
of the goats and sheep from the adjacent enclosure had pushed themselves in between the wall and the metal panel
getting stuck there.
*Many broken and missing wood planks were observed in the main covered barn stalls.
*Many broken metal bars leaving sharp edges at animal height were observed in the front arena barn annex.
*A section of wallboard was falling down and into sheep and goat enclosures in the arena barn. A piece of wood
hammered in place to keep the wallboard from falling contained sharp nails sticking out that could be reached by the
animals.
*A section of wallboard in a sheep/goat pen was missing exposing the animals to the insulation present.
The facility must be constructed of material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The facilities
used to house animals must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. Correct by April 30, 2022.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.


Many wet enclosures were noted throughout the auction grounds on both days. The enclosures were both covered (under
roof) and open. The affected species included zebra, camels, water buffalo, zebu, bison/buffalo, sheep and goats. Some
enclosures were so wet that all the hay fed on the ground was soaked and there were no dry areas in the enclosure.
Multiple enclosures with dirt floors were slippery with wet dirt and thick mud. Animals were noted with mud/dirt caked on
their legs, sides and abdomens from lying down in the wet enclosures. Attendants were noted emptying water buckets by
dumping the water into the enclosures which contributed to drainage issues. Drainage issues can lead to multiple
problems including contamination of feed/hay fed on the ground, contaminated haircoats/skin of the animals, odors,
fly/pest issues and unstable slippery footing that can lead to slips/falls and injuries to the animals. A suitable method shall
be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by April 30, 2022.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Housekeeping regarding trash in enclosures needs to addressed. One bison (auction tag 4967) had twine wrapped
inbetween its hooves and around the outside of the lower leg. An enclosure housing two water buffalo (auction tag 5098)
had stray pieces of sharp edged metal (the larger approximately 12 inches by 6 inches) on the ground inside their
enclosure. Trash items inside animal enclosures can lead to injury of the animals. Grounds must be kept clean with all
trash placed in designated areas to protect the health of the animals. Correct by April 30, 2022.
3.137(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
One large wire African crested porcupine enclosure did not have handles (auction tag 122). The auction attendants were
noted carrying the enclosure from the outside exotic area into the auction ring by putting their fingers through the
enclosure openings. Adequate handholds or other devices for lifting are necessary to allow the enclosure to be moved
safely without it being dropped or any injury to the animal or the attendants. Adequate handholds or other devices for


lifting shall be provided to enable the enclosure to be lifted without tilting and to ensure that the person handling the
enclosure will not be in contact with the animal. Correct by April 30, 2022.
3.137(e)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
Three African crested porcupine enclosures were not clearly marked on top and on one side with the words Live Animal
or Wild Animal (auction tags 122-124). Accurate markings are necessary to ensure that everyone who comes near the
enclosure has knowledge of what may be in the enclosure and how to properly orient it. Enclosures shall be clearly
marked on top and on one or more sides with the words Live Animal or Wild Animal in letters not less than 1 inch in height
and with arrows or other markings to indicate the upright position. Correct by April 30, 2022.
3.36(a)

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
A guinea pig enclosure (auction tag 100) housing two young guinea pigs was not of sufficient structural strength and
construction. The enclosure was a purple plastic storage tub with no top that was set on the floor just under a table. Along
with no top, it was also damaged with duct tape repairs. The lack of a top and structural strength means that the animals
could come to physical harm or escape if the tub were to be kicked or knocked over accidentally or if a member of the
public or their pet reached into the tub toward the animals. The primary enclosures used for guinea pigs shall be
constructed in such as manner that the structural strength of the enclosure shall be sufficient to contain the guinea pigs
and withstand rigors of transportation and the auction process. Correct by April 30, 2022.
3.36(a)(5)

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
Two guinea pig enclosures (auction tag 100 and 101 housing 2 and 5 guinea pigs respectively) had insufficient ventilation
openings. Both enclosures only had ventilation openings on one side (the top). Ventilation openings are required on


multiple sides in order to allow for cross ventilation and to allow continued ventilation if one side’s openings are
accidentally blocked. There must be ventilation openings located on two opposite walls (encompassing at least 16 percent
of each total wall surface area) of the primary guinea pig enclosure or on all four walls (8 percent of each total wall surface
area). Correct by April 30, 2022.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on March 3-4, 2022.
The exit interview was conducted with the lead inspector and a facility representative on March 8, 2022.
