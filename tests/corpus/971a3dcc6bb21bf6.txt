ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
* The following expired drugs were found in multiple areas used to store medications for use in regulated species
throughout the facility: LubriFresh PM Eye Ointment (Exp: 11/2017); AluSpray (Exp: 7/2017); Epinephrine Injectable
(Exp: 6/2017). Review of the most recent finalized Semi-Annual Program Review revealed that the IACUC had also
previously identified multiple areas with expired medications. Use of expired drugs is not considered acceptable
veterinary practice. These drugs were removed for discard during the inspection.
From this day forward: Ensure use of in-date drugs for regulated activity.
* During this inspection, the inspectors found a bottle of non-pharmaceutical grade chloral hydrate powder.
Conversation with the PI and subsequent review of associated protocol (#604) revealed use of this compound as an
injectable anesthetic in veterinary teaching horses. The protocol did not include any drug preparation procedures or
justification for use of this non-pharmaceutical grade drug in regulated animals. The use of non-pharmaceutical
grade drugs is not considered adequate routine veterinary care. The facility shall maintain a program of adequate
veterinary care, including appropriate use of anesthetic drugs.

3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The ceiling of one room used as a primary enclosure for 7 cats had a slow leak of a clear liquid. The liquid was
pooling on the floor of the enclosure. There were two white spots on the floor adjacent to the pooling liquid where
liquid may have accumulated previously. The ceiling material was visibly wet and bulging with an irregular surface in
an area of approximately 2ft x 2ft. The evident damage extended under a light fixture and around a metal vented
structure. The cats had access to the pooling liquid and the area underneath the light fixture. The facility manager
reported previous submission of two separate work orders to address this issue: one on Oct. 24, 2017 and a second
on Dec. 7th, 2017. No assessment or repairs have been performed to date. The cats may be injured by access to
unknown substances or collapse or other failure of damaged ceiling structure. Primary enclosures must bestructurally sound and kept in good repair.
