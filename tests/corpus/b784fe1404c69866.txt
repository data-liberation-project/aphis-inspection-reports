2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white female Cockashon (#45) at the home location was limping on its left front leg. The licensee observed the
dog's condition two days ago, but has not yet contacted the Attending Veterinarian. A dog limping indicates that
there is something medically wrong with the dog. The dog may be in pain and may have some kind of infection
causing it to limp. An infection could spread to other parts of the body. The Attending Veterinarian needs to be
contacted and treatment should be carried out per his/her instructions.
A white and brown female Teddy (#74) at site #13150 had what appeared to be some kind of rash on its underside.
The abdomen had red spots with some of the spots being scabbed over. The licensee contacted the Attending
Veterinarian two weeks ago. The Attending Veterinarian diagnosed the dog with hot spots and advised the licensee
to wrap the area where the hot spots were to prevent the dog from licking at it. The licensee did not wrap the area
and mentioned that the abdomen is worse now than it was a couple of weeks ago. Hot spots, as it was diagnosed
by the Attending Veterinarian, can be irritating and if left untreated can worsen and become infected. The Attending
Veterinarian needs to be contacted again since the condition has worsened since the licensee last spoke with the
Attending Veterinarian. The Attending Veterinarian should be updated with the dog's current condition to see if the
treatment plan has changed. The licensee needs to carry out the Attending Veterinarian's treatment plan per
his/her instructions.
Correct by 12/16/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
Note: Both the home site and site #13150 were inspected.
End of report.
