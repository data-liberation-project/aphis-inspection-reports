2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Since the last inspection, the licensee has not been maintaining records of the current number of hamsters on hand at the
facility.
Failure to maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals born, held, owned, acquired or
disposed of can make it difficult to identify trends in animal losses which could indicate disease conditions in the
hamsters.
The licensee must maintain records which disclose the number of animals born, held, owned, acquired, or disposed of.
