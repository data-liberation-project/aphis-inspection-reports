2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records requirements.
The facility is not maintaining records. Disposition records are not being made to indicate the name and address of
the individual receiving the animals, the number and species of animals leaving the premise and the date of
disposition. This includes the animals present on the previous inspection: 6 rabbits, 2 guinea pigs and 44 hamsters.
Additionally, acquisition records are also not complete. There were a few acquisition records for animals acquired
from one USDA licensed dealer but no other acquisition records have been maintained. This includes records for
offspring born on the premises. Incomplete records does not allow for tracking of the animals, ensuring that they
came from proper sources and does not allow for monitoring of mortality. The licensee must develop and maintain
complete and up-to-date records that contain all required information.

Waste disposal.
There were several used empty enclosures that have not been cleaned and disinfected being stored next to
occupied enclosures for 28 hamsters and 3 guinea pigs. Food with mold present was found in one dish, the trays
underneath contained excreta, food waste, excess water, mold and soiled shavings and the enclosures with solid
floors contained soiled shavings, excreta and food waste. The presence of this waste in empty enclosures could
attract insects and vermin, increase odors and increase health risks to the animals. Provisions for waste disposal
must be made for removal and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding and debris. Correct by 7/23/15.
