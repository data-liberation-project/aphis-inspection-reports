3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
There was one guinea pig pen that did not provide the required amount of floor space. There were 41 weanling guinea
pigs housed in a pen that measured 22 by 46 inches or 1,016 square inches of floor space. Each weanling requires a
minimum of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required to house these weanlings is 2,460 square inches.
There cannot be more than 16 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure measuring 22 by 46 inches.
Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.

Watering.
The majority of the water bottles contained an accumulation of black residue on the inside of the water bottle. The guinea
pigs were observed drinking from the bottles and did not appear dehydrated. The licensee stated the bottles were
cleaned approximately 2 weeks ago.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water


intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
