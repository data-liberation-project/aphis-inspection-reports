The following were observed during the inspection:
A female Camel named "Alice" was observed having dried, caked fecal material covering the entire rear end, tail and both
rear legs. The licensee stated that this was the first time this condition had been observed. The licensee stated that the
attending veterinary had not been consulted over the condition of this Camel at the time of inspection. The licensee
stated that sometime in December or January this Camel had been dewormed. In addition, the license stated that this
Camel had been housed in a dry lot and only recently been turned out to green grass. The Camel performed a bowl
movement during the inspection and a stream of loose, greenish looking fecal waste was observed on the ground.
A male Camel named “Randy” was observed to have a wound on the front and rear of the right front leg. The licensee
stated that on May 20th. they found the right front leg of this Camel wedged between two bars on the feeder. The
licensee had to cut the bar to free the right front leg. The licensee stated that iodine was applied once to the open
wounds. The licensee stated that the attending veterinary had not been consulted over the condition of this Camel at the
time of inspection. Flies were observed on the front wounded area that was now scabbed over. The open wound on the
back of the leg was still open with a red, moist looking tissue still visible. The front wound was estimated to be 1 inch in
width by 2 inches in length. The wound behind the right front leg was estimated to be 2 inches in diameter.
Daily observation is critical to the health and wellbeing of all animals at the premise. Adequate veterinary care includes

daily observation with assessment and recognition of any possible health problems, with these problems promptly
reported to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate diagnostics and any necessary treatment can occur in a timely
manner in order to safeguard the animal's well-being. Daily observation and direct, timely, and frequent communication
with the attending veterinarian is essential for the heath and care of the animals. Lack of communication of ongoing
problems might result in a delay of treatment if severity of the problem is not known by the veterinarian. The licensee
must develop and maintain records of routine daily observations to ensure any animal with a health problem is treated
promptly and appropriately. Failure to diagnose conditions or to follow up when the recorded treatment does not correct
the issues can cause unnecessary discomfort, pain or distress to the animals. The licensee must conduct daily
observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication is required so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian. Correct by 5/29/21.
