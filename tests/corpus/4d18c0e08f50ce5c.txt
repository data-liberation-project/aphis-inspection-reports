ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 pm on
01/11/2016.
I knocked on the door at the residence on the property and no one was home. A message was left on the voice mail
of the licensee that I was there to conduct an inspection if they were in the area. There was no return call and after
30 minutes I left the property.
I left a message to contact me if there were better days or times to conduct inspections as their schedules may have
changed since last year.
