2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
Exotic animals including a young kinkajou, a 6-week-old zebra, an adult male Savannah cat, and an arctic fox were
acquired the weekend of June 5th, transported to Mississippi, and housed at an offsite location (the home of an auction
employee) for 3 weeks prior to being consigned at the auction the weekend of June 26th, 2021. The offsite location is
located 140 miles away from the licensed site (the sale barn). This offsite location was not disclosed to USDA personnel
prior to its use and has not been inspected by USDA personnel.
Animals require clean, safe, and secure facilities that provide adequate shelter for the animals. USDA inspection of new
facilities is essential for ensuring facilities meet the regulatory requirements.
Correct by July 31st, 2021 by notifying USDA APHIS Animal Care about the location of this and any other off site
locations where animals will be held or housed. Alternatively, the person who owns this offsite location may apply for their
own USDA license.

Time and method of identification.
One adult male Savannah cat was consigned at the auction without being assigned an official USDA identification
number, tag, or other approved method of identification.


Animal identification is essential for tracing and tracking animals in the event of theft, escape, resale, or disease outbreak.
Correct by July 31, 2021 by identifying animals using an approved method of identification.

number (or photo identification number) for individuals who consigned or bought regulated animals at the sale and who

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
In the warm room, multiple animals were contained in enclosures which did not have adequate ventilation and lacked
handles.
*2 adult hedgehogs (Tag #267 & #277) were individually contained in plastic containers that had ventilation openings only
on the top of the containers. There were no openings on the sides of the containers.


*1 adult chinchilla (#274) was contained in a solid-bottom plastic and wire cage that did not have handles.
*2 adult sugar gliders (#281) were contained in a wire cage that did not have a handle.
*1 adult gerbil (#278) was contained in a wire and plastic cage that did not have a handle.
*1 adult arctic fox was contained in a wire cage that was in poor repair. The door of the cage was held shut with one
simple wire spring-loaded latch that was bent and rusted.
Animals in transport may be injured or killed if cages or carriers are not of adequate construction and strength to endure
the rigors of transport. Animals may suffocate if carriers are not adequately ventilated or ventilation openings become
obstructed. Personnel handling cages or crates of animals may be injured if handles are not available, causing the
personnel to come into contact with animals during movement and handling of cages/crates. Correct by maintaining
animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA transportation standards for the species contained within.
3.137(e) Repeat

*5 adult hedgehogs (Tag #275, 276, 277, 333, 334) were individually contained in plastic carriers which lacked “live
animal” labels with directional arrows.
*One adult sugar glider (tag #281) was contained in a cage which lacked “live animal” labels with directional arrows.
*2 adult gerbils (tag #278, 402) were individually contained in wire cages which lacked “live animal” labels with

*1 young kinkajou (tag #131) was contained in a plastic pet taxi which lacked “live animal” labels with directional arrows.
“Live animal” signage, with directional arrows, protects animals in transport cages/crates by identifying the contents of the
carrier as living animals and alerting personnel to the correct upright orientation of the cage or crate.
Correct by maintaining animals in enclosures that are labelled with the words “live animal” or “wild animal” (whichever is
appropriate) in letters not less than 1 inch in height, with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position
of the container.
