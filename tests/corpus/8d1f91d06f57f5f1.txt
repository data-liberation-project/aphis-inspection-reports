** I arrived at the premises at 2:28 pm and called the owner letting him know I was at his facility to conduct an
inspection. I also knocked on the door at the owners residence. No one was available to conduct the inspection. I
called the owner at 3:00 pm and let them know that I was leaving the facility and that this would be an attempted
inspection. A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at
2:28 pm on 08/05/2015. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the
