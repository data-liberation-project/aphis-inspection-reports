2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There are two deer at the facility and the younger deer has overgrown hooves. The front hooves are significantly longer
than normal, with the two hooves starting to touch/cross in the front, and angling upward, may change the stance and
ambulation of the deer. The overgrowth of hooves/nails may cause the animals discomfort and lead to injuries or
lameness if not appropriately addressed. The facility shall establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care
that includes timely, adequate hoof/nail care and trimming when needed.

Handling of animals.
On the day of inspection on 8/11/21, the temperature reached 100 degrees F during the inspection, at approximately 5
pm. The forecasted temperature for the late afternoon was 106 degrees and there was an extreme heat warning in effect.
Many of the animals appeared uncomfortable and hot, especially the overweight animals (such as the tiger, tiger x lion
hybrid, leopard, lynx and clouded leopard). Open mouth breathing and visible respiratory effort was also seen in clouded
and snow leopards and several tigers. A Kestrel thermometer reading in front of a typical enclosure was 99.4 -99.8


degrees F. The following animals were observed with continued panting and open mouthed breathing: the snow leopard
Brenda II, the clouded leopards Nebula and Rosie, and several of the tigers and leopard (Frederick). The facility has a
water/cooling protocol which states that when temperatures are above 90 degrees F, the animals may be cooled using
various methods, however none of the measures in the protocol to prevent overheating, and ensure the comfort of all
animals during hot weather were being carried out during the hottest time of the day. The additional measures that the
licensee previously provided as an addendum to the cooling protocol were not observed.

This inspection was conducted with the facility President, and the exit interview was conducted by phone on 24 August
2021.
