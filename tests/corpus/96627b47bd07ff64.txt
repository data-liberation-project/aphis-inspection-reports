3.15(a)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
When asked about crating procedures during transport, the registrant stated that large dogs are secured with a seatbelt
harness within the car, but are not placed in crates. Transporting any animal without the protection of a proper transport
enclosure increases the likelihood of injuries to animals and people or escape of animals.
Any person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations must not transport or deliver for transport in commerce a dog or cat
unless the dog or cat is contained in a primary enclosure such as a compartment, transport cage, carton or crate. Primary
enclosures must be constructed according to the regulations in Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.15(a)(1-9).

3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
When asked about labeling of containers used for animal transport, the registrant stated that she does not label the crates
with "Live Animal" or with directional markings.
Failure to label the crates as detailed in the regulations could result in mishandling and/or inappropriate storage in the
event that someone other than the registrant might need to load or unload the crates, which could cause illness, injury or
death to a crated animal. Transport enclosures must be clearly marked on the top and on one or more sides with the


words, "Live Animals," in letters at least 1 inch high, and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright
position of the primary enclosure.

Care in transit.
When asked about procedures for checking animals during transport, the registrant stated that she, 'tries to check puppies
every four hours,' and if they are crying excessively. She also stated that she, 'checks adult dogs about every five to six
hours.' Failure to check all the animals at a minimum of once every four hours during transport increases the likelihood
that any problems will go undetected and may not be addressed in time to prevent injury, illness or death.
Any person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations transporting dogs or cats in commerce must ensure that the
operator of the conveyance, or a person accompanying the operator, observes the dogs or cats as often as
circumstances allow, but not less than once every four hours, to make sure they have sufficient air for normal breathing,
that the ambient temperature is within the limits provided in the regulations and that all applicable standards of Part 3,
Subpart A of the regulations are being complied with. The regulated person must ensure that the operator or person
accompanying the operator determines whether any of the dogs or cats are in obvious physical distress and obtains any
veterinary care needed for the dogs or cats at the closest available veterinary facility.
