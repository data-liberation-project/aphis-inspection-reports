3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The indoor facility housing cats has accumulations of dust and cat hair along the walls, and dirt and debris on the
windowsills and blinds. There is also a large volume of spilled litter and debris covering the floor under and around the
enclosures.
Having excessive dirt and debris, especially in a room with kittens who are still developing an immune system, can lead to
increased risks of disease or illness.
Correct by cleaning and sanitizing all surfaces of housing facilities to maintain generally accepted husbandry standards
and in accordance with 3.11(c) to maintain all animals’ health and well-being.
3.2(d) Repeat

Indoor housing facilities.
The indoor facility housing cats has areas of the wall that are not impervious to moisture. Large areas of paint have been
peeled off the walls, removing the protective and impermeable outer layer and exposing absorbent material below.
Absorbent materials do not allow for adequate cleaning and sanitation of the room.
Ensuring surfaces are capable of being adequately cleaned and sanitized is critical for eliminating disease risks,


especially in young kittens that are still establishing a strong immune system.
Correct by ensuring all floors, walls, and ceilings of indoor housing facilities are impervious to moisture.
3.4(c) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two of the three outdoor cat enclosures are constructed with wood permeable to moisture and cannot be properly
cleaned or sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed wood. The enclosed shelter box and
wooden ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. Within the back left corner of the shelter box there is an area of
discolored wood that is darker in color, indicating chronic moisture that has been absorbed. The second enclosure with a
corresponding shelter box and resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed wood. Surfaces
permeable to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and/or sanitized as contaminated material can penetrate into the
surfaces. In addition, these structures and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they can be easily
removed once they become worn or soiled.
Having surfaces in contact with the animals that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can expose the cats to
unnecessary disease hazards.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of materials
that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become
worn or soiled.
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Excreta is not being removed from the outdoor cat primary enclosures daily or frequently enough from the indoor cat
enclosures to reduce disease hazards and odors. All three outdoor cat enclosures, housing a total of 8 adult cats, have
large accumulations of excreta mixed in with the mulch and dirt floor. Most of the feces present are dry and did not occur


within the last 24 hours. Inside, there are three cat enclosures, two housing an adult with kittens and one with just a
single kitten. All litter boxes had accumulations of urine and feces. According to the licensee, litter boxes are cleaned daily
and completely dumped at least every other day. However, upon entering the room, a strong ammonia odor was
immediately detected by inspectors.
Excreta and food waste accumulation inside primary enclosures can lead to increased disease hazards or discomfort for
the animals, odors, and/or attract unwanted pests.
Correct by removing excreta and food waste daily from primary enclosures or as often as necessary to prevent the
excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the cats in the primary enclosure, and to reduce
disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
3.11(b) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures for the outdoor-housed domestic cats are not being sanitized once every two weeks. The two, wooden,
outdoor cat enclosures have multiple surfaces such as the ladder ramps, surrounding wood of the hide box, walls, and
shelves that are discolored yellowish-brown and have accumulation of brown debris. The ceilings in the shelter boxes and
enclosures have collections of dust, fur and cobwebs. The plastic carriers and furniture within all three outdoor enclosures
are covered in dirt and discolored.
Infrequent and improper sanitation of primary enclosures exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors,
insects and pests. Adequate cleaning and sanitization are critical for eliminating disease risks.
Correct by sealing all wood surfaces, cleaning, and sanitizing all primary enclosures at least once every 2 weeks and
using one of the approved methods listed in 3.11(b)(3).
3.11(d) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


There is not an effective pest program in place to control insects in the cat outdoor housing area. Ants have contaminated
the food bucket of the cat enclosure along the back fence and are walking around the top rim and top layer of food.
According to the licensee, there is no current pest control program at the facility.
Pests located in animal areas can easily spread disease, bring in new diseases, or cause deterioration and contamination
of food receptacles and primary enclosures.
Correct by creating and implementing an effective program for the control of insects and other pests to promote the health
and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination of pests in animal areas.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
Four fox enclosures have fallen into disrepair and are posing a risk of injury to the animals inside. Along the back fence
line, the wooden red fox enclosure, kit fox enclosure, and both fennec fox enclosures have gaps in the flooring that could
cause an animal to injury themselves or become entrapped. The floors of the enclosures are comprised of both wire mesh
and concrete paving stones. In each of the enclosures, the dirt has eroded out from underneath the wire flooring, leaving
wire mesh exposed or causing the concrete pavers to shift, creating gaps in the flooring. Just outside some enclosures
there is evidence of rodent holes which are contributing to the erosion underneath the flooring. In the red fox enclosure,
concrete pavers have shifted exposing cracks around 1-2” wide along the front of the enclosure. In one fennec fox
enclosure there is a gap in the back left corner between stones. In the second fennec fox enclosure, along the left wall,
the underlying dirt has shifted, causing the wire bottom of the enclosure to become exposed. In the back left corner, the
wire bottom is completely exposed and is covering a hole below. The wire mesh in the enclosure is approximately 1” x
1.5” and large enough for a paw to fall through. In the kit fox enclosure, the floor has eroded directly underneath the food
and water dish, leaving behind wire mesh suspended over a hole. The wire mesh in the kit fox enclosure is approximately
1” x 1” and the exposed area is approximately 6-7” wide and 1.5’ long.


Flooring with gaps, exposed wire mesh with a larger openings, and unstable cement pavers can cause serious injuries
and pose a risk of entrapment.
Correct by November 10, 2022 by ensuring all enclosures are structurally sound and are maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
3.125(d) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Food waste, trash, and debris are present in multiple outdoor enclosures. The potbelly pig enclosure contains multiple
plastic single-use human food dishes. The metal red fox enclosure along the side fence contains torn and shredded
pieces of plastic tarp from the tarp surrounding the enclosure. There is also trash and debris present in the wooden red
fox enclosure and a fennec fox enclosure.
Trash and debris inside primary enclosures can lead to increased risk of injury and illness from potential ingestion or
entrapment, and can also attract pests and vermin.
Correct by by ensuring waste and debris is removed and disposed of from primary enclosures to minimize risk of injury,
illness and/or disease.
3.131(a) Direct Repeat

Sanitation.
There are excessive amounts of feces present in the Patagonian cavy enclosure and both red fox enclosures. The
Patagonian cavy enclosure has accumulations of feces that cover the entire floor enclosure, making it impossible to avoid
sitting on, walking on, or otherwise encountering feces. The plastic food bucket is frequently placed on the ground and
knocked over, mixing the food with the feces. The dirt floor of both red fox enclosures is compromised of a mix of dirt,
feces, debris, trash, fur, and mulch. There is no clear area of flooring that doesn’t contain this mixture, which doesn’t allow
the foxes to avoid their own excreta.


Large volumes of fecal matter and waste that animals cannot avoid in their primary enclosure can lead to soiling of the
animal and act as source of odor and serious disease hazards which are detrimental to the animal’s health.
Correct by removing excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained within and to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
3.131(d) Direct Repeat

Sanitation.
There is not an effective pest program in place. Outside of a few fox enclosures there are rodent holes tunneling under
the walls and floors. These are primarily located near and adjacent to food and water dishes which are kept in pails
clipped to the enclosure side walls just off the ground. There is fresh dirt present at the entrance to the holes indicating
recent activity. The flooring in the affected enclosures is beginning to shift and cause gaps in paving stones or eroding
hard-packed dirt from underneath the bottom wire mesh. The affected enclosures include a red fox enclosure, the kit fox
enclosure, and the two fennec fox enclosures. According to the licensee, these holes were not noticed prior to inspection
and there is no pest program in place to address rodent activity.
Pests located in animal areas can easily spread disease, bring in new diseases, contaminate food in primary enclosures,
or compromise enclosure structural integrity.
Correct by creating and implementing an effective program for the control of insects and other pests to promote the health
and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination of pests in animal areas.
