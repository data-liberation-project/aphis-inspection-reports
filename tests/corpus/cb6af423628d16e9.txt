2.38(g)(1)(3)
MISCELLANEOUS.
The research facility has not been using an official form of identification for dogs and cats acquired from exempt
sources for use in teaching activities. A number is being assigned in the record of animals on hand when the
animals are received at the facility but no tattoo, tag, or collar with that number is being applied to the dogs and
cats.
Dogs and cats acquired for use in teaching activities must be individually identified by an official method in order to
properly track these animals to ensure they are being acquired legally and that they are transported, cared for, and
used humanely.
All live dogs or cats, including those from any exempt source, delivered for transportation, transported, purchased or
otherwise acquired. sold, or disposed of by a research facility, shall be identified at the time of such delivery for
transportation, purchase, sale, disposal, or acquisition by a tag, tattoo, or collar, applied to the live dog or cat by the
research facility and which individually identifies the dog or cat by number.
To be corrected by 8/1/2014.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
