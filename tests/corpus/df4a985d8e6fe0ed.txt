2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female shih tzu, "Me-me's Meggie" (no legible ID number) has a round raised hairless area on her left side that is
about 2x2 inches wide. Documentation shows she had been seen by the Attending Veterinarian in May 2014 and
was prescribed treatment. The licensee reports that the condition has not changed and that treatment doesn't seem
to help it. The licensee reports that this has not been communicated to the Attending Veterinarian. It is important to
communicate with the Attending Veterinarian if a treatment is not working so that the animal can be re-evaluated
and determine if different medications are needed. To ensure this animal's condition is not painful and that what is
causing the condition cannot be spread to other animals, the licensee must have the Attending Veterinarian
re-evaluate this animal so that its condition can be appropriately diagnosed and treated.
