3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Cat door flaps and the surrounding frame are not being cleaned and sanitized frequently enough and are coated in debris
and hair. Two enclosures have cat doors with flaps that allow indoor/outdoor access for the cats housed within. The door
frame and flaps are coated in a dry, brown, waxy debris. It is important to spot-clean and sanitize surfaces that animals
come in contact with on a daily basis to minimize the build-up of potential disease hazards and to maintain colony health.
Correct by August 23, 2022 by ensuring all hard surfaces which the cats come in contact with are spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized every 2 weeks.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
