2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
-Daily observations of three pigs did not occur for two days over a weekend. The pigs had adequate water but no feed.
Based on Department of Lab Animal Resources (DLAR) and IACUC investigations, a significant scheduling error led to
this incident, but no negative physiological effects were noted upon discovery of the weekend oversight. The IACUC
developed and implemented a corrective action plan to prevent future occurrences of missed daily observations and
feedings. Not providing daily observations of the animals can lead to negative effects on the health and wellbeing of the
animals.

- A researcher did not follow the university-wide communication policy when attempting to contact the DLAR on-call
veterinarian during a canine dystocia. Failure to use the university-wide approved method of communication during an
emergency (dystocia) prohibited the DLAR veterinarian’s ability to provide appropriate veterinary medical care during this
emergency, which may have led to the loss of two of the four pups. The IACUC developed and implemented a corrective
action plan to clarify the requirement for using the approved communication policy by the research group.

Per the regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include


daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being; provided, however, that daily observation of animals
may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and provided further, that a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior,
and well-being is conveyed to the Attending Veterinarian.

Both items were corrected prior to inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
