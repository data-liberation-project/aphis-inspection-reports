3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several self-feeders in the sheltered building have roughened, chewed tops. One receptacle has a large crack on
the back side running about two-thirds of the way down from the top.
Chewed, roughened, or cracked surfaces cannot be easily sanitized to prevent disease hazards.
The licensee must have these feeders repaired or replaced. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis,
and if they cannot be effectively sanitized, must be replaced.
To be corrected by February 11, 2015.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
