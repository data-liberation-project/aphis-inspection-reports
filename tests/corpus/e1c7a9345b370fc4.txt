FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The woven wire fence that is separating two pastures has a wooden fence post that is broken and leaning. Broken
fencing could result in injury to the animals, as well as increase the risk of potential escape. There are five elk and
eight bison contained within the enclosure with the broken fence post.
Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, protect the animals from injury and
contain the animals. The licensee must have the broken fence post replaced with a post that is structurally sound
and ensure that all the fencing is safe for the animals and in good repair at all times.
