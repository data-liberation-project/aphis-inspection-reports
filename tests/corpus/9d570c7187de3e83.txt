HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The off-exhibit holding in the Lied Jungle for 8 Francois langurs had liquid dripping from the ceiling. A large pool of
water sits above the ceiling in an exhibit area but no plumbing runs under this pool/above the off-exhibit housing so
the staff is not sure from where the liquid is coming. This dripping liquid creates a pool of water on the floor of the
enclosure on a daily basis and a "stalactite"-type structure has formed from this area of the ceiling, extending
approximately 2-3 inches from the surface.
This continuously dripping liquid from the ceiling poses a risk to the animals' health and well-being as the source
and content is unknown and, since it pools liquid on the floor of the enclosure, the animals may come into contact or
ingest this liquid. This may also be a concern for the structural strength of the ceiling if liquid is collecting between
the exhibit pool above and the enclosure ceiling below. The source of this liquid should be identified and the
dripping stopped or prevented from occurring in an animal enclosure.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury,
To be corrected by 6/18/2014.
3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floors of numerous enclosures in the Lied Jungle off-exhibit area had the paint stripped from the floor last year
but nothing has been done to replace or repair the floor to make it impervious to moisture and to be readily cleaned
and sanitized (DeBrazza monkeys, blue monkeys, spider monkeys, white-handed gibbon, grey gibbon, Celebes
macaques).
The off-exhibit enclosure housing 2 DeBrazza monkeys also had a large hole in the floor next to the keeper access
door. The exposed aggregate rock material is unsealed and unable to be cleaned and sanitized. This enclosurealso had 3 holes in the cinder block walls which exposed the unsealed concrete which cannot be adequately
cleaned and sanitized.
Being unable to readily clean and sanitize surfaces poses a risk to the health of the animals due to potential
exposure to infectious organisms or other contaminants.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by 7/20/2014.
This was a focused inspection to review corrections to noncompliances identified with barriers during the previous
inspection and to evaluate all nonhuman primates at the facility.
Accompanied on the inspection by the General Curator, Assistant General Curator, Curator for Large Mammals,
Clinical Veterinarian, Area Supervisors, Animal Care staff, and two Animal Care VMO's. Exit interview conducted
with facility representatives.
