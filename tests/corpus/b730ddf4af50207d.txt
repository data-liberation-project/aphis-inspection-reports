2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 6-29-2018- at 3:00pm a child that was visiting the facility with his parents was bitten on the forearm and leg by
an exotic animal called a Coatimundi. The animal was reported to be running loose (under the supervision of the
facility manager, according to the licensee), when it attacked the child. The animal had to be euthanized to be
tested for rabies. The child had to be put on antibiotics and rabies post exposure prophylaxis. The animal was
reported to be negative for rabies and nothing further reported about the child’s condition.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The licensee
must handle all animals as carefully as possible so as to never let this happen again. This is a Critical
Non-Compliant Item.
Correct by – from this point forward.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All of the Hedge Hog metal racks and enclosures have excessive rust and are not being maintained in good repair.
Excessive rust compromises the structural integrity of enclosures and makes it impossible to clean and sanitize
appropriately. Also, a wooden, green colored fox den is chewed up on the left corner and all around the entrance
area exposing porous wood and splintered edges While conducting this inspection it was noted that a red fox was
loose and on top of its enclosure inside the building. A loose fox could escape from the building, and injure itself, or
bite or scratch an uninvited/unsuspected visitor. This red fox escaped from its enclosure through the ceiling.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. The license must replace or repair, rusty, Hedgehog enclosures for
proper cleaning and provide structural strength. 3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
When entering a room that houses (118) small exotic animals called (Hedge hogs) a strong over powering eye
watering and lung stinging ammonia smell was noted. The owner stated that his ventilation system which consists of
one vent was not working properly. Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical
means to provide for the health and to prevent discomfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be
provided with fresh air either by means of windows, doors, vents, fans, or air-conditioning and shall be ventilated so
as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation.
The licensee must increase the ventilation in the (hedge hog) room.

3.126(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Throughout the inside of this facility there is a lack of proper distribution of light. The hedgehog breeding and
holding room and the rear animal holding area have insufficient light. Such lighting shall be uniformly distributed and
of sufficient intensity to permit routine inspection and cleaning. Lighting of primary enclosures shall be designed to
protect the animals from excessive illumination. The licensee must provide appropriate illumination throughout the
facility to allow for safe inspections and proper and safe cleaning of the enclosures.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Noted at this inspection is a large amount of soiled bedding swept underneath 2 separate pallets in the animal
facility. There also is loose feed scattered in front of a (Coatimundi) enclosure along with soiled bedding. Out in the
back area behind the main animal building are outdoor enclosures housing (Patagonian Cavies) and (Red Fox) that
have approximately 2 foot high weeds growing in between the enclosures. Accumulations of soiled bedding/loose
food and high weeds attract vermin and pests which can have a harmful effect on the health of the animals.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. The licensee must remove all
soiled bedding and excessive weeds to promote proper animal husbandry standards.3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Throughout the indoor part of the animal facility are fly strips covered with dead flies. Several fly strips are hanging
inside animal enclosures that are covered with dead flies. The air conditioning unit located in the front room is not
installed properly allowing an area for flies and other insects to enter the facility. Also, the overgrown weeds in the
rear are harboring areas for rodents that could carry diseases according to the Attending Veterinarian that was on
site. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained. The licensee must control the flies by replacing the fly strips when there covered with
dead flies and/or utilizing other fly control methods and removing all weeds around animal enclosures to protect
against rodent harboring areas.
(This inspection was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, The Animal Control Officer and the Animal Care
Inspector. The verbal exit interview was conducted with owner and the Animal Care Inspector and will by mailed by
certified mail 7008 2810 0001 0706 1526).
