ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***At 1:30 pm I arrived at the facility. I called the licensee and no one answered so I left a message stating that I
was on the premises to conduct an inspection and to return my phone call. I honked the horn and waited for 30
minutes. At 2:00 pm I called again letting the licensee know that this would be an attempted inspection and that they
would receive the inspection report by mail. I left the premises at 2:02 pm. A responsible adult was not available and
one should be made available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 on 02/24/2014.
