Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The last time the attending veterinarian visited the premises was March 30, 2020. The program of vet care states that
visits will occur annually. Several untreated medical conditions were identified during this inspection, as noted in this
report. Regularly scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian, not less than once every 12 months, are essential to
assess and ensure the adequacy of veterinary care and husbandry. Correct by scheduling an on-site visit by the attending
veterinarian before 9/20/21
2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were several dogs with inadequately treated medical conditions. Banjo, a brindle male French Bulldog (last 4 digits
of microchip #8000), had a procedure done by the veterinarian in June 2021 to treat his ears. However, at the inspection,
his ears were red, thickened, full of dark brown debris, and he was shaking his head as if his ears bothered him. The
licensee had finished all prescribed medications in June but had not contacted the vet nor scheduled a follow-up
examination to address his continued discomfort.
Isaac, a cream male French Bulldog (last 4 digits of microchip #2359), had 2 spots of hairloss with reddened, thickened
skin--one on his left neck/shoulder and one on the inner side of his right elbow, measuring approximately 2in x 1in. The


licensee had not previously noticed nor treated these spots.
Blue Raven, a blue brindle female French Bulldog (last 4 digits of microchip #0097), had a right ear that was red,
thickened, full of dark brown debris, and she kept shaking her head as if her ear bothered her. The licensee had not
previously noticed nor treated her ear.
Sandi, a cream female French Bulldog (last 4 digits of microchip #5797), had an ear condition that the licensee had
treated that morning. However, she also had hairloss with red thickened skin on her left rear foot and toes that the
licensee had not previously noticed nor treated.
Skin and ear conditions can be painful and itchy and can lead to self-injurious behaviors. If treated inadequately, the
infections can create long-term damage and changes to the normal skin and ears, leading to further pain and suffering.
The licensee must consult with their veterinarian to provide appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
disease and follow-up with their veterinarian when previously prescribed methods are no longer preventing chronic
conditions from developing. Correct by 8/26/21
3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There were roaches in all areas of the kennel, ranging in size from 1/4 inch to an inch long. They were on the floor, on
and under counters, in empty medicine boxes, in the drain, and in automatic feeders. The licensee was using ant and
roach spray sparingly around the dogs to not risk getting them sick but it was ineffective at controlling the pest situation.
Roaches can be a source of disease and contamination to food, water, and medicine. An effective pest control program
must be established and maintained to rid the kennel of roaches and other pests. Correct by 9/15/21

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
