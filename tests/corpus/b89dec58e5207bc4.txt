3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***Evidence of an overpopulation of mice is present in the new gibbon off-exhibit area. Mouse droppings were
present on the top of a transport crate stored in the area. Mouse droppings were also seen on the feeding platform
within the animal enclosure. A mouse and evidence of mouse activity can be seen within the insulation of the
building. The presence of mouse droppings indicate frequent rodent activity, which can lead to contamination of
food, water, and surfaces. Rodents may also spread disease which may affect the health of the gibbons. An
effective pest control program should minimize or eliminate the rodent population to prevent the spread of disease
and contamination. Improved pest control measures within the indoor gibbon enclosure must be established and
maintained to ensure the health of the animals. Correct by June 10, 2019
