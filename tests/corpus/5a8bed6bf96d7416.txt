2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The two elephants were brought to the elephant show arena by handler employees. Members of the public were
allowed to enter the arena in small groups, and to touch the african elephant, and pose for pictures with the
elephant. At times, especially while posing for pictures, the handlers stepped away from the elephant, up to six feet
or more to the side, and left the members of the public standing next to, and often touching the elephant.
Members of the public should not have direct, unprotected contact with dangerous animals. Such contact puts the
public and the animals at risk of serious consequences in the event of unanticipated behavoir. During public
exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and members of the public so as to assure the safety of
animals and the public. Employees and handlers must remain in control of the public and the animals at all times
during public exhibition, and at minimum the handlers should stand between the animal and members of the public
when in close proximity with the public.
To be corrected immediately.
This was a focused inspection on elephant handling during public exhibition.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
