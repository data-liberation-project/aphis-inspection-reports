HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
****Food Storage.
In one of the facility's buildings an approximately 2ft x 4ft plastic tote was used for storing open dog food that was
about half full. There was no lid on this container or in the area. Food that is stored improperly can become spoiled,
contaminated, and attract pests, which may harm the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all open food storage
containers are leak-proof and have tight fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.

3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
****Sharp points and edges.
Throughout the facility there was tie wire used to fasten panels. These tie wires were at dogs level and protruding
into the enclosures causing sharp points. One enclosure with two dogs had a 1ft x 2ft piece of ripped up sheet
metal with sharp points and edges on the ground inside where dogs are. This sheet metal was removed by the
licensee after the inspector pointed it out. Another enclosure with two dogs, had a wire pointing in about a foot
above the top of the feed bowl. That same enclosure had sharp points from the divider panel above the water
receptacle. When the dogs were drinking their heads were against these wires. Sharp points or edges could injure
the dogs. The applicant must ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp points and edges.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
****Clean water receptacles.
The water receptacles in 4 enclosures affecting 11 dogs had debris and green algae like substance along the inside
surfaces. The water inside the receptacles appeared to be brown in some receptacles and green in others. Water
receptacles which are not properly cleaned or sanitized can harbor disease-causing organisms. This could
decrease the animals(cid:25) acceptability of the water, as well as increase the risk of disease. The licensee must ensure
that all water receptacles are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent anaccumulation of dirt, debris, food waste and other disease hazards.
