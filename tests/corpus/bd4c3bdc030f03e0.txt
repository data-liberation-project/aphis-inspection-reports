ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 9 year old female Yorkshire terrier with official USDA tag number 007 was observed to have a problem with her
left eye. The eye appeared to be normal in size and did not display any bulging; however the entire surface of the
eye was white and cloudy. This condition maybe causing undue pain and discomfort to the animal. The animal must
be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and the prescribed treatment must be administered.
