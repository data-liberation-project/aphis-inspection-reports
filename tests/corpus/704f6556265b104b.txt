WATERING.
There was an accumulation of algae and grime inside the water bottles in the rabbit enclosure. The method of
cleaning the water bottles described to the USDA inspector consisted of rinsing the bottles with clean water and
replacing with fresh water. The facility must ensure that all water receptacles remain clean and sanitary for the
health and well- being of the animals. The facility replaced the water bottles with new bottles during the inspection.
This item was corrected at the time of inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility's General Manager.
