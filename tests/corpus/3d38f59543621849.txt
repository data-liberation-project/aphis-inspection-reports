ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1040 on
06-Feb-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I knocked on the front door two times. When there was no answer, I called the primary
phone number for Mr. Beeler, heard a brief, quiet greeting and then the call was dropped. I then called back at
10:41 AM and left a message. I honked the horn of the government vehicle two times. After waiting for
approximately 30 minutes, I left the facility.
