ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:50 AM on
12-DEC-17.
Upon arrival at the facility at 10:50 A.M., the entrance gate was closed. The vehicle's horn was then sounded. At
10:57 A.M. a telephone call was made to the licensee. A message was left at that time. This inspector waited at
the entrance to the facility from 10:50 AM to 11:35 A.M.
Subsequent to the visit, later in the day, the licensee returned the telephone call and informed this inspector that
she is no longer conducting regulated activity and that there are no longer any animals at the facility.
The licensee was instructed to send the Raleigh Regional Office a written notification requesting a cancellation of
her license.
