2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During an unsupervised tour visit on July 8, 2019 a group of 4 adults and 6 children approached the lynx primary
enclosure in the area between a partial public barrier and primary enclosure. There was no guide or attendant at the
lynx pen to prevent people from approaching the lynx fence or from gaining entry between the partial barrier and
primary enclosure. Lack of supervision and lack of an adequate barrier fence allowed the public to approach the
lynxes' primary fence and a lynx was able to reach through the primary fence and grab the shirt of a 2.5 year old
boy. The lynx pulled the boy towards the fence and scratched (likely clawed) the boy's head, forehead and forearm.
On July 13, 2019 a group was lead by a tour guide to the open-top prairie dog enclosure. While the guide started to
take the group of 10 to another area, two people stayed behind to take a photo. The guide said one of the people
stuck their hand into the enclosure trying to get the prairie dog to jump up, which resulted in the person getting
bitten on the finger/knuckle. There was no direct supervision by a guide at that time to prevent the actions of the
public, and the distance and barrier were not adequate to prevent the public from being able to put their hands into
the enclosure and contact a prairie dog.
Due to the lack of physical barriers, the safety of the public depended solely on the supervision of the guides. Lack
of adequate supervision and lack of physical barriers has lead to animals causing physical harm to public members.
Lack of adequate barriers and or distance from exhibited animals could lead to future injuries or harm to the public
and/or animals.
The facility must ensure that during public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to
the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing
public. Where responsible, knowledgeable attendants are not available at any time of public contact with animals,
appropriate distance and/or barriers must be in place to prevent contact between the animals and public.
3.75(c)(1) REPEATHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures and shelves/boxes for the two Albifron Lemurs and two Vervet monkeys are constructed of
materials that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and are not being replaced when worn or soiled. While one
shelf has been covered with santizable material in the vervet area, there are still wooden shelves and platforms in
the lemur and vervet enclosures that are made of bare wood and soiled. These fixtures have a wet,
gummy-appearing brown grime on the surfaces that is stuck to them due to continued hand and foot traffic from the
non-human primates.
All surfaces that come in contact with non-human primates must be constructed in a manner and made of materials
that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Wood or cement
that is not sealed cannot be appropriately sanitized in order to prevent possible health and disease issues due to
buildup of dirt and grime.
The licensee must ensure surfaces and furniture for the primates are constructed of materials that can be readily
cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced promptly when worn or soiled.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A perimeter fence variance was issued in July 2017, giving the licensee more time to complete the fence. Since
then, the licensee has completed the fence around half of the property with three entry gates still missing. This
variance was only provided to cover only the species that were on site at the time. However, since the last
inspection in 2018, enclosures for two Albifron lemurs, a Geoffrey cat and two badgers have been added to the
outdoor area with no perimeter fence surrounding these new enclosures.
A tiger enclosure has recently been added that uses two sides of the wooden planked 8ft perimeter fence for two of
its primary enclosure sides, so there is not at least 3 feet between the enclosure and a secondary perimeter fence.
The enclosure does have a top on it, however using the perimeter fence also as the primary enclosure fence has
not been approved by a variance and doesn't meet perimeter fence requirements.
When there is no perimeter fence, animals that escape their primary enclosures can easily escape from the entire
facility. Lack of a perimeter fence also allows for easier contact between unwanted animals/people and the animals
housed in their primary enclosures. This possible contact can cause increased stress, disease transmission, or
possible injury to the regulated animals as well as injury to the unauthorized animal/public. A primary enclosure
using the perimeter fence on two sides without the 3ft distance between the perimeter fence and primary fence
increases risk of unauthorized access/contact with regulated animals.

All outdoor housing facilities must be surrounded by a perimeter fence of sufficient height (either six feet for the
fox/primates/coatis/raccoons or eight feet-for the tiger) with sufficient distance between the primary enclosure andperimeter fence to prevent unauthorized contact or entry to the facility's animals.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
