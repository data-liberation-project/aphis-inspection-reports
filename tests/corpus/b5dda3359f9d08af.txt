FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for the goats contained elements that are potentially hazardous to the animals:
- Wooden pallets were broken and had protruding nails.
- Sharp ends were protruding from the wire mesh panel that comprises the gate
Some of the exotic feline enclosures were in need of repair:
- In the inside shelter enclosure for "Mystery" the linoleum on the floor was peeling, and deteriorating.
- Inside another feline enclosure a wooden structure is detaching from the wall
Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair could result in injury or escape. Sharp objects and electrical wires
could cause injury or death. Deteriorating surfaces present an ingestion risk, threaten structural strength, and
impede cleaning.
Animal enclosures should be free of objects that could cause injury to the animals. Enclosures should be
maintained in good repair, so that they can be kept clean. Enclosures should be regularly repaired so as to maintain
their structural integrity and prevent escape or injury.

SANITATION.
Throughout the facility there was evidence of a severe rat infestation, including the presence of rat feces in animal
enclosures and around food storage area. One rat was observed passing between animal enclosures in broad
daylight.
Vermin can transmit disease and contaminate food. Rats could bite felines that attempt to hunt them. The presence
of rat feces around food and bedding is unsanitary. The facility should work with professional exterminators to
address this serious vermin infestation.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
