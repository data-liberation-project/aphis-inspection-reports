3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
At least sixteen enclosures containing approximately one hundred guinea pigs have an excessive amount of feces.
The feces are covering nearly the entire floor space in the enclosures resulting in very little clean flooring for the
animals. The licensee stated that the enclosures are cleaned out weekly.
A buildup of excessive feces can increase disease hazards to the animals. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and
sanitized often enough to prevent an excessive accumulation of excreta and debris. The licensee must clean the
enclosures often enough to ensure there is no excessive buildup of feces in order to support the health and
well-being of the animals.
