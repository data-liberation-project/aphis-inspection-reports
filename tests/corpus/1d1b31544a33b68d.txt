HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
After the performance, three elephants were led out of the area toward the housing area. Prior to entering their
primary enclosure they were offered a drink. No handler or attendant was present behind the elephants and the
gates intended to keep the public from the elephant housing were not in place behind the animals. A member of the
public and a small boy approched the animals and the man positioned the boy near the back of the animal for a
photograph. Sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public must be in place
to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct: This point forward
This inspection was performed at the Zembo Shrine Circus in Altoona, PA. An exit briefing was conducted with the
responsible agent.
