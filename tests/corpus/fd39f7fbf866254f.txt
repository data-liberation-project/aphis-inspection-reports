ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
-A few expired vials of Propofol are being stored in a bag in the freezer. The freezer is located in an area that is
readily accessible to the students and/ or staff. According to the facility representative, the anesthetic is being stored
there until it can be disposed of. Although Propofol is not a controlled substance, it is an anesthetic that must be
used with care and diligence in clinical medicine and research, and should be labeled and stored in a manner which
minimizes its potential to be misused.
-Three bottles of expired dental hygiene spray were observed in an exam/ treatment room.
-Un-labeled pill vials containing vitamins were observed in student boxes/trays.
-Three small plastic dispensing bottles with no concentration or expiration dates on label, containing betadine
solution, betadine scrub and alcohol, were observed in the crash cart.
Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

cleaned and sanitized as required. Fecal material and other debris can accumulate in small crevices increasing the
potential of disease hazards in these areas. The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed and maintained
in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The following housekeeping issues were noted:
- There is a heavy amount of clutter and a moderate amount of dust present in an office/ lab supply storage area.
The counter tops and carts are covered in equipment, medical supplies, papers, and other materials. The presence
of clutter may impede cleaning.
- In a treatment area, the counter top is cluttered with bags, supplies, and containers. The presence of clutter may
impede cleaning.
- In the surgery suite, there are 2 moderately rusty surgery and i.v. fluid stands. The presence of rust can prevent
the required cleaning and sanitizing of medical equipment.
- In the surgery suite, there is a moderate amount of dust present on a vent and on cautery units which are being
stored on the ground. There is an uncovered small plastic tub containing medical materials being stored on the
ground under this vent. There is unused equipment being stored on the top of the cabinets.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean to
protect the animals from injury, and to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this subpart. Premises must be
kept free of discarded matter.
