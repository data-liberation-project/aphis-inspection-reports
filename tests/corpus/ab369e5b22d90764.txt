****Various cats have signs of eye problems. These cats have not been seen by the veterinarian:
A litter of 5 kittens (mother is "Jhoni Lynx") have varying degrees of eye problems:
-A blue point (white-colored) female kitten is squinting and has crusty material around both eyes and the eyes
appear to be watering more than normal. The clear part of her eye appears greyish in color.
-Two black male kittens are squinting and have some crusty material around both eyes. One of the black kittens
also has discharge around his eyes.
-A blue female kitten was seen squinting in her left eye.
-A brown tabby female was seen squinting mildly in both eyes.
In a different litter, a brown spotted tabby male Bengal kitten (mother is "Blue Bayou" #34, blue-colored Persian)
had crusty material around the eyes and was squinting slightly.
"Jewel" #42, a female blue point Himalayan cat was observed to be squinting in her right eye and the eye appeared
to be reddened on inside part of the eyelids and to be watering more than normal.
A blue colored male long haired exotic kitten (mother is "Avalon" #25) was observed to have a crusted material
around both eyes. His right eye could not be seen due to the crusted material and hair.
Eye problems can be contagious to other cats, can be caused by many different things and can be painful for cats.
The licensee must ensure affected kittens'/cats' eye problems are evaluated by a veterinarian and receive
appropriate treatment and if a contagious cause for the eye problems is found the licensee must work with the
attending veterinarian to ensure preventative measures are put in place at the facility to prevent spread of the eye
problems to other cats. A treatment plan for each affected kitten/cat must be documented, followed, and available
for inspectors if requested.
****A female blue lynx point Persian ("Jhoni Lynx", a female #26) was noticed at times to be scratching her left ear
against the enclosure and also with her paw. Closer observation revealed that she had a dark-colored dischargebelow the opening of her left ear. Discharge and the way she was scratching at her ear suggests that her ear is
uncomfortable (possibly painful or itchy). If left untreated, the condition could worsen or possibly spread to other
cats. "Jhoni Lynx" must be evaluated by a veterinarian to ensure that appropriate treatment is received for her ear.
A treatment plan must be documented, followed, and available for inspectors if requested.

****A female blue lynx point Persian ("Jhoni Lynx", a female #26) was noticed at times to be scratching her left ear
against the enclosure and also with her paw. Closer observation revealed that she had a dark-colored discharge
below the opening of her left ear. Her scratching and the discharge suggest she may have a problem with her left
ear. The licensee and animal caretaker report that they had not noticed "Johni Lynx" doing this until we pointed it
out. Lack of daily observations can allow health problems to go un-treated. A routine of daily observations of each
cat/kitten must be developed and put into practice so that health problems are reported to the attending veterinarian
and addressed in a timely manner.
