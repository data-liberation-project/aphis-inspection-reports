2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two adult miniature Poodles (red male, microchip #990000008179747) and (black female, microchip#
900085001245099) have matted hair on their belly, hindquarters, chest and feet. The matted hair is twisted and wet and
is trapping wood shavings in the hair. Matted hair can trap dirt, debris, and moisture and cause pain and discomfort. It
can foster skin infections and hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. Matted hair does not maintain the
same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective
program for coat maintenance for the health and well-being of the dog.

There are 2 medications in the cabinet in the whelp house that are expired. A 100 ml bottle of Dexamethasone injectable
expired on 6/2022 and a bottle of injectable Vitamin B expired 11/2022. They were stored with other medications that are
in use and could also be used. Expired medications can change to lose effectiveness and use of the expired medication
may result in inadequate dosing or harmful effects. Expired medications must be removed from the kennel to prevent their
use.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male Chihuahua puppy (M-261-22, DOB 11/1/2022) was in an enclosure with 2 litter mates and their dam. This puppy
was in very poor condition, almost nonresponsive to the littermate trying to play with him. His hair coat was rough and he
was about half the size of his littermates. One litter mate tugged on his ear and the owner was instructed to remove the
puppy from the enclosure. The licensee was called during the inspection to gather information about any diagnosis and
treatment. He stated that he had called the veterinarian a couple days ago and was instructed to give the puppy milk and
syrup. This treatment was not effective but the licensee did not contact the veterinarian for further evaluation and a
proper diagnosis and treatment plan. There was no medical record of the puppy's illness and treatment. The puppy was
placed in a separate enclosure with a heat lamp.
Failure to correctly communicate issues of abnormal animal health or lack of response to instructed treatment to the
attending veterinarian in a timely manner, is not adequate veterinary care. Without adequate veterinary care, an animal’s
condition may worsen, and if infectious, can spread to other individuals. Correct by ensuring that animals and conditions
are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be properly examined, diagnosed, and treated. The
license must communicate accurately and timely to the veterinarian any problems of animal health, behavior, and well
being.

Housing facilities, general.
There were 2 plastic garbage containers filled with shavings for bedding material. The containers did not have lids on
them and they could not be found. Bedding material can become contaminated from mice, insects and other pests or
become wet and spoiled. When that happens, it will no longer be adequate bedding material for the dogs. To prevent
this, all open bags of bedding material must be stored in a leakproof container with a tightly fitting lid.
