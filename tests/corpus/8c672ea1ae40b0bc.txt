OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Some nonhuman primate enclosures had inadequate shelter from rain and wind. An enclosure with a howler
monkey had a bamboo or wood slat-type cover over, and on the sides of, the area of the nest barrel but the spacing
of the slats/strands were far apart so it would not keep rain or wind off the open-ended nest barrel. The bedding
provided was sticking out of the barrel so if it rained the bedding would get wet. The enclosure with two Hamadryas
baboons also had inadequate shelter from the rain. Their only shelter was a dog igloo on the ground with some
shade from trees. There were no other area of the pen with overhead cover to protect them from rain. If it rains
during warm humid months the inside of the igloo may also get warm and stuffy and there would be no other option
for these animals to get out of the rain. Heavy rains could also cause water/mud splash into the dog igloo on the
ground. Outdoor housing for nonhuman primates must provide adequate shelter from the elements (sun, rain, snow,
wind, cold, and other weather conditions) at all times. Provide additional protection from rain and wind to the
nonhuman primates.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the enclosure housing five squirrel monkeys there is a cage inside their sheltered night house which had a strong
odor of urine and feces. There was a large wet area and an accumulation of fecal and food waste in the shavings on
the floor. There was a large pile of food waste on the elevated resting shelf in that cage as well. In the enclosures
housing the two pair of tamarins the passageway tubes into their nest boxes had dark colored grime on them. The
enclosure with the three young Celebes had a resting platform with a coating of brown material. Soiled surfaces
should be spot cleaned daily and excreta and food waste should be remove at least daily and as often as necessary
to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and excessive odors.

3.127(d) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence at the front of the property next to the camels was damaged in one section and was less than 6
feet high. This fence is also part of the overall perimeter fence for the entire property which contains potentially
dangerous animals. The perimeter fence should be repaired to re-establish the required minimum height of at least
8 feet.
This inspection was conducted with two of the licensees, and the exit interview was conducted with the undersigned
licensee.
