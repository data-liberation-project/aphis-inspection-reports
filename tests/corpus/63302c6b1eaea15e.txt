3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is one outdoor enclosure on the east side of the facility housing three dogs with a large hole under the
enclosure fence that leaves a gap between the fence and the ground. The hole is under a food receptacle attached
to the fence. Holes under fences and structures can cause injury to dogs who try to crawl in the space between the
fence and the ground. Holes under fences can also allow dogs to escape the enclosure or other animals to gain
access to the enclosure.
***
There is a tarp hanging into an enclosure on the south side of the sheltered building The tarp has some shredded
edges and is within reach of the dogs. The dogs could chew on the tarp leading to injury and intestinal upset.

has broken along one side and the shelter it is sagging. Some of the plastic that had broken off of the shelter is
stucking upright in the sand that has accumulated within the shelter.
The licensee must maintain the facility in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals
securely.

Surfaces that are not maintained so that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized can play a role in diseasetransmission. The licensee must ensure that surfaces be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing
facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 24 November 2014.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are at least 2 enclosure in the sheltered facility that have a build-up of grime on the interior hard surfaces.

must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs or cats come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease
hazards. To be corrected by 11 November 2014.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two of the outdoor enclosures on the east side of the property are without adequate wind and rain breaks. Failure
to provide a barrier from the elements can result in a dog that becomes wet and uncomfortable. In some weather, a
dog that does not have a barrier from the elements is unable to maintain a safe body temperature. All dogs must be
provided with shelter from the elements which includes wind and rain breaks at the entrance to shelter structures.
