* A four year old black, white and tan King Charles Cavalier, female, (ID # 0A01412579) had an excessive buildup
of a dark brown to yellowish material on the canine teeth (the large carnassial teeth) and front teeth extending up to
the gum line. The right side cheek teeth are covered with a buildup of grayish to cream colored material. The gums
were dark red and swollen on both sides of the mouth. There was a grayish creamy material along the gum line
near the cheek teeth on both sides. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can
be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal.
