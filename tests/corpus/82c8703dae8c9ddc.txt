2.31(e) CRITICAL
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On 10 September 2015, procedures relating to one study protocol were not conducted as approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A surgical procedure was performed under general
anesthesia but pre-operative analgesics were not used as described in the approved protocol.
Although the animal was under general anesthesia, the impact upon the animal related to analgesia is unknown. As
the investigator included pre-operative analgesics in the study protocol that was approved by the IACUC, the animal
may have experienced unrelieved pain.
Procedures must be conducted in a manner to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that
which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research, including provision for the use of analgesic,
anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs where indicated and appropriate to minimize discomfort and pain to animals.
The noncompliance was corrected prior to the inspection.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with Facility Representatives.
