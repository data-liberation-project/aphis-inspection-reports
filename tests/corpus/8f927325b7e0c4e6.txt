3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Construction of housing facilities must be maintained and building surfaces in contact with dogs must be impervious
to moisture. Surfaces must be replaced when worn. The wood surface surrounding the doggy door on the west
outdoor shelter is worn, not impervious and in some areas missing. Non impervious surfaces cannot be cleaned and
sanitized properly. The owner must repair/replace and make impervious this area of the wood frame. This can help
insure that dogs are in a safe, healthy, and disease free environment. Correct by 04-03-2016
