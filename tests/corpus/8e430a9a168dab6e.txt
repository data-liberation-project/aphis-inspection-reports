ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult male coatimundi, Cody, was observed to be limping on his right rear leg. This animal was non-weight
bearing during the inspection on February 20, 2018 and was cited for this problem on the inspection report. This
animal still has not been evaluated or treated by a veterinarian. Lameness can be caused by a variety of problems
including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the health and
well-being of the animal.

***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, still has hair loss with red and inflamed skin on the knuckles of all four feet.
This animal was cited for this problem on the inspection report dated February 20, 2018. Since the last inspection
the alopecia and skin appears to not be improving. A facility representative stated that he had noticed the animal’s
condition not improving and continues to itch at his feet. The fox also had excessively long nails that needed to be
trimmed.

***An intact adult male tricolor goat, Thor, that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS
inspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing on this limb. The
most recent veterinary exam occurred on May 27, 2017. The attending veterinarian recommended in his
documentation that 1) more diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2)
if the facility representatives do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the
animal. Currently, this animal is off exhibit but still has not received proper veterinary care for the further diagnostic
workup and treatment of his lameness. To date, the licensee has not followed the veterinary recommendations.
This goat was seen by the attending veterinarian on April 13, 2018 and was euthanized.
***One brown and black, adult, female sheep, Goldberry, was observed to be excessively thin, with protruding hip
bones, spine, and ribs on February 6, 2018 and was cited for this problem on the inspection report. Since the last
inspection, it appears that her condition is not improving with the change of diet that was recommended by the
attending veterinarian. The bones of her spine, hips, and each rib were easily seen by both APHIS inspectors. She
had a rough, unthrifty hair coat with multiple patches of hair loss along her back and right and left sides. Also, she
now has some lameness seen in her right front forelimb. Poor body condition can be an indication of health issues,including parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, and systemic disease. Lameness can be caused by a variety of
problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the
health and well-being of the animal.
This sheep was seen by the attending veterinarian on April 13, 2018 and was euthanized.
***One black and white baby sheep, which was approximately 2 months old, was having trouble walking and
standing. The facility representative claims the baby sheep was stepped on by the adult sheep when he went into
the enclosure at the time of inspection. The sheep was removed from the enclosure and placed into a private
enclosure in the barn. The sheep was circling, stumbling, and had trouble getting up and standing. It was advised by
the APHIS inspectors to have this sheep seen by a veterinarian and evaluated that day.
This sheep was brought to the attending veterinarian on April 10, 2018 by the facility representative and the animal
was euthanized that day due to having suffered a possible spinal injury.

***The facility representative is using two antibiotics Liquamycin LA-200 and Penicillin off-label and without
consulting the attending veterinarian before use. A licensee cannot treat any animal without consulting their
attending veterinarian first to get the proper medication, dosage, and treatment plan for the animal. Using drugs that
are not first approved by the attending veterinarian can yield unanticipated reactions when used off labeled and at
an incorrect dose.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility. The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plans for the problems cited above. From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all
animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the
program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male, adult Ibex hybrid, has a 1 cm in diameter dark red mass above his right eye. The right eye appears to be
red, inflamed and bulging out of the eye socket. This animal was seen by the attending veterinarian about 7 days
ago and was given Terramycin to treat an eye infection. The facility representative claims the mass above the eye
was not present during the attending veterinarian's evaluation and he believes the condition is getting worse.Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and
the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
3.130 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
Two pot-belly pigs and one goat did not have access to drinking water, the water receptacle was empty. Lack of
adequate amount of water can lead to dehydration and other health issues. If potable water is not accessible to the
animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Frequency
of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
