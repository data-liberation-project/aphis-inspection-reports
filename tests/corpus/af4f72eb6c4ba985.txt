2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Identification.
***There were 8 puppies which were less than 16 weeks of age at the facility that did not have individual
identification. There were no cage cards on the enclosures to identify the puppies. Identification is required in order
to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs less than 16 weeks of age are identified by an official tag as described in Sec.
2.51, a legible tattoo approved by the Administrator, a microchip, or a cage card (if maintained as a litter with their
dam and housed within the same primary enclosure).
To be corrected by: June 8, 2014.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces- (3) Cleaning.
***The sheltered building, along most of the underside of the east and west run of enclosures on the outside,
effecting approximately 62 dogs there is a buildup of hair, feces, and grime. Ten dog entry doors had a buildup of a
brownish grime covering about 30% - 50% of the doorway. The accumulation of the dirt and grime can cause
diseases and attract pests. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must
ensure animal enclosures, areas inside of housing facility and adjacent areas must be kept clean to ensure the
health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must spot clean daily as required.
