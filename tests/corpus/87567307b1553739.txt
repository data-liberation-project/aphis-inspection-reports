OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is no perimeter fence around the enclosure housing 2 ring-tailed lemurs. Lack of a perimeter fence does not
protect the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals.
Also, without a perimeter fence there is no secondary containment system. A perimeter fence must be provided for
this enclosure to keep unauthorized people and unwanted animals from coming in contact with the lemurs and
provide a secondary containment system in the event of an escape.
