ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One older male lion named Aslan was in the outdoor portion of a sheltered housing enclosure. The lion was missing
hair over both lower front legs (just above paws), both lower rear legs (just above paws) and along the right
hindquarters from the hip to the knee. The skin showing in all places was pink to red in color. An open, raw, bright
red, round lesion approximately ½ inch in diameter was visible on the lower right rear leg. The lion was observed
rising from a lying position and walking. The lion appeared stiff and stilted during rising and walked with an
occasional slight stumble. The flooring of the enclosure was concrete both indoors and outdoors. A white firm
slippery looking resting mat was noted on the floor indoors. The facility representative states the lion is on a joint
supplement but no other medications and has gotten worse in the last couple of weeks. Untreated skin and joint
issues can lead to pain and distress to the animal and secondary infections. The attending veterinarian last saw the
lion on Jan. 9, 2016. She has not been contacted since the lion(cid:25)'s condition worsened.
One 14 year old white tiger named Kailash was very thin with protruding vertebrae along his back and protruding hip
bones. The facility representative stated they were aware he was losing weight and were trying to feed him a
special diet. She stated he was eating but was not gaining weight back. The attending veterinarian last saw the tiger
on Jan. 9, 2016. She stated she recommended blood work be done, but the facility declined. The facility has not
updated the veterinarian on Kailash(cid:25)s condition since then. Weight loss can be a sign of many different medical
conditions.
One tiger named Mooton was housed separately in an outdoor area behind the barn. The facility representative
stated that he was not eating well the last few days and seemed stressed by ongoing construction. He was
separated to monitor his appetite and well-being. Loss of appetite can be a symptom of a medical issue, stress or
other issues. The veterinarian has not yet been contacted about this tiger.
These cats were seen by the attending veterinarian during this inspection and further treatments were prescribed.
Treatments to be instituted by 2-24-16.
2.40(b)(3)ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection at least three big cats were observed with problems of animal health and well-being.
Although the caretakers observed the conditions, and in one case were taking actions, the attending veterinarian
was not contacted. When the inspectors contacted the attending veterinarian she indicated she was not notified of
the deteriorating condition of the male lion. The veterinarian was last at the facility on 1-9-16. The facility needs to
have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate
information of problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed. To be corrected with future health
issues.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A juvenile 3-4 year old chimpanzee returned with his primary caretaker to this facility 3 days ago. During this
inspection the chimpanzee was brought out of a metal crate cage in the apartment where he was put while the
caretaker was working outside. The metal enclosure measured 40 inches long by 24 inches wide by 26 inches
high. Although a majority of time the chimpanzee would not be housed in this enclosure, the enclosure must be
meet the minimum space requirements. The enclosure only provides 6.7 square feet of floor space whereas 25.1
square feet is required. Also the enclosure has to be a minimum of 84 inches high. To be corrected by 2-26-16.
3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The current Environmental Enhancement Plan does not address the juvenile chimpanzee on the property. This is
the only primate currently at this facility, therefore it is unable to see and hear nonhuman primates of its own or
compatible species. The plan is to describe how the social needs are provided for any nonhuman primate unable to
see or hear other nonhuman primates. To be corrected by 3-18-16.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The leopard housing consists of a large outdoor enclosure and four small separate feeding stations behind the main
enclosure. During the inspection one adult leopard was confined to the feeding stations to facilitate behavioral
observations. Two adult leopards were in the large outdoor enclosure. Each of the metal feeding stations are
approximately three feet tall, two feet wide and six feet long, all connected by a hallway. The facility representative
stated the leopards were rotated so each could get some exercise. The feeding stations section is not large enough
to provide the leopards adequate space to perform normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of
movement. The vertical height restriction of the feeding stations prevents the leopards from jumping and stretching
vertically. The short crate sections prevent the leopards from running, jumping and climbing. Inadequate space may
lead to stress, poor condition and abnormal behavior patterns. Enclosures used to house the leopards must beconstructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow the animals to make normal postural
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Correct by March 18, 2016.
