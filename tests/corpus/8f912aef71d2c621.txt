Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Over the course of this inspection several adult sugar gliders were found to have serious eye lesions. The lesions have
not been observed by the facility and therefore no medical care has been provided. These animals are housed in a large
building divided into several rooms kept in unsanitary conditions with extensive buildup of excreta and food all over their
cages and an infestation of mice and roaches.
Inside room 3, an adult grey-yellow with black stripe sugar glider (cage ID #166) has a sunken right eye. A white patch
covers the entire surface of the eyeball giving it a milky color. The area around the eye is redden with watery discharge.
Inside room 4, there is an adult grey-yellow with black stripe sugar glider (cage ID #25) with the right eye completely shut
and sunken in. There is no bulging appearance which gives the impression the eye is missing, or it has ruptured. There
is a dark yellow staining of the skin around the eye. The animal has also long nails that must be trimmed. A second adult
grey-yellow with black stripe sugar glider (cage ID #268) has watery eyes and a sunken left eye. A white patch covers the
entire surface of the eyeball giving it a bluish coloration. This tissue appears to be inflamed around both eyes.
Inside room 7, an adult yellow sugar glider (cage ID #45) has an extensive lesion on the left eye. The hair around the
eyeball is missing and the skin is swollen, red and moist. The eyeball is sunken in and barely visible. There is yellow
discharge and dark crusty material around the eye. When light was shined directly to the eye, the animal quickly moved
away and sought cover to avoid the light. A second adult grey-yellow with black stripe sugar glider (cage ID #38) has

asymmetrical eyes. The right eye is swollen, and the left eye is sunken in with white opacity inside the eyeball.
Eye lesions can be very painful and indicative of an underlying disease. The animals must be examined by a veterinarian
immediately for diagnosis and treatment.
To be corrected by February 16th, 2022.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Over the course of this inspection a total of 5 adult sugar gliders were found to have lesions on one or both of their eyes.
The lesions have not been observed by the facility prior to inspection and occurred prior to the daily observation for that
day. The lesions range from missing eyeballs to loss of the normal structure of the eye. These lesions can be very
painful and impair the vision of the animal. Without proper daily observation to assess the animals there is no effective
way to gauge the health and well being of the animals. There is no effective way to treat or assess a sick or injured animal
in a timely manner, and there is no effective way to communicate in a timely manner any issues that may arise to the
attending veterinarian. Ensure daily observation of all animals throughout the facility and direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian when needed.

Facilities, indoor.
The overall odor from the waste and lack of sanitation throughout the indoor facility was extremely pungent and
overwhelming. This caused discomfort to both inspectors and they had to wear N95 masks throughout the inspection of
the indoor facility. Several rooms had open windows and box fans. The rooms with open windows or fans in use had a
decrease in odor. Some of the windows are in disrepair and do not open. The odor was still present on the inspectors and
their clothes even several hours after the inspection. The employee accompanying the inspectors informed them that due
to a lack of employees, some of the rooms are only cleaned as often as once every three weeks. Inadequate sanitation

increases noxious odors in the rooms. Inadequate ventilation poses a direct health and safety hazard to the animals.
Multiple animals on inspection were seen with ocular problems which could be a result from inadequate ventilation. The
licensee must provide adequate ventilation for all housing facilities to ensure the health and prevent the discomfort of all
animals at all times. Correct by 02.16.2022

Sanitation.
During the course of the focused inspection, there continued to be an overall and severe lack of sanitation in the following
cages.

Room 1: Cage #42 with 2 Gliders
Room 2: Cage #133 with 2 Gliders
Room 4: Cage #54 with 2 Gliders
Cage #187 with 2 Gliders
Cage #25 with 1 Gliders
Room 7: Cage #84 with 2 Gliders
Room 9: Cage 240 with 2 Gliders
Room 10: Cage #436 with 2 Gliders

During the course of the focused inspection, one Sugar Glider food receptacle in Room 2, cage # 69 housing 2 Gliders
was observed as having a dark brown crusty organic buildup inside the receptacle that was neither the size, shape, color,
or texture of the dry food used. An additional food receptacle in Room 10, cage # 56 housing 2 Gliders was
approximately half way full of a wet mushy tannish substance that had neither the look, texture, shape or color of the dry

food used.

Excreta and hair were observed collected in those above mentioned cages and caught through the wire floors of most
cages, and a dried brown mushy substance which had the appearance of dried fecal material was present on the tops of
a majority of the nesting structures inside the cages which are round capped pieces of pvc pipe, approximately 4-5 inches
round. The animals within those cages listed above were not provided any clean and sanitary space within the cage in
which to sit, stand, rest, move, or otherwise make normal postural adjustments. Animals that are subjected to soiled
enclosures and food can become destressed, or sick. All enclosures and food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized
as often as necessary to provide for the health and well being of the animals housed within.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
