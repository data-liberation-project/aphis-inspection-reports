Sanitation.
The flooring of the enclosure housing two ferrets was covered in excreta, food waste, and other debris. The litter box
provided had an accumulation of feces and had not been appropriately cleaned in several days. The employees working
at the store stated that the enclosure is cleaned about once a month.
The enclosure for the ferrets needs to be cleaned and a cleaning/maintenance plan needs to be implemented to prevent
contamination of the animals, to minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors.
To be corrected by March 4, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
