2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, male pug "Tank" (unable to read microchip) has a thick white discharge in and around the right eye and some
dried, dark discharge in the hair coat around the eye. There is a dark discolored spot in the center of the surface of
the right eye. The licensee stated that this was noticed a couple of days ago and that he is treating the dog with
injectable penicillin every other day, triple antibiotic ointment on the eye lid, and "Refresh" eye lubricant drops in the
eye. The licensee has not consulted a veterinarian regarding the medical care for the problem in this dog. Eye
problems can be a result of trauma, genetic and other medical problems and can be painful. This dog also has
heavy accumulation of brown discharge completely coating the upper "cheek teeth" (premolars and molars) and
most of the upper canine teeth. The gum line of the upper left "cheek teeth" has recessed up from the surface of the
teeth. There is a white discharge and some grass like material trapped along the gum line of the left upper "cheek
teeth." A few of the upper "cheek teeth" are loose on left side. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue
and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall
health of the animal. The licensee must have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on
9 April 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the
inspector upon request.
Adult, female, black and white Havanese (unable to read microchip) has a matted coat. Approximately 75% of her
limbs, rear end, and torso were matted. The mats were tight against the skin on the legs and rear end. Matted coats
can cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted coats do not provide complete protection against
the elements. The licensee must remove the matted hair from this dog. As part of the facility's program of veterinary
care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance to ensure that animals are cleaned
when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a regular basis. To be corrected by end of
business on 9 April 2014.
The licensee is using a bottle of injectable penicillin on one dog in the facility. There are no directions approved by
the attending veterinarian for the use of this medication in dogs on the bottle, in the program of veterinary care, or in
the animal housing areas. Lack of directions from a licensed veterinarian for use of medications can result in
improper use and potential harm for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facilityare labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices and have directions for their use. To be
corrected by end of business on 9 April 2014.
2.50(b)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
At the time of the inspection the licensee could not locate the microchip scanner. Without the availability of a
scanner, proper identification of the dogs could not be verified. The microchip scanner must be readily available to
APHIS officials during inspections. Correct by next inspection.
2.76(a)(1)
RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
The current APHIS form 7005 is incomplete. The "Acquired from" column for approximately 8 dogs is blank.
Complete and accurate records are essential to keep track of dogs in the kennel. This form must include all
required information. Correct by 7 May 2014.
On two separate APHIS form 7006's, the identification number "140102" was used for a puppy born on 11/15/13
and a different puppy born on 1/2/14. Duplication of identification numbers does not allow the dogs identity to be
known with certainty. These forms must include accurate information. Correct with next transaction.
This routine inspection and initial exit interview were conducted on 4/7/2014. A final exit interview was conducted
on 4/8/2014.
