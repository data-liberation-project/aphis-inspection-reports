FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 4/27/2015, two male crossbred goats, ID #S2AD766 and #S2AD757, knocked down one of the woven fences of
the primary enclosure. They were able to climb out of their enclosure and graze on ornamental plants. Facility
employees found the animals outside their enclosure and observed that they were vomiting and distressed. The
facility employees took immediate corrective actions and repaired the damaged fencing. The facility must ensure
that animal outdoor facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to contain the animals
inside to protect them from injury.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
