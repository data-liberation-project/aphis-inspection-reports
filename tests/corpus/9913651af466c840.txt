PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The adult male Olive baboon enclosure has several sharp points from a section of wire mesh. There is also a loose
wire in the entranceway between two sections of the enclosure. The ends of the wire fencing around the cut-out
section has numerous loose wire ends, some pointing inside the enclosure. No lacerations were observed on the
animal. Surfaces in the housing facilities of non-human primates must be free of jagged edges and sharp points that
may injure the animal. Sharp wire ends can cause lacerations to the skin and be broken off and ingested. Correct by
ensuring that these sharp edges are removed or made inaccessible to any animals. The licensee removed the loose
wires in the enclosure at the time of the exit briefing.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**The enclosure with two goats had several wires that had broken off the enclosure fence at one end and were
sticking inside the enclosure. No lacerations were observed on any of the goats. Sharp points or jagged edges
could cause injury and pain to an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to break off and be eaten or stepped on.
Correct by ensuring all housing facilities are free of sharp points that could injury animals. Furthermore, monitor all
wire fences and enclosures to ensure loose wires are removed and could not harm any animals.
