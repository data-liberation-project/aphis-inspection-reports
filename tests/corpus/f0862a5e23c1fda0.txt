ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male deer did not receive adequate veterinary care until after his apparent injury was healed. On June 19.
2015, this facilities attending veterinarian visited an adult male adult deer and the written report stated; " It appeared
as though the lower lip was avulsed from its attachment and had healed, however its new attachment was more
proximal on the mandible." During the prior inspection on June 18, 2015, this deer was in discomfort, had its tongue
out and in a licking motion. The attending veterinarian and curator were both not available for me to contact to
ensure adequate veterinary care was being provided. Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of
adequate veterinary care that include: The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
CORRECTED.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian was not notified in a timely manner on an adult male deer which needed veterinary care
from what appeared to be injury. During this inspection I read the veterinarians report from the June 19. 2015, visit
and it stated; " It appeared as though the lower lip was avulsed from its attachment and had healed, however its
new attachment was more proximal on the mandible." During the prior inspection on June 18, 2015, I observed this
deer had its tongue out and repeatedly was licking and there was no communications with the attending veterinarian
on the deers medical condition until after the inspection. Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of
adequate veterinary care that include: Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being;
Provided, however, That daily observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending
veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.
CORRECTED

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
After arriving at this facility which is open to the public, I approached the Director's office and no one was available. I
was able to walk to the bear enclosure without any presence of an employee. Nearby was an office where there
was an administrative clerk present, however she was unaware that I had arrived at the facility. Due to the locations
of the both offices of the administrative clerk and the director, including easy public access (no gates or fencing)
employees would not able to see members of the public entering the facility. During this inspection, the director had
business to conduct outside the facility and the curator has only been at the facility on few occasions since June,
2015. Although Even with barriers around enclosures, members of the public should not be able to enter this facility
without employee oversight, especially with a potentially dangerous bear on exhibit. During public exhibition, any
animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public to assure the safety of
animals and the public.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal fence posts that are used to secure the bear enclosure to the ground have excessive rust where several
have detached. There are several resting surfaces which have steel poles holding them up that are leaning outward
and could fall if the bear climbed on top of them. These metal posts and poles are not of strength and or structurally
sound and need to be repaired or replaced. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: OCTOBER 9, 2015.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The bear enclosure does not have adequate shelter from inclement weather. The enclosure currently has shelter
on top of the enclosure but not on any of the sides to afford the bear protection and to prevent discomfort during
heavy rains, winds and cooler temperatures in the winter. I observed green algae throughout the enclosure's
concrete surface which shows the need for additional shelter for the bear to remain dry. Appropriate shelter needsto be provided for animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort at all times.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: OCTOBER 9, 2015.
The exit interview was conducted with the facilities Administrative Clerk and Director.
