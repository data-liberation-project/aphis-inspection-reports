ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1645 on
05-Jun-18. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn and
then contacted the licensee by phone. I left messages at three different phone numbers and waited 30 minutes. I
did not receive a phone call back. I then left the property.
End of report.
