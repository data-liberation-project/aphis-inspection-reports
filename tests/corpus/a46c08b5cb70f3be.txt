2.33(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the inspection, the following animals were found with veterinary care issues.
- A male beagle (ID 74349) was non-weight bearing on his left hind limb. The facility representative stated this dog
had a "tussle" with another dog on 2-27-2020 and was immediately lame on that leg. The facility separated the
animals at that time. However, the dog did not receive any medical treatment at the time of the inspection and was
only being monitored.
- A female cat named "Sophie" (ID 5819) had lost approximately 75% of her hair and had scabbed lesions on both
flanks. The facility representative stated a small amount of hair loss was noted on February 27, 2020. However, no
medical treatment was given, and upon inspection the lesions had not resolved and actually were more involved
with increased hair loss and skin lesions. The facility did call the veterinarian for these two animals on March 4,
2020 and had an appointment scheduled for Friday March 6, 2020. However, the facility waited a week after
noticing these conditions to seek veterinary care.
- A male beagle named Glenn ( ID 3871) had 2 red, inflamed areas of hair loss on his mid-dorsum. These lesions
were approximately 1.5 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. The facility had not noticed these areas prior to inspection.
Medical conditions must be appropriately treated, which includes timely veterinarian notification and appropriate
follow up evaluations to assess progress and make changes to the treatment plan when necessary. Sophie (ID
5819), Glenn (ID 3871) and Dog (ID 74349) must be assessed by the attending veterinarian within 36 hours and
treated appropriately. Records of treatment must be made available to inspectors.
3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- In the outdoor housing area, there were multiple enclosures that contained dilapidated wooden shade structures
with sharp points within reach of the animals. Sharp points and unsound structures are a potential source of injury to
the animals. All sharp points and unsound structures must be removed from the enclosures, and a program ofmaintenance implemented to identify and correct any future facility issues. The dilapidated shade structures were
removed from the enclosures during the inspection.
Corrected at time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
