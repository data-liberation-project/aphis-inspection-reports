scheduled to be given in a 7 day period from 3/30-4/5/14. Antibiotic treatments that are not given appropriately may
not be effective in clearing the infection and this may lead to recurrent infection or to pain in the animal. The facility

Storage
--An open bag of dry kibble (Advance) for the 2 coyotes is stored with the bag left open in the freezer and this may
not prevent contamination of the open food. Contaminated food may cause illness in the coyotes. Chunks of cut up
fresh fruit and several bags of chopped salad greens that state on the bag of food "Keep Refrigerated" are not being
stored under refrigeration in the commissary due to inadequate refrigerator storage space, according to the facility
representative. The facility shall provide a means of appropriate storage, such as storing the open bag in a sealed
container and storing perishable fruits and vegetables under refrigeration so as to prevent deterioration or
contamination of the food.
To be corrected by 5-25-14.
