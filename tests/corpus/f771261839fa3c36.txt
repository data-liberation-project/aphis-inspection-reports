ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230 on
20-Sep-16.
Attempted to locate physical address but was unable to find the facility. Attempted phone contact at approximately
1230 but there was no response so inspector left a message. A second call was placed an hour later but again
there was no response. The next day (Wednesday September 21st) made another attempt to locate the facility but
was not successful. Called the company phone number at 1330 hours but there was no answer, so inspector left a
second message. There were no return calls from the facility.
