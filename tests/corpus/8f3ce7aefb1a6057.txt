ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One black and tan colored adult female Yorkshire Terrier ( microchip number 025 114 350 ) has a yellow-white
creamy fluid accumulation around both eyes. The licensee had no medical records to show dates the dog was
examined by the attending veterinarian and what diagnosis and treatment had been prescribed. After cleaning the
discharge, the eyes showed no sign of infection or inflammation. There was no excessive blinking, sensitivity, or
any other indication of pain or discomfort. The dog was otherwise bright and alert and had good body condition.

examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and institute an appropriate treatment plan. The
outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by 1/21/15.

two dogs is located inside the enclosure on the divider fencing in shelter housing. A chewed, roughened, jagged
surface cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized and could potentially cause injury to the dog. In addition, it could
harbor bacteria and other disease causing agents that can affect the health and well-being of the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that all receptacles can be properly cleaned and sanitized at all times. Correct by 1/28/15.

clean and sanitized to facilitate normal husbandry practices. Correct by 1/28/15.
