2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* The 42 puppies on premises do not have cage cards or identification. This does not allow with certainty the
identity or the puppies and does not facilitate proper record keeping practices.
Identification is required for all adult dogs and puppies in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known
with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three enclosures inside the whelping barn are housing six adult dogs. These enclosures had a buildup of brown
grime and dirt on the back wall. The grime and dirt indicate daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. Improper
cleaning and sanitization can increase the accumulation of waste on the hard surfaces, and increase the disease
potential for the dogs.
All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily. Daily spot-cleaning and required sanitization will prevent an
accumulation of waste and decrease the disease hazards for the dogs.
