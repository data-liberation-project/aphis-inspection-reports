FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1) The 4' wire cattle fencing at the pasture housing the buffalo is not of such strength to contain the animals. These
animals are currently young, however in the near future they will be able to damage and possibly escape this
pasture. Additional measures need to be taken to contain these animals. 2) Both goat enclosures have wood steps
and resting platforms that are damaged with protruding nails, loose wire, that need to be repaired or replaced. The
goat platform at the front of the facility no longer has the shelter which protects the goats from falling because the
platform is approximately 20' high. A new shelter needs to be added so it protects the goats in case they fall.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.

3.127(d)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
1)The pasture housing two wallaby does not have the required 6' perimeter fence. 2) The pasture housing the
blackbuck antelope does not have the required 6' perimeter fence. There is 4' foot cattle fencing on opposite sides
of these enclosures.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Fences must be at least 6 feet high or approved in writing by the Administrator. The
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
