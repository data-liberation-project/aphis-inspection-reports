FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the metal chutes in the interior portion of one woodchuck enclosure is rusted to the point that there are
sharp, jagged edges present. Sharp, jagged edges could injure the animals. All animal housing facilities must be
constructed and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 4 August 2015.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are four free-standing enclosures housing 3 raccoons, 2 foxes, and 1 woodchuck that are located outside of
the perimeter fence. The perimeter fence protects the animals from unauthorized persons and other animals as
well as serving as a secondary containment system. All outdoor facilities housing regulated animals must be
enclosed by a perimeter fence. Correct by 4 August 2015.
