FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following areas have peeled and currently flaking paint on several areas of the ceilings of the following animal
holding areas: Hippo barn # 5 & 6, rhino barn # 4, rhino holding yard, elephant barn, giraffe barn, eland barn,
warthog holding, zebra holding, white rhino holding, waterbuck holding, bontebok holding, & wallaby/muntjac
holding, All of these structures have galvanized metal ceilings in which the paint does not appear to hold onto the
galvanized metal.
These flaking paint chips eventually fall to the ground and may fall into the food or in the water and be subsequently
ingested by these animals before they are observed and removed by the animal care staff.
Each animal area must be constructed of such materials as appropriate and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury

FEEDING.
Bales of hay were on carts in close proximity to the front two elephants barn holding enclosures. These bales of
hay were intended to later be fed to the elephants at a later time. During the time of the inspection of this area, theelephant barn was being cleaned with high pressure hoses. The spray of the water coming off the ground from
these machine(s) was getting onto a portion of some of these bales of hay making them wet and contaminated with
waste washing water, detergents, &/or dirt from the floor.
This process does not assure wholesomeness, or minimize contamination of the feed. The hay shall be place in
another area that does not get wet during the cleaning process.
