2.1(b)(2)(ii)

Requirements and application
While inspecting the zoo site, one cougar and two servals were present in the animal barn with the rest of the exhibit
animals for the facility. The facility is not licensed to conduct regulated activities with wild/exotic felids. Comingling of the
cougar and two servals with animals intended for exhibit without appropriate approval makes them regulated species.
Licensure with USDA must specifically authorize the use of wild/exotic felids. The facility must remove the cougar and two
servals from the barn so that they are not comingled with animals intended for exhibit.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One female goat was observed to be limping and carry her right front leg. The licensee stated that the animal had an
appointment to see a local veterinarian on Friday. After speaking with the attending veterinarian, he was unaware that the
goat had an appointment at the local vet. The licensee did not get prior approval from her attending veterinarian to see the
local vet. A lack of communication between the licensee and attending veterinarian can lead to unnecessary animal pain
and suffering. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The licensee must get
approval from the attending veterinarian to see other veterinarians for animal related issues.

2.75(b)(1)(iv) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee gave the single north American river otter to the sponsor of the otter. The licensee did not include the name
and address of the individual to whom the otter was given.
Every exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of
by that dealer or exhibitor. These records must include the name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold
or given.

Records for animals sold or given must include the name and address of the person to whom acquired the animal from
the exhibitor to ensure proper licensure or permit, and to be able to track the animal in case of disease outbreak.
3.75(c)(2) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
An enclosure, housing two brown lemurs, contained a shelter. The shelter was composed of plywood. The sides of the
house were excessively covered and streaked with a brown organic material. Inadequate maintenance and replacement
of surfaces can lead to animal disease and affect animal health and well-being. All surfaces must be maintained on a
regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities – including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within
the facility – that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. The license must
adequately maintain surfaces and replace surfaces when worn or soiled.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
-There is a resting platform on the inside portion of the baboon enclosure above the heater for the enclosure. There are a
couple of blankets on the resting platform. The blankets have smeared feces on them, and the resting platform is

smeared with a large amount of both wet and dry feces on the entire top surface. There was a strong odor of urine and
feces inside the enclosure that could be smelled through my mask.
-The resting platform on the inside portion of the enclosure that houses 2 rhesus macaques has a large accumulation of
smeared feces on the entire surface, and a large accumulation of feces in the corner of the resting platform. There was a
strong odor of urine and feces inside the enclosure that could be smelled through my mask.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily to prevent the nonhuman
primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from the indoor enclosure daily to prevent soiling of the non-human primates,
and to reduce disease hazards, pests and odors.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There are two shelves in the corner of the inside portion of the primary enclosure for the baboon. These shelves used to
have running space heaters on them. One of the heaters has been removed leaving a 3/4" by 2" gap to the outdoors.
There is a large accumulation of mouse feces on this shelf.

An effective program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and wellbeing of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas.


A program for control of mammalian pests must be developed to ensure the health and well being of the baboon and
reduce contamination of the enclosure, water, food available to the baboon and risk of animal disease.

Watering.
The single cavy house with a red kangaroo had a 5-gallon bucket as a water receptacle. The water was at a level that
made it very difficult for the cavy to access. The inspector asked if the cavy could use the bucket to drink and the
licensee stated yes. The inspector asked that a smaller bucket be offered to the cavy and the cavy drank for
approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds. The new bucket was hung on the fence, and was still too high, the cavy was
having a hard time as the bucket was pressing into its neck, and the cavy had to move to the side of the bucket where the
edge of the bucket was somewhat lower to access the water easier.

If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal.

A more appropriate water receptacle must be maintained in the enclosure for the cavy so that it has access to potable
water to maintain the health of the cavy.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The 7 ½ week old African crested porcupine is currently being housed at the licensee’s house. When the licensees are
home they let the porcupine run loose in the house. At night the porcupine is housed behind a baby gate in the laundry
room. There was a jar of Fluker’s Repta Calcium with D3 that was spilled on the floor of the room where the porcupine is

housed at night. There was also an electrical cord in this area that the porcupine had access to.

Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.

Vitamin D3 can have detrimental effects for porcupines if ingested, and porcupines are known to chew. Any area where
animals are kept must be kept clean and in good repair to prevent ingestion of substances that may be toxic to the animal,
and to ensure that the porcupine doesn’t chew on the electrical cord which may cause injury, or death.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
