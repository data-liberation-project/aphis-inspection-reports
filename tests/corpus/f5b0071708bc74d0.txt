ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** On the counter in the animal clinic there was a bottle of Flunixijet that was stated to be used within the last month
that is past the labeled expiration date of January 2015. Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become
contaminated, and could harm the animals. The applicant must ensure that all medications used in the facility are
not expired. The facility discarded the medication.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** During the inspection there were several piglets running in and out of the enclosure. The facility stated that they
wanted the piglets to be socialized by the public. While the public were coming in contact with the piglets there
wasn't an employee or attendant monitoring the public's interactions with the animals. In the petting zoo area there
was an employee posted on the giraffe's platform monitoring the feeding station. Down in front of the giraffe's
feeding station there was another feeding station for the goats. During the inspection we observed the employee not
paying attention to the interactions between the goats and the public while monitoring the giraffes feeding station. A
readily identifiable employee or attendant shall be present at all times during periods of public contact so that they
can monitor and visualize public contact and, intercede when necessary.There also needs to be enough attendants
available to effectively monitor all of the areas where there is public contact with the animals. The facility contained
the piglets before the exit briefing.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** There were young lemurs being housed in a screened-in outdoor enclosure that were stretched out on the bench
and floor at about 2 pm. They appeared exhausted by the heat. The temperature was 89 degrees F that day and
the heat index was 115 degrees F in the shade. It was the hottest part of the day with a slight breeze. When climatic
conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the
impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity, and
time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's
age. Correct by the end of the day.3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The suspended perch made out of PVC pipe in the golden headed tamarin's night house was dirty and needs to
be cleaned more frequent. All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to
satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices and to minimize disease.
3.77(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
** In the tamarin's night house at the beginning of the inspection the facilities thermostat read 87 degrees F. At the
end of the inspection the temperature was 89 degrees F at the zoo. The humidity made it feel hotter and the heat
index was 115 in the shade at the park by the end of the inspection. The sheltered part of sheltered housing
facilities must be sufficiently cooled when necessary to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes,
and to provide for their health and well-being. The ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not
rise above 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) for more than 4 consecutive hours when nonhuman primates are present, unless
temperatures above 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) are approved by the attending veterinarian, in accordance with
generally accepted husbandry practices. The ambient temperature must be maintained at a level that ensures the
health and well-being of the species housed, as directed by the attending veterinarian, in accordance with generally
accepted professional and husbandry practices. The facility placed a fan in the enclosure that was effective in
cooling the sheltered facility.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In "Sadie" the jaguars indoor primary enclosure behind the door there is a stabilizing fencing post that has rusted
and is beginning to pit that is part of the containment for the animal. The bottom of the fencing at the junction of the
post is also rusted. The rusting of the post compromises the integrity and strength of the structure and needs to be
replaced and/or repaired to ensure the containment of the animal.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
** The hedgehog's den box has an infestation of roaches. When opening the den the roaches were all on the top of
the box and down in the animals bedding. It was stated that pest control comes out at least once a week. A safe
and effective program for the control of insects may need to be modified and shall be maintained for the entire
facility. Pest control had assessed the issues and treated the facility before the exit briefing.The previous vet care issue was addressed by the veterinarian and the animals are currently receiving treatment.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
