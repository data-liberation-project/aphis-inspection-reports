ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A white female long haired Chihauhau, ID # 63, was observed with thinning hair on the hindquarters and down
the rear legs. This dog was also observed scratching itself multiple times during the inspection. Closer observation
revealed the hair coat containing fleas and black specks indicative of flea activity. The owner stated the dog had
been on a medication of methyl/prednisone for an allergy condition. At this time the dog has not received a recent
flea treatment. Fleas are present, there is multiple areas of thinning hair, areas of the rump and hindquarters have
reddened skin. Additional treatment must be provided to this dog to remove the flea risk and associated disease
and skin issues.
A male poodle, ID #71, was observed with a short hair coat. The teeth on this dog were covered with a hard,
brownish material. A large lump of this hard, brownish material was behind the right upper canine tooth. The gums
of this dog were extremely receded with the upper left lip having red, raised lesions at the point of contact with the
teeth. This dog was also thin with the vertebra and hip bones very prominent.
A female Maltese, ID #20, was observed shaking her head repeatedly. No outstanding issues were observed with
the ears but the teeth were covered with a hard, gray material that covered the molar teeth so that individual teeth
could not be seen.
These dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian with appropriate treatment program established and
followed. Excessive buildup of material on teeth is associated with gum disease, can create pain and distress to the
animal, reduce feed consumption, lead to infections, and is a general threat the well being of the dogs.
Documentation must be maintained of the treatment programs for review.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
***The interior portion of the lower sheltered building was observed with a temperature of 55 degrees at a level of 4
feet off the floor. A space heater was located within the middle walkway of the building. This area was above 50
degrees. The pens were constructed with solid walls approx. 4 feet tall. The surface temperatures in the lower
areas of these pens was in the range of 39 to 42 degrees. The solid walls are preventing the heat supplied from
adequately heating the space occupied by the dogs. No bedding adequate for nesting purposes was provided.
Measures must be taken to heat the area immediately around the dogs to and above 50 degrees. To be corrected
by: 02/10/16
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Three pens contained outside dog shelters with inadequate bedding. Hay was being used for a bedding material
but had been flattened down to the point to reduce the effective insulating properties of the bedding. Outside air
temperatures during the time of inspection was approximately 25 degrees F.Bedding must be provided when
outside air temperatures are below 50 degrees F with additional bedding provided when temperatures fall below 35
degrees F. Bedding must be of sufficient quantity to allow the dogs to nest in to conserve body heat. To be
corrected by: 02/10/16
