ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection it was noted that the elephant "Bunny" at times appears to have limited range of motion in
her right front limb. During the performance she would sometimes not bend her right carpal joint in the same
manner as she uses her left limb. While walking, she sometimes extends the right front limb in a peg-like fashion.
These actions are intermittent, but consistently recurring, and they are suggestive of some underlying problem that
may be causing discomfort.
The exhibitor had not noticed any change in Bunny's gait, and there was no history of Bunny having gait problems
of this type. The attending veterinarian stated that she had examined Bunny in January, and did not observe any
gait abnormalities at that time, and she was not aware of any current problems with Bunny.
Adequate veterinary care for the elephants is to include daily observation with assessment and recognition of any
possible health problems, with these problems promptly reported to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate
diagnostics and any necessary treatment can occur in a timely manner in order to safeguard the animal's
well-being. Failure to recognize changes in gait or health could delay treatment, potentially resulting in worsening
medical conditions, and / or discomfort for the animal.
The elephant "Bunny" should be assessed by a veterinarian by 7/10/16, with appropriate treatment and follow-up to
occur in a timely manner.
This inspection occurred in Baraboo, WI at the Circus World venue.
Elephants present were Bunny, 48 yrs, and Libby, 49 yrs.
An exit interview was conducted with the elephant handler.
