3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In all of the outdoor runs within the "green kennel", there is a build-up of old and fresh feces mixed in with the straw
that is used to cover the ground in these enclosures. In some of the enclosures the feces is mixed in with the straw
and has become layered and compacted. There are eight dogs in the affected enclosures.
Multiple dog doors throughout the kennel have a build-up of brown to black grime. The amount of grime varies from
a patchy thin layer to a thick build-up covering nearly half of some dog doors. At least seven enclosures are affected
housing ten dogs.
Failure to properly clean and sanitize primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. Hard surfaces
with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks in
order to prevent an accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. Floors made of dirt, absorbent bedding, or
similar material must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoidcontact with excreta. Contaminated material must be replaced whenever this raking and spot-cleaning is not
sufficient.

3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are three dogs housed in the outdoor exercise yard. The dogs have access to a dog house that is used as
shelter from inclement weather. There are no wind and rain breaks at the entrances to the shelter. Two days prior
to the inspection it had snowed and the temperature at the time of the inspection was approximately 27 degrees F.
Lack of a wind and rain break at the shelter entrance may not allow the dogs full protection from the cold and other
winter weather extremes.
All shelters in outdoor housing facilities for dogs must have a wind and rain break at the entrance. The licensee
must add a wind and rain break to both entrances of this shelter and ensure that all outdoor shelters have a wind
and rain break at all times.
