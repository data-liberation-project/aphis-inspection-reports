ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The licensee is not scheduling regular visits to her facility by the Attending Veterinarian (AV). The licensee's
Program of Veterinary Care states that these visits will occur annually, however, the last visit by the AV was on
04/06/15 according to records supplied during the inspection.
Facility visits are necessary to ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care is being understood and followed by the
licensee, to check the health and well-being of the animals, and to determine if changes in the Program of
Veterinary Care are needed.

***One of the female hedgehogs, Conifer (microchip #981010001769740), has an abnormal swelling on the right
side of her face and an abnormal right eye. At the time of inspection the right eye was cloudy and had an opaque
spot on it. There was a large swelling on the right side of the muzzle, with reddened skin visible under the fur. When
the licensee lifted the hedgehog’s upper lip, there was swelling present along the gums of the right side of the
mouth. The licensee stated that she had not noticed this problem prior to the inspection and the animal had not
been seen by a veterinarian recently.
The licensee must have this hedgehog examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 4, 2016, to obtain
accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation
must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary
diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any
medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions. The licensee must provide documentation of entries on a
log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of the animal
at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and theneed for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are observed daily and provided with
adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The
program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

***Three of the hedgehogs, Toph (microchip#981020007016468), Conifer (microchip # 981010001769740), and a
hedgehog from enclosure 34, have excessively long nails due to a lack of routine nail trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain nails can cause postural and gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause
injuries. As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals
receive appropriate nail care in a timely manner.
These hedgehogs must have their nails trimmed by November 5, 2016
