SANITATION.
At time of inspection old white moldy feces were observed in the fox enclosure and the opossum enclosure. The
licensee stated that she last cleaned on Saturday September 17th. Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards and to reduce odors. When enclosures are cleaned by hosing or flushing, adequate measures
shall be taken to protect the animals confined in such enclosures from being directly sprayed with the stream of
water or wetted involuntarily. The enclosures need to be kept clean and excreta removed on a more regular basis
for the health and well being of the animals as well as to reduce insect and vermin infestation. A vine in the
opossum enclosure needs to be removed as it has sharp thorns and is protruding into the interior.
All of the above was corrected during the inspection.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the Owner.
