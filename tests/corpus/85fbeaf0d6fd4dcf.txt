2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three rabbits died without veterinary evaluation and treatment after the veterinarian was not notified of the animals'
conditions. The facility representative indicated all three rabbits were observed sneezing and had white, pus-like
discharge coming from their eyes approximately three or four days before they died. She also stated the
veterinarian was never contacted for evaluation and treatment of the animals. Insufficient veterinary care can cause
pain and suffering in animals.
Veterinary care issues must be communicated to the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment.
To be corrected: From this day forward.
