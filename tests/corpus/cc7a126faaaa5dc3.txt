2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A seven year old male, cream colored French Bulldog (ID#: 013539607), named “Yoda”, had a buildup of bluish
white discharge in the center of the right eye. Closer examination revealed some dark green crusty material in the
hair around the right eye or where the eye and eye-lid meet. The right eye had blood vessels present on the surface
of the eyes. The white of right eye is mildly reddened. There was slight discharge from the right eye causing the
hair around the eye to be wet. The condition of the eyes can be due to infections, allergies, injury, irritation or other
medical conditions that could be painful.
As a result of the condition of the eye, the licensee must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian for veterinary
care and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
* A nine year old white male Maltese, (ID#: 013359639), named “Princeton”, had an excessively thick buildup of
brownish tarter on the cheek teeth and Canine teeth (carnassial teeth) on both sides of the jaw. The left canine
teeth (carnassial teeth) had a buildup of creamy substance where the teeth and gum line meet. The gums were
swollen and dark red in areas. The gums had receded from the teeth. The gum line along the check teeth was
bright red. The hair around the mouth was mildly wet from drooling. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth can
be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal.
* A nine year old white female Maltese, (ID#: 013519838), named “Precious”, had an excessively thick buildup of
dark brown to brownish tarter on the cheek teeth and Canine teeth (carnassial teeth) for the right side of the jaw.
The canine teeth (carnassial teeth) had a buildup of creamy substance where the teeth and gum line meet on the
right side of the jaw. The gums were swollen and dark red in areas. The gums had receded from the teeth. The hair
around the mouth was mildly wet from drooling. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth can be painful, impact
the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal.
**The licensee must have these two above mentioned animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to
the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by, 28-September-2016.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the Whelping Kennel, from the right of the entrance door, an enclosure had plastic tracks for a sliding divider.
These two sets of tracks were on the floor of the enclosure and were excessively chewed or scratched. There was
an accumulation of brown grime in the chewed areas. This indicates the chewed surfaces are worn and hard to
clean and sanitize. This can increase the disease potential for the four puppies.
All hard surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. This will allow for the surfaces to be readily cleaned
and sanitized. Therefore, this will decrease the disease hazards.
To be corrected by, 1-October-2016.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The Big Kennel had 16 dog doors with an accumulation of dark brown to brown grime on their surfaces. Three of
the plastic dog door inserts had an accumulation of dark brown to brown grime on their surfaces. The Reefer
Kennel had two dog doors with an accumulation of brown grime on their surfaces. This indicates that daily
spot-cleaning and frequent sanitization are not taking place. As a result, this increases the disease hazards for 16
adult dogs.
All surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized frequently. This will decrease the disease potential for the
dogs.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Inside the Big Kennel, the three far end enclosures on the right side from the entrance door had an accumulation
of dark brown grime or waste. This accumulation of dark brown grime was in front of the enclosures on the alley
floor. There was a slight ammonia odor in this area. The alleyway of this building is not being kept clean and this
can affect the health and well-being of the three adult dogs.All buildings must be kept clean of an accumulation of waste products. This will protect the health and well-being of
the animals.
