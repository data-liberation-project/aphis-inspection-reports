ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:20 am on
11-Oct-17.
I arrived on the premises at 11:20 am. I called several numbers and left messages that I was on the premises to
conduct an inspection. The gate was locked so I could not knock on the door. I waited a little over 30 minutes. I then
called her numbers and left a message that I was leaving her facility and that this was an attempted inspection.
