FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A tiger enclosure had a rusted detached pipe in a corner directly above the ground which compromises the integrity
of the structure, another enclosure had sharp points which could cause injury to the tigers, another enclosure with a
white tiger had a platform that was too close to the top of the enclosure fence which could result in the tiger jumping
and escaping.
The deer enclosure fence had a 1 foot separation at the top of the gate entrance due to a pole that was bended
towards the inside of the enclosure which could cause the head of a deer to be trapped in between.
The Serval enclosure had exposed underground wire which could potentially trap the cats paw and cause injury.
The black jaguar had a detached piece of wood which compromises the strutural integrity of the platform.
