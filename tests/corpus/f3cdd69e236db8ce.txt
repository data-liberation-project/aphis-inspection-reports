FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All animal enclosures housing hoofstock are in poor condition. Multiple sections of fence are leaning and some
sections of welded wire fencing appear to be pushed down by animals attempting to reach over them to the outside
of the enclosures. It is possible that an animal could be entangled and injured by this fence while attempting to exit
the enclosures or an animal could escape the enclosures and gain access to the public road located nearby. These
enclosures need to be repaired or replaced in order to protect the animals contained in them from injury.

WATERING.
The water receptacle located in the enclosure housing one white lama have a layer of brown algae slime on its
inside and has debris in it. This would indicate that this water receptacle is not cleaned frequently enough. The
brown lama has no water receptacle in its enclosure. The lama was placed in this enclosure last night. All animals
need access to water. Water receptacles need to be cleaned. The lama must have access to water. Dirty water
receptacles can effect water palatability and lead to decreased consumption. Access to adequate water is vital to
maintaining animal health.
