2.31(e)(3) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A protocol involving research with Syrian hamsters is incomplete and doesn’t include the parenteral administration of
DMSO. In reviewing the protocol, DMSO was not listed as a drug/substance being administered to the hamsters. Several
hamsters on the study developed minor skin lesions on their abdomen in the same area as the DMSO was administered.
The veterinarian was contacted and no treatment was needed. The institution has already taken steps to notify the
primary investigator that the DMSO use was not included in the approved protocol.
Incomplete descriptions of procedures do not allow the IACUC to fully review the proposed activities involving animal use.
This oversight is crucial to monitoring and enforcing animal welfare standards in research. Correct by August 12, 2022 by
ensuring that protocols submitted to the IACUC for review contain a complete description of the proposed use of the
animals including all substances to be administered. The principal investigator has submitted a protocol amendment to
the IACUC for review.
3.129(a) Critical

Feeding.
Based on a necropsy report, a 6 day-old piglet died from starvation and emaciation due to the facility’s failure to ensure it
received a sufficient amount of food to maintain proper body condition and health. The piglet had been removed from its


mother per a research protocol. The standard feeding protocol for these piglets is to teach the pig to drink milk provided
in a bowl. Milk was provided to this piglet in a bowl and several attempts were made to teach the pig to drink from it, such
as by dipping it’s snout into the milk and using fingers to try to lure the piglet to the bowl however, the facility’s notes
indicate that the piglet did not learn to eat from the bowl. Although the piglet had not learned to self-feed through the
facility’s standard practice, the facility did not ensure the animal received sufficient feed through an alternate means
(bottle, syringe, or other method) to maintain proper body condition and health. Supplemental milk was only occasionally
offered by syringe feeding. In addition, the volumes of milk provided in this manner over each 24 hour period were
approximately 10% of the animal’s daily energy requirements. On day 4, the pig was described as sitting in the corner,
quiet and with its head hanging down. When stimulated to move towards the milk bowl, the pig’s snout fell into the bowl.
At no time in the 6 days were additional steps implemented such as calculating nutritional needs to maintain body weight,
increasing the food offered via syringe or other method, measuring glucose levels, measuring hydration levels and/or fluid
intake, or conducting weight checks. On day 6, at 4 pm, the pig was found dead. On necropsy, the pig was described
with a body condition score of 1/9, emaciated and the death was attributed to prolonged starvation. The facility failed to
take the necessary steps to ensure that a sufficient quantity of food was provided to this piglet in a manner that
considered it’s age, condition, and inability to self-feed from a bowl.

Young neonatal animals that are removed from their dam require additional care to ensure that the food provided is of
sufficient quantity and presented in a manner that they are able to consume. Failure to provide feed in an appropriate
manner and ensure adequate feed consumption can lead to unnecessary suffering, starvation, and death.



Correct by July 28, 2022 by ensuring all animals are provided a sufficient quantity of food to maintain good health and that
all diets are prepared and presented with consideration given to the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.

This inspection was conducted with a facility veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted with the attending
veterinarian, facility veterinarians, IACUC members, Principal Investigators, and ACUP staff.
