CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
On December 7, 2014, Air Transport International transported non-human primates from Guangzhou to IAH without
obtaining a certification from the consignor that the animals were offered food and water no more than 4 hours prior
to delivery to the carrier. The required certification must contain the date and time the animals were last fed and
watered and the specific instructions for the next feeding and watering for a 24 hour period. The certification must
be signed by the consignor and include the date and time of signing.
The carrier must ensure that adequate food and water were provided to the animals prior to accepting the animals
for transport. Instructions for future food and water provisions must be included for the next 24 hours so that all
parties who take possession of the animals will be able to provide for their health, well-being and comfort in cases of
adverse events such as unforeseen delays during transport.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.
The primary enclosure housing two non-human primates, consisting of cage #2-69 containing animal #1206644
and cage #2-70 containing animal #1208658 had a panel covering the food and water receptacle openings which
was not secured to the enclosure. Immediately after off-loading it was noted that the animals were able to remove
the panel and stick a body part (arm) through the openings accessing outside the enclosure.
The non-human primate must be securely contained within and unable to put any part of its body outside the
enclosure. Accessing the outside of the enclosure with body parts could cause injury to the animals or to persons in
close proximity to the enclsoure. For the safety of the animals and people enclosures used to transport non-human
primates must be constructed to securely contain the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.Several enclosures housing non-human primates were noted to be leaking fluid from the bottom. immediately after
off-loading. Removeable trays under the enclosures were attached to the enclosures with shallow screws. The
trays were dislodged and loose creating an opening that allowed fluids which had accumulated in the enclsoure
during transport to escape from the bottom.
Primary enclsoures used to transport non-human primates must have a solid leak-proof bottom or a leak-proof
removeable tray used to prevent leakage or seepage of waste products such as body fluids outside of the
enclosure. To protect adjacent animals and the people near by from potential contamination hazards and illness
fluids must be contained within the primary enclosures during transport.

FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
According to documentation provided by the consignee, more than 24 hours had elapsed since the last feeding and
watering of non-human primates transported by air cargo on AWB 81313751625, 81313751636, 81313751640 and
81313751651 from China to IAH on December 7/8, 2014. Every non-human primate 1 year of age or older must be
offered food at least once every 24 hours and potable water every 12 hours.
Provisions for food and water during transit as required under the Animal Welfare Act are designed to prevent
nutritional deficiency, dehydration, hunger, thirst and animal discomfort. Compliance with the food and water
requirements helps to ensure that compromise to the health, well-being and comfort of the animals is minimized
during transport.
The exit interview was conducted with the loadmaster at IAH on December 8, 2014.
