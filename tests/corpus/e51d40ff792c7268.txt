A female German shepherd (ID 900 0320026922358) has a injury on her nose that the facility noticed on Monday
(12/12/16). The injury is red and scabbed over and has not received veterinary care and the attending veterinarian
has not been notified. Untreated injuries may not heal properly and can be painful. To ensure that this injury heals
properly and is not painful, the licensee must have the attending veterinarian evaluate it and follow the prescribed
treatment.
