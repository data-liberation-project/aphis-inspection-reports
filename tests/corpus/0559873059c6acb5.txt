ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Each breeder must maintain an adequate veterinary care program with appropriate methods to prevent, control, and
treat diseases and injuries. Katy, a black and orange beagle, identification number 65 appears to be walking in a
slow and abnormal manner. The dog(cid:25)s movement is wobbly and appears to be hesitating when she moves. She
seems to be favoring her back legs, mostly her right hind leg. She is walking with her back somewhat arched,
possible a sign that her movement is painful. The breeder/owner must have this dog seen be a veterinarian to help
determine what the problem is and the best procedure to help this dog heal. The breeder/owner must daily monitor
each dog in this facility to help insure their good health and well-being. Correct by 02-03-2016.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative and Karl Thornton, ACI.
