2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current records of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 1440 adult guinea pigs, weanlings, and
newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records showing the number of adult and
weanling guinea pigs for the last three months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health
of the caviary by identifying guinea pig losses by deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals
being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care and use.

The facility must retain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
guinea pigs held, owned, and disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by July 23, 2021.
3.26(d) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. The wooden floor in the guinea pig building, the right side of the front wall by ladder, and the back wall
around the large fan are not sealed or covered with an impervious surface. Indoor surfaces that are not impervious to
moisture can absorb moisture and liquids, retains odors, and do not allow adequate cleaning and sanitization of the room
surfaces. Correct by sealing or covering wooden floor, front right wall section, and the back section of wall around the

large fan with an impervious surface so that surfaces can be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized, won't retain odors, and do
not permit the absorption of liquids and moisture. Remains uncorrected.
