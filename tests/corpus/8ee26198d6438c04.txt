3.6(a)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A couple of puppy enclosures are in disrepair.
A puppy enclosure inside the store that is housing three puppies has a painted particle board wall along one side.
The bottom edge of the particle board has been chewed along the bottom exposing the wood and creating gaps
between the floor and the wall that are up to 8 inches high. These gaps have exposed wire fencing that has sharp
wire points protruding into the puppy enclosure. The exposed particle board cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized. The wires pointing into the enclosure could wound the puppies.
In another puppy enclosure housing one puppy, at the puppy's eye level there is a plastic shelf with a chewed edge
that has sharp points and edges. These sharp points and edges could wound the puppy.
The primary enclosures must be kept in good repair. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so
that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs, protect the dogs from injury, and enable all
surfaces in contact with the dogs to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
