Contingency planning.
There was no written contingency plan available at time of this inspection. Failure to have a written contingency plan can
result in lack of readiness for emergencies or disasters which could impact animal health and well-being. Dealers must
develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing,
and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster.
