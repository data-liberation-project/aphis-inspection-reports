3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: There are still equipment and supplies such as trees, containers, wheel barrows,
equipment, machinery, dumpsters and construction material being stored against the inside of the 8 foot perimeter
fence at the front area by the parking lot. This material provides good cover and hiding places for vermin/pests.
Also a function of the perimeter fence is to be a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The
stored items against the fence act as stairs or steps so an escaped animal could easily reach the top of the fence to
jump to the other side. The items stored along the perimeter fence must be removed to prevent cover for
vermin/pests and so the perimeter fence may serve as a secondary containment system for the animals. This is a
repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the general curator; Mary Geib, VMO; and Robert Markmann, ACI.
