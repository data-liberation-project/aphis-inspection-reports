ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****An adult female tiger named Precious had an intermittent hopping gait and appeared lame on her right front leg
when walking. She also would intermittently hold her right front foot in the air when standing and appeared reluctant
to bear full weight on that foot. Closer inspection of that foot revealed multiple circular areas on the foot pad that
were yellow and roughened. Recent medical records did not mention the lameness and the tiger was not receiving
any treatment or diagnostic procedures.
****An adult female tiger named Princess had an intermittent hopping gait and appeared lame on her left front leg
when walking. She also would intermittently hold her left front foot in the air when standing and appeared reluctant
to bear full weight on that foot. Closer inspection of that foot revealed multiple circular areas on the foot pad that
were yellow and roughened. Recent medical records showed that the left front foot had been examined by the
Attending Veterinarian on February 13, 2014, and that no abnormalities were seen. The tiger was not receiving any
treatment or diagnostic procedures for the current condition.
****An adult male leopard named Blackie had numerous areas of patchy hair loss on his left and right sides, over his
flanks, and extending to the thighs. The skin in some of these areas appeared slightly reddened. The leopard did
not scratch or appear itchy during the inspection. The tip of Blackie's tail was completely hairless and bright red.
The animal caretaker said that the tail lesion was the result of self-mutilation by Blackie chewing and/or sucking his
tail. The Attending Veterinarian had examined this cat on February 13, 2014 and had noted the areas of missing
hair on the body and the tail in the medical record. His list of possible causes included self-trauma from boredom,
vitamin deficiency, stress, infection, and allergy. The recommended treatment at the time was supplementation with
vitamins. The Attending Veterinarian examined Blackie again on May 6, 2014; however, no notes were made in the
medical record kept at the facility. The animal caretaker stated that the condition did not seem improved, but the
treatment was not changed and no diagnostic procedures were scheduled.
****The adult male leopard named Blackie also exhibited stereotypic behavior of self-stimulation by rubbing his
external genitalia on a plastic toy and on a ball 5-6 times during the inspection.
Lameness and skin conditions can be painful, can be the result of injury or illness, and can progress if not treatedappropriately. Stereotypic behavior and self-mutilation can be the result of boredom, stress, inadequate space, or a
medical condition. The licensee must establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care, including the
use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries. The licensee must
maintain medical records and make them available to inspectors upon request.

2.131(d)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(d)(1) Conditions for Exhibition of Animals
****An adult white tiger named Precious was being exhibited to the public even though she was showing signs of a
medical condition. She was displaying an intermittent hopping gait and appeared lame in her right front leg when
walking. She also would intermittently hold her right front leg in the air when standing and appeared reluctant to
bear weight on it. Closer inspection of that foot revealed multiple areas of circular, yellow, crusty lesions on her
footpad. Despite these problems, the curtains over the window to her enclosure were pulled apart about 3 feet,
which allowed the public to view Precious next to the theater's box office. Public exhibition of sick or injured animals
can cause stress, which can affect the animal's ability to heal and their psychological well-being. The licensee must
ensure that animals are exhibited only for periods of time and under conditions that are consistent with their good
health and well-being.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
(b) Ventilation.
****Both the upstairs housing facility and the downstairs housing facility have inadequate ventilation. A strong odor
was present in both areas and the ammonia levels appeared to be excessively high as evidenced by a burning
sensation in the noses of both inspectors. Inadequate ventilation can result in a buildup of odors and gases, such
as ammonia, which can cause discomfort and adversely affect the health of the animals. The licensee must ensure
that indoor housing facilities are adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means so as to minimize drafts,
odors, moisture condensation, and excessive ammonia.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 10, 2014.
3.132
EMPLOYEES. ****The employee who is caring for the cats does not have adequate training to provide acceptable levels of health
and husbandry care for the animals as evidenced by the health care issues, lack of proper ventilation, and
inappropriate public exhibition of an ill or injured animal. The licensee has not had contact with the animals or
provided supervision of the animal caretaker for approximately 2 months. During this time the animal caretaker has
been in charge of caring for the animals. Inadequately trained employees may not recognize medical conditions or
their seriousness, may not understand adequate husbandry needs of the animals, and may make decisions that
adversely affect the well-being of the animals. The licensee must ensure that he provides a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees to provide an acceptable level of health care and husbandry to the animals.
