3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An area of standing water continues to be present along the back wall and under two enclosures housing four dogs
in the east end building. The water is dark, dirty and mixed with excreta. The licensee uses a wet/dry vacuum daily
to eliminate the water. However, once daily does not eliminate the water to prevent it from accumulating. Failure to
provide an adequate drainage system increases the risk of odors, insects and disease hazards. Eliminate the water
more frequently and/or develop a method to prevent the accumulation of water.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
