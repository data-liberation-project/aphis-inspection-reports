2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is using "Cyonara Plus" (a fly repellent labeled for use in cattle) on the dogs in the facility for fly
control. There is also a bottle of liquid neomycin in the large animal whelping building. There are no directions and
approval for use on dogs from a licensed veterinarian for either of these medications. Inappropriate use can result in
illness or injury. The licensee must ensure that all medications must be labeled and administered properly as part of
the facility's program of adequate veterinary care.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an enclosure in the large dog whelping building housing a Siberian husky mix dog and her puppies. There
is a deep hole that has been dug in the ground of the outdoor portion of this enclosure that undermines both the
fence and the building. The hole under the fence results in a gap between the fence and the ground. These holes
could trap and injure the dogs including the puppies when they are large enough to access the outdoor part of the
enclosure. There is also a hole in an outdoor enclosure housing 4 dogs on the north west side of the facility. This
hole undermines the dirt, creating a small "cave like" hole. This could injure the dogs if it were to fall in on one of the
dogs.
***
There are cattle panels attached to a chain link fence as a patch in two enclosures housing Australian Shepherds.
In both cases the panels are not well attached to the fence, leaving them loose and creating a gap between the
panel and the fence. The loose panels could injure the dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(8)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outdoor enclosure on the north west corner of the facility housing two golden retrievers has a muddy hole
directly in front of the water receptacle. In order to access the water receptacle, the dogs must stand in the hole.
The drop in the ground makes it more difficult for the dogs to access the water. The licensee must ensure that
primary enclosures provide all the dogs and cats with easy and convenient access to clean food and water. To becorrected by 15 August 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is an enclosure housing six schnoodle puppies and their dam. The puppies' legs were seen passing through
the openings in flooring material. Puppies whose feet can slip through openings in the floor are at risk for injury. The
licensee must ensure that the floors of primary enclosures are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' and
cats' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' and cats' feet to
pass through any openings in the floor. Corrected during the inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
