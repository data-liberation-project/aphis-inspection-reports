Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 169 adult guinea pigs, 473
weanlings, and 211 newborns were counted during this inspections. There were no inventory records indicating the
number of adults, weanlings, or newborns present since the last inspection. Failure to maintain these records can make it
difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal losses by death or decreased numbers of animals born
and to track animals being sold in regulated activities to ensure their humane care. The licensee must maintain records
containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned,
acquired or disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by June 1, 2022.

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided to 228 weanling guinea pigs in 5 enclosures. Enclosures measure 74 inches
by 30 inches or 2220 square inches of floor space. Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60
square inches of floor space each and guinea pigs weighing over 350 grams require at least 101 square inches of floor
space each. Enclosures can not house more than 37 weanlings weighing up to 350 grams or 21 weanlings weighing
above 350 grams.


Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, and increases in aggression in animals which can result in ear
chewing and fights between guinea pigs. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are provided with a least the minimum
amount of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary stress and discomfort to the animals. Correct by June 15, 2022.
3.31(b)

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. The floor of the animal room contained accumulations of dirt, debris, and scattered hay. The walls,
windows, and ceiling had accumulations of dirt, dust, and cobwebs. Animal facilities must be kept clean and maintained in
good repair. Ineffective cleaning and housekeeping may attract pests, result in unpleasant odors, and may contribute to
disease problems. Correct by sweeping and cleaning the floor of the animal room on a regular basis and cleaning walls,
windows, and ceiling of dirt, dust, and cobwebs. Correct by June 1, 2022.
