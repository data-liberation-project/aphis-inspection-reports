2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian.
In pen 11, there was a brown and white newborn guinea pig housed with 13 other guinea pigs. The newborn was
lethargic and minimally responsive with sunken eyes that were held partially closed. The animal was observed to
be sitting in one position and not moving and exhibited limited reaction when approached by other guinea pigs in the
pen. In addition, the animal appeared to be breathing with increased respiratory rate and effort.
The licensee had not observed any problems with this animal, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and
was not administering any treatments.
Newborns that are lethargic and depressed with respiratory issues can rapidly worsen if not evaluated and treated.
Failure to identify and treat health conditions can lead to worsening of the condition including death.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an
appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
