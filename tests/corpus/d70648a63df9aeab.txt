2.31(d)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
Two protocols were approved by designated member review process on 9 Nov 22 and 5 Dec 22. The designated
member who reviewed the protocol is personally involved in the activity and is listed as test facility personnel on the first
page of the protocol. No member may participate in the IACUC review or approval of an activity in which that member
has a conflicting interest (e.g., is personally involved in the activity), except to provide information requested by the
IACUC, nor may a member has a conflicting interest contribute to the constitution of a quorum.

Correct for all future protocols.
2.134(a)(3)

Contingency planning.
The contingency plan referred to responsible persons in Annex A, but the Annex was missing. There was no clear chain
of command identified who will be responsible for fulfilling these tasks as required by the Animal Welfare Regulations. In
the event of an emergency, a clearly identified chain of command is important to take responsibility to provide for the
humans handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of their animals.
