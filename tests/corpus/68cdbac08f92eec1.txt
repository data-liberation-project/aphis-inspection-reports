Personnel qualifications.
On 04AUG2021 a nonhuman primate sustained a thermal injury when undergoing an MRI procedure. This injury became
apparent on 07AUG2021. The animal began receiving treatment for its injury including pain management. The animal
was evaluated again on 08AUG2021 and 09AUG2021. This animal was euthanized due to its injury on 10AUG2021. A
review of animal records including the IACUC’s investigation of the incident indicates that a lack of complete training of all
the MRI technicians was likely the cause of this injury. Lack of proper or complete training can lead to unnecessary
animal injury and possible death. Ensure that all personnel involved in animal care, treatment and use are adequately
trained.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with an IACUC representative.
