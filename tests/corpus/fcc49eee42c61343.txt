2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 on
04/27/2015.
Upon arrival I called the phone numbers listed and waited 30 min. The licensee called later and informed me he had
been out of the area and discussed when the facility would open for the season.
This is the first attempted inspection.
