Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility employed a new part-time attending veterinarian several months ago. The veterinarian is visiting the facility
weekly to provide veterinary care. However, a written program of veterinary care has not yet been completed with the
new veterinarian. A written program of veterinary care formalizes and defines the arrangement regarding veterinary care
between the facility and the veterinarian. The formal arrangement between the facility and the part-time attending
veterinarian must include a written program of veterinary care. Correct by 3/1/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director.
