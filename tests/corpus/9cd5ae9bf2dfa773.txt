Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During the inspection, the following animals and conditions were observed:

- In the top enclosure of stack 8A, there is a black and white guinea pig laying in right lateral recumbency who has an
occasional gasp and kicking of the back feet. When the inspection was completed, this animal was noted to have died.
- In the bottom enclosure of stack 8A, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig who is in left lateral recumbency. When
the licensee segregated the animal for further observation, it fell to it's left side again with spastic movements of all four
limbs and appeared unable to stand on it's own. Upon completion of inspection, this animal was also noted to have died.
- In the bottom enclosure of stack 5A, there is a male guinea pig with approx. 1cm of red and brown crusted tissue
protruding from it's rectum.
- Also in the bottom enclosure of stack 5A, there is a black and tan guinea pig with hair loss on it's back and crusting of
the underlying skin.
- Also in stack 5A, in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a black and white guinea pig with crusting skin and hair
loss around it's right eye.
- In stack 3A, in the enclosure fifth from the top, there is a male guinea pig with safety pins pushed through both of the


ears. The licensee explains that he does this to identify his boars. Two additional male guinea pigs in other enclosures
were identified as having safety pins placed in their ears as well.
- In stack 1A, in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with crusting, hair loss, and
fresh areas of blood around the right eye.
- Also in stack 1A,in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a black and white guinea pig with missing hair on it's left
flank and the underlying skin appears thickened.
- In stack 8B, in the enclosure fourth from the top, there is a tan and white guinea pig with missing hair on the right side of
it's nose.
- In stack 7B, in the enclosure third from the top, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with hair loss and crusting skin
on the left side of it's nose.
- In stack 6B, in the enclosure third from the top, there is a black and white guinea pig hair loss on it's nose.
- In stack 1B, in the enclosure fifth from the top, there is a dead black and white guinea pig that the other guinea pigs are
huddled on top of.

There were no observation or treatment records for any of the animals identified above. The licensee stated that he did
not observe these conditions prior to today's inspection. According to the facility's Program of Veterinary Care, animals
with hair loss are to be segregated immediately but all of the aforementioned guinea pigs were still in their enclosures at
the time of inspection. The Attending Veterinarian had also not been contacted regarding the animals who were found to
be recumbent or the animal with the tissue protruding from it's rectum. Additionally, during a discussion with the Attending
Veterinarian, she was unaware that the licensee was inserting safety pins through the ears of the boars and stated that
this was not a procedure she authorized.



A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the Attending Veterinary can result in delay of care
and worsening of health issues. Additionally, performing procedures such as the insertion of safety pins through the ears
of male guinea pigs can cause pain and distress to the animals. Finally, instructions already provided by the Attending
Veterinarian, such as those outlined for animals missing hair, must be followed to prevent further spread of potential
infectious diseases.

Correct by observing all animals on a daily basis, following the Program of Veterinary Care, and having all of the
aforementioned animals examined by the Attending Veterinarian.

Facilities, indoor.
Upon entering the room where the guinea pigs are housed, it was noted that guinea pigs in their enclosures were huddled
in an inside corner of their pens and a Kestrel placed on stack 8A identified the room as having a temperature of 48.3°F.
The licensee stated that he had a stove to keep the room warm but it was not been running at the time of inspection.

Rooms housing guinea pigs must not have an ambient temperature that falls below 60°F. Failure to maintain this
temperature can lead to hypothermia or other health dangers for the animals. Correct by ensuring the temperature of the
room housing the guinea pigs is not allowed to fall below 60°F or exceed 85°F. Correct by November 23, 2021.
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
The room housing the guinea pigs contains several empty guinea pig racks that have significant accumulations of
spiderwebs and dust. There is also a stroller and several power tools that are in the room that also have accumulations of


dust and spiderwebs.

Premises, including buildings, need to be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. Failure
to do so can lead to respiratory issues due to these accumulations of dust and spiderwebs. Correct by cleaning and
maintaining the building which houses the guinea pigs.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
