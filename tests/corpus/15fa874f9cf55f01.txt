ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was an approximately 6 years old male Shih Tzu (#00070C34D8), "Willie", with matted fur and a dental
condition. The dog had fur that was matted over most of its entire body. A large mat appeared to encompass the
dog's entire back from the nape of his neck to the base of his tail and extended just over the sides of the animal.
The skin could not be observed over the back. Several various sized wadded-like mats were also present along the
dog's abdomen, chest, legs and paws. An approximately 3 inch long rope-like mat was observed hanging down
from the inside of the dog's right rear leg. Another large wadded-like mat was closely adhered to the skin and
covered much of the dog's left rear foot. This dog was included on the reports for the inspections conducted on
February 10, 2015 and February 17, 2015. During the February 10th inspection the dog was noted with an
"unusual slow gait and slow movements". Written documentation dated 2/17/15 from a veterinarian stated that a
"routine check" was performed on the dog and included that the dog needed "to be cleaned up and change dog
food". According to a facility representative, the dog food had been changed but the dog had not been bathed or
groomed. Matted fur can increase the risk of pain, discomfort and skin sores and it does not provide the insulation
for the animal as intended. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed. Upon observation of the dog's mouth,
most of the teeth had a heavy build-up of yellowish brown to dark brown to black material on the teeth. This
abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the cheek teeth and extended into the gum line. The gums
appeared reddened, swollen and had receded along some of these teeth. On the right side of the dog's mouth,
there was a linear band of whitish grey material noted above the canine tooth. A larger portion of whitish grey
material was also noted behind the right upper canine tooth and appeared to extend to the right upper large
(carnassial) cheek tooth. Individual teeth were not easily discernible in this area. The dog's left upper canine tooth
appeared to have an uneven surface with a crack-like lesion noted on the tooth. The abnormal build-up of material
on this dog's teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This dog's dental condition could be
painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal. The
licensee must have this animal evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by close of business February 20, 2015 in order
to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary
care for the animals in the facility.
***At least two other dogs at the facility also had matted fur. One male Poodle (#95600008678081), "(cid:28)Paul"(cid:29), wasgenerally matted over his entire body. The majority of the fur had a thick ropey appearance. There were also
several various sized wadded-like mats of fur along his abdomen, chest, legs and tail and on his paws. Another
black and white female Shih Tzu, "Oreo", also had mats located generally over her body. These mats also
appeared as various sized wadded-like mats of fur along the dog's chest, abdomen, legs and ears and on the paws.
Some of these areas on both of the dogs appeared wet and dirty. Matted fur can increase the risk of pain,
discomfort and skin sores and it does not provide the insulation for the animals as intended. The licensee must
ensure these dogs are groomed and establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs.
***Within an outdoor enclosure, an individually housed female Pug, "Sally", had a condition noted along the edges
of both ears. An approximately 1 inch section along the edge of the dog's right ear appeared wavy-like, dry and
thickened. There was a smaller section along the edge of the dog's left ear which also had a similar, but not as
prominent, wavy-like and thickened appearance. This abnormal condition could be due to injury, infection or other
veterinary medical condition which could cause the animal discomfort. The licensee must have this dog examined
by a licensed veterinarian no later than February 20, 2015 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made
and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.
***In the ready to use medication area, there was a bottle of Penicillin. This medication had an expiration date of
06/13. There was a bottle of Ivomec stored with a needle inserted into the rubber top, which provides an entry for
contaminates into the medication. Medications that are expired or stored improperly may not produce the desired
result. The licensee must remove the out of date medications from the ready to use medication storage and store
medications appropriately.
The licensee must follow the treatment plans for the animals, follow up on all of the instructions given by the
veterinarian and ensure that all of the animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(a) A class ``A'' dealer (breeder) shall identify all live dogs. (2) Live puppies or kittens, less than 16 weeks of age.
***In the sheltered facility there was a Labrador puppy that had no collar, tatoo or microchip for identification.
Appropriate identification is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport,
trace forward, trace backward and healthcare. The licensee must properly identify these animals and assure that all
animals are identified as required.
3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(b) Condition and site. ***In the sheltered facility, there was one Labrador puppy that was being held in stacked cages for the brokerage
portion of the facility. This building is used for breeding dogs and housed five adult dogs on the breeding program.
Dogs that are brought to the property and housed with breeding dogs can increase the risk of disease hazards and
transmission of disease to all of the animals. The licensee must move the Labrador puppy to the broker holding
facility and assure that all businesses are kept separate as required.
To be corrected by February 21, 2015.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces (3) Cleaning.
***In the indoor portion of the sheltered facilities, there were three enclosures containing six dogs that had dirt,
grime,
hair and feces on the floors and walls. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential for a healthy environment and reduces
disease hazards by eliminating harboring places for diseases and pests. The licensee must clean these areas and
assure that all surfaces in contact with the animals are cleaned as required.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(e) Storage.
***In the sheltered facility, there was an open bag of dog food sitting on the floor. Open food containers attract pest
and rodents that could contaminate the food. The licensee must place the food in a leakproof container with a tight
fitting lid and assure that all food is stored as required.
To be corrected by February 21, 2015.
3.4(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
(3) Be provided with a wind and rain break.
***In the outdoor facility there was a plastic type shelter unit in an enclosure housing one adult Pug identified as
"Sally". This housing shelter had no wind or rain break at the entrance. Standing in front of the enclosure the entire
flooring surface of the shelter could easily be visualized. The ambient temperature during the time of inspection was
21.1 F and the wind chill was 16.2 F via Kestrel 3000. Since the entrance is straight into the shelter, with no flaps or
doors, the dog is not adequately protected from the elements. Wind and rain breaks are vital for protection of the
animal from the elements. The licensee must provide a wind and rain break at the entrance of this housing shelter
and ensure that all outdoor housing shelters containing regulated animals are provided with wind and rain breaks as
required. The licensee acknowledged that this non-compliant item was to be corrected by close of businessFebruary 18, 2015.
3.4(b)(4) DIRECT REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements. (4) Contain clean, dry, bedding.
***In the outdoor housing facility, there were enclosures housing at least 12 adult dogs. In these enclosures, the
housing shelters had thin carpet pads that were being used for bedding. In the enclosure housing one adult Pug
identified as "Sally", there was one carpet pad on the floor of the housing shelter and one carpet pad laying in the
center of the enclosure. In the hutch-type enclosure containing a Dachshund and a Cocker Spaniel approximately
eight months old, there was no bedding material. At least three of the carpet pads were soiled or partially wet. Four
of these enclosures had snow covering approximately 1/3 of the enclosure that the dogs had been walking through.
The ambient temperature was 21.1 F and the wind chill was 16.2 F at the time of inspection via Kestrel 3000. One
tan and white adult dog was seen shivering intermittently and holding up the front paws for extensive periods of
time. The lack of appropriate amount of bedding in cold environments increases the risks of illness, frostbite and
hypothermic situations to the animals. The licensee must provide appropriate bedding for temperatures below 50
degrees and extra bedding below 35 degrees as required.
The licensee acknowledged that this must be corrected by close of business today, February 18, 2015.
3.4(b) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
***In the outdoor facility, there was one primary enclosure containing an adult Beagle and an adult Shih Tzu. There
was a large self feeder, a water receptacle, and another black rubber receptacle in the primary enclosure. Inside the
housing shelter, there is a black rubber receptacle on the floor. This does not leave enough floor space in this
shelter
for these two dogs to lie down and move freely. Limited floor space in housing shelters can cause animals to be
exposed to the elements more than necessary. The licensee must provide adequate amount of floor space in
housing
shelters as required.
3.11(a) DIRECT REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
***In the outdoor hutch type facility there were two dogs housed in the same enclosure. The housing shelter for this
enclosure has fresh, dried and molding feces covering approximately 85% of the floor. The young Cocker Spanielhoused within this enclosure cannot enter the housing shelter without stepping in the feces. The molded fecal
material observed during the February 10, 2015 inspection was located in the same place of the housing shelter
during the present inspection. There was also grime, dirt and smeared feces on the walls of this shelter.
***There was an excessive amount of feces in all of the enclosures housing the 19 adult dogs. In the majority of
these enclosures, the feces was flattened where the dogs had walked through it. The facility representative did not
know the last time that the enclosures were cleaned. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease
by attracting pests and providing an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must remove the feces
from these enclosures and assure that the primary enclosures are cleaned as required.
*Note - on February 17, 2015 the Boston Terrier identified as "Mister" and the Shih Tzu identified as "Willie",
included on the reports under veterinary care for the 2/10/15 and 2/17/15 inspections, had been evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian and treatment plans had been developed. The licensee must ensure that the treatment plans
are followed.
This inspection began at 1226.
The inspection and partial exit conference, to discuss bedding, wind and rain breaks, were conducted with the
facility representative. The complete exit conference was conducted with the facility representative on February 19,
2015.
