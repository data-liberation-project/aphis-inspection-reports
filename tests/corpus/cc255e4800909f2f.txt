2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility is allowing public interaction with 4 young coatimundi without ensuring minimal risk of harm to the
animals and to the public. During this inspection I requested the facility demonstrate how they are handling the
animals. We entered the enclosure, sat down, and two of the coati were allowed to climb onto our laps. The
method of control was to grab the animals if they started a behavior that was not appropriate. One of the coati was
able to grab my arm in its mouth before the attendant was able to restrain it.

During public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.
The current method to control or restrain an animal is ineffective in preventing an injury to the public. A more
appropriate handling method that would minimize the risk of injury during public interactions must be established in
consultation with the attending veterinarian.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
