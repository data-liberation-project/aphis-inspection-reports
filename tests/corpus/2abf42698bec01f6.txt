ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A total of 7 animals were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection for problems. This includes:
1. A brown weanling smooth hair guinea pig with one tan and two white spots in the 5th pen on the left side of
the building had an injured left eye. Approximately 2/3 of the surface was brown, dried, and appeared to be
protruding abnormally from the surface of the eye. The center area of this dried area contained a well delineated
depression and there was a small pink circular ring around the dried brown area. The remaining eye that was
visible appeared cloudy with a slight blue hue. There was crusty dried discharge at the corner of the eye closest to
the nose.
2. An adult brown agouti smooth hair guinea pig in pen #12 had an abnormal left eye. There was an area of the
surface of the eye towards the nose and bottom eyelid (covering approximately 1/4 of the eye) that was opaque
blue-white and appeared swollen. There was a smaller pinpoint area within this that appeared dried and light
brown.
3. A chocolate and tan weanling guinea pig in pen #12 had an abnormal left eye. This eye had a large circular
opaque blue-white area in the central 1/3 of the eye (offset away from the nose). This animal was squinting with the
eye held half closed and had an excessive amount of clear tearing when first identified by inspectors (prior to being
picked up).
4. A black and white weanling guinea pig in the 3rd pen on the right side of the building had an abnormal right
eye. The surface of the eye was cloudy all over and there was a blue-white opaque area towards the corner of the
eye nearest the nose.
5. An adult brown agouti and white smooth hair guinea pig on located in pen #12 had an abnormal left eye. This
eye was uniformly cloudy in appearance over the entire surface. Additionally, there were small areas of dark
pigmentation on the surface of the eye running from the center of the eye to the lower portion of the eye.
6. An adult tricolor smooth hair guinea pig in pen # 8 had a large mass on the chest area under the chin. This
mass was approximately golf-ball sized, firm and slightly movable. This guinea pig was slightly underweight.
7. An adult chocolate and tan smooth hair guinea pig with small white spots on the top of her head and chin
located in pen # 4 had a large mass on the chest area under the chin. This mass was freely movable and when felt,
it had two adjacent portions each the size of a large grape mass that were only slightly firm. There was small scab
on the right side of the mass.The abnormal conditions of the eyes described above can result from a variety of causes including trauma and
disease. When left untreated eye problems are often significantly painful and can progress quickly resulting in
unnecessary suffering, and possibly impairment of vision or even loss of the eye due to rupture. Similarly masses
as described above in two animals can result from a number of causes and left untreated, may worsen resulting in
unnecessary suffering. Correct by having the seven animals listed above examined by a licensed a veterinarian to
ensure proper diagnosis and treatment of these conditions as well as to ensure that spread of the condition to other
animals is prevented if infectious in nature. The licensee shall maintain documentation of this examination and all
veterinary recommendations for review by APHIS Officials.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Seven animals were found in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection (as described above). Additionally,
there was one black and white smooth hair weanling guinea pig that was found dead in the 5th enclosure on the left
side of the building. There were no records that indicated any problems of ill-health were noted by the licensee prior
to this animal(cid:25)s death. The licensee stated that she was not aware of the dead guinea pig, nor of the conditions
identified by inspectors for all but one of the animals. Although the licensee was aware of the eye problem with
guinea pig #5 listed above, she stated that it had not been reported to the attending veterinarian. All licensees are
required to use adequate methods for daily observation so that animals with health problems are identified quickly.
Additionally, there must be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian (AV)
so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed and
proper care can be directed by the AV and provided by the licensee in an appropriate manner. Failure to make
effective daily observations to properly identify animals in need of care and then communicate those findings to the
AV in a timely manner delays care and results in unnecessary animal suffering. Correct by ensuring that adequate
daily observations are being conducted and that there is a mechanism for direct and frequent communication with
the AV from this point forward. Correct from this day forward.
2.126(a)(4)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The current Program of Veterinary Care allows euthanasia of guinea pigs by the licensee using CO2, however, the
equipment and supplies used for this procedure are located in an area of the property which is not accessible to
inspectors because of biosecurity concerns. Dealers must allow APHIS Officials to inspect the facilities, property
and animals as necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act. Locating portions of the facility (such as equipment
used for euthanasia) in an area of the property that is off-limits to inspectors prevents inspection to ensure thateuthanasia is conducted in a manner consistent with adequate care. Correct by ensuring that all areas of the
property, and animal facilities including all equipment are accessible to inspectors for all future inspections. If the
licensee chooses to change the methods used for routine euthanasia, this must be made in consultation with the
attending veterinarian.
Correct by: Oct. 30, 2015.
3.29(d)
FEEDING.
There are at least 5 food bowls with severely chewed edges along the top rim. All of these bowls had a brown
discoloration around these chewed edges. The chewed edges can no longer be adequately cleaned and
disinfected. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal,
and viral diseases. Food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as often as necessary and at least once
every 2 weeks. Correct by replacing chewed feed bowls and keeping feed bowls clean and sanitizing bowls at least
once 2 weeks. Correct by: Nov. 2, 2015.
3.30 DIRECT
WATERING.
The majority of the enclosures had water bowls that were empty of water at the start of the inspection (they
contained only feces and bedding). A few enclosures still had some water, but the water in the bowls was filthy and
discolored with brown debris from dirty shavings and excreta. Licensee stated that the schedule for feeding,
cleaning, and offering water varies depending on which family member is responsible for the particular enclosure,
but that most guinea pigs were last offered water on the previous afternoon. At the request of APHIS officials, the
licensee rinsed bowls and provided water at time of inspection. In every enclosure animals immediately came up
and began drinking. Several animals drank for an extended amount of time (up to 5 minutes). Water for guinea pigs
must be potable and provided daily unless the food supplements consumed by the animals supplies them with their
normal water requirements. Open containers such as water bowls must be placed in enclosures that minimizes the
contamination from excreta. Water that is contaminated by soiled bedding and excreta can expose the guinea pigs
to disease hazards and health problems. Correct by ensuring that potable water is offered as often as necessary to
ensure the health of the animals and at least daily. Additionally, ensure that watering receptacles are free from
contamination and are properly sanitized when dirty. Correct by: Oct. 30, 2015.
3.31(a)(1) DIRECT
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations of excreta andsoiled bedding. There was an excessive accumulation of fecal material in at least 6 enclosures housing guinea pigs.
These enclosures were filled entirely with excreta mixed with little or no bedding. There were no clean areas for
animals allowing them to be out of the feces and guinea pigs were observed standing and sitting in the fecal
droppings. Several animals had feces on their feet and fur on the legs when removed from the enclosures and the
fecal material had consolidated into a moist pad on the floor of the enclosures. The licensee stated that the
schedule for cleaning of enclosures varies by which family member is responsible for caring for those animals. She
was unsure of the last time that many of the enclosures had the bedding changed or were sanitized. Ineffective
cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough and to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding
and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean
and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding. Correct by: Oct. 30, 2015.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping. The floor in the animal building contained accumulations of spilled hay, shaving, and debris. Animal
facilities must be kept clean to protect the health of the animals and to prevent unnecessary disease risks.
Ineffective cleaning exposes the animals to disease hazards and health problems. Correct by ensuring the floors
are cleaned regularly to support good animal husbandry and health. Correct by: Oct. 30, 2015.
