PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The guinea pig enclosures are suspended on either side by a metal strip, into which the enclosure slides into place.
Approximately 10% of the enclosures are not suspended as intended, rather the metal has become bent, and one
side of the enclosure will tip down on one side, creating a gap opening on the front corner of the enclosure of up to
one inch in diameter. Such opening pose a risk of entrapment, were a guinea pig to access this opening,
Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
To be corrected by 7/22/19.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Many rabbit enclosures were found to be in disrepair. For example:
•(cid:9)One rabbit enclosure door hinge was missing its pin, and was poorly repaired with a piece of wire. This caused the
door to hang slightly crooked, and not close as snugly.
•(cid:9)One rabbit door was bent and could not be latched. It was in use, as the door would stick into the closed position
with force, but it was not latched.
•(cid:9)Some of the feeder slots that were not in use in the rabbit enclosures were not completely covered, so there’s an
opening measuring approximately 1 x 4 inches.
•(cid:9)It was observed that two rabbits had pushed their feeders upward, leaving a gap measuring approximately 1 x 4
inches underneath the feeder. Some feeders slide firmly into place, but others are loose, and are being held into
place by attaching a spring behind the feeder. There is a risk of the feeder falling off, in which case the rabbit could
potentially escape or fall from the enclosure. Enclosures that are not maintained in good repair can present a risk of
entanglement, injury, and/or escape.
Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to contain the rabbits, and
protect them from injury.To be corrected by 7/22/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives on 4/17/19 and 4/18/19.
