2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC approved protocols 2013-02 and 2013-16 without an adequate consideration of alternatives to
procedures that may cause pain or distress. Electronic searches were conducted for literature reviews and the key
words used for the searches included only general terms such as "alternative to animals" "pain and distress in
animals" and "reducing numbers of animals." No scientifically relevant terminology was included in the electronic
searches and the numbers of identified literature results were too large to be realistically assessed and applied to
these protocols. For example, one protocol search yielded over 5 million results for the key words used.
Search terms for alternatives should be specific enough to be related to the animal use identified in the protocol.
Including scientifically relevant terminology that references the field of investigation or study, methods or techniques
to be used and/or the objective of the study are some examples. Prior to IACUC approval protocols must contain
sufficient information for the IACUC to conclude that alternatives were not available.
Correct by: All future protocol reviews.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Coordinator for Laboratory Compliance.
