3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
The licensee is using "Windex" to clean the enclosures approximately 75% of the time. The hamster enclosures (as
well as other small mammal's enclosures) shall be cleaned with a detergent solution followed by a safe and
effective disinfectant.
The use of "Windex" which contains ammonia can irritate the respiratory tracts of these small mammals, particularly
in these fish tank type of enclosures which can hold the ammonia for a longer period of time. The attending
veterinarian concurs with this assessment and recommends discontinuation of this agent.
