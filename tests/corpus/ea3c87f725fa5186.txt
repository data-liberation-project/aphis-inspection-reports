ANNUAL REPORT.
The facility's Annual Report to USDA incorrectly identified all animals used for potentially painful procedures
(surgery) where appropriate use of anesthetic, analgesic, and tranquilizing drugs were employed to minimize pain
and distress as Category C. Category C is for animals used for procedures that involve not more than momentary or
minimal pain and distress, such as blood collection or tattooing. The animals used by this facility should have been
reported under Category D. Appropriate reporting shows that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) understands the pain categories, and is carefully considering ways to minimize pain and distress, and
allows for appropriate regulatory oversight, both of which help to safeguard animal welfare.
An amended Annual Report should be submitted to USDA by 3/10/15.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
