2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care is incomplete. There is no information on the type, dosage and route of
administration for the use of Ivermectin and Frontline. The licensee stated that he uses a backpack style chemical
sprayer to administer the Ivermectin. He stated that he saturates the enclosures and animals contained within them
directly. Furthermore, the licensee stated that he does not remove the pelleted feed, hay feed, bedding or the
guinea pigs when treating with Ivermectin. The licensee also had several bottles of Frontline spray. He stated that
he had not discussed using this product with his attending veterinarian and he uses it once in a while. All
medications used on the guinea pigs must be approved by the attending veterinarian and have directions for their
off label use. The licensee must obtain guidance from the attending veterinarian on the use, dosage, frequency and
administration of all medications and drugs. The program of veterinary care must be complete in order to provide
guidance to the licensee, and to maintain the health of the guinea pigs. The program of veterinary care must
include the type of Ivermectin, dosage, and an approved and safe route of administration, so the animals receive
the appropriate amount of parasite control.
The program of veterinary care was incomplete during the previous inspection conducted on September 9, 2015. At
that time the licensee was instructed to correct it by September 18, 2015. At the time of this inspection the program
of veterinary care remains uncorrected.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of the inspection, six guinea pigs were found dead in their enclosures, in various stages of
decomposition. In pen #101 there was a dead adult tricolor guinea pig, in pen #172 there was a dead juvenile
guinea pig, in pen #167 there was a dead adult dilute tricolor guinea pig, and in pen #80 there were three dead
juvenile guinea pigs. The licensee stated that he had not seen the dead guinea pigs to remove them. There were
no records to indicate any problems of ill-health noted by the licensee prior to the death of these six animals. Daily
observations are either not being performed or are not being performed adequately as evidence by the dead
animals found on this inspection. All licensees are required to use adequate methods for daily observation so thatthe animals with health problems are identified quickly. Additionally, there must be a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian (AV) so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal heath, behavior, and well-being are conveyed and proper care can be directed by the AV and provided by
the licensee in the appropriate manner. Failure to make effective daily observations, to properly identify animals in
need of care, and then communicate those findings to the AV in a timely manner delays care and results in
unnecessary animal suffering and death. Correct by ensuring that adequate daily observations are being conducted
and that there is a mechanism for direct and frequent communication with the AV from this point forward. Correct
from this day forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of animal sold were incomplete. The sale records did not include the name and address of the buyer, the
USDA license number of the buyer, and the method of transportation. Records must be complete to document
changes in ownership, track animal shipments, and to comply with Animal Welfare Regulations. Licensee must
ensure that records on complete on all animals sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of. Correct by June 20,
2016.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The following enclosures need repair:
(1) Majority of the breeding enclosures (about 90 %) and several weanling enclosures (about 20%) have chewed
and sharp edges around the opening for the water valves on the plastic pipe.
(2)There are protruding screws on the inside wooden frame that was previous used for salt blocks in the breeding
enclosures.
(3)Multiple enclosures have rusty and/or broken wire on the side of the breeding enclosures. Examples of
enclosures with rusty and/or broken wire include 1, 2, 3, 4, 49, 50, 51, 98, 99, 100, 138, 139, and 140.
All enclosures must be kept structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury
and to contain the animals securely. The above enclosures must be repaired or replaced to prevent injury to the
animals and to prevent escape. Correct by July 16, 2016.
3.31(a)(1)SANITATION.
Primary enclosures are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations of excreta, soiled
bedding, dirt, debris, and urine stains. There were accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, urine stains and
grime on sides and floors of enclosures. The breeding enclosures had a fecal material consolidated in a moist fecal
pad on the floor area by the watering system. The licensee stated that the enclosures are cleaned weekly by
removing bedding, scraping floors while the animals remain in the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation
exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be
cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, urine stains and grime and must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods described in section 3.31(a)(4). Correct by ensuring
that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized othern enough to prevent accumulation of excreta and
debris. Additionally, ensure that all primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by
June 18, 2016.
3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are not being sanitized properly. There were accumulations of excreta, soiled
bedding, dirt, urine stains and grime on sides and floors of enclosures. The licensee stated that the enclosures are
cleaned weekly by removing bedding, scraping floors while the animals remain in the enclosures and sanitizing
enclosures with clorox. The buildup of urine stains, dirt and grime on sides and floors of enclosures indicates the
enclosures are not being cleaned sanitized adequately or effectively. Licensee must ensure that primary enclosures
are sanitized using 180 degrees and soap or detergent in a mechanical cage wash, by ensuring washing with a
detergent solution and then using a disinfectant, or by cleaning with live steam. Sanitation of primary enclosures is
necessary to minimize risk of disease to the animals housed therein. Correct by June 23, 2016.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping. The floor adjacent to and directly beneath the primary enclosures contained accumulations of spilled
hay, soiled shavings, and excreta. Premises must be kept clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry
practices and to prevent unnecessary disease risks to the animals. Correct by ensuring the premises are kept clean
including: removing of spilled feed, shavings and excreta from the aisles and under the racks.
There were several bottles of Frontline, a 2 gallon opened jug of Ivermectin, and a large canister of Tang powder
mix stored on the top of a stack of four primary enclosures housing approximately 15 guinea pigs in each (60 total
guinea pigs). Chemicals, medications and cleaning supplies can leak or spill causing contamination of feed and
bedding and pose a potential to cause injury to the animals contained within the enclosure. All medications and
cleaning supplies must be stored in a leak proof container to prevent accidental exposure to the guinea pig colony.Correct by moving the medications, supplements, and cleaning supplies away from the primary enclosures and in a
safe and clean environment such as cabinet or shelf. Correct by June 18, 2016.
