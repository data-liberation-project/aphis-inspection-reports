2.31(c)(6)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
During the spring 2021 semi-annual reviews, the IACUC discovered regulated activities, at an off-campus site, that were
not included in an active protocol. Since 2016, the facility has provided an agricultural training program for special forces
medics which covers a variety of general animal husbandry procedures. The IACUC believed that this training program
was covered by an existing agricultural protocol, however, during their investigation, they discovered that additional
medical procedures that were not covered by the protocol were being performed. It was discovered that the trainings
involved epidural demonstrations with cattle and blood collection for cattle and swine which were not medically necessary
for the animals' health.
In order to provide appropriate oversight of the research programs and facilities, the IACUC must review proposed
activities to ensure that the care and use of animals is being performed as documented. Performing activities not
reviewed or approved by the IACUC can lead to unidentified painful and distressing situations for the animals.
Upon discovery, the program was immediately halted, a new protocol was drafted specifically for the training, and the
IACUC representatives notified the APHIS inspector.

Facilities, general.
Within the facility's IACUC records, it was noted that on various occasions sheep's hooves have gotten caught between
the slats in the holding pen flooring. These incidents have resulted in transient lameness, but have not required additional
medical care.
Failure to use appropriate materials for animal housing can result in possible entrapment and injury to the animals. The
facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved to protect them
from injury.
The facility took immediate corrective actions to address the incident and replaced the slatted flooring in the sleep
enclosures. The facility has not had any known cases of foot injuries related to the flooring since implementing this
change.
