2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**A rescued male feral pig currently being housed in an approximately 10 x 10 primary enclosure, appeared thin
with patches of hair loss along the back and sides of the animal. A lock was noted on the animal's primary
enclosure which didn't allow the animal access to the larger portion of the outdoor housing while fencing around the
area was being repaired. Not being allowed out of the primary enclosure for extended periods of time can have a
negative welfare impact on the animal which can lead to hair loss and poor body condition. Although the pig has
been housed at the facility for several weeks, the attending veterinarian had not been contacted to evaluate the
condition of the pig. Direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is communicated to the attending veterinarian. The licensee
must contact the attending veterinarian to have the pig's condition evaluated for diagnosis and treatment.
