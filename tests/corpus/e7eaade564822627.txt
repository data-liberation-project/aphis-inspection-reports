FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain link fencing between the adjacent tiger enclosures (one housing a male named Chase next to one
housing a male named Mowgli and a female named Kiara) had become unsecured at the bottom. This poses a risk
of injury to these tigers should a paw get caught on the sharp ends or a bite or scratch may occur if one of the tigers
reaches into the adjacent enclosure.
A wooden spool in the enclosure housing 3 servals had the sharp end of a wood screw protruding fromt the top
surface, posing a risk of injury to these cats.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected by 6/20/2014.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The facility is maintaining a trash pit near the enclosure #31 housing 23 black bears and 2 brown bears. This pit
has a strong odor and is attracting numerous flies around the enclosure. Flies can carry diseases and the waste in
the pit may contribute to this risk since it is adjacent to the enclosure.
Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the
animals.
To be corrected by 6/30/2014.Accompanied on the inspection by the Owner, APHIS personnel, and representatives from the Colorado Parks and
Wildlife Division. Exit interview conducted on site with the owner.
