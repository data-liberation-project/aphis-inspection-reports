HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One of the servals has a history of arthritis. In order to get to the 4 foot (approx.) elevated resting surface, this cat
needs to jump first onto a sky kennel, and then onto the platform. Jumping can cause pain or unnecessary
discomfort to the joints and exacerbate the arthritis.
A suitable ramp (or other device) shall be placed into the enclosure so that this cat can comfortably climb up to the
elevated resting platform without causing unnecessary discomfort or contributing to the progression of this
condition.
