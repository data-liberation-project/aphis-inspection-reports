2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Four spiny mice were observed to have tails that were recently chewed off/lost about half way down from the base of the
tail. Dried up blood was observed at the tips where the tail was cut off. The licensee was aware of the injuries to the
spiny mice, but has not contacted the Attending Veterinarian for treatment.

One adult and four baby hedgehogs were observed to have mites crawling throughout their spines/quills. The licensee
had not observed this prior to inspection and therefore was not treating the hedgehogs.

Broken off tails on the spiny mice may be painful. In addition, the open wound could get infected and cause systemic
disease. Mites can cause irritation for the hedgehogs. In addition it can lead to a loss of appetite, fatigue, flaky skin, loss
of quills, among other things.

The Attending Veterinarian must be contacted and a treatment plan must be followed through for both the spiny mice and
hedgehogs.

Correct by 12/11/21.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
