3.6(a)(2)(12) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
.
The outside wire runs of the Stacker building that are coated with a material (plastic/fiberglass/rubber, etc.) have
numerous missing pieces of the material, leaving bare wire that is not adequate flooring for dogs to walk on. Metal
strands of wire used for flooring must be greater than 1/8 of an inch in diameter (9 gauge) or coated. These missing
pieces of coating leave the metal wire strands that dogs are walking on bare and less than 9 gauge. This flooring
must be repaired or replaced in a manner that can maintain a safe environment for dogs to walk. This will help
ensure that the dogs in this building are on flooring that will allow them to move around comfortable and be injury
free.
