3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural strength,
In the back holding area of the Collard Peccary enclosure, along the right rear wall is an area of broken stucco with
exposed chicken wire with sharp edges. This area is not in good repair and the exposed chicken wire could
potentially cause injuries to the animals. In the same back holding area, along the left rear side the floor is missing a
board. This area has a large enough gap for an animal's foot to get caught which could potentially cause an injury.
Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from
injuries.
Inspection accompanied by APHIS Officials Jeanne Kjos, VMO; Cindy Rhodes, ACI, and facility representative. An
exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
