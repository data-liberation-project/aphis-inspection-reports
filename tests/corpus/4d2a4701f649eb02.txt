Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of the inspection, multiple dogs were identified by the inspectors as having interdigital cysts. These included
dogs (id # 1968089, # 183998, #0181405, #0226492, #0227138). Interdigital cysts can be painful and the facility has a
treatment plan in place to be started when these issues are identified during daily observations.

A dog id # 0204422 had an injury to the left rear hock that had been present more than a day and was not identified by
the staff during daily observations.

A dog id # 0205118 had a growth observed on the left side of the chest that had been present for more than a day and
was not identified by the staff during daily observations.

A dog id # 3703348 was missing a toe nail on the left front paw. There was a small hole and the area was reddened in
color. This did not appear to be a recent injury, there was no treatment card identifying that the dog had been treated or
noted during daily observations.

A dog # 0166333 had a small puncture wound affecting her left mammary gland. This did not appear to be a recent

injury, there was no treatment card identifying that the dog had been treated or noted during daily observations.


Although there is multiple walk throughs occurring daily in these animal areas, daily observation at the facility must be
conducted by employees and attendants who can recognize when animal health or condition is compromised and then
communicate that information to the attending veterinarian so timely and accurate information on problems of animal well
being are being properly diagnosed and can be treated.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Animal enclosures in Buildings 35 were not being spot cleaned daily and there was old feces on top of the wire mesh and
on the mats for the dogs. This accumulation of feces needs to be removed to prevent the dogs from soiling themselves.

There is a build up of feces on the wire mesh in one whelping building at the main site. Although large piles of feces are
not present, the feces that remains is building up on sections of the mesh and the dams and puppies cannot avoid
walking in it. This is a smaller mesh area and needs more attention so that feces are fully removed from the enclosure
daily.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

In Building 24 the fans and vents above the enclosures had an accumulation of hair, dirt and debris that needs to be
removed. This building also had extra storage containers of old feed that were dirty and had mold growing in them.

In building 35 the fans also need to be cleaned and there was excess older food that was on a shelf under an electrical
box that was green.

These housing facilities must be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate husbandry practices and keeping fans clean
promotes better air movement around the animals.
