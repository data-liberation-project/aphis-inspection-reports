3.6(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The enclosures housing puppies in the "Nursery" and "NICU"' are not being maintained in good repair. The enclosures
are comprised of stainless steel kennels stacked upon one another. Along the bottom seams of the middle row, large
areas of silicone sealant are missing, allowing liquids such as urine, cleaning solution, waste material, etc. to run down
from the upper enclosure into the lower enclosure. A facility employee stated that during cleaning, the cleaning solution
can be seen running down from the upper enclosure into the lower enclosure. Brown material and water stains are
present at upper seams of the lower enclosures. This brown material was easily removed with a cotton swab during
inspection. Additionally, when water was poured down the wall of the upper enclosure, multiple streams of water began
running from the top of the lower enclosure down the wall.

When animals are housed in the lower enclosures, they are at risk of exposure to waste fluids from animals housed
above. Animals that come in contact with other animal's excreta have a higher risk of contracting contagious diseases,
especially in young puppies that are still developing a strong immune system.

Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are maintained in good repair.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
