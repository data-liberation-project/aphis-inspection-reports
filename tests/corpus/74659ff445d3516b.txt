ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Male Westie (chip #105774846) has a pea sized red mass between the 2nd and 3rd toe of the right front foot.
This dog is not limping and does not appear painful on this foot. The licensee stated he noticed this mass but does
not have veterinary guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care nor has he called the attending veterinarian for
guidance. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to have this animal examined and to have the
veterinarian provide treatment recommendations. Treatment recommendations and treatments must be
documented and maintained for future review by APHIS officials.
Failure to provide prompt appropriate care to the dogs for medical concerns may lead to prolonged pain and
suffering in the animals.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.***No current records of animals in hand were available during this inspection. The licensee(cid:25)s daughter stated that
they currently do not have an up to date Form 7005 for adults. A computer record from 2011 was found but has 62
dogs listed when only 35 adults were counted on today(cid:25)s inspection. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are
kept on Form 7005(cid:25)s and are kept current. This is required to assist the inspection process and ensure animal
tracking is possible, which is especially important in the event of a disease outbreak.
