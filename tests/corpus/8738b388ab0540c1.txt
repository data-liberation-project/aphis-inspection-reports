2.4 CRITICAL
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
On July 26, 2017 at approximately 11:30 am the inspectors arrived at the facility and knocked on the front door.
The licensee came out the door and was very angry and spoke aggressively towards the inspectors. The licensee
stated that she had sent a copy of her license to the office and was not going to have it renewed in October,
therefore the inspectors were not going to inspect the animals today. The inspectors informed the licensee that as
long as the license was still active they needed to do the inspection. The licensee again angrily stated that they
were not going to inspect today.
The inspectors told the licensee that she could cancel her license with them today and she stated she was not going
to do that, she paid for it through October and she was going to keep it. Once again the inspectors said they
needed to conduct the inspection and the license began to verbally insult one of the inspectors. The inspectors
stopped the verbal insults and once more asked the licensee if she was going to refuse the inspection or allow the
inspection, but she continued to verbally harass one of the inspectors. The inspectors asked at least four times if
the licensee was refusing the inspection, and the licensee stated that she was not going to allow any inspections
until she has another person present so the inspectors can not gang up on her.
The licensee angrily said that she was tired of the inspector bringing other inspectors to the facility. The inspector
explained that she had brought a Veterinary Medical Officer to the inspection due to the problems with veterinary
care at the facility. The licensee said that she has not had any veterinary care problems except with the dogs' teeth.
The inspectors asked one last time if she was going to allow the inspection and the licensee replyed by saying the
inspector isn't supposed to be here until September, and wanted to know why the inspectors were here in July. The
inspectors stated they were here to do an inspection based on a complaint from the public and the licensee
requested the mailing address for the Freedom of Information Act office.
The inspectors said they would return to their car and get her the requested information and bring it back to her and
she needed to take this time to decide if she was going to refuse the inspection or not. After returning from the car
and giving the information back to the licensee she said that the inspection was going to be allowed. The licensee
then began to verbally insult and harass the inspector again and both inspectors told her she was to stop and they
are going to get their inspection supplies from the car. The licensee followed the inspectors to their car andcontinued the verbal harassment of one of the inspectors and that inspector told the licensee that she was tired of
the name calling and the accusations and that needed to stop now and the inspection would begin. The licensee
continued the harassment and both inspectors stopped the inspection and left the facility.
Interference with APHIS officials does not allow for a proper inspection of the facility and animals, therefore, the
regulations of the Animal Welfare Act cannot be adequately enforced.
A licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbal abuse), or harass any APHIS official in the
course of carrying out his or her duties. The licensee must refrain from interfering with any APHIS official who is
inspecting her facility in order to ensure that the Animal Welfare Act can be properly enforced.
Correction date: From this day forward
The exit interview could not be conducted due to interference from the licensee.
Additional Inspectors
Unck Autumn, Veterinary Medical Officer
