3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The lip of a metal feeder in pen #3 (containing one dog) was worn to the point of having a jagged, sharp edge.
This jagged edge could cause injury to the mouth or face of the animal. The licensee must repair or replace any
surfaces that come in contact with dogs so that there are no sharp points or jagged edges of metal protruding into
the enclosure that could injure the animals.

3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* A strong ammonia odor was present in the Whelp Building (housing nine puppies and ten dogs). This odor
permeated throughout the building, irritating the inspectors nose and causing them to catch their breath. This odor
can irritate the respiratory tracts of the puppies and dogs. Licensee must provide sufficient ventilation to provide for
the animalsCBA health and well-being, and to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation.
