ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:45 am on
02/24/2016.
Waited ~15 minutes at the gate. There was no answer at the gate call system. Called both licensees' cell phone
numbers - no answer and no voicemail option was available at either. Then a text message to one licensee resulted
in a returned phone call. She stated that no one was on-site who could accompany an inspection, and the licensee
was away for at least an hour and a half due to a doctor's appointment. Licensee was notified that an attempted
inspection report will be sent.
IES Investigator Sue Orham was present at this attempted inspection.
