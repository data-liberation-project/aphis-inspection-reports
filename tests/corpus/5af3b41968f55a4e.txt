Facilities, general.
RSC : Sacks of feed are stored on pallets underneath an open shed . One of the bags is torn and spilled feed is on the
ground adjacent to the feed bags. Flies are swarming on the spilled feed. The spilled feed is creating an attractant for
pests that may contaminate the feed. Storing feed sacks in a shed open to the weather allows for damage to the feed
supply by rain. Feed must be properly stored to prevent deterioration and the area surrounding the stored feed kept clean
to avoid contamination by pests .
