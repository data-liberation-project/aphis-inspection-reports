Requirements and application.
This is a search inspection. The facility currently sells regulated mammals (degus, hedgehogs and African dormice) at the
Birdytown Exotics pet store in Jackson TN without a valid USDA license. A valid license is necessary to protect the health
and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. The facility needs to obtain a
USDA license or discontinue regulated activities. No regulated activities may be conducted until USDA license is
obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
