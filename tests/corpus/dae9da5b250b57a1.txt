ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While reviewing the Program of Veterinary Care it was noted that it had been updated within the past year.
However, the rabbits were not listed on the document. To ensure that the attending veterinarian will provide care for
the rabbits, this document will need to be amended.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
While reviewing the records it was noted that they were not complete. Documentation on the acquisition of animals
that have been on the premise for years, was not available for review. All animal acquisition paperwork needs to be
kept currant, accurate, and available for inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. During this inspection the fence in the goat pen was noted to be in need of repair. The fence along the "train side"
had a few broken ties. The broken ties were approximately 1' up from the ground. The lack of ties is allowing for the
fence to bow outwards.
To ensure that the fence is secure these ties will need to be replaced.

2. The left side of the goat shelter is also in need of attention. There is a hole in the wood door frame. To ensure
that the goats are not injured on this hole it will need to be repaired.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of this inspection there was an opened bag of shavings in the deer shed. In speaking with a staff
member I was informed that this bedding was for the rabbit hutches. Due to the fact that the bag was open and the
deer would have access to it, this will need to be placed into a closed container, and moved out of the deer area.

WATERING.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the goat and deer water receptacles were in need of attention. The
receptacles had an accumulation of dirt, grim, algae and leaves present. All animals need to be offered potable
water. Due to the conditions in these water receptacles, this water would not be considered potable.
These receptacles will need to be cleaned out on a more frequent basis.
