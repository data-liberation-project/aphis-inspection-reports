WATERING.
A water receptacle in the rabbit enclosure had a heavy buildup of algae. Clean water receptacles are essential for
promoting good health to the animals and reduce the risk of disease. All watering receptacles shall be sanitized
when dirty and at least once every two weeks.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the goat enclosure at the Somis facility, there are two areas in the metal wire fencing which have been cut away.
Removal of this fencing material has left metal wires exposed with sharp edges. The sharp edges are located at a
level where the animals could injure themselves. Animal housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.
