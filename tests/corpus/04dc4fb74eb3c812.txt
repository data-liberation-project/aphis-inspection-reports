FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The electrical cords to the heat lamps being used for the goat enclosure housing one adult goat and four young
goats are within reach of the goats. The goats may be injured if they chew through or into an electrical cord. The
electrical cords need to be moved out of reach of the goats or protected in a manner that the goats can't reach
them.
*Several small white pieces of insulation material were noted in the African crested porcupine enclosure. The
porcupines have been chewing on the housing material exposing the insulation. Ingestion of the material may lead
to digestive issues. The housing walls need to be repaired or replaced.
