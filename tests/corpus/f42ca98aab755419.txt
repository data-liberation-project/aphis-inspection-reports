FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several fence post supports running parallel along the top of the north side of the outdoor black bear enclosure are
showing signs of rot and structural compromise. These posts provide a frame work for the fencing that contains the
black bears and need to be repaired or replaced to ensure a structurally sound enclosure. A regular schedule of
review and maintenance needs to be in place and carried out to maintain all enclosures in sound condition.
