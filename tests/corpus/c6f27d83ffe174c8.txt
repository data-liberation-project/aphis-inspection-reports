2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00pm on
13-OCT-17. Attempts to contact the licensee included knocking on the front door and leaving a voicemail at the
listed phone number. No response to any attempts to contact were answered within a 30-minute period.
Lack of availability makes the inspection process impossible. The licensee must ensure a responsible,
knowledgeable facility representative is available to accompany the inspection during normal business hours.
Correct from this time forward.
