ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:33 AM on
03-Sep-19.
Upon arrival to the facility, I knocked on the door twice, then called Mr. Beeler's telephone number. There was no
answer, so I left a message. I honked the horn twice while waiting in the vehicle. After waiting in the vehicle for 30
minutes, I left the facility.
