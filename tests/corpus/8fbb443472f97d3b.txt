Notification of change of operation.
In an attempt to inspect this facility, it was determined that the business was no longer in operation. A call was made to
the registrant and the APHIS VMO was informed she moved out of Arizona on July 1, 2021 and she didn't notify a change
of address as required by AWA. A registrant shall notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the
name, address, or ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as an intermediate handler, within 10 days
after making such change.

To be corrected immediately.

This exit interview was conducted with the registrant.
