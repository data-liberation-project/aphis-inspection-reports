2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
* One two-week-old orange and white TSW Chocolate Texel colored Guinea Pig was not able to walk on its back legs.
The Guinea Pig was able to use its front legs to move but both back legs just drug on the floor. Both back legs extended
backwards when the Guinea Pig was trying to move. No movement of both back legs was observed during the
inspection. The licensee stated that this was the first time the condition had been observed. The licensee did make text
contact with the attending veterinarian during the facility inspection. Adequate veterinary care includes daily observation
with assessment and recognition of any possible health problems, with these problems promptly reported to the attending
veterinarian, so that appropriate diagnostics and any necessary treatment can occur in a timely manner in order to
safeguard the animal's well-being. Failure to recognize changes in gait or health could delay treatment, potentially
resulting in worsening medical conditions, and discomfort for the animal. Daily observation of all animals is critical to
ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and wellbeing are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally,
when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that
appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health
problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions.
Lack of veterinary care could lead to a worsened health condition and discomfort to the animal. The facility must conduct
daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and

appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian. The licensee must perform daily observations of all animals
to assess their health and well-being. Daily observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the
attending veterinarian. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct by
end of business on 7/2/21.

This inspection and exit interview done on 6/29/21 were conducted with the licensee. The inspection report and verbal
exit briefing done on 6/30/21 were conducted with the licensee.
