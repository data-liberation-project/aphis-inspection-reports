PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two of the four rabbits were housed in an open top pen. The other two rabbits were tethered by harnesses to the
outside of the enclosure. When the inspector arrived at the event, around 4:40 pm, there was no staff present
observing the animals. At approximately 5:20 pm the licensee arrived and began giving pony rides. The animals
were not immediately checked. The loose rabbit was not noticed until the inspector brought it to the licensee's
attention during the inspection. The licensee said the rabbit had been in a harness when she last checked
sometime around noon. The licensee left the area for the afternoon. The harness could be seen under one of the
sandbags near the enclosure. The rabbit had apparently gotten stuck and wiggled out of the harness. The licensee
stated that the exhibit had been set up previously and that the animals had been left overnight. They were checked
in the morning and again at noontime.
The primary enclosure should provide a safe environment for the animals. It is required to adequately contain the
animals and protect them from predators. The open top pen, the use of tethering while unattended, loose rabbits outside the enclosure put these rabbits at
great risk of injury or death.
Provide adequate enclosures that ensure the safety and well-being of the rabbits.
Harness use must be restricted to times of direct supervision is provided.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The area set up for the sheep and goats did not have any shade provided. The animals were all observed panting.
In the corner next to the pen, a fan was set up. Two of the animals housed in that pen were pushing and leaning
out of the pen to be in the breeze of the fan.
Direct sunlight on animals can cause heat stress quickly and puts the animals at risk of illness or death.
