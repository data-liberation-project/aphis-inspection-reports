3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a lack of adequate perimeter fencing around several of the enclosures in the section of the facility referred
to North American Trail as well as the camels and New Guinea singing dogs enclosures. Some of the enclosures do
have a perimeter fence but not on all four sides also, a few of the enclosures are surrounded by perimeter fences
that are only four feet high.
Lack of a perimeter fence does not protect the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons
from having contact with the animals. Also, without a perimeter fence there is no secondary containment system.
A six foot perimeter fence must be provided for these enclosures to keep unauthorized people and unwanted
animals from contacting the animals on exhibit and provide a secondary containment system in the event of escape.
