3.127(d)(1)

Facilities, outdoor.
The licensee recently acquired two raccoons from a state confiscation. Their current primary enclosure is a three sided
durable structure made of wood with a wire mesh front and a chain link double door entry. The enclosure is designed to
restrict entry by both animals and unauthorized persons but as it is not behind the perimeter fence, it requires
Administrator approval.

The licensee must submit for approval to be fully complaint with this section or place building behind a perimeter fence.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within (2) more inspection(s) or by March 15, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
