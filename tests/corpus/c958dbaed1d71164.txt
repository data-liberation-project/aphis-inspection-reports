Sanitation.
The enclosure housing two geriatric bears had accumulated an excessive amount of fecal matter. Fecal matter of varying
chronicity (freshly produced to at least one day old) could be identified. The cement surrounding her rear end and directly
under her was covered in various layers of feces - some of which had caked onto her fur.
Excess excreta can lead to odors, spread of disease and attract vermin. Excreta should be removed from the primary
enclosures often enough to prevent contamination of animals and minimize disease hazards and odors.
