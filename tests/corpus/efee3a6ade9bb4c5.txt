FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There were two calves that were found in the enclosure with the alpaca. They had gotten out of their enclosure
with the cow. The paneling had spaces wide enough on three sides of their enclosure for them to squeeze through
which means they could easily escape from their pen. The enclosure needs to be reinforced or constructed to
properly contain the animals so they can't escape. Correct immediately.

WATERING.
***The two small water buckets for the pigs, sheep and goats were empty in their shared primary enclosure. Several
animals were coninuously approachig the water buckets looking for water. There were too many animals in that
enclosure to share two small buckets of water overnight. There should be more water available to the animals for
everyone to access it. Correct immediately.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***In the pens containing the sheep, goats and pigs were several strands of baling twine on the ground. This could
cause injury to the animals if they get entangled in the twine or if they ingest it. Accumulations of trash shall be
placed in designated areas and removed from the animal's pens. Correct immediately.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
The inspection was conducted at the Queen City Fair in Meridian, MS.
