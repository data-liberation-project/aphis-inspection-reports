2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently the Records of Acquisition/inventory 7005 forms are missing several ID numbers, complete addresses of
where animals have been acquired and descriptions. There are three Golden Retrievers that have not been added
to the inventory and have been on the property for several weeks. The Puppy Records that are being kept are
missing some information that allows for complete traceability. The majority of the records are adequate, however
there needs to be more details recorded for proper AWA regulations and standards, and all animals on the property
must be on the Acquisition forms.
Complete and accurate records are necessary for proper management and care for the regulated animals.
The licensee must keep updated and complete 7005 Acquisition/inventory paperwork and Puppy Records of all
regulated animals kept and born at the facility.
