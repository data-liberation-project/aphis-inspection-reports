ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult black and white goat had overgrown hooves and walked with slightly abnormal gate. The hooves on
both hind legs were excessively long, extending out approximately three inches to the point that they were curling
up. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause
injuries. As part of the facility(cid:25)s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals
receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***During the inspection, APHIS personnel observed members of the public feed and touch one giraffe outside the
designated contact/feeding area. There is a section of the giraffe enclosure, near the service entrance to the giraffe
barn, which the public can reach over the public barrier and make contact with the animals. Although there was an
attendant present in the designated giraffe feeding area, the attendant was not observing this interaction.
Additionally, when the facility owner and general curator were asked, they stated the public should not be touching
the animals in non-designated areas.
Failure to maintain appropriate barriers with adequate distance does not ensure the safety of the animals and the
public. The facility must ensure, during public exhibition, there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the
animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The shelter on the island housing five ring-tailed lemurs is in need of repair or replacement. The backside of the
shelter has a large hole (large enough for the animals to go through) with jagged wood edges with screws
protruding. The edges and screws pose a risk of injury to the animals. ***The shelter roof on the island housing five spider monkeys is in need of repair or replacement. The corrugated
metal roof of the shelter structure was no longer attached in some sections and was lifted up off the shelter. The
roof has not been maintained and will not function properly if lifted off its structure.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be kept in good repair and must protect the animals from injury. The
facility must repair or replace the items listed above and maintain all housing facilities from this inspection forward.
To be corrected by 1/29/16.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The facility is not spot cleaning hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come into contact daily. The
general curator and animal keeper stated that the shelters on the nonhuman primate islands are cleaned every two
to three days with water and bleach. APHIS personnel observed the nonhuman primates to sit on top of the shelter
structures on the island. One APHIS VMO observed several piles of excreta and food waste on the corrugated roofs
of the shelter structures while inspecting the nonhuman primate islands.
Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in
accordance with 3.84 of the Animal Welfare Act regulations to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards.

3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***The facility is not providing heat to non-human primates housed outdoors to maintain temperatures above 45
degrees Fahrenheit. When asked, the facility owner and general curator stated they had no documentation or policy
on temperature range guidelines or acclimation. At the time of inspection, the temperature according to inspector(cid:25)s
kestrel, was 39 degrees Fahrenheit. The overnight lows for the area, according to weather underground, was 36
degrees Fahrenheit. The outdoor housing facilities consist of eight nonhuman primate islands and six outdoor
enclosures housing 59 nonhuman primates of various species including ring-tailed lemurs, white-throated
capuchins, spider monkeys, Patas monkeys, De Brazza monkeys, Pileated gibbons and white-handed gibbons.
APHIS personnel observed several nonhuman primates to either huddle in groups or to sit in the sun spots of their
enclosures. Additionally, APHIS personnel observed one female Pileated gibbon huddled in a corner and to
periodically tremble/shake.
Failure to provide supplemental heat can lead to health and medical conditions including cold stress, frostbite,
hypothermia and death. The facility must safely provide heat to all outdoor enclosures when the ambienttemperatures fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit, except as directed by the attending veterinarian and in accordance
with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices. Additionally, the facility must safely provide heat
when the animals are exhibiting and/or may exhibit signs of cold stress.
To be corrected by 2/5/2016
***One island (outdoor housing) containing four ring-tailed lemurs does not have adequate shelter from the
elements. The island has one (cid:28)umbrella-like(cid:29) structure that the nonhuman primates can sit under. This structure
does not provide protection from horizontal rain, wind or cold. Failure to provide adequate shelter can lead to health
and medical conditions including sickness, cold stress and hypothermia. The facility must provide adequate shelter
from the elements at all times in outdoor housing facilities.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***The perch branches in the enclosure housing one female red handed tamarin had an excessive accumulation of
dark brown debris.
***The den box in the enclosure housing five red handed tamarins was dirty with an accumulation of dark brown
debris on its surfaces.
Failure to clean primary enclosures and surfaces/structures within the enclosure at an appropriate frequency
increases disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. Additionally, it does not allow the animals the freedom to
avoid contact with excreta. Primary enclosures including structures within the enclosure must be kept clean and
replaced when worn.
To be corrected by 1/29/16.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***One of the dry food storage rooms was dirty with spilled dry food on the floor and rodent feces. Failure to
maintain food storage areas can lead to deterioration, molding or contamination of the animal food. Additionally,
contaminated feed could be fed to the animals posing a risk of health and medical issues. The facility must ensure
that supplies of food and bedding are stored in clean facilities that adequately protect them against deterioration,
molding or contamination by vermin.
To be corrected by 1/23/16Inspection was conducted on 1/14/16 with the facility owner, general curator and APHIS personnel including Drs.
Aaron Rhyner and Tyler Fields and Compliance Specialist Jean Bolinger.
Exit briefing was conducted on 1/22/16 with facility representatives and APHIS VMO Aaron Rhyner.
