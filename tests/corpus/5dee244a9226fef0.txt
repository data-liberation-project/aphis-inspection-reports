2.31(c)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC functions.
The facility is currently conducting regulated activity in one horse. There is no IACUC approved protocol covering
this activity. The facility representative states they are currently working on writing and reviewing a proposal for this
activity. Conducting regulated activities that have not been approved by the IACUC does not ensure humane care
and use of animals at the facility. The IACUC must review and approve all proposed regulated activities involving
regulated animals prior to conducting those activities.
To be corrected from this day forward.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with three facility representatives.
