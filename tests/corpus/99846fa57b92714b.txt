3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
One sheltered enclosure containing three dogs has not been sanitized in a month. There was a strong odor on the indoor
part of the enclosure. Not sanitizing all enclosures every two weeks or more often as necessary can contribute to the
spread of disease. All enclosures must be sanitized every two weeks or more often as necessary. Correct by 2/10/23.
3.13(a)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Annual exams have not been getting completed on the adult dogs. Not having the Attending Veterinarian conduct annual
exams on all adult dogs doesn't ensure that adequate veterinary care is being provided to the dogs. The licensee must
have the Attending Veterinarian conduct annual exams on all adult dogs. Correct by 3/7/23.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
At least five adult dogs were not current on their distemper, parvo, and rabies vaccines. In addition, no dogs are currently
being sampled for heartworm or fecal parasites. Not vaccinating all adults dogs and not sampling the adult dogs for
parasites doesn't ensure the dogs are adequately protected from various diseases and parasites. All adult dogs must be
vaccinated for distemper, parvo, and rabies and must be sampled for parasites in accordance with a plan from the
Attending Veterinarian. Correct by 3/7/23.
