FACILITIES, INDOOR.
At least 20 rabbit enclosures are moderately covered in rust. The presence of rust may prevent the required
cleaning and sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The facility is currently replacing rabbit primary enclosures, food receptacles, wood beams, and other structures. It
was noted that one barn has been completed and a second barn had one row of enclosures replaced.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are
substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.
