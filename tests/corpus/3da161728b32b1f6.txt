OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements. Shade
****In the outdoor facility there were enclosures that did not provide sufficient shelter structures for each of the
enclosed dogs. Two large dogs shared a shelter that was large enough for one of those dogs. When one of the
dogs went into the enclosure,it took up almost the entire space. There were 2 medium size dogs that shared a
plastic 55 gallon barrel but there was only space enough for 1 of those dogs to sit, stand, and lie in a normalmanner. When 1 dog was in the shelter, there was no longer space for the other dog to have normal posture and
movement while inside the structure. Shelter space is important to protect the dogs from the weather and wind.
Sufficient housing for all dogs is essential for the comfort and well being of the animals. More shelter space must
be provided for all dogs at all times.
****The outdoor facility has metal roofing over most of the enclosures that provides shade and protection from the
direct rays of the sun. There are 4 enclosures that do not have any roofing or shade over them. It is important for
dogs to have shade so they can get relief from the direct rays of the sun. Shade must be provided and maintained
for all dogs at all times.

****The wooden step in front of the large shelter has 4 nails that have come through from the opposite side of the
board. The ends are the sharp points of the nails and could injure the puppies as they move about. The owner
must ensure the safety and well being of the dogs by preventing sharp points in the enclosures that could injure the
dogs. The sharp points must be removed.
