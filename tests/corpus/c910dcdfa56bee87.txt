2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A sheep in the pen towards the front of the farm and housed with a goat and zebu is limping on the left front limb. When
standing still, the goat is holding the limb up intermittently and is not willing to put full weight on the limb. A second sheep
in the pen in the far right corner and housed with another sheep and zebu is limping on its rear limb. This limp was more
significant upon initial observation, but once the sheep began moving around, the limp became less pronounced. The
licensee stated that when doing the morning feeding and observation, the limp was not noted for either sheep.

Failure to promptly identify injuries can delay treatment and cause unnecessary pain and distress in the animals. Daily
observations of animal health, behavior, and well-being must be performed and health issues must be conveyed in a
timely manner to the attending veterinarian.

Correct by contacting the attending veterinarian and having the animals examined. The licensee corrected this during the
inspection and contacted the veterinary office upon identification of the limping animals. A veterinary appointment is
scheduled.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
