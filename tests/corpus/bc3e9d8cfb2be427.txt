PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection one adult dog was on suspended flooring that was sagging due to the cattle panel underneath
being used to support the wire flooring was broken. Suspended flooring that sags or is bent between the structural
supports does not provide a flat surface area for the dog to walk on. Daily activity & mobility can be greatly affected
(limited) because the dog has to learn to walk on flooring that is sagging or bent. Elimination of all sagging or bent
flooring that the dog has to walk on is necessary to ensure the safety,health & well- being of all dogs. To be
corrected by 04-05-15.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
