3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor portion of the primary enclosure for the two wolf-dogs named "Lola" and "Lupa, along the side on the
outside of the Tropical building the chicken wire had pulled away leaving exposed, sharp edges. Underneath the
Tropical Building, boards, chicken wire and other building materials were present, where the animals had access to
come into contact with these materials. Along the bottom of the fencing in the primary enclosure are railroad ties
with coated wires. The coating of the wires has deteriorated, leaving the sharp edges of the wire exposed. The
uncoated wires attached to the primary enclosure fence had sharp, rusted edges protruding outward into the
primary enclosure where the animals have access. Multiple nail heads were protruding from the second story
outdoor wooden deck in the primary enclosure, which is often used by the wolf dogs. Multiple nail heads were
protruding from the wooden border of the outdoor storage shed, where the animals can come in contact with. These
sharp edges and points could potentially cause injuries to these animals.
The licensee needs to ensure that the primary enclosure for the dogs must be constructed and maintained so that
they have no sharp edges or points that could injure the dogs.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The storage shed in the primary enclosure of wolf-dogs "Lola" and "Lupa" contains building materials, metal stakes,
a bicycle, and plastic storage tubs that are accessible by the animals. The accumulations of the materials in the
shed have the potential for harboring pests and vermin. Within the primary enclosure, and accessible by the two
wolf-dogs, is a gasoline-powered snow blower. Gasoline is flammable and can potentially be toxic to animals.
The licensee needs to ensure that the premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and
surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to reduce or
eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin.To be corrected by: October 24, 2016
