2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a male King Charles Cavalier (#16) Blk/bro/white that has moderate buildup of brown tarter on all of his
teeth, with a dark red swollen gum line. The gums have receded to the point of exposing the roots of several teeth,
with two premolars on each side of the upper jaw that had gray pockets of puss at the base of the gums. While the
body condition was good, the teeth need to be attended to before there are other health issues. The attending
veterinarian had not been contacted before this inspection.
Untreated dental issues can be a source of pain and discomfort for the regulated animals, and a treatable condition
left untreated can become chronic or cause serious health issues.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment.
To be Corrected by: July 22, 2018
