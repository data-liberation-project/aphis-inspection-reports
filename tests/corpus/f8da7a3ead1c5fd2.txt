2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three outdated bottles of medication were found in the hospital medical storage. Since outdated medications
cannot assure their intended result will still be active they are not considered adequate veterinary care. A regular
program of checking and removing all outdated medications needs to be in place and maintained.
Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
