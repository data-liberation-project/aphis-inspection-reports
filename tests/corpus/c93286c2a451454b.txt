3.14(b) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The registrant accepted a dog for transportation and when she was walking the dog on a leash for a break the dog
bit her. The registrant dropped the leash and the dog ran away.. The registrant tried to find the dog and called
Animal Control, the Animal Shelter and the police. The dog was never found.
If it becomes necessary to remove the dog from the enclosure in order to clean, or to move the dog or cat to another
enclosure, this procedure must be completed in a way that safeguards the dog from injury and prevents escape.
All dogs shall be maintained securely to prevent injury to the handler and escape and loss of the dog.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
