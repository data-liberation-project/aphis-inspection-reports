CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were a couple of water receptacles heavily lined with a dark green material. The water inside of the
receptacles appeared clear. This build-up of material inside of the water bowls can increase the risk of disease
hazards. The licensee must ensure that water receptacles are kept clean and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris and other disease hazards. To be corrected by:

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was at least one dog at the facility that was observed with several fleas crawling throughout the dog's fur. The
dog was also observed scratching. According to facility records, the last use of a product to control fleas was in
April. Fleas increase the risk of diseases in the dogs and can cause discomfort to the dogs. The licensee must
establish and maintain a safe and effective program of pest control so as to promote the health and well-being of
the animals at all times. To be corrected by: October 1, 2019.
