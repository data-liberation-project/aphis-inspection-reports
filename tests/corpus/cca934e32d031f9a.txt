Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records for the animals on hand were insufficient. The records documented the name of the facilities from which the
muntjacs were acquired from the early 1990s to 2004. The records however did not provide the address or USDA number
for those facilities. There was no documentation of the acquisition information for the Watusi, Water Buffalos and
blackbuck. Several of the missing acquisition information are concerning animal births. Without records which fully
disclose the animal’s acquisition/disposition information, legal and medical information traceback is not possible. Develop
and maintain records disclosing the required acquisition/disposition information including the date, name, address, and
USDA number if applicable of the person from whom the animal was acquired from or transferred to. The records shall
include any deaths and any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. To be
corrected by December 23, 2022.

Sanitation.
Discarded items were found in some of the enclosures with the animals having access to those items:
- In the pasture housing 18 water buffalos and a Watutsi, there was a large accumulation of discarded materials such as
large appliances, cabinets, large wooden planks and metal bars. What appeared to be old washer and dryer appliances


as well as an oil tank were seen among the pile of discarded materials. The items were mainly located at the edge of a
thicket of trees where the facility representative explained the animals migrate to in the afternoons.
- In the enclosure where 2 blackbucks were seen, a damaged metal panel was seen in the enclosure. Large wooden
branches were also seen in some areas propped against or pushing on the fencing of the enclosure.
- The muntjac enclosures were heavily wooded and at least 2 large tree limbs in 2 separate enclosures could be seen
breaking from the tree and leaning into the enclosure. Many large tree branches could also be seen on the floor scattered
throughout the enclosures.
The discarded items in the enclosures could result in injury from the animals coming into contact with them and could
provide harboring space for rodents/pests thus increasing the risk of animal disease as well. The breaking and falling of
tree branches into the enclosures could result in animal injury and could affect the structural integrity of the fencing
making up the enclosures. Premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury. Accumulations of trash
shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. Correct by removing
discarded items or preventing animal access. Create a plan to identify and remove problematic trees located inside and
near animal enclosures. Include a schedule for their removal as well as a plan to continue routine monitoring thereafter.
