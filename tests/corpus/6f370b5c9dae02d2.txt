FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The meat freezer appeared to be not functioning properly. When the door was opened there was a strong odor of
decomposition. Upon examination of the meat stored there it was discovered that the chicken was no longer frozen
although it had been placed inside approximately 30 days prior. There were also bottles of orange juice inside that
were not frozen. Food must be unspoiled, wholesome, palatable and free from contamination. Meat that has not
been properly stored may become contaminated with bacteria, lose nutritional value, or become unpalatable.
Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect them against deterioration. The freezer must
be repaired or replaced to adequately store frozen meat supplies.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Enclosures for several of the tigers, lions, cougars and bears had standing water and puddles that were not rapidly
draining. The area in front of the liger and tiger lockout entrance to the yard had a large puddle of water in which
the liger was wading, The animals will have to cross through it to enter the exercise yard. The shelter for the lions in
the front of the facility had a hole dug out beneath it which encompassed nearly the entire shelter floor and was
filled with water. Therefore the lions would have been unable to remain dry when seeking shelter from the rain. In
addition the chicken and meat for these lions was placed on a small cement platform surrounded by water and the
lions would have to stand in the water to access this meat. The food for the bears was served in bowls and later
dumped by the bears into the standing water. Many of the animals were wet and although it was unclear if it was
because they chose to be out in the rain or because they do not have adequate dry areas within the shelter. A
suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water in addition to providing high and dry areas for
them to remain dry.

FEEDING. In the bear enclosures the food and meat was dumped onto and spread across the muddy ground and into large
puddles of dirty water. The meat in the cougar enclosure was observed mixed with mud and dirty water in the feed
receptacle. Several of the tigers and lions meat was on the muddy wet ground thus contaminating it with dirt and
possibly waste material. Eating contaminated meat and food may cause the animals to become ill. Food and food
receptacles must be placed to minimize contamination.
