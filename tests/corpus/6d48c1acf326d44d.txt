ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A four year old, female, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with USDA tag number 002 has an open wound
in-between the 3rd and 4th digit of her left front paw. The wound is round, raised, and has a clear discharge
associated with it. The dog appears to be walking normally. If left untreated, foot issues can lead to further
problems, such as infection or lameness. Failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat
diseases and injuries can affect the heath and well-being of the dogs. This dog must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian or treated by the foot abscess instructions in the program of veterinary care approved by the attending
veterinarian. Documentation of this treatment must be available for review by APHIS officials.
***The five year old, female, Shih Tzu with USDA tag number 039 has a white discharge in and around both eyes.
There is small white spot located centrally on the surface of the right eye and an approximately 2 mm round,
crater-like lesion located centrally on the surface of the left eye. There is discharge associated with both eyes and
the fur near the medial aspect of both eyes is moist and matted. The dog is not squinting either eye. Eye
conditions can be uncomfortable for the dog and can lead to permanent eye damage if not treated properly. This
dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of the examination, diagnosis, and treatment
must be maintained by the Licensee and made available to APHIS officials for review.

around both eyes. The Licensee failed to observe this discharge and associated eye lesions. Daily observation of all
animals is necessary to recognize early signs of disease, injury, or illness. All dogs must be observed adequately to
assess their health and well-being.
