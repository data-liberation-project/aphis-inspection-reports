2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male French bulldog (“Oscar”, tag #31) has a large area of swelling on the right side of the face. Physical
inspection of the dog revealed a firm mass located within the swollen area of the face. The licensee had not noticed
the condition of the dog’s face and the dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. Facial swelling could
cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as, indicate an underlying health condition.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment
plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
