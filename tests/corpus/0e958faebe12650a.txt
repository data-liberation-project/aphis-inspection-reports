SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The barrier along one side (short side) of the enclosure housing the pair of rhesus macaque monkeys is not
sufficient to restrict physical contact between the public and the monkeys. The wire of the enclosure has rectangular
openings large enough for the monkeys to extend out their entire arm length. The current physical barrier is only
approximately two feet away from the enclosure and is less than three feet tall. It is not solid and has spaces
between the bars large enough for kids to reach through. An adult person standing outside the barrier is able to
reach across and touch the enclosure. The monkeys could grab the person's hand leading to possible injury to
both. Public exhibits housing nonhuman primates must have a barrier between the primary enclosure and the public
at any time the public is present that restricts physical contact between the public and the nonhuman primates.
