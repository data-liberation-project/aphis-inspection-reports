PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A young adult Pyrenees dog was obtained for the show. During this inspection, the dog was found tethered on a
long leash outside of his night enclosure which is a large concrete walled room indoors. Because this dog kept
escaping his enclosures, the building, and the premises, he was placed in a more secure indoor enclosure at night,
but tethered during the day. He has also been off tether when people were around to supervise him.
Because temporary tethering is prohibited for use as a primary enclosure unless approval is obtained from APHIS,
this approval should be obtained, or use a different primary enclosure for daytime.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
