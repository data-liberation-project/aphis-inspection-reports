ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female 13 year old black bear (cid:28)"Sugar"(cid:29) housed with a 13 year old male black bear (cid:28)"Spice"(cid:29) was euthanized by
gunshot on May 26, 2016. The licensee stated that a car had backfired in the parking lot, which is close to the bear
enclosure. The car backfiring triggered a flock of peacocks to disperse and some landed in the bears enclosures.
This occurrence agitated (cid:28)"Sugar(cid:29)" and she began charging the electric fence. The licensee was concerned that the
bear would hurt someone and asked one of his employee(cid:25)s experienced with firearms to shoot the bear. The
employee that shot "(cid:28)Sugar"(cid:29) fired a second shot to ensure she was dead. Unfortunately, the bullet ricocheted and
ended up mortally wounding "(cid:28)Spice"(cid:29), the male black bear. An additional gunshot was fired at "(cid:28)Spice(cid:29)" to end his
suffering.
The Program of Veterinary Care does not describe the use of gunshot by the licensee in cases of emergency. In the
absence of guidance from the veterinarian there is a greater chance of collateral damage or undue suffering of the
animals if the proper firearms, proper projectile caliber or correct anatomical site is not used. In order to provide
adequate veterinary care, the licensee must consult with the veterinarian. The veterinarian must update the program
of veterinary care to reflect detailed euthanasia guidance in emergency situations.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A year and a half old female tiger (cid:28)"Tiana" was observed being displayed to the public. The tiger was brought into an
exhibit area. An attendant held the tiger by a leash attached to a choke chain. The public was behind an
approximately 4 foot barrier fence. The age of this tiger, coupled with the strength of this animal renders it
dangerous to the public while being restrained in this manner and with this type of barrier. There must be sufficient
barriers between adult tigers and the general public and a secure method of restraining the animal in order to exhibit
to the public in this manner.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A 9 week old female bobcat neonate "(cid:28)Ruckus"(cid:29) was displayed to the public every 90 minutes or 4 times each day.
Interactions with the public occurred during this time. In less than 10 minutes 19 people made contact with
"(cid:28)Ruckus"(cid:29). Many times (cid:28)"Ruckus(cid:29)" was observed jumping away from the public. A request for the vaccination history
for this bobcat showed it had one vaccination the week of the inspection. No other vaccination history was provided.
The handling of this neonatal bobcat is excessive and its health is compromised as its immune system is not yet
developed.
A 22 week old female black bear (cid:28)"Honey"(cid:29) was observed interacting with the public. The public would come into the
holding area in groups while "(cid:28)Honey"(cid:29) was nursing on a bottle. Up to 5 people were trying to interact with the bear
by petting her at one time. During a 10 minute period 38 people interacted with (cid:28)"Honey"(cid:29). This is excessive public
handling. Excessive handling interferes with "(cid:28)Honey's"(cid:29) health, well-being and normal development. Additionally, a
photo taken when (cid:28)Honey(cid:29) was a neonate shows 4 young children petting, feeding and handling her. The risk of the
neonatal bear aspirating the formula was great while being fed by inexperienced members of the general public. In
addition, the young age of the infant bear being handled by multiple people creates stress to the developing immune
system.
Young, immature animals cannot be exposed to excessive public handling that interferes with their good health and
well-being.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An adult skunk and a ferret were brought out of their enclosure to interact with the general public along with
neonatal foxes and opossum. The skunk and ferret were placed on top of a barrier fence beam and did not move
during the interactive session. The animals did not seem aware of their surroundings and were non responsive to
stimuli or touching. Both the skunk and ferret appeared to be sleeping or alternatively groggy and lethargic. These
interactions take place approximately every 90 minutes or four times each day. The behavior of both the skunk and
ferret during the interaction was not normal. The animals were either exhausted from prolonged contact with the
public or indicative that the normal sleep cycle is being interfered with. Animals must be exhibited only under
conditions that are consistent with their health and well-being.

2.131(d)(2)HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Many members of the public were observed feeding, interacting, and petting the goats, fallow deer, llama, sheep
and reindeer without an attendant present. Many instances of adults and children picking up baby goats and sheep
was observed. Children were also observed chasing goats and deer in an effort to pick them up. At times mothers
were separated from their offspring. Chasing and handling of animals without adequate supervision can cause
animals to become panicked, stressed and likely to become injured. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily
identifiable attendant must be present at all times during public handling.
