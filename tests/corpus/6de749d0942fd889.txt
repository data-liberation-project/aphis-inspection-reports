ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Humane gunshot as a method of euthanasia is used, and though handled correctly by trained personnel, this
method of euthanasia was not listed in the PVC. An updated PVC that includes this method of euthanasia must be
signed by the Attending Veterinarian and made available for APHIS inspectors upon request.
Correct immediately.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee is not obtaining the required information on acquisitions of some of the mammals. The licensee
acquired a donation of a Virgina opossum on May 22, 2013. This acquisition was listed only as a "public donation".
A short tail opossum was also acquired on April 27, 2013 from the Navarre Reptile show.
For these acquisitions, the licensee did not obtain the name, address, driver's license number, and vehicle tag
number of the person from whom you acquired the animal. This information is required for all acquisitions of
regulated mammals from persons who are not USDA licensed.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A short tail opossum was found dead outside of its enclosure, and inside the building where it was being housed.
An intern mistakenly left the top of the enclosure uncovered and this animal escaped and was subsequently found
dead the next day. The intern's supervisor did not immediately notice this error either. All employees shall receive
the appropriate training for the species that they are caring for and shall be adequately supervised.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The main squirrel monkey exhibit that only had vertical wooden posts with a short rope on the front side of the
enclosure has been corrected. However, there is now an area located on the back side of this exhibit, to the left of
the keeper entrance, that no longer has a barrier. The public can gain access to this area and walk right up to the
back of this enclosure. The 1"x 2" wire mesh easily allows the public to put their fingers, as well as, other objects
inside this exhibit.
The cotton top marmoset exhibit barrier also has undergone renovations. The new barrier fence in front of this
exhibit is three feet away but is only 40.5 inches in height. This allows the public to bend over this barrier and make
contact with this exhibit. The mesh at this exhibit is 1/4"x 1/2" which can allow the public to put a portion of their
finger, or other thin objects, into this exhibit.
These exhibits are not constantly monitored by a zoo employee. Every exhibit shall have a complete barrier fence
around it and shall be sufficiently high or far enough away so that the public cannot make contact with it. This is to
protect the animals, as well as, the public from injury.
These exhibits had compliant barriers installed on the second day of the inspection. No further correction is
necessary at this time.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Some of the goats and sheep are routinely rotated from the exhibit areas to an off-exhibit enclosure. The natural
shelter in this enclosure is not adequate to protect the animals from inclement weather during times of the year
when foliage is not present.
All animals shall have a sufficient amount of shelter space to afford them protection from sunlight &/or inclement
weather, and to prevent discomfort.
A shelter was erected by the end of the second day of the inspection. No further correction is necessary
