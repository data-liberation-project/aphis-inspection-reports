2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Several acquisition and disposition records examined during inspection were lacking complete information required
in 2.75 (b) (1) ii-iv. Although APHIS forms 7020 are not mandatory to use, alternate forms must contain all
information required in 2.75 (b) (1) (i-vii). The vehicle license number and state, and the driver's license if he/she is
not registered under the Animal Welfare Act must be recorded. The full name and address of the buyer/receiver
must be recorded in addition to the city and state.
Acquisition and disposition records are necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in regulated
activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation.
The facility shall make, keep and maintain records which fully disclose all the required information concerning
animals purchased or otherwise acquired or disposed of.
2.75(b)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The animal inventory was incomplete at the time of the inspection. The inventory of animals on hand must contain
the license number of the entity from which the animal was acquired. If the entity is not licensed or registered under
the Animal Welfare Act then a complete address and state identification is required. Although APHIS forms 7019 is
not mandatory to use, alternate forms must contain all information required in 2.75 (b) (1) and (i-vii).
The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her
control.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the nursery several electrical outlets and switches did not have protective covers in place. Exposed electrical
wiring is a potential source of injury to the baby kangaroo and other baby animals housed in this room that are
allowed to roam free. Facilities should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. Appropriate supervision of free roaming animals in the nursery must be constantly provided until such
cover plates are installed.
