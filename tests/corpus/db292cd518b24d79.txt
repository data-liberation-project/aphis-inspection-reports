ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I arrived at the facility at 6:15 pm and knocked on the door. No one answered so I called the owner and left a
message. I waited until 7:00 pm and then called the owner. I left a message that I was leaving the premises and
this would be considered an attempted inspection. A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS
Officials during the inspection process at 6:15 pm on 04/14/2014. A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
