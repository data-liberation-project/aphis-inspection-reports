3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
1. The south side of the camel pen continues to lack a perimeter fence. The entire length of the southernmost
camel pen fence (located on the southeast side of the facility) is also acting as a portion of the facility's perimeter
fence. The perimeter fence must be at least three feet in distance from any animal enclosure fencing. A perimeter
fence is necessary to assure that unauthorized persons and wild animals do come into contact with the animals.
Assure the camel pen is completely enclosed with a perimeter fence.
2. No fewer than ten (eight foot wide) sections of perimeter fence are in disrepair. The affected lengths of fence are
comprised of cyclone wire and are located along the southeastern most entrance into the facility. The bottom of the
fencing has become unattached exposing gaps that range from six inches to one foot. Additionally, two top posts
have disconnected causing the fence to partially collapse at the top. The fence was damaged during the winter
months due to snow removal as per the facility owner. A perimeter fence is necessary to assure that unauthorized
persons and wild animals do come into contact with the animals.
Assure that the affected areas of perimeter fencing are repaired or replaced
The inspection exit briefing was conducted with the facility owner.
