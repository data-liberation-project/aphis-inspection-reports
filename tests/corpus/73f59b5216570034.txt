FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strenght. The metal gate on the front side of the alpaca enclosure is attached to the the fence posts with
bale twine and rope. The bale twine and rope are not adequate to secure the gate in the alpaca enclosure. Owner
plans to replace the metal gate with board fence. All animal enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained
in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to prevent escapes.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather. There is no shelter in the new alpaca enclosure except for a shade structure. A
shelter with at least 3 sides and a roof must be provided in the alpaca enclosure to prevent discomfort to the
animals and to protect them from inclement weather.
