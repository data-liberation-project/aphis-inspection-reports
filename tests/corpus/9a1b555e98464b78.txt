SANITATION.
There were five enclosures housing a total of 38 adults with offspring which had wet bedding. Enclosures were last
cleaned on Saturday (9/29/18). Primary enclosures that become soiled or wet to a degree that might be harmful or
uncomfortable to the animals therein due to leakage of the watering system, the guinea pigs shall be transferred to
clean primary enclosures. Replacing water bottles or directing water away from bedding on floor of enclosures may
improve the problem of wet bedding. Correct by ensuring the primary enclosures are kept clean and that guinea
pigs are transferred to clean enclosures if the bedding becomes wet. Correct by October 3, 2018.
This inspection was conducted with owner's son and exit interview was conducted with owner's daughter.
