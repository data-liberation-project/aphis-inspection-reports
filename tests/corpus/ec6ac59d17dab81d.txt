SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: The following two items must be addressed.
1) The kitchen and quarantine rooms have the top layer of the floor peeling away in areas leaving indentations in
the floor where dirt, food and debris can accumulate. Bacteria and mold may grow on food particles/residue on the
kitchen floor and be tracked to animal areas on footwear or equipment. Disease agents and parasites may
contaminate debris in the floor indentations in quarantine and be also tracked into other animal areas. The floor in
the kitchen and quarantine must be repaired/resurfaced to be adequately cleaned to protect the health of the
animals.

2) Equipment and supplies are being stored against the inside of the 8 foot perimeter fence, especially in the front
area by the parking lot. A function of the perimeter fence is to be a secondary containment system for the animals
in the facility. The stored items against the fence act as stairs or steps so an escaped animal could easily reach the
top of the fence to jump to the other side. The items stored along the perimeter fence must be moved so the
perimeter fence may serve as a secondary containment system for the animals.
