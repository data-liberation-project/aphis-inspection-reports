FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The padlocked gate to a lion enclosure was chained to a solid post with a gap of approximately 6- 8 inches in width,
extending the entire height of the fence, but behind the required set back fence preventing public contact with the
side of the enclosure. The gap represents an area through which an adult lion potentially could extend a forelimb
and reach a person walking next to the enclosure. Enclosures must be maintained to protect the animals from
injury and contain the animals.

A goat kid was observed to put its head through a gap in the enclosure gate fence, and was unable to withdraw the
head due to the angle of its growing horns. The facility representative removed the animal from the gate, and
placed a temporary barrier of a rock to avoid repeated occurrence. Should the animal become stuck overnight, it
would not be able to access food, water, or shelter, and could be subject to bulling from other animals, resulting in
pain or distress. Enclosures must be maintained to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

The fence between two tiger enclosures had a thin dead tree leaning against the top, and a section approximately 3
feet in width by 2 feet in depth was slightly compressed. Tigers not co-housed and of unknown compatibility may
exhibit athletic territorial or dominance behaviors that can weaken the structural integrity of fencing separating them,
and unplanned comingling could result in injury to animals. The second tiger enclosure had small branches growing
through the enclosure wall near a section of fence at the top of a wall next to the pond that was attached to two
consecutive vertical fence posts by one wire encircling each one, with a loose top rail. Branches growing through
fences may eventually weaken the strength of the fence. Similarly, the strength and agility of adult tigers may be
sufficient to overcome the strength of this section of fence, resulting in lack of containment. Enclosures must be
maintained to protect animals from injury and contain them.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Dead flies and mouse feces were present in the food preparation area around the sink and on shelves holding
closed containers of food. Bird droppings covered the outside of the door of the bulk grain storage, and a hole was
present that could permit access of birds into the grain bin. Vermin may contaminate feed or food receptacles with
bacteria and viruses; leading to adverse health affects for animals. Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities
which adequately protect such supplies against contamination by vermin.
