ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple bottles of medication were found to be out of date. These medications ranged from a month out of date to
9 months out of date. All medication that was expired was removed and either disposed of or returned to the
attending veterinarian on this date. Medication needs to be checked on a routine basis and disposed of when it is
no longer in date unless directed by the attending veterinarian.
Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. The inspection report was delivered by email.
