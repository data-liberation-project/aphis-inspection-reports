2.75(a)(1)(vi)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is assigning official identification numbers to puppies shortly after birth and documenting them on a cage
card. A litter of 4 Bernedoodle puppies born 4-May-2022 were sold and on the Record of Disposition of Dogs (APHIS
Form 7006), male puppy 18-3 was listed on two forms, one on 16-July-2022 and one on 8-August-2022. The licensee
states that the one sold on 8-August-2022 was in fact male puppy 18-4 but was recorded incorrectly and admits it is
difficult to get all paperwork correct all the time. The paperwork was modified and fixed at the time of inspection.
Failure to document the proper identification number on required documents interferes with APHIS officials’ ability to
identify animals and trace their movements. Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records that fully disclose the
official identification number of each animal. The licensee must ensure that the correct official identification number is
recorded on all required paperwork for each dog.
To be corrected by: From this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
