2.31(c)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
When inspecting sheep enrolled in several IACUC approved protocols studying the effects of maternal obesity on
offspring, the inspector observed juvenile ewes being checked for puberty. The puberty checking is performed by
housing the ewes with vasectomized rams that wear a dye marker on their chest. The dye marker puts a visible
mark on the ewes' backs when the vasectomized rams mount the ewes in an effort to breed. This procedure is not
described in any IACUC approved animal use protocols. Upon request by the inspector, the Director of Research
Integrity and Compliance corresponded by email with a representative of the laboratory group of the principal
investigator responsible for this activity. The representative confirmed that the puberty checking was being
performed on these animals for regulated, research purposes. The representative also confirmed that they had not
requested approval by the IACUC for this activity. If activities involving the care and use of animals at the facility are
not reviewed and approved by the IACUC, then the IACUC is unable to ensure that those activities comply with the
regulations and do not jeopardize the welfare of the animals. The IACUC shall review and approve, require
modifications in (to secure approval), or withhold approval of those components of proposed activities related to the
care and use of animals. The principal investigators must obtain IACUC approval before conducting any regulated
animal care and use activity.
