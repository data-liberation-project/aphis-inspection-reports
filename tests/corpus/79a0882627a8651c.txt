ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
26-Sep-18.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 11am on 9/26/2018 and knocked on the door. After receiving no answer I
called both contact numbers available. I was able to speak with the licensee who stated that no one would be
available for an inspection that day and that licensee will contact the inspector with any other additional days that
the licensee is not available. I then left the facility.
