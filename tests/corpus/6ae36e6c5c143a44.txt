2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Shiba Inu (#15), with a litter of four 6-week-old puppies was noticed to be on the thin side. According to the
licensee they were starting to wean her, and the puppies were seen eating softened dry food. She had an obvious visible
waist and abdominal tuck. The tops of her lumbar vertebra were visible, and the pelvic bones were becoming prominent
and were easily felt with a gloved hand. The licensee also stated that he noticed her losing weight gradually over the past
couple of weeks and that this sometimes happens with his bigger litters but once the puppies are weaned the dam always
bounces back. The program of veterinary care did not instruct the licensee on how to address this dog’s condition nor had
he communicated this dog’s condition with a veterinarian. Poor body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition,
parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee must communicate with a veterinarian in order to obtain an
accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for this dog’s condition. The licensee must ensure that the
treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

Outdoor housing facilities.
In the outdoor facility housing 13 adult dogs and 2 puppies are enclosures with wood and concrete that are not impervious
to moisture. When talking to the licensee about when the last time he treated the wood and concrete to be impervious to

moisture he replied that it had been about two years. Wood and concrete that are not impervious to moisture allow urine,
feces, and such moisture to be soaked into the porous material which increases the risk of harboring bacteria and other
diseases. Building surfaces to include wood and concrete, in contact with animals in outdoor housing facilities must be
impervious to moisture.
