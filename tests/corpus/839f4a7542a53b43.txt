2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There were four puppies that were 22 weeks of age that did not have official identification. Proper identification of
each animal is needed for record keeping and animal traceability. The licensee shall ensure each animal at the
facility is officially identified.
3.10 REPEAT
WATERING.
There were 4 mixed breed puppies with no official ID that did not have access to water. The same puppies were
identified during the previous inspection because they had no access to water. When inspectors requested the
caretaker supply the puppies with water the puppies demonstrated their thirst by drinking continuously for an
extended length of time. It is crucial to the health and well-being of the animals that they are offered sufficient
access to clean, potable water especially during hot summer conditions so that they do not become over heated or
dehydrated. The licensee shall ensure that if potable water is not continually available to the dogs it is offered as
often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being.
THE LICENSEE WAS AGAIN INSTRUCTED TO CORRECT THE ISSUE IMMEDIATELY BY PROVIDEING THE
ANIMALS WATER.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and VMO, Konnie Plumlee.
All 6 of the dogs identified during the previous inspection for veterinary care issues had received treatment and their
condition was improving. Additional Inspectors
