3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility does not have a written primate enrichment program that adequately documents an appropriate plan for
environmental enhancement for non-human primates. A document was presented to this inspector dated June 22,
2016 and signed by the attending veterinarian that describes the size of the lemur enclosure, states it is in good
condition, safe and appropriate for feeding and treatments. The document also refers to the overall good physical
and behavioral health of the animals.
A complete primate enrichment plan at a minimum should address social grouping and the physical environment in
the enclosure that is enriched to provide safe expression of species typical behaviors. Examples of environmental
enrichment can include perches, swings and other cage complexities/furnishings, objects to manipulate, varied food
items, foraging or task oriented feeding methods and care-giver interactions.
The enrichment plan must be in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the
attending veterinarian. Exhibitors must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environmental
enhancement that demonstrates adequate promotion and maintenance of the psychological well-being of
non-human primates housed at the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The sheltered part of the enclosure housing deer, immediately on the right when entering the front of the barn, has a
metal wall directly across from the walkway that is excessively rusted at the bottom near the floor. The resulting
damage includes flaking metal and holes in the wall. Damaged metal with holes can have sharp edges that could
injure animals and can also indicate compromise of structural integrity.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The
damaged wall should be repaired or replaced. Correct by March 9, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
