ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The Program of Veterinary Care, the Environmental Enrichment Program, and records of animals on hand were not
available during the inspection. The owner stated that his truck had broken down and it was approximately an hour
away from inspection site. It is important that all records are available in order for the inspector to determine the
current status of each regulated animal. All records should be available for inspection to assure the health and well
being of animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are three primary enclosures that contain several animals which only have pallets on top of enclosures for
shade. The pallets were not blocking enough of the direct sunlight to prevent the animals from overheating. The first
enclosure contains a kangaroo which does not have any other sheltered area provided in enclosure. The second
enclosure has a medium sized plastic dog crate with holes which the porcupine was not using. The third enclosure
contained three foxes that have a small plastic dog crate with holes which they were sharing. The plastic containers
were not providing enough shelter to prevent the discomfort of the animals. The animals were hot and panting.
During the inspection the caretaker placed a large size plastic dog crate with holes in with the kangaroo. The current
weather is sunny and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The owner stated he had just arrived home and did not have enough
time to provide adequate shade to the animals. The inspector noted that all the rest of the animals had proper
protection from the hot sun. Animals that are unable to find sufficient shade from the sun could overheat. Animals
shall be provided sufficient shade by natural or artificial means to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect
themselves from direct sunlight. Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with owner.
