Sheltered housing facilities.
The interactive room contains 4 lemurs (2 Red Ruffed and 2 Ring Tailed) that are allowed to have direct contact with the
public. While the licensee states that there is a handler present in the room during this time, there is no direct control of
the animals when they have contact with customers. As per the licensee, customers are allowed to sit on a bench in the
encounter room and the primates are allowed to roam free on and around the customers. Customers can be given
enticements such as fruit to encourage the animals to interact with them. The licensee or one employee stands in the
room to observe this.
There is a risk of direct injury to both the public and the animals in the interaction area. Animals must be under the direct
control at all times during interactive sessions.
