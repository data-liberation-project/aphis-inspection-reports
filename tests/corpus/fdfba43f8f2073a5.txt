REGISTRATION.
***On February 6, 2014 from 1:00pm - 1:30pm I arrived to conduct a routine inspection of Novascreen. There were
no cars in the parking lot and the entrance door was locked. No one responded to my knock on the door. I called
both contact persons in my file and was redirected to a company named PerkinElmer, Inc. I left a voice message on
the PerkinElmer voice messaging system. Additonally, I e-mailed the two contact person. Both e-mails were
returned as "undeliverable".
A research facility shall notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name, address, or
ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as a research facility, within 10 days after making such
change. Novascreen, as a research entitiy, must notify the AC Regional Director, by certified mail, of its change in
name, address, ownership and operation to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations and
standards. Correct by February 14, 2014
2.38(b)
MISCELLANEOUS.
***
On February 6, 2014 from 1:00pm - 1:30pm, the registrant failed to have a responsible person available to conduct
an animal welfare inspection. The research facility could not be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. This is the FIRST ATTEMPTED
INSPECTION. A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct immediately.
