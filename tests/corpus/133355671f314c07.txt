methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to the procedure retro-orbital bleed that
may cause more than momentary pain and or distress to the study animals that is described in the protocol.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall determine when reviewing a proposal for animal use that the
principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain
or distress to the animals and that the investigator has provided a written narrative description of the methods and
sources used to determine that alternatives were not available. This requirement is important to ensure that the
procedures in the proposal involving animals minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for this protocol.
