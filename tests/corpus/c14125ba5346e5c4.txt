FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the south farm, a goat was observed to jump up onto the ledge of the concrete foundation and move from pen 4
over to pen 5 and then back to pen 4 again. There was a panel up on the ledge in place to prevent this, however
the goat could pass between the vertical supports of the panel. Also, the panel had some free ends of wire that if
bent out could become sharp points exposed to any goat that climbs up on the concrete ledge. Lack of proper
containment and exposure to sharp points could lead to injury or other adverse events. The facility must ensure
that enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals and protect them from
injury.
