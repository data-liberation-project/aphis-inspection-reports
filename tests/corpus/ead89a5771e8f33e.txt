Two tiger cubs arrived at this facility 8 weeks ago. They have been taken off-site during the evening/nights hours
daily and are returned to the zoo the next morning. They are being housed overnight at both a USDA licensee, and
an unlicensed USDA individual. The licensee has not informed the Regional Office of where these additional
overnight locations are within 10 days.
A licensee shall notify the Regional Office of any additional housing sites within 10 days of utilization.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A portion of the barrier fence at the red kangaroo/cavy & gray kangaroo enclosures consisted of dense vegetation
which prevented the public from access to these enclosures. Due to the cold weather in this area the plants have
died. The zoo has placed a temporary barrier consisting of a single strand of rope/plastic tape barrier in this area.
The public can easily pass over/under this barrier and it is not effective in minimizing the safety of the animals and
the public. This area is not consistently being monitored by a uniformed employee to assure that the public does
not pass through this temporary barrier.
This area shall be monitored by zoo employees at all times when the public is present until such time as an effective
barrier is constructed in this area which would restrict public access and ensure the safety of the animals and the
public.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The new attending veterinarian has not approved the facility's primate enrichment plan. The plan states that singlyhoused primates will be given "more time" with the keepers but is not specific as to the amount of time that would
be.
A red ruffed lemur is currently being housed in a room in the hospital due to medical reasons. This primate (who is
unable to see other non human primates) is confined to sky kennel in this room (which does not meet the minimum
space requirement) and is taken out periodically. The enrichment plan does not address this housing condition. A
veterinarian may exempt a primate from the enrichment plan because of its health, but that basis must be recorded
by the attending veterinarian. Unless the basis for the exemption is a permanent condition, the exemption must be
reviewed every 30 days by the attending veterinarian,

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility corrected the deteriorating rusty chain link ceiling in the left bear den, but has made no corrections to the
left side ceiling of the right bear den. The licensee did not remember or notice that the right side den was also listed
as non complaint on the previous inspection report. The right side den continues to have deteriorating, flaking, rust
on the left side of the ceiling of the den. When this chain link is touched the metal easily flaked off. The structural
integrity of this wire is compromised in this area of the den.
The chain link in this area shall be repaired or replaced to assure the structural integrity to contain the animal.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The big cat feeding plan does not indicate that any vitamin-mineral supplementation is given to the cats and in what
quantities. The licensee recently acquired 2 tiger cubs (now 8 weeks old) & 1 lion cub (now 10 weeks old). There is
no written, veterinarian approved feeding plan for these cubs.
A veterinarian approved feeding plan shall be in place which not only addresses the nutritional requirements for the
adult cats, but also the nutritional requirements for the cubs.
