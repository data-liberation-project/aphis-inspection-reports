2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The applicant uses a liquid medication dispensed by her veterinarian to deworm puppies. The label on the bottle was not
legible, but the applicant says the medication is "Marquis" (Ponazuril). The medication did have a legible sticker stating it
was to be stored in the refrigerator, but it was not cold or refrigerated at the time of inspection. The Program of Veterinary
Care (PVC) says puppies should be dewormed with Marquis at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. Cage cards for 4 litters, born
between July 5th and July 30th, representing 9 puppies in all, were dewormed starting between 4 days to 1 week of age,
and then repeated at 1 to 2 week intervals. No dosage for the Marquis is given on the PVC and the dosage on the bottle
is not legible.
In order to ensure effective and safe dosing of medications, written instructions from the attending veterinarian must be
followed and medications must be clearly labeled and properly stored. Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs
of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease. These
programs and methods must be established with the guidance and approval of the attending veterinarian, clearly
describing medications with dosages and frequencies to be used, and any deviation from or changes to the program must
be approved by the attending veterinarian before they can be implemented.
