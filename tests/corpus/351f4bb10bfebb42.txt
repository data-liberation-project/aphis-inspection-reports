EMPLOYEES.
Sec. 3.12 Employees.
Currently there is one part time permanent employee responsible for supervising the daily husbandry and post
procedural care of the resident animals. The remainder of the time veterinary technician students with varying
degrees of experience are responsible for these duties. Relying on untrained students to adequately observe and
care for animals that may have had invasive procedures is irresponsible. There must be an increase in the amount
of time the animal area is supervised by an individual with knowledge, background, and experience in post
procedure care and husbandry of dogs and cats.
