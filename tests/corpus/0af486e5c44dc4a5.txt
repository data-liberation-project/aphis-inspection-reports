2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is using a bottle labeled as Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension that is expired (11/14).
The licensee states that she is using that bottle to store this medication from a different "stock bottle". Incorrect
expiration dates or medications that are expired are not considered adequate veterinary care. Expired medications
can experience spoilage or have reduced efficacy. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility
are not expired and are labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices must be relabeled if label
becomes illegible.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are three, male rat terriers that the licensee states she acquired last fall that have no identification. Correct
identification is essential for the inspection process and to help track the movement of animals. The licensee must
identify all live dogs and cats on the premises. To be corrected by 21 April 2015.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are four dogs not listed on the APHIS 7005 form (dogs on hand). One dog was scanned on routine check
during the inspection and could not be located on the form. Three are dogs that were acquired last fall were not on
the form. Proper record keeping is essential for tracking movement of animals and to facilitate the inspection
process. The licensee must keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer or exhibitor. To be corrected by 14 April 2015.
3.1(a)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are holes that have been dug in the dirt floor of the outdoor enclosure housing three beagles. The two holes
undermine the shelter structures and have resulted in a "cave like" hole in the enclosure. Holes that undermine
structures can entrap the animals and cause injury.
***
One rat terrier was seen climbing the enclosure fence, walking across the top of the adjacent enclosure, and then
jumping back down into the enclosure. There were wire points exposed on the top of this other enclosure.
Enclosures that do not securely contain the animals can cause escape of and injury to the dogs.
**
The licensee must ensure that the housing facilities protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely,
and restrict other animals from entering. To be corrected by 24 April 2015.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are four wood boards in outdoor enclosures being used as wind and rain breaks that have areas of rough,
chewed/damaged surfaces. There is also an area of rough, chewed wood in the east side of the whelping building.
There are four plastic outdoor shelter structures with chewed, pitted edges around the openings and/or the corners.
These rough wood and plastic surfaces are not being maintained so that they can be adequately cleaned and
sanitized which can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces be maintained
on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and
objects within the facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. To
be corrected by 24 April 2015.
3.6(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The buried welded-wire fencing has become uncovered in sections of one outdoor enclosures resulting in exposure
of the fence openings and a gap between the fencing and the ground. Dogs may become entangled in these
openings causing injury to the dogs. All surfaces must be kept in good repair so dogs are protected from injury and
surfaces are maintained.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is a row of exposed wire points on the ground in the enclosure housing three beagles. Also at the entry of this
enclosure is a wire fence edge and metal strip where both have turned into the enclosure at head level to the dogs.
Wire points and edges and cause injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are
constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs. To be correctedby 14 April 2015.
3.6(c)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The were two litters of puppies being housed with their dams in the licensee's house. When we entered the house
during the inspection, the litters were being housed in different rooms but there was no physical barriers to prevent
either dams from having access to the other dam's litter. When we inspected the litter in the living room, the dam
whose litter was in the bathroom ran into the living room. The licensee stated that she was concerned that the dams
were going to fight. Dams that have access to other dams and their litters can cause injury to the puppies. The
licensee must ensure that bitches with litters not be housed in the same primary enclosure (in this case in the house
with no barriers between the litters) with other adult dogs. To be corrected 8 April 2015.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are three outdoor enclosures with an excessive accumulation of feces. In each case, about a quarter of the
enclosure was heavily covered with feces. The licensee states that she last spot cleaned the enclosures about a
week ago to remove feces. Excessive feces can attract pests, increase odors, and can play a role in disease
transmission. The licensee must remove excreta and food waste from primary enclosures daily, and from under
primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent
soiling of the dogs or cats contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and
odors. To be corrected by 14 April 2015.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The food and water receptacles in the east side of the whelping building were dirty. The self feeding food receptacle
had areas of dirt accumulating on the interior surface. The water receptacle has a layer of debris on the surface in
contact with the water. Inadequate cleaning of food and water receptacles can contaminate the food and can play a
role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that used food and water receptacles must be sanitized at
least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if
necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. To be
corrected by 14 April 2015.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an accumulation of bird and rodent feces on the window ledge and other shelves in the whelping building.
In addition, there are holes in two outdoor enclosures and in the outdoor portion of the one of the whelping houseenclosures. These holes appear to be rodent holes. Pests such as rodents and birds carry diseases and can play a
role in disease transmission. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of
insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that are pests so as to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. To be corrected by 7 May
2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Margaret A Shaver, VMO and David
Cortright,ACI in attendance.
