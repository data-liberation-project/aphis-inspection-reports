2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian was contacted on June 11, 2015 and stated he has not visited the facility in
approximately four years and only has knowledge of sugar gliders and a gibbon housed on the premises. The
attending veterinarian needs to be aware of all species housed at the facility in order to adequately advise on diet,
husbandry and health issues. Additionally, the written program of veterinary care should be updated as needed to
reflect current veterinary recommendations. Regular visits to the premises must be done by the attending
veterinarian at least annually or as often as he/she feels necessary to fulfill the provisions for adequate veterinary
care and oversight under the Animal Welfare Act.
3.82(a)
FEEDING.
During the focused inspection, a container of human baby formula was observed on the counter where the baby
nonhuman primates were located. The formula triggered a discussion about the diets being provided to all of the
nonhuman primates. The licensee stated that he was using what he has always used in the past and what other
breeders he knows have used. He stated his attending veterinarian had not worked with him on the diets. After
contacting the attending veterinarian on June 11, 2015, he stated that he has not been requested to evaluate the
diets for the nonhuman primates at the facility.
Inappropriate diets can cause malnutrition and other health problems for the animals. The diets provided for
nonhuman primates must be appropriate for the species, size, age, and condition of the animal and for the
conditions in which the nonhuman primates are maintained.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are excessive amounts of rust on many of the sugar glider cages and cage stands. Excessive rust can affect
the structural strength of the cage and impair adequate sanitation. The rust on these cages needs to be removed
and any defects caused by the rust repaired or these cages and stands need to be replaced in order to adequatelyprotect the animals from injury and illness and to contain the animals.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The diets provided for the sugar gliders, possums, coati mundis and prairie dogs have not been evaluated by the
attending veterinarian. The licensee stated that he was using what he has always used in the past and what other
breeders he knows have used. After contacting the attending veterinarian on June 11, 2015, he stated that he has
not been contacted to evaluate the diets for the animals at the facility.
Inappropriate diets can cause malnutrition and other health problems for the animals. The diet shall be prepared
with consideration for the age, species, condition, size and type of the animal.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is a hard, crusted build up of old food and excreta on the bars of most of the sugar glider cages. Loose
debris was also noted on the sides of some enclosures. Excreta should be removed and sanitation procedures
performed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to reduce disease hazards and odors.
The licensee needs to implement a cleaning and sanitation schedule with a frequency that will prevent the buildup
of excreta and old food.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*The two sugar glider buildings have an accumulation of brownish material on the ceilings and light fixtures.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate
prescribed husbandry practices. This brownish material appears to be dead bugs, bug feces, accumulated
miscellaneous debris, or all of the above. Regardless of the cause, inadequate cleaning can cause illness in the
animals or can cause a pest problem. The sugar glider buildings should be cleaned more frequently to prevent a
buildup of the brownish material.
*The premises have debris, trash, unused and discarded items lying on the ground throughout the facility adjacent
to the animal buildings and enclosures. Inadequate cleaning of the buildings and premises can lead to pest
infestation, odors, and harbor diseases that are harmful to the animals. All buildings and premises must be kept
clean, cleared, and in good repair to protect the health of the animals.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and APHIS personnel.This was a focused inspection to determine if serious repeat and Direct NCIs from previous inspections had been
corrected.
