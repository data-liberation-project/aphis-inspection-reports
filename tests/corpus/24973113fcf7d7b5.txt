3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** At the time of the inspection, the female red kangaroos and two joeys were being housed in the main building
and not able to have access to the runway and large outdoor pens. The licensee stated that foxes have been able
to get into the pen through gaps in the wire and have killed some joeys that were out of pouch. The male red
kanagroos still have access to the runway, building and larger pens. Outdoor facilities and primary enclosure fences
must be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injuries. The fencing should be addressed to keep wild
animals out of the enclosures for the safety of all animals and to allow the females access to the outdoor areas for
their health and well being.
