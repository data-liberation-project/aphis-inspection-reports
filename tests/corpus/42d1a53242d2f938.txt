2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***A group of approximately 70 members of the general public recently visited the facility as untrained volunteers to
help with husbandry and maintaince tasks throughout the facility. According to the licensee, one of five untrained
volunteers, under his direct supervision, fed a tiger during the visit. According to the licensee, the individual was
asked to wear gloves and stand alongside the licensee at approximately 2 1/2 feet from the tiger's primary
enclosure, which was a chain-link fence. The individual was then allowed to toss the meat into the tiger's enclosure
through an approximately 3 1/2 inch gap between the vertical pole of the gate and the wall of the enclosure. The
licensee gestured that the individual's hand came within approximately 1 foot from the animal's primary enclosure
while tossing the tiger its food. These distances between the animal's primary enclosure and the member of the
general public increase the risk of injury to the animal or the individual. The licensee must establish a program to
ensure that there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general public at all times in
order to assure the safety of the animals and the public. To be corrected by: immediately and from this point
forward.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***The enclosure housing two servals was covered with either hardware netting or wire panels. There were several
sections where the netting and panels were not securely fastened to the horizontal metal support poles of the
enclosure. For example, on the north side of the enclosure there was an area, approximately 3 feet in length, where
the wire panel covering was not securely attached to the support pole and an approximately 2 1/2 inch gap was
present. Also, within the middle of the enclosure, there was a gap between the netting and wire panel coverings
and the horizontal support pole. These unsecured sections of hardware netting and wire panels which cover the
servals' enclosure may not allow for the safe containment of the animals and could increase the risk of injury to the
animals. The licensee must ensure that all sections of fencing in these enclosures are securely fastened in order to
maintain the structural integrity of the enclosures. Also, the licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals at all
times.3.125(d)

(d) Waste disposal
***Within one of the shelter structures for a cougar, there was an accumulation of bedding material that appeared
compacted, dark brown, moist and dirt-like in nature. According to the licensee, the bedding was wood chips which
had not been changed or cleaned out in at least one to two months. Also, there was another igloo-style shelter
within the same enclosure, with a build-up of dirt, debris and several strands of straw. The cougar was initially
observed lying within one of the shelters and later the animal's fur appeared to have matted, moist-looking,
discolored darkened fur on its back and along its right rear leg. Failure to properly clean the enclosures and employ
timely removal and disposal of animal bedding increases the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must ensure
that a program to remove and dispose of animal bedding is established in order to minimize vermin infestation,
odors and disease hazards. To be corrected by: September 20, 2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***The perimeter fence measured less than 8 feet (96 inches) high in some areas around the facility which houses
large felines and wolves. For example, on the north side of the facility, a region of the fence measured 95 inches in
height; on the east side of the facility, a region of the fence measured 90 inches in height; on the southeast side of
the facility, regions of the perimeter fence only measured 88 to 90 inches in height; on the south side of the facility,
a region of the fence measured 90 1/2 inches in height; on the west side of the facility, a region of the fence
measured 89 inches in height. The perimeter fence must be of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized
persons out. The licensee must ensure that the perimeter fence is at least 8 feet high in order to protect the type of
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons and having contact with the animals in the
facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facilitly at all times.
In addition to the perimeter fence not being of sufficient height, the inspectors noted several areas along the bottom
of the perimeter fence and areas in between the gates and the posts that had areas large enough to allow for
potential access (both entry and exit) of animals. For example; on the north side there is a 12 ft. gate that had a
measured 6 3/4 inch gap between the post and the gate. On the east side there were at least 2 sections along the
bottom, measured at 4 1/2 in x 12 in, and 30 in x 16 in. The larger gap appeared to have had recent animal activity,
with freshly exposed earth material in and around a cavity next to a large rock. On the south east side there is a 6
in x 9 in gap of the chain link fencing material being bent upward. On the south side there is a 12 ft. gate that has a
gap measured of at least 4 in. between the post and the gate with a gap along the bottom measured of at least 5
1/2 in. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals
and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so
that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility at all times. To be corrected by: October 16, 2014.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
***The water receptacle for three wolves had a dark green algae-like substance along the inside surface and under
the water level of the receptacle. The water inside of the receptacle appeared to be an abnormal greenish brown
color. Water receptacles, which are not properly cleaned and sanitized, can harbor disease-causing organisms.
This could decrease the animals' acceptability of the water, as well as increase the risk of disease. The licensee
must ensure that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
(c) Housekeeping.
***There were tall weeds and grass within and adjacent to the wolves' enclosure as well as next to regions of the
perimeter fence. The weeds and grass reached at least 3-4 feet in height within the wolves' enclosure and
surrounding areas of the perimeter fence. There were also regions within the perimeter fence with weeds reaching
at least 7 feet in height. Tall weeds and grass can harbor insects, rodents and vermin which can increase the risk of
disease in the animals. The licensee must keep the premises clean and in good repair in order to protect the health
of the animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices at the facility at all times.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee on September 16-17, 2014. An exit interview was conducted with
the licensee on September 17, 2014.
