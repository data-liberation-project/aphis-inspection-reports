Housing facilities, general.
***Throughout the facility there were at least six enclosures containing six nonhuman primates and one sloth. These
enclosures had AC units, box fans, lights and humidifiers within or attached to the enclosures with electrical cords being
inside the enclosures or in close proximity to where the animals could reach them. Electrical cords and fan blades within
reach of animals could cause injury. The licensee must make the fans and electrical cords inaccessible to the animals and
ensure that enclosures are constructed to protect the animals from injury as required.
Corrected during the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
