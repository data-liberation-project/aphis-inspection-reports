2.126(a)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The inspectors arrived at the facility at approximately 11:50 am and called the phone number provided by the
licensee. The inspector left a message for the licensee and then knocked on the door to the dog kennel. The
licensee called the inspector back and said that she was going to sell the remaining dogs (ages six months to one
year) currently at the facility and turn in her license. The inspector requested to meet with the licensee and review
and print records that are kept at her home and the licensee said "no" and hung up. The licensee then called the
inspector back and stated that the inspector could go ahead and cite her for refusing to provide the records. The
inspector asked once more if she would show any of the records and the licensee once again said "no" and hung
up.
Each dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials:
To enter the place of business, examine and make copies of required records, to inspect, photograph and document
facilities, property, animals and any areas of non-compliance. Failure to provide APHIS officials with access for
inspection upon request interferes with the ability of the officials to protect the welfare of the animals and prevents
the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. Licensees must allow APHIS officials to
conduct inspections to assess the welfare of the animals and enforce the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee must
allow APHIS officials to conduct inspections to access the welfare of the animals and enforce the Animal Welfare
Act.
Correction date: From this day forward
Additional Inspectors
