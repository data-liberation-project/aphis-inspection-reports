Licensee returned call at 12:37 pm. Licensee stated she could not be available for inspection nor provide optimal
hours during daylight for inspection on weekdays. Licensee said Sundays would be the only possible day. Licensee
stated she would try to find a designated representative for possible inspection today.
Licensee called back at 1:10 pm and said she could not find anyone to be present for inspection today. I discussed
with licensee the importance of getting her facility inspected and the possibility of doing a Sunday inspection. I
requested licensee also call me between 4:00-6:00 pm today or tomorrow to discuss options and how we can get
her facility inspected.
