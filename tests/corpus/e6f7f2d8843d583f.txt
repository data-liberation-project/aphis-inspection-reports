FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Approximately 8 weeks ago, 3 of 4 wallabies in one exhibit died after becoming frightened by stray dogs running
along the perimeter fence adjacent to their exhibit . The dogs caused the wallabies to run and deaths were due to
heat exhaustion. One wallaby survived and is currently still housed in the exhibit. Wallabies are animals that are
known to be easily frightened by predators to such an extent that they may run into objects or run excessively as
these animals did . Visual barriers along exhibit fence lines can reduce the chance of this happening and is a part of
housing husbandry seen at other facilities. There are bushes in the wallaby exhibit at this facility but there are no
other visual barriers along the fence line to prevent the animals from being frightened . Visual barriers to prevent
the wallaby from being frightened is needed along the fence line of this exhibit to protect the animal from injury .
