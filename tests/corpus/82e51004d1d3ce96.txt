FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. There is roughened concrete on the floor of the guinea pig building. The floor surface makes
cleaning and sanitation more difficult since the roughened surface is not smooth and allows dirt and debris to
adhere. Inadequate cleaning and sanitation can expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards. Interior building
surfaces of indoor housing facilities must be constructed and maintained so that they do not permit the absorption of
fluids, can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected, does not retain odors, and from which fluids bead up and run off.
The roughened concrete must be repaired or replaced so that the floor can be thoroughly and repeatedly cleaned
and disinfected, does not retain odors, or expose the animals to disease hazards. Correct by May 15, 2017.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures. The four rack pens with a total of 20 enclosures have rusty wire on the front side by the
automatic water receptacles. Primary enclosures must be kept in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury,
contain them securely, and constructed of smooth material which is impervious to liquids and moisture. The rusty
wire by the water valves must be repaired or replaced so that the wire can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected,
will not retain odors, or expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards. Correct by March 31, 2017.
