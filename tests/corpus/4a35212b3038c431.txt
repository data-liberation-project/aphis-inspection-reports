2.33(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***The facility did not perform adequate daily observations of two beagles and did not identify abnormalities on the
dogs’ forelimbs.
During a walk-through of the indoor kennel on December 5, APHIS inspectors discovered a circular area of hairloss
on the right forelimb of a 7 year old male beagle, ID #1683A. The hairless area was approximately 1.5 centimeters
in diameter, located on the top of the paw, above the second digit. The visible skin was pink/red in color, becoming
red and inflamed towards the center of the hairless area. In the center of the reddened skin, the skin was dry and a
scab had formed.
During the same walk-through, APHIS inspectors discovered a circular area of hairloss on the left forelimb of a 7
year old male beagle, ID #1688A. The hairless area, approximately 1cm in diameter, was on the top of the paw,
above the 2nd digit. The skin beneath the hairless area was reddish in color.
These particular conditions had not been documented by facility staff.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and
the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
After the inspection, the facility provided veterinary care for the beagles, addressing the issues cited above.
This inspection was conducted from December 5-7 with facility representatives and the exit interview was
conducted on December 7 with facility representatives.Additional Inspectors
