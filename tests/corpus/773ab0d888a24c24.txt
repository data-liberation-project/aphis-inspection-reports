3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing the Hereford cow had two fence posts along the back fence (in the excessively muddy area)
that were leaning outward into the llama enclosure. Leaning fence posts may weaken the structural strength of the
enclosure fencing. All animal enclosures must be structurally sound to contain the animals. Once APHIS officials
identified the leaning fence posts, facility maintenance personnel repaired the fence. Corrected at time of
inspection.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The L shaped enclosure housing the Hereford cow is excessively muddy in the back area from the shelter to the
fence where the water bucket is attached. There are puddles of water around the water receptacle. Animals should
not have to walk through mud to get to their water or shelter. Standing in mud can cause animals to have foot
problems such as foot rot. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The area of the
enclosure from the shelter to the water receptacle needs to be dry to maintain the health and comfort of the animal.
