2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is no written Program of Veterinary Care that covers the animals at the Cultural Park and no record that the
attending veterinarian has visited the site. A staff member stated that the veterinarian would be going to the site the
morning following the inspection.
The facility should ensure that all animals being exhibited are under the care of the Attending Veterinarian. The
Attending Veterinarian should visit the site to inspect the animals, review husbandry practices, and, together with
the licensee, develop a written Program of Veterinary Care that addresses preventive care and other issues that will
ensure the health and well-being of the animals being exhibited.
Previous correction date: To be corrected by 9/25/14.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Current animal records were not available for review at the time of the inspection. While the tiger records are up to
date, there are no records for any animals housed at the Cultural Park. A system should be in place to ensure that
complete acquisition and disposition records are maintained and made available for examination by APHIS officials.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The tips of two screws were protruding approximately one inch into the pig enclosure where it appeared they had
been placed to secure a now missing piece of board. The tip of a shorter nail or screw was protruding into the
enclosure from a different board.
Sharp objects may cause injuries to the animals. Animal enclosures should be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury.

WATERING.
The water container for the pigs was sitting in a muddy area and contained muddy water. This was the only water
source for the animals.
Dirty water may be less palatable to the animals. Drinking insufficient amounts of water may adversely affect the
health of animals. Drinking contaminated water may also adversely affect the health of the animals.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Two approximately three inch long nails had been left on top of the roof of a small shelter in the goat enclosure. The
nails were within reach of the goat. Animal enclosures should be kept free of construction materials and any other
debris that could be harmful to the animals.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.
