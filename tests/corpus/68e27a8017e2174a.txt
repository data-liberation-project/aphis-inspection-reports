ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The part-time attending veterinarian has not been to the premises since October 2013. The written program of
veterinary care says visits by the attending veterinarian will occur no less than annually. The licensee must ensure
that adequate veterinary care is provided to the animals, which includes, regularly scheduled visits of the
veterinarian to the premises.
