2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Chihuahua (#190) has a torn left ear with the ear flap tip dangling. The edges of the wound are blackened. The
ear flap has dried blood on it. Licensee had not noticed this injury at time of inspection. This type of injury may be
painful and prone to infection and decay. Licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian. Documentation
of the diagnosis and treatment plan must be available upon request.
**** To be corrected by: 6/27/15
* Shih Tzu (# 187) was seen to periodically shake and rub her head. The right ear felt hot to the touch and had a
black discharge in the ear canal. This head activity and discharge can be indicative of infection or other health
issues.
Licensee must confer/consult with a veterinarian about an appropriate diagnosis/treatment plan. Documentation of
the consultation/diagnosis/treatment plan must be maintained and available upon request.
* A white Pomeranian (# 84) has patches of matted hair along the belly and behind the ears. Matted hair can pull on
the skin causing pain and irritation, prevent air flow to the skin and harbor bacteria.
The penis and prepuce looked red, inflamed and irritated. The appearance of the penis and prepuce could be
indicative of pain, infection, irritation or other health issues. Licensee must remove the matted hair and
confer/consult with a veterinarian about an appropriate diagnosis/treatment plan. Documentation of the
consultation/diagnosis/treatment plan must be maintained and available upon request.
* Silky Terrier (# 162) has long toenails that are starting to curve and/or have "hooks" at the end of them. These
toenails do not allow the dog to stand in a normal postural manner and may cause injury if caught on the enclosure.
Licensee must trim the nails and adhere to a maintenance grooming program.
** To be corrected by: 7/1/15
3.1(c)(1)(1)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three enclosures containing six dogs total, had areas of rusted metal siding that the dogs come in contact with.
These rusted areas could harbor disease organisms as can not be cleaned and sanitized properly. Licensee must
remove, repair or replace and maintain all surfaces to allow for required cleaning and sanitization to help eliminate
disease hazards to the dogs.
* To be corrected by: 7/24/15
3.1 DIRECT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* At time of inspection the divider between two enclosures (2 Shih Tzu's with a Silky Terrier and 2 Boston Terriers)
had come unattached from the main building. This created an opening which allowed the dogs access to each
other, resulting in the death of Silky Terrier (# 110). Licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are constructed
and maintained to be in good repair at all times to: protect the animals from injury, contain the dogs securely and
prevent other animals from entering the enclosure.
* To be corrected: 6/24/15 (Immediately)
3.7 DIRECT
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
* There are two Chihuahua's housed together in an enclosure. Dog # 190 had a torn ear with the tip of the left ear
flap dangling. The ear flap showed signs of dried blood and the edges of the wound had started to turn black.
Licensee had not noticed at time of inspection but indicated that it may have been the result of a fight between the
dogs. This type of injury is indicative of non compatibility between the animals to the point of injury. Licensee must
ensure that all dogs housed together in a primary enclosure are compatible at all times and separate immediately if
aggression issues are observed for the safety of the dogs.
* To be corrected by: 6/24/15 (Immediately)
