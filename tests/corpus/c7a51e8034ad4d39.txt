3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
An excessive accumulation of debris consisting of food, excreta and hair was noted on the sides and front of
multiple enclosures housing guinea pigs. Primary enclosures housing guinea pigs must be cleaned frequently
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and/or debris. Adequate cleaning is necessary to help reduce
potential disease transmission and odors.
The facility does not have standard operating procedures in place to address spot or periodic cleaning of guinea pig
enclosures but management began the process prior to the end of this inspection. Correct by: Guinea pig
enclosures must be adequately cleaned in the future.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The floor of the primary enclosure housing rabbit # 18940 contained excessive excreta. An almost confluent layer of
dried excreta covered the entire slatted floor leaving no clean resting surface available for the animal. Primary
enclosures for rabbits must be kept reasonably free of excreta and debris to ensure adequate sanitation and
cleaning to minimize soiling, compromise of dermal integrity and disease potential. At least two other rabbit
enclosures were noted to have excessive amounts of dried feces on the slatted floors but the excreta was not yet
present in a confluent layer covering the entire floor. The facility indicated that the rabbits would be removed from
the dirty surfaces prior to the close of business.
The facility does not currently have standard operating procedures in place to address spot or periodic cleaning of
the inside of rabbit enclosures but management began the process prior to the end of this inspection. Correct by:
Rabbits must be housed on reasonably clean surfaces in the future.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with management and APHIS personnel.Additional Inspectors
