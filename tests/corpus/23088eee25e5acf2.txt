3.13(b)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
On 10-January-2023 the licensee had the attending veterinarian examine each of the 20 adult dogs at the facility. The
results of the examinations for each individual animal are not documented and the licensee's Program of Veterinary Care
requires a body condition score and dental score to be recorded for each dog. Failure to document exam results may
interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to determine if the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records that include the dates and findings/results of all screening, routine, or other
required or recommended tests or examinations. The licensee must ensure that the results of examinations are
documented and that all medical records are complete with the required information.

To be corrected by: From this day forward

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
