3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Most of the hedgehog enclosures have excess fecal material and soiled bedding present. The licensee stated it has
been at least two weeks since the hedgehog enclosures were cleaned. Excreta and soiled bedding must be
removed from the animal enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize
disease hazards, and reduce odors. The hedgehog enclosures must be cleaned, and a more frequent schedule of
cleaning established and maintained.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The room for the hedgehogs has accumulated fecal material and bedding present on the floor. Clutter, dust and
debris are present throughout the room, and cobwebs and debris are present on the walls. Excess equipment and
supplies are filling one side of the animal room.
The licensee has removed some of the animal equipment that was present in front of the hedgehog building;
however, many items still remain. There is no organization of these materials, and the majority are being kept in
unsanitary conditions and could potentially contribute to disease hazards within the facility.
Accumulated bedding and fecal material on the floor contribute to odor and make it difficult to maintain adequate
pest control. Excess equipment and clutter make the animal room difficult to clean and sanitize, and accumulated
caging and other equipment preclude adequate pest control on the premises.
The floors and walls of the animal housing room must be cleaned, and clutter and debris removed from the room.
The licensee must also ensure that any unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property, and
that the premises are kept clean in order to minimize odor and pests. Additionally, useful items must be properly
cleaned, organized and stored so that all areas of the facility, especially the animal housing room, are kept clean
and free of accumulation of materials in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices. The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 7/18/16, 9/11/17, 12/11/17, 3/14/18, 2/19/19 and 6/13/19.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
