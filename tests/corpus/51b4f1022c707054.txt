INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
*****Analgesics were not administered to at least one animal in a timely manner. Protocol 13-138-H was approved
with the use of buprenorphine to relieve pain and distress. The (cid:28)"Monitoring and Minimizing Pain and Distress"(cid:29)
section on page 15 states (cid:28)"The animals will be given an injection of long acting SQ.buprenorphine (0.05mg/kg) for
pain control and placed....(cid:29)" Also in the "(cid:28)Surgical Procedures"(cid:29) section on page 22 it is reiterated that "(cid:28)the animals
will be given..buprenorphine 0.05mg/kg/BW for analgesia."(cid:29) The "(cid:28)Survival Surgery -(cid:19) Post Operative Care"(cid:29) section
on page 23 of the protocol reiterates again (cid:28)"Analgesia is administered for animals receiving a surgical procedure
prior to leaving." The animal health records reviewed for rabbit # 22094 included the "(cid:28)Individual Animal Record"(cid:29),
"(cid:28)Daily Log(cid:29)", "(cid:28)Surgery Record(cid:29)", and "(cid:28)Procedure Notes".(cid:29)
- Rabbit number 220934 was estimated to weigh 3 kg was not given preanesthetic analgesia, operative
analgesia or post operative analgesia. There is no indication that burprenorphine was given prior to induction or
just prior to recovery or during recovery from the procedure for this animal used in the study.
***** Analgesics were not administered to at least one animal in a timely manner. Protocol 13-043-I was approved
with the use of buprenorphine to relieve pain and distress. The "(cid:28)Surgical Procedures"(cid:29) section on page 18 states
"(cid:28)Following sedation the baboons will be administer preemptive analgesia with intramuscular injection of
buprenorphine (0.05mg/kg)."(cid:29)
The animal health records reviewed for male baboon #3713 known as Franklin included the "(cid:28)Individual Animal
Record"(cid:29), "(cid:28)Daily Log(cid:29)", "(cid:28)Surgery Record(cid:29)", and "(cid:28)Procedure Notes".(cid:29)
- Male baboon Franklin animal # 3713 was not given preemptive analgesia, operative or post operative analgesia.
The failure to follow the protocols and administer the burprenorphine as approved, at the prescribed times and
dosages, may have caused undue pain and distress. The IACUC must ensure the principal investigators and all
team members, to include the laboratory and veterinary staff, follow the approved protocols.
2.31(d)(5) REPEATINSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
*****The IACUC did not conduct appropriate reviews of the animal activities for protocols 13-138-H, 13-043-I, and
12-007-I, to ensure that the principal investigators are following the approved protocols. The animal use activity
involved rabbits for one protocol and baboons for the others.
The principal investigator for protocol 13-043-I did not follow the approved protocol. The medical records for
baboon # 3713 Franklin indicate that buprenorphine was not administered as stated in the protocol. Also propofol
and atropine was administered on 1-23-14 for anesthesia. However, the amendment for their use was not signed
by the IACUC until 2-17-2014. These medications were not listed in the original protocol.
The principal investigator for protocol 13-043-I did not follow the approved protocol. The "Provide a list of the
procedures to be preformed" section of the protocol on page 14 states "...the baboon will be anesthetized with
ketamine (10 mg/kg) and acepromazine (0.5 mg/kg) via intramuscular injection.... and intubated..." The medical
record for baboon # 3713 Franklin indicate the animal was initially anesthetized with ketamine at 20 mg/kg and
acepromazine at 0.4mg/kg and then propofol 20 mg was administered at 9:25, 10 mg at 9:30, 10 mg at 9:36, 10 mg
at 9:41, 10 mg at 9:51 and 10 mg at 10:16. Franklins records also indicate that atropine at 0.05 mg/ kg for 0.162 mg
was administered IM at 9:40. Propofol and atropine were not listed as an approved medication on the original
protocol. An amendment to add these medications was not approved until 2-17-2014 and this procedure took place
1-24-2014.
***** The prinicpal investigator for protocol 12-007 did not follow the respective protocols The "Provide a list of the
procedures to be preformed" section of the protocol on page 15 states ".. Blood pressure and pulse oximetry
readings are also used and continuously recorded during the operation." All of the animal health records for baboon
11108 Catman was reviewed included the "(cid:28)Individual Animal Record"(cid:29), "(cid:28)Daily Log(cid:29)", "(cid:28)Surgery Record(cid:29)", and
"(cid:28)Procedure Notes" and there is no indication that these parameters were monitored or recorded.
*****In accordance with established veterinary practices and there is no description in the IACUC approved
protocols 13-138-I or 13-138-H for monitoring of animals during and after surgery. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and
body temperature are not being monitored perioperatively or postoperatively so there is no objective way to assess
the animal's depth of anesthesia or whether heart rate, respiratory rate, or body temperature are being adversely
affected due to the anesthesia or due to pain.
The IACUC is required to conduct continuing review of all animal activities in order to ensure that they are
conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations, and in order to ensure that the animals do not
experience any undue pain and suffering. The IACUC must conduct continuing review of all activities involving
animals in order to ensure that all animal activities are conducted as stated in the approved protocols and in
compliance with these regulations.2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
- In room 212 Ce a rabbit was found showing signs of possible discomfort or illness. The animal had swollen
conjunctiva around the eyes, and was very quiet and still. The rabbit huddled in the rear corner of the cage until he
was physically removed by facility personnel. No treatment or examination had been conducted on this animal, and
there was no indication in the daily observation forms that any problems or concerns had been noted. All animals
must receive adequate and appropriate veterinary care in a timely manner. The affected rabbit must be examined
by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment initiated. Records must be kept of any diagnostics or treatment, and
must be available upon request.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- In the annex building, a singly housed male baboon named "Catman" was exhibiting stereotypic behavior.
Catman was visibly agitated, and showed a repetitive movement pattern that involved swinging his head in a
circular motion followed by a movement around his cage, and then another head swing. Catman continually
repeated this behavior pattern while observed by inspectors. In July 2013, the facility Primate Enrichment Team
had identified Catman as an animal that needed special consideration in addition to the routine enrichment all
primates in the annex receive. Catman was started on a targeted training program which lasted until early 2014.
When Catman was placed on a new protocol, his individual training program was discontinued and not replaced
with any additional enrichment. There was no indication in any records that Catman's behavior problems had
resolved. Certain nonhuman primates must receive special attention regarding enrichment of their environment.
Primates that exhibit psychological distress through behavior or appearance are in this category requiring special
attention. Catman's abnormal behavior suggests that the animal is in psychological distress. Failure to properly
address environmental enhancement in animals showing signs of psychological distress can lead to further
psychological distress, abnormal behaviors or animal injury. The registrant must develop, document and follow an
environmental enhancement plan that specifically addresses animals that show signs of being in psychological
distress through behavior or appearance.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- In the annex building, there was an extensive accumulation of small winged insects in multiple rooms housing
baboons. Fly traps were present but it is unclear if these are effective against the smaller insects. Insects arepotential vectors for disease, and increase the chance of contamination and discomfort of the enclosed primates.
The facillity must adequately control insects and other pests.
