Sanitation.
Housekeeping. There is a pile of clutter containing empty bags, water bottles, bale twine, rodent bait and other
miscellaneous items in the front corner by the overhead door. Rodent (mouse) feces were present in this area by the
clutter, along the walls, and on top of the brown guinea pig enclosures. Animal facilities must be kept clean and in good
repair to prevent unnecessary disease risks. Ineffective cleaning along walls, tops of enclosures, and corners of animal
rooms can lead to pest problems. Correct by ensuring the premises are kept clean, including: removing clutter in corner,
cleaning along walls and tops of enclosures, routinely dusting off and sanitizing surfaces; and maintaining a level of
general cleanliness to support good animal husbandry and health.

Remains uncorrected.
3.31(c)

Sanitation.
Pest control. Numerous rodent (mouse) feces were present along the walls and on tops of the brown guinea pig
enclosures. Mouse bait and two rodent traps were present on the top of the brown enclosures, but the pest control
program does not appear to be effective in controlling mice. Licensee must establish and maintain an effective pest
control program. An effective program should include: removing clutter in corner, cleaning rodent droppings, spilled

bedding and debris from behind enclosures, and dusting off and cleaning tops of animal enclosures. Correct by May 11,
2021.
