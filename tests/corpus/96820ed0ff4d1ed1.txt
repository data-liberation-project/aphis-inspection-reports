3.1(a)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal area of the facility is surrounded by a perimeter fence with numerous, animal enclosures contained
within. One adult male Great Pyrenees and five Great Pyrenees puppies live within the area enclosed by the
perimeter fence and have access around all the animal enclosures. There is a large amount of stored and/or
unused materials that the dogs can come into contact with. The materials include loose wires on the ground, piles
of sheet metal with sharp edges, tools including a pitchfork and small sledge hammer that are both lying on the
ground and wooden pallets leaning against walls. Long metal poles and a large unattached screen are leaning
against a barn and a puppy was observed lying beneath them. Near the black bear enclosure there is a large pile of
broken plastic resulting in numerous sharp edges that the puppies were observed to be walking near. Contact with
these items or if these items fell over could cause injury to the dogs.
The shelter area for the dogs is a large barn and there are loose pieces of sheet metal with sharp edges, an
unattached wall panel and tools such as a rake leaning against the wall. There are also pieces of woven wire
fencing on the floor that has numerous sharp points. The chicken coops in the barn are covered by a large plastic
tarp and the tarp is hanging down onto the ground. Contact with these items or if these items fell over could cause
injury to the dogs. If the puppies were to chew/consume the plastic tarp this could be detrimental to their health.
While inspecting black bear "Molly", two puppies approached the bear(cid:25)s primary fence and the bear was observed
to stick her paw through the fence and touch one of the puppies on its nose. Contact with large predators could
cause injury to the puppies.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound and protect the
animals from injury. The licensee must remove all the unused/stored material from areas that the dogs have access
too. The licensee must eliminate the ability of the black bear to touch the puppies. The licensee must ensure that
all housing facilities for dogs are structurally sound and safe for the dogs at all times.

The facility also raises/brokers/keeps domestic, exotic, and wild bird species within the perimeter fence (dog
enclosure). There are numerous enclosures housing the birds and the puppies have access to the areas around all
of these enclosures. The facility representative stated that the litter of five puppies was previously housed in an
enclosure with doves. Some of the birds have access to the dog areas and during the inspection a peacock, ducks,
chickens and an emu were observed to be walking around with the puppies and adult male dog. The shelter area
for the dogs is an alley way around chicken coops in a large barn. During the inspection loose chickens were
walking around in the alleyway of the barn.
If a housing facility for dogs is located on the same premises as another business, it must be physically separated
from the other business so that animals the size of dogs, skunks and raccoons are prevented from entering it. The
licensee must keep the business of raising/keeping birds separate from the dogs and, therefore, must establish a
physical separation of the housing facilities for birds from the housing facilities for dogs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Behind the groundhog enclosure there are at least two bird carcasses the size of ducks on the ground and a puppy
was observed to approach and sniff the carcasses. Near the black bear "Molly" there is a bucket containing at
least one bird carcass the size of a chicken and the dogs have access to this area. Contact with dead animals can
increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
Housing facilities must provide regular removal/disposal of dead animals to minimize contamination and disease
hazards. The licensee must remove the dead birds from the housing facility and ensure that all dead animals are
removed as quickly as possible to reduce the disease risk towards the dogs.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One adult male Great Pyrenees and five Great Pyrenees puppies have access to a plastic swimming pool as a
water source. The water in the pool is a dark brown color and there are feathers floating in it. The facility
representative stated that the loose ducks also use the pool as a water source and during the inspection two ducks
were observed to be drinking water from the pool. The use of the dog's drinking water by the birds could result in
contamination of the water and increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Primary enclosures for dogs must be constructed and maintained so that the dogs have access to clean drinking
water. The licensee must either eliminate the ducks ability to access the water source for the dogs or remove and
refill the water as often as necessary to ensure that it remains clean and uncontaminated at all times.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure containing male black bear "Gibby" has a raised resting platform. The top of the platform is attached
to the frame by wire. The ends of these wires have created sharp points that the bear can come in contact with.
The enclosure containing two grey foxes has multiple raised shelves. Two of the shelves are attached together with
wire and the ends of the wires have created sharp points that the foxes could come in contact with.
In a corner of the enclosure containing female black bear "Molly" there is a "catch pen" attached to the primary
fence. The "catch pen" is constructed of metal fence panels, wire and metal rails. The "catch pen" has been torn
away from the primary fence resulting in metal fencing, wire and rails scattered across the floor of the enclosure.
The fence panel used as the top of the "catch pen" is still attached to the primary fence and one side panel is still
attached by one of its corners but is leaning over. The areas of the side panel that are broken have created sharp
points that the bear was observed to touch during the inspection. The facility representative stated that "Molly" tore
down the "catch pen" two weeks ago.
The water tank for "Molly" is attached to the primary fence by wire. The wire is twisted together and the ends have
created sharp points. The bear was observed to touch the ends of these wires during the inspection.
The broken metal fencing and sharp points could cause injury to the animals. The facility must be constructed of
such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals. The housing facility shall be structurally soundand maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
The licensee must remove all sharp points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the animals.
The licensee must remove the components of the "catch pen" from the bear enclosure. If the "catch pen" is to be
rebuilt it must be constructed of appropriate materials with suitable strength that the bear cannot destroy. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the animals at all times.
