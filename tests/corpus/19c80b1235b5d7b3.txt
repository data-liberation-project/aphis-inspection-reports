2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 14:00 on
25-Oct-17. Attempts to contact the licensee went unanswered, both at the house and by phone (home and work
numbers were attempted; the work number was answered by someone who said the licensee was not in that day).
A voicemail was left on the home phone, but no response was received within 30 minutes of the call.
Without access to the facility, the inspection process is impossible. The licensee must ensure that a
knowledgeable, responsible facility representative is available during normal business hours. Hours of availability
may be established with the inspector.
Correct from this time forward.
