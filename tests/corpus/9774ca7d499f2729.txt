3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One plastic shelter located within the outdoor housing facility, does not contain any bedding material. Four adult
Pomeranian dogs are using the shelter. At the enclosure, the inspector's Kestrel device recorded an air temperature
of 43.9 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature last night was 34
degrees Fahrenheit and the low for tonight will be approximately 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
Failure to provide clean and dry bedding does not ensure the animals can remain warm and dry during low
temperatures. This can potentially lead to health hazards and cause discomfort for the animals. Shelters for dogs
must contain clean and dry bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Additional
clean and dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. The licensee must
ensure that all shelters being used are provided with sufficient bedding material.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
