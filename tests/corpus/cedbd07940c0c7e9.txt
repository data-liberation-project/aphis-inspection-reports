3.129(b)
FEEDING.
There were several metal feeders with edges that appeared jagged and sharp on the side facing the inside of the
chinchilla cages. It was explained that some of the chinchillas chew the feeders. There was also a small to
moderate amount of rust on the insides of these feeders.
Extensive damage to the surfaces of the feeders, leading to jagged edges or rusting, prohibits proper cleaning and
sanitation of the receptacles. This is because pathogens may reside in a damaged or porous surface. In addition,
rust can flake into the animal feed and may harm the animals if it is ingested. Animals may also injure themselves
on the sharp edges of the feeders.
Food receptacles shall be kept clean, sanitary, and free from contamination to protect the animals from disease and
injury.
