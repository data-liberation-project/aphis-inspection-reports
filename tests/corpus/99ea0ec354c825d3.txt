ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1143 on
27-Jun-18. I went to the licensee's house and spoke to a relative. She informed me he was not home and no one
else was able to do the inspection with me. I informed her I would try back another time.
End of report.
