2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has an attending veterinarian, however the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) made available
at time of this inspection needs more detail. The Parasite Control Program has no guidelines for the frequency of
sampling or treatment. Emergency Care provisions need more detail in regards to who will provide emergency care
if the attending veterinarian is unavailable. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a
more complete and accurate written program of veterinary care. This information is important so that the
preventative medicine program established and implemented will ensure that the animals are maintained in good
health.
