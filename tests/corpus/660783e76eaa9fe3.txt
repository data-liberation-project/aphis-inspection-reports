3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the building housing the large breed dogs, one enclosure, affecting one dog, has sides constructed of metal bars
that are showing excessive rusting. The rust causes flaking and pitting of the metal and does not allow for proper
cleaning and sanitization of these metal bars. All rusty metal must be replaced or altered in a manner that allows for
it to be properly cleaned and sanitized every two weeks.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the building housing English Bulldogs, the enclosures are constructed of wire floors and wire sides. Three
enclosures, affecting three dogs, had wires on their sides that are broken and creating sharp points at the level of
the dogs. Sharp points pose an injury risk to the dogs. All sharp points must be removed or altered in a manner
that eliminates the injury risk towards the dogs and licensee must establish a maintenance plan for the enclosures
to ensure they remain safe for the dogs. The licensee removed all broken wires and sharp points from the
enclosures during the inspection.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
In the first room of the building housing English Bulldogs, eight metal self feeders, affecting eight dogs, have a
buildup of dirt and grime on them. Food receptacles must be kept clean in order to prevent food contamination and
protect the health of the animals. Licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized every
two weeks or as often as necessary, to prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and other contaminates.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the building housing large breed dogs, two enclosures, affecting four dogs, had the plastic frames around the
access doors chewed and damaged by the dogs. This damage allows dirt and grime to penetrate the surface of the
plastic and the frames can no longer be properly cleaned and sanitized. All chewed and damaged plastic doorframes must be replaced or altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization every two weeks.
