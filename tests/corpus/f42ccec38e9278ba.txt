3.25(a)

Facilities, general.
Structural strength. One wall was removed due to construction in the holding/receiving room for guinea pigs. There is also
a missing widow pane on the side door in the room. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair
to protect the guinea pigs from injury, contain them securely, and restrict the entrance of other animals. The missing
section of wall and window pane could allow rodents and cats to enter the housing area for the guinea pigs. Licensee
must ensure the holding/receiving room is structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and does not allow other animals
or pests to enter the guinea pig room. Correct by April 30, 2022

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
