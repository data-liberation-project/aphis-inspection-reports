2.75(b)(1)(iv)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The disposition records for 2017 are missing addresses for all chinchillas sold to various businesses. The
addresses for animal sold are very important to allow for Aphis Officials to track the movement of animals in case of
a disease outbreak. The name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold or given must be
documented. The licensee must update all 2017 disposition records to include complete addresses.
