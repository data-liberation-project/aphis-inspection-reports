RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no acquisition records for the two Kangaroo, six Jacob Sheep and three Goats. The two Kangaroo were
not listed on the inventory on the September 17, 2015, pre-license inspection. I contacted the inspector of this
licensee and she stated the inventory on the September 17, 2015, inspection was correct and these Kangaroos
were not present. The six sheep and three goats were obtained just prior to this fair, however no records are
available. The licensee stated he first transported the farm animals to this fair obtained from a USDA licensee and
then transported the rest of his animals from his winter quarters in Tennessee. Every exhibitor shall make, keep,
and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information concerning animals acquired,
owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold,
euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
This licensee failed to submit a written itinerary to the AC eastern regional office to this fair which started November
6, 2015. The licensee stated he sent an itinerary to the eastern regional office, however after contacting the office
no itinerary was on file. The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in
advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any
animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. If the exhibitor accepts an
engagement for which travel will begin with less than 48 hours notice, the exhibitor shall immediately contact the AC
Regional Director in writing with the required information. APHIS expects such situations to occur infrequently, and
exhibitors who repeatedly provide less than 48 hours notice will, after notice by APHIS, be subject to increased
scrutiny under the Act.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The plastic kennel in the outdoor chain-link enclosure for the three ring tail lemurs has a large hold on the left side
viewing from the front of the enclosure. The hole is due to the lemurs biting on the kennel and they could ingest
these plastic parts and become ill or injured. The hole is covered from the outside with a metal fencing,\, however
the inside of the kennel still accessible to the lemurs. Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be
constructed and maintained to prevent injuries. This kennel needs to be repaired or replaced.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: NOVEMBER 20, 2015.


3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The capuchin, macaque, and lemurs do not have sufficient increased cage complexities: providing objects to
manipulate: varied food items: using foraging or task-oriented feeding methods. The care taker stated they do
provide toys and other foraging, but the toys are currently dirty. No evidence of foraging was present during this
inspection. During this inspection all the non human primates were observed sitting on their perch or on the
ground.. The capuchin and macaque are singularly housed and lemurs are group housed. The rhesus macaque
was sitting on one of the food / water holders, no perch or environmental enrichment in its enclosure. The care
taker stated that they take the macaque out daily for enrichment, however there needs to be a variety of enrichment
to keep these animals adequately enhanced. The physical environment in the primary enclosures non human
primates must be enriched by providing means of expressing non injurious species-typical activities.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor chain-link enclosure housing four coatimundi has metal fencing on its grass surface that could cause
injury. The coatimundi have dug out dirt throughout these 4'' by 4'' spaces of the fencing. These coatimundi could
get their body parts caught in these area and become injured. If this metal fencing is to be used there needs to be
bedding added. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained to protect theanimals.
CORRECTED - Animal shavings were placed over the metal panels in the enclosure.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The white nose and mountain coatimundi are housed in small hard plastic kennels in the transport trailer for the last
several days and do not have sufficient space to stand or turn around freely. There are only several inches of space
between these animals and the inside of the kennel on all sides. The care taker stated they were in these
enclosures because they are not able to be put in with the other four coatimundi. The license stated that they were
in their travel enclosures because their other enclosures were being cleaned. It was evident that these animals were
in these travel enclosures for more than one day due to observing multiple occurrences of excreta. To prevent these
animals from living in unhealthy stressful conditions, they must be moved to enclosures in which they can make
normal postural and social adjustments shortly after arriving at your destination.
