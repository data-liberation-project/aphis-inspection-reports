OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On the southwest side of the main zoo property there are two snow macaques in an enclosure that lacks a
perimeter fence on the backside (far side from the public area) of their enclosure. Inspectors observed the area
behind these animals was a swampy area and the licensee reports that the swamp has always served as these
animals(cid:25) perimeter barrier. An incomplete perimeter fence could potentially allow entry of unwanted animals or
unauthorized persons. Also, without a complete perimeter fence there is no secondary containment system in place
if animals were to escape from their primary enclosure. This enclosure must be inside an area surrounded by a
perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet tall and at least 3 feet from the primary enclosure.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Some animals that require a perimeter fence are being housed outside of the zoo'(cid:25)s main perimeter fence.
** On the southwest side of the main zoo property there is a zebra and a camel in an enclosure that lacks a
perimeter fence on the backside (far side from the public area) of their enclosure. Inspectors observed the area
behind these animals was a swampy area and the licensee reports that the swamp has always served as these
animals(cid:25) perimeter barrier.
** On the northwest corner, 2 Oryxes are housed in an enclosure that uses the facility'(cid:25)s perimeter fence as the
north side of their primary enclosure.
** The southernmost side of the property has a partial perimeter fence. This area has various North American
wildlife species on exhibit. An inspector followed this fence line to where it ended and was able to continue walking
through the woods to the back part of a subdivision.The licensee stated that he had approval in the past for the fence not to be complete in these areas and to use the
swamp as a barrier. However, there is no approved variance. The licensee also stated that the perimeter fence
cannot be constructed in these areas due the swampy ground. An incomplete perimeter fence could potentially
allow entry of unwanted animals or unauthorized persons. Also, without a complete perimeter fence there is no
secondary containment system in place if animals were to escape from their primary enclosure. These outdoor
primary enclosures must be inside an area completely surrounded by a perimeter fence that is at least 8 feet tall for
potentially dangerous animals and at least 6 feet tall for other animals. The perimeter fence must be at least 3 feet
from the primary enclosure.
