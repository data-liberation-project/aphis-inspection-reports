FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A section of the enclosure fencing in the northeastern corner of the property has sharp wire ends at the base that
protrude into the enclosure along a section approximately 12 feet in length. The sharp points on the wire fencing
could injure the animals. This section of fencing must be repaired.
The enclosure fencing has electric wire (not in use) that is hanging loosely along the top of the fencing on the
northern side of the property, and also in the inner enclosure on that side of the property. Animals could potentially
become entangled in the wire and injured. The affected wire must be repaired.
Maintenance problems should be identified and repaired in a timely manner to keep the facilities in good repair and
protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The wooden perimeter fence located in the northwestern corner of the property lacks structural stability, as it is
easily moved when pressure is applied to the fence. This area of the fencing must be repaired. The perimeter
fence must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to contain the
animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.
This inspection of a new site and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
All items must be in compliance prior to conducting regulated activities at this site.
