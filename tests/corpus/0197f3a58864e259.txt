ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 16 week old unidentified female Pekinese/Pomeranian mix has an abnormal condition of her left eye. The dog
squints the eye and drainage is observed in and around the eye. The current condition of the dog's eye can be
painful and can possibly lead to more serious problems such as infection or blindness if left untreated. The
licensee, in consultation with the facility's attending veterinarian, must address the eye health of this dog.
A female Pomeranian with tag #117 is observed to have a hard, grayish-brown material on the surface of her front
and cheek teeth. The licensee stated that she has consulted the facility veterinarian regarding dental health and has
been treating the adult dogs at the kennel with an oral dental medication. However the treatment appears not to be
effectively working as the material observed on the teeth of dog #117 is consistent with dental disease. Dental
disease can be painful and can lead to other health problems if left untreated. The licensee, in consultation with the
facility veterinarian, needs to reevaluate the current dental health plan for this dog and all the dogs at the facility.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
A 16 week old female Pekinese/Pomeranian mix is not currently identified with official USDA identification. Lack of
official identification does not allow for the proper identification or tracking of the animal. Identify the adult dog with
official USDA identification.

the housing area as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of such materials. Correct by June 19, 2915.
