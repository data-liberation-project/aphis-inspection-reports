An enclosure containing one of the llamas had part of the fence line that was in disrepair from a tree branch that
had fallen on it a few years ago. This part of the fence line was not stable and was mangled to the point where the
llama could potentially get its head stuck in it.
Two enclosures containing a total of 9 goats, 5 sheep, and 1 deer had wooden bridges for the goats to walk across.
Both bridges had screw heads sticking out of it. Screw heads sticking out could potentially be stepped on by any
animals walking across the bridge causing a potential injury to an animal's feet.
All housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
