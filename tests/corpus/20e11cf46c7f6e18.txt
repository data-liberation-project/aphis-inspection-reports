SANITATION.
Some of the rabbit hutches have excreta building up in the corners, on the support surfaces, and in between the
mesh and wood support on the sides. While the remainder of the enclosure is adequately cleaned additional
attention should be given to ensure the corners and areas where the mesh wire is attached to the wood are cleaned
as well. Excessive build up of excreta increases the risk of hazards such as bacterial growth, fungus, parasites and
insects which may cause illness. The enclosures shall be properly cleaned and sanitized to protect the rabbits from
illness. Correct by March 21, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The farm fence used to create the pig enclosure holding the male pig "Tubby", and the enclosure holding the sow
and two small potbelly pigs have sections that are not secured. These sections hve been pushed up creating gaps
that allow the smaller pigs to freely enter and exit the enclosure. These gaps may also allow unwanted animals to
enter the enclosure. Some of the fence wire has been broken leaving sharp points that may cause injury. The
fence shall be secured and all sharp points removed to protect the animals from injury and contain them safely
within their enclosure. Correct by March 28, 2016.
