3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There were 10 enclosures at the very top of the 2 racks of enclosures currently used within the facility. About 75%
of these enclosures have not had food waste, feces or bedding removed from the enclosure within the past 2
weeks. Several of these enclosures had feces were tuning or had already turned white in color due to the amount
of time it had been sitting in the enclosure. In addition, the facility is currently using a disinfectant but are not using
a detergent during their routine cleaning process. Not having proper cleaning of the facility directly contributes to
the odor within the facility and exposes the guinea pigs to unnecessary disease hazards. The licensee must ensure
that all primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.
In addition, the primary enclosures must be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 [deg]F.) and soap or
detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a
safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam.
