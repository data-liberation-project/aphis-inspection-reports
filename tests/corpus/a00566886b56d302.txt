2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) no longer reflects the actual practices at the facility. For example, the
parasite preventative and treatment described is no longer used as written.
Also, the attending veterinarian (AV) hasn't been to the facility for almost 2 years (mainly due to shutdown for covid,) but
the PVC indicates annual visits.
Regular AV visits and maintaining a current PVC ensures that all aspects of husbandry and health maintenance are
current and documented, and emergency care options are addressed before an urgent need arises.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The environment enhancement plan for Bandit, the ringtail lemur, no longer represents his current housing situation. The
singly-housed primate has had changes in his needs and behavior as he's aged and has been relocated to a different part
of the house. The written plan needs to be updated and approved by the attending veterinarian.
Singly-housed primates present additional challenges for ensuring their psychological wellbeing. Researching options,


then writing out and following the plan will help ensure his needs are addressed.
