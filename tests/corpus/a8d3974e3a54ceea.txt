3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is a very high level of urine ammonia/tomcat spray inside BARC cubicle "I" and the immediate center corridor
area outside of this enclosure. The concentration of ammonia/spray smell was sufficient enough to cause difficulty
in breathing and an irritation of the lower and upper respiratory tract of this inspector. This smell remained with this
inspector for approx 1 hour after this area was inspected.
The floors and walls appeared clean, and the ventilation system appeared to be functioning correctly. No other
cubicles were affected. This condition may be emanating from either the grout, glass door seals, or some other
surface(s) that is not impervious to these secretions in this particular cubicle.
Prolong exposure to this irritating odor can increase the risk of respiratory infections and irritations of the respiratory
tract, and causes discomfort to the cats in this area and does not provide for their health and well-being.
The cats shall be provided with an enclosure that minimizes odors.
