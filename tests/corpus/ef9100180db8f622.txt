3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Space
An enclosure housing 2 dogs did not provide enough space for them. Both dogs were measured to be 18 inches in
length. The minimum floor space required for these two dogs was calculated to be (18+6)(18+6)/144= 8 square
feet. The enclosure with which the dogs were housed in was measured to be 40inches x 23 inches/144 which
equals 6.4 square feet. This primary enclosure does not allow enough space for the dogs to have freedom of
movement or other perform other natural postural movements. The licensee moved the dogs to a larger enclosure
that exceeded the minimum space requirements at the time of inspection. The licensee must ensure that all dogs
are provided with at least the required minimum floor space so that they can have freedom of movement and
perform other natural postural movements at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures
There is an accumulation of fecal material under 4 outside sections, affecting 11 dogs, of a sheltered building
"Puppy Barn". The amount of fecal material has attracted several flies. These flies can transmit diseases to the
dogs. The licensee stated that the last time she had removed the fecal material from under these enclosures was
"2 weeks ago".
On the east side of a sheltered building "High Barn" the outside sections of 4 enclosures, affecting 13 dogs, had a
greater than a daily accumulation of fecal material present. Some of the fecal material had a dried, whitish
appearance to it indicating that it is older than 1 day. The amount of fecal material present is a potential for disease
hazards, insects, pest and odors.
The licensee must remove the fecal material from under the primary enclosures and from within the primary
enclosures. The licensee must ensure that fecal material is removed at least once daily from the primary
enclosures and as often as necessary from under the elevated enclosures to prevent disease hazards, insects,
pests and odors.
To be corrected by: 23 June 15.Inspection and a verbal exit interview was conducted with licensee and ACI Stephanie Osborne.
