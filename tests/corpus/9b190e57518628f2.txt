3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
A wooden resting platform in the wolf-hybrid enclosure is not in good repair. The platform is warped in two areas and the
surface is splintering. At the back left corner of the enclosure, there is an approximately 6 inches in height X 20 inches in
width gap at the bottom of the fence. Although the gap has been covered by 2 cinder blocks, they are not securely fixed
and can be moved. The presence of splintered surfaces and gaps in fencing can lead to animal injury. Housing facilities,
including furniture and den boxes, for wolf- hybrids should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
