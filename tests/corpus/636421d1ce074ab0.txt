*One white/brown/black adult in pen F(5) has extensive hair loss. The left eye of a brown and white adult, also in
this pen, is only partially open, is moist and red rimmed.
*One white/brown/gold adult in pen C(1) has scabs and hair loss on the left side of its face bordering its nose.
*Two juvenile guinea pigs, one white/black in pen I(1) and one black/white in pen A(4) are moribund. They are
unable to rise and breathing rapid & shallow. They are also intermittently twitching or paddling their feet.
Licensee contacted the Attending Veterinarian, who said he would come by today.
The above listed guinea pigs need veterinary treatment for their health and well being. They must be examined by
a licensed veterinarian for evaluation and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarians diagnosis, treatment, and
plan, shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials. There were also eight guinea pigs divided into two
"sick pens" but no treatment records were available. Licensee stated they are being treated with Uniprim and
supplemental vitamin C. Some notes are kept on notebook tablets on each rack, but they are difficult to interpret.
Every facility should have a system of health records sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate the delivery of
adequate health care.
