2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two pigs were observed to be lame and facility staff had not identified the lameness issues as of approximately
14:00 hours the afternoon of the inspection. One of the pigs appeared to be moderately lame on the right front leg.
The second pig was severely lame and was not bearing weight on the left front leg. A number of what appeared to
be shallow bite wounds were present on the sides of the second pig. The animals were being housed in a group of
approximately 40 pigs. While the pigs had sufficient room to make normal postural adjustments, the density of the
animals made the observation of individual animals difficult.
Daily observations of all animals to assess their well-being and direct and frequent communication with the
attending veterinarian regarding observed health issues are necessary to ensure that the animals at the facility
receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensure that all animals are observed
daily and the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary.
