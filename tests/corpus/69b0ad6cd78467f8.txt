3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The enclosure housing one goat and one sheep has chicken wire detached
from the inside of the gate and curling up into the enclosure. The animals may be injured on the wire. The post that
closes the gap between the barn and the back fence is loose and no longer secured in place. The animals may try
to push through the gap and be injured or escape.. Once the APHIS official identified the structural items the owner
removed the chicken wire from the gate and secured the post back in place to close the gap. The facility must
establish and maintain a program to keep the animal enclosures structurally sound and in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
