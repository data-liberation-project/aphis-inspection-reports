FACILITIES, GENERAL.
POT BELLIED PIG: The goats have damaged the wire fence fabric in the left corner of "Bacon's" enclosure
fence. The damage has left a gap large enough for the goats to put their heads through. Additionally, protruding
points of the broken wire were present. During this inspection, the broken, protruding wires were removed. The
damaged fence fabric must be repaired and/or replaced to maintain structural strength and to protect the animals
from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
POT BELLIED PIG: Water is pooling in front of the "human door" of "Jerry's" shelter building. The keeper must
step through this water in order to gain entrance into the shelter building. Additionally, when the interior of the
shelter is hosed out for cleaning, the excess water is directed out of the "human door" which may be a cause of
pooling water.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate this excess water to prevent unnecessary pooling.
