FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The food storage and preparation area does not adequately protect the food against deterioration, molding, and
contamination by vermin. I observed hundreds of rodent dropping throughout the floor at the food storage and prep
area. There was a plastic bin used to store dry food which had large holes due to the rodent chewing it. There are
numerous areas outside the building where rodents have chewed through large portions of the wood panels. There
are several areas inside the food storage area where rodents are entering and exiting the building thought the
chewed wood and wire mesh fencing. Some of the freezers and refrigerators have foul odors, uncovered food, dirty,
and had thermometers to ensure appropriate temperatures.
Rodent excreta in contact with animal food could transmit illness and or numerous diseases in animals. There
needs to be thermometers in all refrigerators and freezers to ensure the food is being stored at adequate safe
temperatures. Refrigeration / freezers needs to remain clean and food covered to ensure there is no contamination
and or freezer burn. Rodents bred for feeding housed in this area were recently removed due to the odors and
some escaping their enclosures the last several years.

FEEDING.
There are 3-4 raccoons and other animal carcases in a freezer which were obtained from a wild life removal service.
It is not known which USDA animals are being fed these animals. The animals have been in this freezer from 4
months to unknown dates because there is no information as to when they were obtained. There is no information
on how these animals were euthanized, if they were adequately refrigerated, if they were ill and or had parasites /diseases. Animals must be fed food that is wholesome, free from contamination to maintain all animals in good
health. These frozen carcasses must not be fed to USDA covered animals. It is important that this facility consult
with their attending vet in any changes of diet to ensure their animals are being fed an appropriate diet.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The food storage room and food preparation area has a dirty floor with rodent feces. There is an accumulation of
trash and animal supplies which needs to be discarded or cleaned and stored appropriately. Premises (buildings
and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as
necessary to protect the health of the animals.

TO BE CORRECTED BY: SEPTEMBER 25, 2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
This facility does not have an effective program for the control of mammalian pests. There are hundreds of rodent
droppings throughout the floor inside the food storage and prep area. There are numerous areas outside the
building with rodent droppings and where rats have chewed through large portions of the wood panels. The rodents
are entering and exiting the food storage building thought the chewed wood and wire mesh fencing. The curator and
director at this facility stated they do have a professional pest control company, but no documentation was available
during this inspection. It was stated that rats are observed in the daytime and the amount of droppings seen during
this inspection is evidence that the pest control program is not effective.
Contact with rodent excreta could transmit numerous illnesses and diseases to animals and humans. A safe and
effective program for the control of mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. To ensure that there is
an appropriate pest control plan, written documentation needs to be available.
