2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. There were no inventory
records present for several months indicating the number of adult guinea pigs, weanlings, or newborns present or the
number of guinea pigs that died. A total of 480 adults, 60 weanlings, and 16 newborns were counted during this
inspection. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal
losses by decreased number of guinea pigs born or raised. Licensee must maintain these records containing the required
information for animals which discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births
and deaths. Remains uncorrected.

Contingency planning.
A contingency plan was not available at time of this inspection. If an emergency or weather incident occurred animal
health could be impacted if the facility was not prepared with a plan. Licensee needs to develop a contingency plan in the
event of an emergency that could affect the health and well-being of the guinea pigs. Correct by October 7, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
