TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Two dogs (Tommy and Hercules) and four cats (Zorro, Fox, Yogi, and Charlie) did not have individual identification.
Appropriate identification of dogs and cats is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory,
disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must properly identify these animals. (The
licensee chooses to use tags as his method of identification.)
To be corrected by April 30, 2014.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the exhibitor. An inspector from the Missouri Department
of Agriculture was also present during the inspection and exit briefing.
