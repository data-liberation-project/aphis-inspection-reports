eye has not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian. Eye problems can be painful and may lead to more

receives proper treatment have the attending veterinarian evaluate the dog's eye and treat per veterinarian's

**A female Pomeranian (no official ID) cannot weight bear or walk normally on her left front leg but otherwise
appears normal. According to the licensee, the dog received an injury in April 2018. Veterinary care was provided.
However, the course of initial treatment has passed and the leg still appears to be injured and abnormal. No
follow-up veterinary care has been planned or provided since April. Injuries can be painful and can lead to
abnormal healing and potential loss of normal use of the injured body part. Consult the attending veterinarian
regarding the injured leg and follow any prescribed treatment.
