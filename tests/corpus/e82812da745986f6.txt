3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is missing information on the routine for heartworm testing and fecal sampling. There is no guidance currently
provided in their program of veterinary care for the percentage or total number of dogs to be sampled and the frequency
of which they should be tested for heartworm and intestinal parasites.

Heartworm disease is caused by a parasite that can cause significant damage to the heart before visible symptoms are
seen. Likewise, intestinal parasites can cause chronic disease that can be difficult to detect. Intestinal parasites can also
be spread from mother to puppies. Because of these risks to the health of dogs and puppies, regular testing in necessary
to ensure control and early detection.

The facility's Program of Veterinary Care provides a schedule for adult dog rabies vaccinations. It states adult dogs will be
vaccinated annually for the first rabies vaccine and then every 3 years. 7 dogs are overdue for their rabies vaccinations;
Dixie, Christa, Breanna, Bella, Beauty, Frisky and Fluffy. Maintaining a vaccination schedule is necessary to ensure the
dogs are protected from contagious and deadly diseases.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests and a vaccination

schedule in accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. The facility must consult with their
attending veterinarian and add a schedule for testing for heartworms and intestinal parasites to the Program of Veterinary
Care. The facility must vaccinate the dogs that are overdue for the rabies vaccine or provide a statement from the
veterinarian if the dogs are not able to be vaccinated at this time.
