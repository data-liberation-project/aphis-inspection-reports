ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 p.m. on
02-Mar-18.
* In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I honked the vehicle horn, knock on the door, called the phone numbers
provided and left a message and ask individuals who came on the premises if someone was available for
inspection.
