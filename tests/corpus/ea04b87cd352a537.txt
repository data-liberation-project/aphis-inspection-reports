2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The current written program of vet care with the attending veterinarian states that certain vaccines and TB
testing will occur annually with all non human primates. The facility did not have on record the last time testing was
done, nor tests for several new animals that arrived recently. To ensure the attending vet has adequate authority for
the health of the animals, the written program of vet care needs to be followed and vaccines and testing
administered when listed. This plan needs to be followed for the health of the animals. The attending vet should be
contacted and a time scheduled to administer these vaccinations and testing in a timely manner.

2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** At the time of the inspection, the facility was very busy mid afternoon. This is a facility that allows contact with
multiple species throughout the park and multiple times a readily identifiable employee could not be viewed in areas
where guests were having contact with animals. The facility has stations where employees are located to sell food,
but those employees have limited viewing when dealing with guests. The facility needs to station more identifiable
attendants in high traffic areas of the park during periods of public contact for the safety of the animals.
