2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On the morning of May 22, 2015, the public was able to gain access to an area of the zoo that is meant for zoo staff
only. The public was able to enter this area through a gate that was left open that serves as an entry/exit for zoo
staff to access the wolf and elk exhibit areas and as a public barrier. While the public had access to this area a child
was able to put its fingers in the wolf enclosure and was bit by one of the wolves. Gates that are left open that serve
as part of the public barrier pose a danger to the animals and the public by not restricting access to the animals by
members of the viewing public. The integrity of the public barriers must be maintained to assure the safety of the
animals and the viewing public.
Correct: Immediately
This was a focused inspection in response to the May 22, 2015 incident.
