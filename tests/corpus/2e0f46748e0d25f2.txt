HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At this time the newly acquired artic fox was being housed in a dog run style of enclosure. The barrier fence was
~2.5(cid:29)' -(cid:19) 3'(cid:29) away from the primary enclosure. However, due to the fact that the barrier fence was only one strand of
rope and wrapped around short black posts it was easily manipulated and could give the public direct access to the
fox. To ensure the safety of the fox and the general public, this barrier will need to be erected farther away from the
enclosure and constructed of a more stable, substantial material.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The ring tailed lemurs were being housed in the house at the time of this inspection. The roof of this enclosure has
been constructed of a small wire mesh. However, the back left corner has detached from the walls and the mesh is
now loose. There is also a small section of mesh by the light fixture that has detached from the other mesh panel.
These areas now present jagged edges and possible escape routes for these primates. To ensure that they are
securely contained and cannot be injured on this material it will need to be address.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The first goat pen on the right, as you enter the zoo, is constructed of chain link fence attached to wood posts and
rails. However, there are a few wood rails that are detaching from the posts and the chain link is detaching from the
rails. This now allows for the front fence line to bow outward. To ensure that the animals cannot escape from this
pen, this fence will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: April 13, 2014
2. The goat pen in the middle of the zoo, across from the tiger exhibit, is constructed of chain link fence attached to
metal posts and rails. However, the chain link fence has begun to detach from the metal rails in a few areas. Again
to ensure that the goats do not escape, this fence will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: April 13, 2014
3. The black bear enclosure has sections of chain link fence that are attached to the bottom wood rails and are then
laid down on the ground of the primary enclosure to act as a "(cid:28)skirt"(cid:29). However, in the front, right corner the chain
link has been pulled up and there are now jagged edges of fence exposed. The bear has direct access to this
fencing. To ensure that he is not injured on this material it will need to be addressed.
**To Be Corrected By: April 10, 2014
4. The goat and llama enclosure, which is by the new aviary, has a blue chain link fence attached to metal posts.
Again, the chain link fence has begun to detach from the metal support posts. To ensure that the goat and llamas
do not escape, this fence will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: April 13, 2014
5. The dromedary camels were being housed in the aluminum sided riding ring at the time of this inspection.
However, the wood planks that had been placed along the bottom half of the metal walls are in need of attention.
Several wood planks, along the left side, have detached and are now either completely off the walls and laying on
the ground or partially detached and one half is attached while the other half is on the ground. To ensure that these
camels are not injured on these planks they will need to be addressed.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The brown bear enclosure has a cement block den attached to her outdoor chain link enclosure. However, during
this inspection it was noted that the den was filled with 2"-(cid:29) (cid:19) 3"(cid:29) of water. This bear had no access to a dry area in
the den portion of the enclosure. Due to the cold temperatures at night this den needs to be made available to this
bear for shelter. This situation will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: April 9, 2014
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The chain link fence behind the black and brown bear enclosures is in need of attention. The fence has begun to
detach from the metal support posts and is now sagging and bowing. To ensure the integrity of this fence line this
will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: April 13, 2014
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
At the time of this inspection we were informed that this facility has changed veterinarians. Due to the fact that the
tigers are not being fed a commercial diet, the new attending vets will need to review the current diets. The diets will
need to be documented and approved by the new attending vets.
***To Be Corrected By: April 19, 2014
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The brown bear enclosure had an accumulation of strands of rope and soiled enrichment items. The ropes in the
enclosure will need to be evaluated to ensure that they are not a hazard to this bear cub. To ensure that this
enclosure is properly maintained and cleaned on a routine basis the soiled items will need to be removed.
