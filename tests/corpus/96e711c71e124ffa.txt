3.75(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Components of the primary enclosures housing squirrel monkeys were rusted, creating sharp edges. These areas
included the platform over the entry door and a horizontal support member of a partition wall. Additionally, a drain
cover was missing in another enclosure housing a non-human primate.
No animals were affected at the time of the inspection.
Sharp edges can cause cuts or other injuries to the animals. An animal might be injured or an appendage
entrapped due to the missing drain cover.
All affected areas must be repaired and a system of maintenance of enclosures and facilities should be in place to
prevent injuries to the housed animals.
