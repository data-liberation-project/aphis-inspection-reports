2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Guinea pigs on study are ear tagged for identification purposes. During inspection guinea pigs #3153 and 4776
were identified with torn and bleeding ears resultant from the metal ID ear tag. Their conditions were addressed by
the veterinary staff at the time of inspection. During protocol review it was found that this potentially painful and/or
distressful condition is not included under the search for alternatives.
During review of TI261, the search for alternatives to painful and/or distressful procedures that are more than
momentary did not contain Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) or DNCB which are both potential sensitizers and
can cause ulceration and edema of the skin at the site of injection.
Alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals must be
considered. A written narrative description of methods and sources shall be provided to determine that alternatives
were not available.
