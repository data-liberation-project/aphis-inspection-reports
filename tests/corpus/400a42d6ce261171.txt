3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility was cited on 3/3/16 for areas of wire fencing in the pasture that were loose and had fallen down. Those
areas of fencing have been repaired. Two new sections have been damaged by the goats rubbing on the welded
wire fencing. The affected fencing separates the two most southern pastures on the property. A portion of the wire
has been broken and is lying on the ground.
The damaged areas compromise the strength of the fencing and animals could become entangled in the wire. The
facility plans to repair and upgrade the fencing within the next two weeks.
Exit interview conducted with the facility representative, Gwynn Hallberg, VMO and Diane Forbes, VMO.
