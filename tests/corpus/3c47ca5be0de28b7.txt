ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Facility staff contacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) 2-4 months ago regarding a lesion on the left foot of the male
Bettong. The AV was unable to visit the facility until the following month but offered that the facility could bring the
Bettong in for treatment. The facility chose not to take the Bettong to the AV and instead treated the lesion in-house
without consulting the AV. According to staff, the lesion had an underlying cavity was flushed with betadine for a
period of a several days until it healed. There is no documentation of communication with the AV, treatment of the
animal, or observations as to how it recovered.
The facility is to assure that the AV has appropriate authority in regards to veterinary care. By bypassing the AV to
administer treatment, the animal is at risk of not receiving the proper medical care, including pain management or
observation for complications, all of which can be detrimental to the animal's health.
Correct by communicating with the AV how medical issues will be treated when a site visit is not possible by the AV
and ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care reflects any treatment authority the AV places upon the facility.
Correct by: July 18, 2018.
