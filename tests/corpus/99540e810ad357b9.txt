3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An enclosure, housing two adult dogs, had wood particular board from the primary fencing. This wood board was
excessively chewed and scratched. This wood surface cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized. As a result, the
disease hazards can increase for the dogs.
For the prevention of disease hazards to the animals, all surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis and kept in
good repair for proper cleaning and sanitation.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The dog doors for six enclosures, housing 10 adult dogs, had an accumulation of brown to black grime or debris
on their surfaces. The door inserts and area around some of the dog doors had an accumulation of brown to black
grime or debris. This indicates daily spot-cleaning is not taking place and could increase the disease potential for
the animals.
All surfaces must be spot-cleaned and disinfected regularly for the prevention of an accumulation of waste or grime.
This will decrease the disease hazards for the dogs.
