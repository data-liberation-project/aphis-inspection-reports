SANITATION.
The inside surfaces of a refrigerator used to thaw meat for the animals contained a buildup of dirt and dried blood in
several areas. Also, the metal rack, shelves had a moderate accumulation of rust which prevents effective cleaning
and sanitation.
Premises used to store food must be kept clean to protect and ensure the well-being of the animals and to facilitate
good husbandry practices. A system of a more timely and efficient cleaning schedule must be in place.Correct by 05/06/2016.
