3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
SHELTER FROM THE ELEMENTS.
****In the outdoor housing area, there were sixteen shelters housing a total of 35 dogs (including small, short-haired
breeds) that did not have sufficent bedding. The ambient temperature at the time of the inspection was 33.9 F
degrees, and the temperatures were below 20 degrees during the night before. Adequate bedding is necessary to
protect the dogs from the cold. The licensee must provide clean, dry bedding whenever the ambient temperature
falls below 50 degrees F and must provide additional clean, dry bedding when the ambient temperature is 35
degrees F or lower.
A focused inspection was conducted to address the non-compliant items of 2.50(a)(2), of 3.1(c)(3), and of 3.4(b)(4)
from the December 19, 2013 inspection report.
Puppies from different litters that were housed together in the same primary enclosure had the required individual
identification. Also, the outdoor enclosures did not have an excessive buildup of feces.
This focused inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
