HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One lab room was found with an uncovered container of fruit flavored cereal used as non-human primate (NHP)
treats sitting out on a workstation and two open bags of raisins and dried fruit marked “NHP Use” sitting on the floor.

All supplies of food must be stored in manner that protects them from spoilage, contamination, deterioration and
vermin infestation, and when not in actual use must be kept in leak-proof containers with tight fitting lids.
Improperly stored and open containers of food and treats are vulnerable to pest infestation and contamination which
could cause harm to the animal if ingested and/or reduce the nutritive value of the items. All treats and feed items
should be properly stored to prevent contamination and protected from spoilage at all times when not in use.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.

WATERING.
A water tank in an outdoor cattle enclosure was observed to contain opaque green water and debris.
Contaminated water may harbor harmful microorganisms and adversely affect water intake and thus negatively
impact animal health. The facility should ensure that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

SANITATION. Dozens of flies were observed on two heifers in a cattle enclosure. Flies were observed on the legs of the animals
and they were stomping their feet. When one of the animals was recumbent flies were observed circling and landing
on the animal, and it exhibited repeated truncal skin twitches in response to the flies landing on its back.

Animal disease, discomfort, and distress may be caused by insects such as flies. The facility should ensure that a
safe and effective program for the control of insects is established and maintained.
Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
