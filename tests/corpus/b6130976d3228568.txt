Housekeeping for Premises
****The entire back side of the outdoor portion of the facility had weeds, grass and brush several feet high growing
next to the dog enclosures. Both sides of the outdoor area had an excessive amount of dried leaves piled next to
the enclosures. The dogs in these enclosures had fleas. Leaves, weeds and brush provide shelter and breeding
areas for pests such as fleas. The licensee must maintain the areas in and around the dog enclosures so that they
are free of excessive leaves, weeds and brush.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest Control
****Numerous fleas were observed on three Jack Russell Terriers(MC #077-863-270, MC #028-520-383, MC
#058-786-766) and on five Boxers. Some dogs were observed scratching or biting at themselves. The licensee
stated that she is using fles control products on the dogs and in the enclosures. However, they apparently are not
effective. Fleas can cause discomfort and can cause medical problems in the dogs. The licensee must establish
and maintain an effective pest control program.
