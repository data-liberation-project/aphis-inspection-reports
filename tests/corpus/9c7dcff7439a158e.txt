2.30(a)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
REGISTRATION.
A follow up visit to the facility was conducted this morning to determine the status of the facility’s registration. The
facility representative stated that the application, as well as veterinary papers, had been sent into the USDA
Animal Care regional office at least a month ago, maybe even a month and 2 weeks ago. No USDA research
certification has been issued for this facility as of yet. The facility representative also stated, that the study was over
and that the dogs would probably be euthanized tomorrow.
This conversation was between the facility representative and the Animal Care inspector.
Registration is required so that regulatory oversight, which includes conducting inspections, can be maintained to
assure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). It is a violation of the AWA to conduct research on covered
animals without being registered.
