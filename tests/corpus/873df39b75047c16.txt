HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The alleyway of the kennel there was an accumulation of woodchip bedding, shredded paper, bags and heat
lamps. This can attract and provide living and breeding areas for vermin, rodents, insects and other pests.
Therefore, the health of 27 adult dogs and seven puppies can be affected.
Housing facilities and areas must be kept free of any accumulation of trash, discarded matter and equipment.
Equipment used in husbandry practices must be stored properly to allow for required cleaning. Housing facilities
that are kept cleaned will provide for the health of the animals with the prevention of vermin, rodents, insects and
other pests.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There were five plastic water receptacles used water the dogs. These plastic buckets were excessively chewed
along the top of the bucket. There was brown grime in these chewed areas. The back wall for four enclosures had
pieces of plastic board fasten to it. These plastic boards were chewed around the edges. There was gray grime in
these chewed areas.
These worn and excessively chewed surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Improper cleaning and
sanitization can increase the disease hazards for the 14 adult dogs.
All worn and chewed hard surfaces that come into contact with the animals must be replaced. Hard surfaces that
are not worn or chewed will allow for required cleaning and sanitization. Thus, reducing the disease potential for the
animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Several of the plastic enclosure dividers, back walls and dog doors had an accumulation of brown grime or waste
on the surface. This can increase the disease hazards for 23 adult dogs.
All surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and must have required sanitization. This is for the prevention of an
accumulation of waste on the hard surfaces and to reduce disease hazards to the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the feed storage shed, the dog food used to feed the dogs was stored on the floor next to the wall. There were
two open bags of dog food. Also, there was an uncovered bucket of corn intermingled with the open bags of dog
food. There was empty dog food bags, boxes and taxi carriers piled in and around the dog food.
All open bags of dog food and other feed must be stored in leakproof containers for the prevention of contamination
and spoilage to the dog food and vermin infestation. All bags of dog food must be stored off the floor and away
from the walls to provide for required cleaning underneath and around the supplies. This will prevent vermin
infestation. All empty dog food bags, boxes and taxi carriers must be stored in a manner for the prevention of an
infestation of vermin. Proper storage of dog feed will prevent vermin infestation, spoilage and contamination to the
feed for the 27 adult dogs and seven puppies.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Counting from the left of the doorway, enclosures three and four had sharp points protruding into the enclosures.
These points were approximately ¾ inches long and at eye level of the dogs in normal standing position. These
sharp points could injure the four adult dogs housed in these enclosures.
All enclosure must be free of sharp protruding points that could injure the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Five watering receptacles used to water 14 adult dogs had an accumulation of gray to brown grime or debris
inside the receptacles. There was bedding and an accumulation of brown grime or debris at the bottom of some of
the receptacles. This indicates these watering receptacles are not be cleaned and sanitized often enough. This
can increase the disease potential for the animals.
All feed and watering receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized more frequently for the prevention of an
accumulation of dirt, debris, grime, food waste and other disease hazards. As a result this will decrease the disease
hazards to the animals.
