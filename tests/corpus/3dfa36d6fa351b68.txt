ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Pomeranian microchip #005-008-600 continues to have problems with her teeth and right ear. The upper
teeth remain covered in a dark hard material and the dog's right ear has redeveloped a thick brown discharge that is
matted in the hair. Tooth problems can be painful and cause further health issues in dogs if not treated. The
discharge from the ear may be a sign of a problem in the ear and needs to be evaluated if it needs proper
treatment. To ensure that this dog is not in pain and receives appropriate treatment have the attending veterinarian
evaluate it to diagnose the ear and teeth problems and treat them per the veterinarian's instructions.
Documentation of the dog's diagnosis must be kept for future inspections.
