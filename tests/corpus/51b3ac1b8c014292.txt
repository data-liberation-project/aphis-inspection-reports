HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An estimated two inch gap exists between the entrance gate and wood frame in one enclosure due to
deterioration or wood rot. The gap exists along the top where the enclosure gate was originally attached to the
enclosure frame. In addition, the enclosure gate was observed to be sagging downwards. Three dogs are in

strength and integrity of all wood surfaces. This affects the ability of the enclosure to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals securely. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities are structurally sound,
must be kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely. Correct by 7/8/15.

that could cause injury.3.6(a)(2)(10)

The licensee must ensure that the flooring does not allow the feet or legs to pass through the openings in the floor.
