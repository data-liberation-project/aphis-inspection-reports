2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This was a focused inspection on the (direct) veterinary care non-compliance reported on the October 28, 2013,
inspection.
* (cid:28)Madison" a black and white female Shih Tzu ID: (# 455B4C5D57) with mats around both eyes mats were
removed.
* "Mandy", ID: (# 093093000), a female King Charles Cavalier had not been treated by a veterinarian and was
donated on 28-October-2014.
The following two dogs did not received veterinary care for the C.O.B. on Monday the 3-November-2014. These
dogs are still in need of veterinary care.
* "Wheaton Terrier" (# 442E5C4763) has an accumulation of off-white/brown/grey material completely coating and
obscuring the "cheek teeth" and molars. This material is also present in various amounts on all the other teeth in the
mouth. Gums are deep red, swollen, and extremely receded to expose obscured tooth roots. There is a creamy
white discharge along the gum line. Dental issues can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth/mouth structures,
be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally.
* "Luther", a male Wheaton Terrier (#48345B3821) has an excessively matted hair coat. The dense hair matting did
not allow for matt separation to allow for skin visualization. Excessively twisted, densely matted hair covered and
dangled off most of his body. This condition could promote and foster skin infections because of the trapped
debris/moisture and the lack of air circulation. The licensee must remove the matted hair from this dog. A program
of coat maintenance must be established and maintained to ensure that excessive hair matting does not occur.
"Luther" also has an accumulation of green/brown material completely coating and obscuring the _cheek teeth" and
molars. This material is also present in various amounts on all the other teeth in the mouth. Gums are red, swollen,
and receded to expose obscured tooth roots. Dental issues can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth/ mouth
structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally.Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
