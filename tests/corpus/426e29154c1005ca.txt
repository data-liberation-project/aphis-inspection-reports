Handling of animals.
On the morning of 11/19/2022, two tiger cubs (Khan and Nina, DOB Aug 2022) were found dead in the enclosure. The
licensee said early that morning up to 6" of heavy slush/snow had fallen and covered the entire enclosure and pond,
making it difficult to distinguish the pond's borders in the landscape. The licensee reported all four cubs and tiger mother
were observed to be fine early that morning, but shortly after observed abnormal behavior from the mother and he went
over to the den and found a dead cub, possibly moved there by the mother. Once the mother tiger was secured, he went
down to the pond and removed a cub from the water, but it was also deceased. He said he called the AV and that over
the phone the AV presumably thought hypothermic shock that led to drowning was the cause of death. The climatic
conditions that morning were likely a role in the tiger cubs' death. If climatic conditions create a threat to an animal's well-
being, appropriate action must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions, such as preventing access to water
features that can become unsafe in winter.
The facility reported this incident to the USDA on 11/20/2022 and took immediate corrective action for the mother and
remaining 2 cubs by preventing their access to the pond.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are maintained to protect animals from unsafe conditions created by weather
conditions.
