ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female boxer "Star" has a tick over her right eye and a large, engorged tick on the right side of her neck near her
collar. The facility representative had not noticed the ticks and did not know the last time the dog had received the
treatment/preventative for ticks that is approved in the Program of Veterinary Care. Ticks can harbor and transfer
diseases which could be detrimental to the health of the dogs.
The licensee must treat this dog for ticks with the treatment/preventative that is approved by the attending
veterinarian in the Program of Veterinary Care. The licensee must ensure that the dogs remain free of ticks and
other pests at all times in order to promote their health and well-being.
