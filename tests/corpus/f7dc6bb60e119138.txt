ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Barney, an approximately 1 year old bear cub, was observed with large patches of hair loss around his neck and
half way down both the right and left sides of his body. During this inspection this cub was also observed to be
continually scratching himself.
According to the owner, Barney has been seen by the attending veterinarian and skin scrapings were performed.
Results and recommendations were made however, there is no documentation available to verify this information.
The APHIS official spoke with the attending veterinarian and was informed that the cub was seen and treated back
in November 2014. At that time, the patch of hair loss was small. As of the January 30, 2015 inspection, the hair
loss has increased and the bare patches are much larger. The significant amount of hair loss and scratching, since
November 2014, indicates that direct and frequent communication on the cub's condition has not been conveyed to
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner.
Barney must be seen by the attending veterinarian to determine the underlying reason(s) for the hair loss and
itchiness. Additionally, records of animal health, treatments and recommendations should be maintained.
