INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The two active protocols did not have written approval notification from the IACUC available at the time of
inspection. The records reviewed included an approval page that was blank for both protocols, and the facility was
not able to find a copy of the written notification to the principal investigator. These protocols had subsequent
amendments that were approved in April of 2019 with a new principal investigator listed, and the IACUC
deliberations included discussion of a protocol rewrite with a new PI that has not been completed or approved in
writing at the time of inspection. There has been covered animal activity on this protocol in the interim.
The approval letter serves to notify the principal investigators that their protocol was approved and that activities
related to the care and use of animals may begin. Correct by notifying the principal investigators in writing of the
decision to approve or withhold approval of the activities or of modifications required to secure approval.
Correct before animals are utilized on the new protocol, or 30 November, 2019 whichever comes first.
2.33(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are required to be
communicated to the attending veterinarian. During inspection, four guinea pigs (A83, B28, B32 B35), had
significant areas of fur loss, scabbing and skin injuries consistent with bite wounds on the caudal half of their bodies
in two all male enclosures. According to the facility records, July 12th was the last time the veterinarian had treated
any guinea pigs for bite wounds.
Following inspection, the attending veterinarian communicated that she had walked through the facility monthly, but
that any wounds should have been reported to her immediately, in accordance with the facility Guinea Pig Care and
Health Protocol.

SANITATION.
This facility is not sanitizing primary enclosures every 2 weeks as required. The room activity checklist maintained
by the registrant documented that bedding is being changed twice a week while disinfecting kennels as well as food
and water bowls should be completed monthly.
Failure to sanitize surfaces in contact with the animals in a manner provided in Section 3.31(a)(4) may expose the
guinea pigs to disease hazards. Facility must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the animals are sanitized at
least once every 2 weeks.

CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
There is a compatibility issue in Cages 20 & 25 where there are 8 males in each pen and 2-3 male guinea pigs in
each enclosure have significant fur loss and open wounds or scabs over the caudal half of their bodies. While the
enclosures do appear large enough for the number of animals, there are some animals that are aggressively
injuring other animals in the pens and are not compatible.
It is important that all animals are put in compatible groups in order to prevent stress fighting or injuries caused by
aggressive animals. Any aggressive animals should be removed from the group living or put in conditions where
there is no risk of injury to the other regulated animals. The facility SOP on behavior says "If two animals simply
refuse to get along, you may have to house them separately in order to keep the peace"
The registrant must ensure that the guinea pigs are housed together in compatible groups and do not cause
harm to one another, such as fur loss or bite injuries.
