HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Since June, 2013 there have been new managers in charge of animal care at the facility and there have been
numerous
deaths of animals in their care. The list includes one ringtail lemur, 1 bobcat kitten, 2 adult watusi, 2 cavy, 1 fox, one
peacock, one Chinese pheasant and two fallow deer. Two Whitetailed deer fawns were recently acquired. The
caretakers have no experience bottle raising these animals. The managers husband stated that the technician that
was
hired this spring was represented as having wild and exotic animal experience, but they found out she had only
worked at a dog kennel, which is also the only experience that the manager and the managers husband have had
with animals. Since the previous inspection a rabbit has had a back injury due to poor handling.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain.
The managers must gain the appropriate knowledge and experience of any species of animal prior to acquiring the
animal or hire someone with the proper knowledge and experience with the species involved.
