ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:55am on
27-Jun-18.
I arrived at the facility at 11:55am. I first knocked on the door and rang the door bell with no answer. I then went
across the street and called out to see if anyone was available at the barn with no answer. I called both numbers
listed twice with no answer, the phone numbers did not not have voicemail capabilities set up. I stayed at the facility
till 12:30pm and then left.
