RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS forms 7005 maintained by the facility are incomplete. Also, cage cards are not being utilized by the
facility as the cats are raised in the home environment. Four litters have been born since the last inspection but
none have been recorded on the APHIS Forms 7005. It is difficult to determine what animals have been born, sold,
or died without accurate, up to date records. Accurate records are needed to trace animals in the event of a
disease outbreak. APHIS forms 7005 shall be used to make, keep, and maintain the required information.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The carpet is worn in two places. Between the living room and the family room and between the bedroom and the
hallway the carpet has been worn and torn away exposing the subfloor. The frayed, unraveled edges pose a health
hazard for the cats if ingested. Housing facilities must be kept in good repair.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Litter stored in the garage is in contact with the cement floor. At the previous inspection, this was presented as a
teachable moment and has been uncorrected. Supplies stored on the floor are prone to contamination from
moisture and pests. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls.

and other organic material. Licensee stated the garage portion of the enclosure has not been cleaned or sanitized
for about a month. Used litter and organic material creates an environment for pests and is a disease hazard.
