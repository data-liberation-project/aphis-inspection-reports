ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female West Highland approximately 10 years old named Lucy Lynn (Tag # 165) had two separate vet care
issues that had not been addressed by the Attending Veterinarian. The dog somehow got a cut/open wound just
underneath her right eye a couple of weeks ago. The licensee observed the cut and has been treating it with
Terramycin since then. However, this treatment is not authorized by the Program of Veterinary Care and the
Attending Veterinarian has not been consulted with in regards to the eye. In addition, the dog has a series of
bumps covering its back. The licensee has been treating the back with Blukote since 2/5/18, but the Blukote is also
not authorized in the Program of Veterinary Care and the Attending Veterinarian has also not been consulted with in
regards to the back.
Using medications without consulting the Veterinarian on what should be done may result in the treatment being
ineffective or it could possibly even cause the condition to worsen. A cut/open wound not treated properly can
become infected and lead to systemic infection. The series of bumps on the back can be caused by a variety of
factors including parasites, skin infections, or some other kind of condition. Not treating the back properly could
potentially lead to an outbreak amongst the other dogs if the condition is contagious. The bumps on the back may
be irritating or painful to the dog. In addition the back could potentially become infected and worsen if not treated
properly.
The Attending Veterinarian must be consulted with in regards to both of these issues. The dog should be treated
per his/her instructions. Correct by 2/28/18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
