2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult, male Dachshund named "Basil" in the outdoor facility could not use either of his back legs to walk. He was
pulling himself across the ground with his front legs while dragging both back legs. The licensee picked the dog up and
placed him in a sitting position. He was able to maintain the sitting position but would not attempt to move when verbally
encouraged. The licensee was not aware of the dog's condition until the inspector pointed out the problem. Daily
observation is necessary to detect injuries and disease in the dogs so that they can receive appropriate veterinary care.
The licensee must conduct daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being. The licensee must have
this dog examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis, must follow the treatment recommendations, and must maintain a
written medical record for inspection.
TO BE CORRECTED BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JANUARY 27, 2023. NOTE: The inspection was stopped so that
the licensee could contact a veterinarian.
2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
The licensee is not properly identifying puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Thirty-one puppies did not have any form
of identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory,


disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must properly identify puppies with an acceptable
form of identification, which include a cage card (if litters are not comingled), a microchip, a collar and tag, or a plastic-
type collar with the required information legibly written.

3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Three enclosures containing a total of 12 dogs had shelters with essentially no bedding. One pen with 3 dogs had 4
shelters; a second pen with 4 dogs had 4 shelters; and a third pen with 5 dogs had 4 shelters. The shelters contained
varying amounts of gravel inside and a very small amount, if any, of straw for bedding. The ambient temperature during
the inspection was 33.9 degrees F. Inadequate bedding can result in discomfort, stress, and increased incidence of
disease. The licensee must ensure that shelters contain clean, dry bedding material when the ambient temperature is
below 50 degrees F and must provide additional clean, dry bedding when the ambient temperature is 35 degrees F or
lower.

3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A large amount of mouse feces was present on a wash-down in the whelping building, including on a lid of a feed
receptacle. The inspector observed a live mouse inside the whelping building during the inspection. Mice can
contaminate feed and transmit diseases that affect dogs. The licensee must establish an effective program for the control
of pests to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.
TO BE CORRECTED BY FEBRUARY 27, 2023.
