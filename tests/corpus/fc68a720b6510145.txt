*Two Schnauzer puppies had been born the day before the inspection. At the time of the inspection one puppy was
dead and the other puppy appeared to be dying as evidenced by lack of normal movement, thin appearance, and
an inability to right itself. The enclosure had a piece of carpeting in it but the puppy was lying on the expanded
metal portion of the floor when the inspectors first approached (a kennel assistant moved the puppy to the carpet
when its condition was noticed). No additional heat source, such as a heat lamp, was being provided. The kennel
assistant stated that both puppies had been alive earlier that day, but she did not know whether the dam had milk,
whether the puppies had ever nursed, and whether the facility had heat lamps or where they would be located.
*Five weaned Pug puppies were huddled on top of each other in the corner of the inside portion of an enclosure.
This litter of puppies was recovering from a respiratory problem. The kennel assistant was unaware that this
behavior could indicate that the puppies were cold. She did not know whether the facility had heat lamps or where
they would be located.
Inadequate training of employees on proper care and handling can compromise the health of the animals. Thelicensee must ensure that all kennel employees have adequate training on the care and handling of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements (2)(x)
There were two sets of young puppies housed on the left side of the whelping facility in enclosures that had flooring
with large enough openings that their feet and legs could pass through. There were two Schnauzer puppies that
were less than 24 hours old in an enclosure with their dam. The licensee had provided a mat for the puppies to lay
on, however, one of the puppies was no longer on the mat and was laying on tenderfoot flooring that has large
enough opening that it's feet and legs can pass through.
There was also a 1 week old Dachshund housed with its dam that was laying on carpet squares that covered the
majority of the enclosure. However, there was approximately a 4 inch strip along the side of the mat that exposed
tenderfoot flooring with opening large enough that the puppy@?>s ?>As feet and legs could pass through. There
was no barrier to prevent the puppy from moving the the uncovered area of flooring. Young animals that are not
provided adequate support can result in an inability to learn a proper gait and has the potential to cause injury. The
licensee shall provide enclosures that have flooring that does not allow the feet or legs of the animals to pass
through any openings of the floor.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
