FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Although the work of the perimeter fence is very advanced there are still 2 pens with 4 animals that do not have a
perimeter fence.
The licensee must construct a perimeter fence of the appropriate materials at least 8 feet tall for the potentially
dangerous animals for example lions, cougars, and wolves, and at least 6 feet tall for all others animals for example
bobcat, deer ,coyotes, and boars.
The perimeter fence also must be maintained in functional condition so that it prevents unauthorized persons and
animals from going through it, and also must function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility.
