ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-A wallaby had overgrown toenails on both hind feet. Failure to appropriately maintain toenails can cause gait
abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility(cid:25)'s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate care of toenails or hooves in a timely manner.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
-The floor of a doghouse in an outdoor dog enclosure for (cid:28)Piggy(cid:29) and (cid:28)Dirt(cid:29) contained worn and frayed carpeting with
several, long strings.
-The outdoor part of a sheltered enclosure for cats contained worn, frayed sections of an elevated, carpeted perch.
Also a small section of carpet at the end of the cat perch has become detached exposing the points of wire staples.
Carpeting which has become worn or frayed poses the risk of string, foreign body ingestion and potential blockage
of the digestive tract of these animals. Also, sharp points or edges located within direct contact of the animals may
cause injury. Primary enclosures for dogs and cats must be constructed, kept in good repair, and maintained in
order to protect the animals from injury and to ensure their health and well-being.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The entrance opening of the nest box for two baboons, Stingy and Tabatha, had heavily worn roughened surfaces
with exposed raw wood as well as a large hole/opening just inside the nest box.
Surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized such as unsealed, raw wood are porous and can trapdebris, bacteria, or other harmful organisms that may contaminate the animals and pose a disease or health risk.
Also, openings/ gaps from worn, broken or missing boards inside the nest box could lead to injury to the animals.
The surfaces of housing facilities-including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures or objects within the facility-must be safely constructed in a manner to protect the welfare of the animals and
made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned, sanitized, and maintained on a regular basis or removed or
replaced when worn or soiled.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Camel enclosure: The corrugated metal siding of a shelter structure had a bent area and small opening with sharp,
jagged points/edges in the middle section. There was also an area of bent metal with sharp points and edges
adjacent to a support pole.
-Tiger enclosure: There were at least two metal nails protruding from an elevated, wooden platform. The location
of the nails within the enclosure allows for direct contact of these sharp, protruding edges by the animals.
- Sections of chain link fencing of several enclosures housing multiple animals including hoof stock and domestic
species at this facility had gaps or open spaces where the bottom of the fences meets the ground. Facility
representative stated that the weather/conditions of this climate create the need to periodically build up the dirt in
these areas due to erosion. Openings or gaps in enclosure fencing poses the risk of an animal getting parts of their
body caught, trapped or injured.
-Wallaby enclosure: The metal siding of a shelter structure has become unfastened from its support poles leaving a
large opening and exposing the metal edges and protruding, sharp points within direct contact of the animals.
All animal enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges and gaps/openings in
order to protect the animals from injury and to safely contain them. A system of timely identification, facility repair
and maintenance must be in place.
