There is not an appropriate shelter in the pasture containing the bison and watusi. A structure comprised of only
four posts and a roof without walls is present in the pasture. Additionally, a single tree is present on the pasture.
Neither the structure or the tree provide adequate protection from inclement weather for the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Five enclosures contained excessive amounts of mud and/or standing water.
The enclosure containing the white tiger had standing water around the entire perimeter. The remaining ground in
the enclosure was saturated with mud. The tiger had mud coating all four of its limbs, its abdomen, and its chest.
The enclosure containing two raccoons (Bonnie and Clyde) had excessive, thick mud and areas of standing water. The animals must walk through the mud to gain access to their water receptacle.
The ground in the enclosure containing the two lions was completely covered in mud with several areas of standing
water. Tractor tires inside of the enclosure provided the only dry areas for the animals.
The ground in the enclosure containing the orange tiger contained excessive mud with areas of standing water.
The tiger must walk through the mud to gain access to its water and feeding area.
The ground of the enclosure containing the brown pig was completely covered in mud with a large area of standing
water. The pig must walk through mud to gain access to its food and water receptacles.
Excessive mud and standing water inside of the animal enclosures is a potential health hazard to the animals.
Ensure every animal enclosure has appropriate provisions in place to rapidly eliminate excess water.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The southwest perimeter fence of the facility is only 4 feet in height. The fence is constructed of woven wire pasture
fencing. The facility received a perimeter fence variance in 2008, but has since acquired a white tiger, bobcat, and
hyena. These animals are housed behind a public barrier, but in the same vicinity of the of the 4 foot high perimeter
fence. Animals such as tigers and hyenas must have an 8 foot high (6 foot high for bobcats) perimeter fence
surrounding their enclosures. The perimeter fence must also be at least 3 feet away from their primary enclosures.
Perimeter fencing is necessary to act as a secondary barrier to prevent unauthorized persons and wild animals from
contacting the facility animals.
Assure all animals have the proper perimeter fencing around their enclosures.

beneath the shelf housing bags of unopened food. The facility has an audible signal that is meant to deter rodentsin the shed, however; a facility employee indicated that the method was ineffective. There are no other provisions in
place to control the mouse population.
Mice can carry and spread diseases that affect animals.
Implement and maintain a pest control program to control the mouse population in the food shed.
