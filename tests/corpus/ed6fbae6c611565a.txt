ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****An adult Olde English Bulldog (Mildred m/c# 033-810-365 ) had areas of reddened skin and hair loss on her
loin,tail, hips, legs, and inside the lower right hind leg. The licensee stated that she had treated the dog with an
antibiotic and the condition improved, but then returned when she stopped the medication. The licensee had not
consulted a veterinarian about the condition. Skin conditions that reoccur when treatment is stopped can worsen,
can be painful, and may be contagious to other dogs in the kennel. The licensee must have this dog examined by a
veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The licensee must keep records of the diagnosis, treatment,
and follow-up care and must make these records available to the inspector upon request.
****An adult female Boxer (Shades, m/c # 0A02130730) was thin, with the ribs easily observed. While her coat had
a shine to it and she was very active, her thin condition could indicate a problem that could worsen without
treatment. The dog must be examined by a veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The licensee
must keep records of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care and must make these records available to the
inspector upon request.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Sharp points
A primary enclosure, housing one adult English Bulldog, was constructed of chain link fencing that had been
compromised on one side with chain link being torn, causing loose wires and a sharp point. Sharp points can injure
the dog as it moves about. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained so that they
protect the animals from injury. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp
points that could injure the dogs. This was corrected during the inspection.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS DAY FORWARD3.6(a)(2)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Protect the dogs from injury.
****A primary enclosure, housing one adult English Bulldog, was constructed of chain link fencing that had been
compromised on one side, approximately 12'-14" from the ground level. This resulted in a hole at a height and large
enough for the dog to stick its head through. The dog pushed its head through the holes in the chain link fence
several times during the inspection. Holes this size in the fencing can result in injury and/or entrapment. The
licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained so that they protect the animals from injury.
3.6(a)(2)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Contain the dogs securely;
****In the outdoor chain link enclosures an Olde English Bulldog was able to escape from her enclosure due to a
gap in the gate. The locking mechanism did not make enough contact with the frame to hold the gate securely
closed. When dogs escape they could become injured or be in contact with other animals. The owner must repair
or replace the gate to ensure that the enclosures contain the dogs securely.
