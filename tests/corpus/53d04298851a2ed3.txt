ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 1:00 PM on 4/22/14 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee was preparing to leave
for an appointment off-site and would not be returning to the premises for several hours. An AWA compliance
inspection could not be conducted because there was no other responsible adult facility representative available to
accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 4/23/14.
