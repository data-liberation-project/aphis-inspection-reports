FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The following areas have an accumulation of mud.
1) The enclosure housing 3 llamas and 7 goats has a large muddy area between the shelter and the enclosure
fence for the camels.

2) The enclosure housing 18 sheep, 7 goats, 2 yak, a cow with her calf and equine has large puddles of water and
very muddy areas in the front area by the water receptacles, a shelter and where the hay is fed.
3) The enclosure housing 3 cattle, 4 sheep and equine has large puddles of water and muddy areas by the water
receptacles.
Animals should not have to walk through mud/water to get to food, drinking water and/or shelter. Walking through
mud and water may cause hoof problems such as foot rot. As the weather gets warmer the mud and water may
attract insects that may bite the animals and/or bother the animals. Insects may carry diseases that can be
transmitted to animals. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent muddy
conditions and to protect the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by April 7, 2016.
