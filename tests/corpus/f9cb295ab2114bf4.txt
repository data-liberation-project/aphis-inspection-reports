3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
There are two holes dug under the perimeter fence, one in the southwest corner and one along the west hoof run.
An insufficient perimeter fence can allow unwanted animals to enter the facility and potentially harm the animals within.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 11 MARCH 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
