3.13(a)(3) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
(a)(3) Vaccinations for contagious and/or deadly diseases of dogs (including rabies, parvovirus and distemper) and
sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm) in
accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian, unless otherwise required by a research protocol
approved by the Committee at research facilities;

According to the written Program of Veterinary Care, that was again made available to the APHIS offifcials, the attending
veterinarian for the wolf hybrids and coydogs are to receive vaccinations for parvovirus but the owner declined to have
this vaccine provided. Additional vaccines for leptospirosis, hepatitis and Bordetella were suggested but were also
declined by the owner. The attending veterinarian also recommended annual fecal sampling to test for intestinal parasites
but this was also declined. The facility is still not following the veterinary care plan that the attending veterinarian feels is
appropriate for the wolf hybrid and coydogs. Lack of the required vaccines will potentially affect the health of the wolf
hybrids and coydogs. The program of veterinary care must be updated and followed according to the attending
veterinarian's reccommendations.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and facility representative.
