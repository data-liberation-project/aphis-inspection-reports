FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is approximately an 8-12 inch long x 1x1inch square metal pipe that is sticking out into the enclosure at
approximately 4.5-5feet off the ground. This pipe did support a wooden surface used by the big cats to rest on
however, the boards have been removed but the metal framing is still in place. Because the pipe end protrudes into
the enclosure up to 8-12 inches and is not covered with the boards, it is possible the ligers could jump up or stand
up and injure themselves. There are 2 adult ligers in this enclosure
In 2 enclosures (Taliger and tiger/lion) there is a door that can be used to isolate the animals on one side or the
other of the primary enclosure. In both enclosure the wooden doors are 'freely moving' and not secured open or
closed.
Protruding objects inside enclosures can cause injuries to the regulated animals. The un-secured doors could
trap/catch the animals in the doorway and cause possible injury, especially in the enclosure with 2 animals.The licensee must repair or remove the protruding object, and secure the doors either open or closed.
To correct by: The licensee removed the section of pipe and secured the doors before the inspectors left the facility.
