Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During this inspection, the following animals and conditions were observed:

- In the 5th pen of stack 8A, there is a brown, tan, and white guinea pig with hair loss near it’s right eye.
- In the bottom pen of stack 8A, there are 3 dead juvenile guinea pigs that have been partially cannibalized by the other
guinea pigs in the enclosure.
- In the bottom pen of stack 8A, there is a dead adult guinea pig.
- In the 4th pen of stack 5A, there is a tan and white guinea pig with hair loss and moderate ulceration near the right eye.
- Also in the 4th pen of stack 5A, there is a brown and tan guinea pig with hair loss and ulceration near the right eye.
- In the 2nd pen of stack 3A, there is a tan and white guinea pig with hair loss on it’s nose.
- In the bottom enclosure of stack 2A, there is a decaying carcass of an adult guinea pig.
- Also in the bottom pen of stack 2A, there is a light brown and white guinea pig with hair loss, crusting skin, and mild
ulceration near it’s right eye.
- In the top pen of stack 1A, there is a brown, white, and tan guinea pig with hair loss, crusting skin, and mild ulceration
around both eyes.


- Also in the top pen of stack 1A, there is a black, brown, and white guinea pig with hair loss and moderate ulceration near
it’s left eye and extending over it’s nose.
- In the 4th pen of stack 4B, there is a brown, tan, and white guinea pig with a markedly swollen left eye surrounded by
moderate hair loss, ulceration, and crusting skin.
- In the top pen of stack 3B, there is a black, tan, and white guinea pig with marked hair loss, crusting skin, and ulceration
around it’s right eye.
- In the bottom pen of stack 3B, there is a dead adult guinea pig.
- Also in the bottom pen of stack 3B, there is a brown, tan, and white guinea pig with marked hair loss, crusting skin, and
ulceration around it’s right eye.
- In the 5th pen of stack 1B, there are two dead juvenile guinea pigs that have been partially cannibalized by the other
guinea pigs in the enclosure.

All of these animals were still in their original enclosures at the time of inspection and had not been identified by the
licensee. Animals with missing hair were not separated as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care and treated with
Miconazole Nitrate. Animals with ulcerations and the animal with the swollen left eye were also not identified, segregated,
or discussed with the Attending Veterinarian.

The licensee was also asked about the animals identified on the USDA Inspection Report dated December 8, 2021. The
licensee stated that the Attending Veterinarian did visit on December 22, 2021 but the licensee only asked about the
following two animals:



- The tan and white guinea pig with a right-sided head tilt (originally in the 4th pen of stack 2B) was examined by the
Attending Veterinarian and antibiotics were prescribed. However, the Attending Veterinarian states that she instructed the
licensee to separate the animal and add the antibiotics to the water. At the time of inspection, this animal was still in the
4th pen of stack 2B and had not yet received any treatment by the licensee as the water source in this pen is not treated.
When the licensee was asked about the plan for treatment of the animal, he showed that the botte of antibiotics was still
unopened (sealed) and he was unsure how to administer it even though instructions for adding to the water are included
in the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal still displays a right-sided head tilt.
- The Attending Veterinarian was asked to euthanize a guinea pig with severe ringworm. Records at the facility and a
discussion with the Attending Veterinarian describe that it was a tri-colored male approximately three months of age. The
licensee stated that this animal was noted on the last inspection report as being the animal in the top enclosure of stack
5A with a left eye that was sealed shut with crusting green mucous and missing hair around it’s right eye and back. When
the Attending Veterinarian was shown a photo of this guinea pig, she could not confirm that this was the animal that was
euthanized but did not recall any issues with the eyes.

When the licensee was asked about the other animals included on the last inspection report, many of whom had
ulceration present with hair loss, he stated that they were all treated with the Miconazole Nitrate spray and returned to
their enclosures as all of the lesions had cleared up. Only one guinea pig, listed on the last inspection report as having
missing hair on it’s back and nose (initially in the 3rd pen of stack 5A and found in the same pen today) was located as it
still has hair loss on it’s face and back. None of the other animals identified on the last inspection report were located
today, despite the licensee’s statements that all recovered with treatment and were returned to their enclosures.



Finally, the licensee stated that a guinea pig listed on the last inspection report (top pen of stack 3A, tan and white guinea
pig with a left eye that was discolored yellow/green/white with a red border and thick, green mucous) was not seen by the
Attending Veterinarian as the eye resolved on it’s own without treatment and the guinea pig was returned to the pens. The
Attending Veterinarian confirmed that she did not see this animal and does not fit the description of the animal she
euthanized yesterday. When shown a picture of the eye, the Attending Veterinarian did not believe that this condition
would clear up on it’s own without treatment.

A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the Attending Veterinarian can result in delay of
care, worsening of health issues, and further spread of disease. Instructions provided by the Attending Veterinarian must
be followed to prevent further pain and distress to the animals as well as limiting the spread of disease.

Correct by having the Attending Veterinarian exam all animals listed in this Inspection Report, observing all animals on a
daily basis, and following the instructions provided by the Attending Veterinarian, either given verbally or stated in the
Program of Veterinary Care, including the segregation of animals requiring antibiotics for a head tilt and topical
medications for hair loss.
3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
At least five guinea pigs were observed to be loose within the building housing the guinea pigs. One of these guinea pigs
was a nursing juvenile that, when caught, had to be placed in a pen with other nursing juveniles in hopes that a lactating
female would continue feeding it as the licensee did not know where the mother was or how to catch it.
Enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair so as to contain the animals and protect them from


injury. Loose guinea pigs are susceptible to injury and even death. Correct by ensuring guinea pig enclosures properly
contain the animals and capturing the animals already loose.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
