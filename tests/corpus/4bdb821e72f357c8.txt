3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least two enclosures had wire points and loose wire mesh that the rabbits could come into contact with. Loose
mesh and wire points could possibly injure the rabbits. Surfaces that rabbits come into contact with must be
maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from possible injury.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Six enclosures were over-crowded with rabbits. Each rabbit in these six enclosures was estimated to weigh less
than 4.4 lbs. Weaned rabbits that weigh less than 4.4 lbs are required to have a minimum of 1.5 square feet of floor
space per rabbit
--Five enclosures were measured to have 5.8 square feet of floor space, which provides the minimum floor space
for 3 weaned rabbits that each weigh less than 4.4 lbs. Two of these enclosures contained 4 rabbits, two
enclosures had 5 rabbits, and one enclosure contained 6 rabbits.
--Another enclosure was measured to have 8.3 square feet of floor space, which provides the minimum floor space
for 5 weaned rabbits that each weigh less than 4.4 lbs. This enclosure contained 7 rabbits.
Over-crowding animals can cause them to get sick easier and does not provide for their wellbeing. To protect
animal health and provide for their wellbeing, rabbits must be provided at least the minimum amount of floor space.
3.56(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.

Excessive build-up of excreta can cause rabbits to get sick and does not provide for their wellbeing. Routinely clean
rabbit enclosures to prevent a build-up of excreta. Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
