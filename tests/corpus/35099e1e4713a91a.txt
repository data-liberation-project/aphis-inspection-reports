ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* An black and white, female, Shih-Tzu born on 5/26/06 and identified by (#081-575-354) and 'Confetti Cowgirl' has
a thick buildup of tarter covering the surface of its canine, front and cheek teeth. The layer of tarter coating the
affected teeth has a dark brown appearance. There are also areas of reddened gums and gum recession along the
top of the cheek teeth.
The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures, be painful and
harm the health of the animal.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. Additionally, the licensee needs to consult the attending veterinarian to develop and follow a dental
maintenance plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
