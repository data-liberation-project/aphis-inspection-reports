FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosure for 2 female pigmy goats located next to the barn outside was found to be inadequate. The
primary enclosure consisted of metal wire cattle fencing that were held together by plastic zip ties around metal
stakes in the ground. In one section of the fence only one plastic zip tie, a couple inches from the ground, was used
to fasten the 4 foot high cattle fence to a metal stake. This allowed the top 75% of the fence to be easily
manipulated to create a gap several feet wide at the top and middle of the fence. Additionally, there were several
areas in the fence line that were misshaped and bending outwards from the enclosure. It was mentioned by staff
that coyotes have been seen on the outside of the perimeter fence. The primary enclosure is not structurally sound
and does not adequately contain the animals. Furthermore, the goats could easily become trapped inside the gap in
the fence, or wild predators could gain access to the goats. The primary enclosure must be structurally sound,
protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals.
Corrected at time of Inspection
The inspection was conducted with Animal Care staff and the Exit interview was conducted with the Associate
Director.
