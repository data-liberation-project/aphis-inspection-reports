2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are no records of the current number of guinea pigs on hand at the facility. Records containing the required
information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals held, owned, acquired or disposed of are
necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care. Failure to
maintain records can make it difficult to identify animal losses which could indicate disease in the animals. The licensee
must maintain records which disclose the number of animals held, owned, acquired, or disposed of.

Watering.
A majority of the 36 primary enclosures had open water bowls which were contaminated with fecal material and bedding.
Failure to clean water containers and provide potable water can lead to the spread of disease and create a reluctance to
drink. Open containers used for dispensing water to guinea pigs shall be placed in or attached to the primary enclosure
as to minimize contamination from excreta. The water receptacles must be cleaned, sanitized, and maintained in a way
which will minimize contamination with feces and bedding.

3.31(b)

Sanitation.
There is a build-up of dirt, dust, and cobwebs on the walls and ceiling of the guinea pig housing area. Failure to clean
animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the animals by spreading disease and can potentially attract
pests. The facility must maintain the premise by keeping it clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from
injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
