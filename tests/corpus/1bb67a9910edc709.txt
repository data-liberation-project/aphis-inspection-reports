-Dexmedetomidine, with an expiration date of October 2016, was used in November 2016 on covered animals
according to the controlled drug log.

research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the alpaca and goat enclosures, there were sharp points that have the potential to cause injury to the animals.
The goat pen had chicken wire with exposed or damaged ends, exposing sharp points to the animals. The alpaca
pen had fencing that was no longer secure along the bottom and creates a hazard.
Animal enclosures should be free of objects that could cause injury to the animals and maintained in good repair. A
system of maintenance should be in place to ensure that areas of the enclosure that could pose a hazard are
identified and repaired.
