2.31(c)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility’s IACUC has not reviewed the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals,
inspected all of the animal facilities, or prepared and submitted reports of these evaluations to the Institutional
Official (I.O.) in the last six months. The last program review and facility inspection by the IACUC was performed in
January of 2016. An evaluation of the research facility's animal use program and an inspection of all the animal
facilities is necessary to ensure adherence to the Act. The results of these evaluations must be reported to the I.O.
to keep them informed of the nature and extent of the facility's adherence to the Act.
The IACUC shall review the facility's program for humane care and use of animals, inspect all the animal facilities,
and prepare and submit reports of these evaluations to the I.O. at least once every six months.
To be corrected from this day forward
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
