2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee failed to adequately inform Animal Care of movement of their animals to a new location while continuing to
exhibit at the new site without obtaining approval. On March 09, 2022, the licensee notified Animal Care that the facility
and animals were going to move to a new site by March 21, 2022. The licensee then continued to exhibit the animals at
the new location which had not been inspected and approved for regulated activity. Providing address changes with
adequate notice allows Animal Care to approve all new sites prior to being used for regulated activity. Licenses are issued
to specific persons, and are issued for specific activities, types and numbers of animals, and approved sites. Licensees
are required to notify Animal Care no fewer than 90 days before any change in the name, address, substantial control or
ownership of his business or operation, locations, activities, number or type of animals and only approved sites may
conduct licensed regulated activity.
2.126(c)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee is exhibiting and traveling with their animals without submitting an itinerary to the Deputy Administrator. The
most recent exhibition travel occurred with a cat named “Larry” to Tennessee in September of 2021. No itinerary was
submitted prior to overnight travel. Providing a traveling itinerary allows for unannounced inspections by Animal Care


inspectors to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee must submit an itinerary to Animal Care no
fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever the animals will be exhibited at a location other than the approved site
and whenever travel extends overnight. The itinerary shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the approved site.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence was not a sufficient distance from the rear side of seven outdoor primary enclosures housing
animals. Six outdoor primary enclosures, individually housing a ground hog, 3 foxes, and 2 raccoons were located 30 to
31 inches from the perimeter fence. Then, further down the same side of the perimeter fence, a singly housed coyote’s
outdoor primary enclosure was only 34 inches from the perimeter fence. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high (for
non-dangerous species) as well as a minimum of 3 feet away from the primary enclosures is needed. Perimeter fencing is
necessary to keep unwanted species of animals and humans out, as well as serve as a secondary containment. The
facility shall ensure the primary enclosures for the non-dangerous species listed above, are enclosed by an appropriate
perimeter fence, or a variance, if appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be requested from the Administrator/Regional
Office.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection or by JANUARY 6, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
