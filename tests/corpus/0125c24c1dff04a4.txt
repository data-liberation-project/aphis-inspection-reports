3.9(b)
FEEDING.
Several of the self feeders had areas of rust or appeared not to have been sanitized recently. One male dog was
observed urinating on the corner of one of the feeders contaminating the food in the bowl.
Rust cannot be sanitized in accordance with the requirements in Sec 3.11(b)(3). Those feeders with areas of rust
must be repaired or replaced so that they can be adequately sanitized. Food receptacles must be located so as to
minimize contamination. Some method of preventing the food from becoming contaminated with urine needs to be
implemented.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several of the dog shelters had wet, smelly hay under their dry bedding hay. The hay bedding should be checked
daily and changed whenever necessary to prevent soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease and odors.
