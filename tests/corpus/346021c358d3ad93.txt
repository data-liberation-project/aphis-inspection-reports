ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several animals were noted in need of veterinary attention and one animal death was discussed:
*One adult female zebra with her young zebra in the drive through portion of the facility was noted with bright red
fresh blood leaking from a small opening under her right eye. Dried blood was noted forming a line/tract down the
right side of her face from this opening to the corner of her mouth. In addition, a large gelatinous bloody clump of
discharge was noted hanging from the opening to her right nostril. Around the rim/edge of the right nostril was noted
dried dark black crusty material.
*One black and white goat has a 3/8 in round lesion on the top left side of its nose. The center 1/4in diameter
portion is raised and dark red in color. The encircling 1/8in wide band around this red center is flat and light grey in
color. There is some brown black dried material at the lower corner of the left nostril.
*One female lemur with a short tail (she had lost part of the tail to frostbite last winter) was noted sitting outside in
her sheltered enclosure holding her tail. She looked at the tail frequently and occasionally was noted licking at it.
This is not her normal behavior.
*The caretaker who feeds and waters the animals was asked by the inspectors about a baby oryx that is not at the
facility during today(cid:25)'s inspection. The caretaker responded that it had died-was found dead in its shelter one
morning this past fall. She stated that the oryx had been losing weight before its death and that she had tried
deworming it a couple of times. When asked if the veterinarian had been out to see this oryx or been called about it,
she responded no.
Review of records available and conversations with staff, a veterinarian has not been contacted about the zebra, the
goat or the lemur. A veterinarian needs to be consulted to ensure the use of appropriate methods to diagnose and
treat diseases and injuries. The facility shall contact their veterinarian in order to have the zebra, the goat and the
lemur examined for diagnosis and treatment.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The inspectors pointed out three animals with veterinary care issues (zebra, goat, and lemur) to staff during this
inspection. Conversation with staff about these animals elicited the information that the staff was unaware of theseissues. The staff stated that they look at animals while feeding and watering but there is no one dedicating time
specifically to observing the animals on a daily basis. Since these issues are not being observed and identified, the
attending veterinarian has not been notified of the issues. There also appears to be an issue with which staff
member has responsibility for communicating with the veterinarian. Different staff members and the owner gave the
inspectors inconsistent answers to the question of who at the facility is responsible for contacting the veterinarian.
Lack of adequate daily observation and direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian will lead to issues
with the animal(cid:25)s health and well-being not being addressed in a timely and appropriate manner. The facility shall
ensure that there is daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being and that there is a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication to convey problems of animal health, behavior and well-being to
the attending veterinarian.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two Savannah cats are housed in an outdoor enclosure. There are two small plastic round domed shelter
structures with a large opening at the front of the enclosure. One shelter is missing a wind/rain break and the
second shelter has a wind/rain break that is hanging off to the side providing no protection. The weather this winter
has been cold, wet and windy. The temperature midday today is 37 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures at night
have been in the 20s this week. Lack of wind and rain protection makes it more likely for the cats to become
hypothermic. The shelter structures must be provided with wind and rain breaks at the entrance.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two Savannah cats housed in an outdoor enclosure have two small domed shelter structures. Each shelter has a
fleece bed in it. There is no additional bedding present to provide insulation and protection against the cold. The
temperature at midday today is 37 degrees F. Temperatures at night have been in the 20s this week and are
predicted to be in the 20s tonight. To provide protection from the cold, shelters must contain clean dry bedding
material if the temperature is below 50 degrees F. and additional clean dry bedding if temperatures are 35 degrees
F or lower. Correct from this day forward.
3.81(a)(3) DIRECT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The inspectors noted that one female lemur was sitting outside in the outdoor portion of the sheltered housing
during the entire routine inspection. The caretaker that feeds and cares for the 3 lemurs stated that the mother and
son pair is starting to prevent the single female lemur from entering the heated inside enclosure. She stated that she
has added another nest box with hay to the inside heated area and another to the outside area for extra protection.In addition, the inspectors noted that the caretaker was putting food for her in the outside area. When the
inspectors asked the maintenance caretaker the same question, he stated that he has noticed the female lemur
going into the inside heated area. During the inspection, the lemur was noted licking at the end of her tail multiple
times. The inspectors noted the temperature was 37 degrees when the lemur was outside. The temperatures have
been in the twenties at night which would be temperature extremes a lemur would not be able to adapt or tolerate
for a lengthy period of time without serious physical injuries or possible death. It is important to make sure the
female lemur has adequate access to the inside heated space available to her at all times during cold temperatures
below 45 degrees. Correct from this day forward.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The female Jacob sheep has been moved to a new enclosure due to her pregnancy. A temporary fence has been
constructed to divide the enclosure from the miniature pony next door. The fence is loose and some of the
wires/sections of fencing are protruding into the sheep enclosure which may cause injury to the sheep. Due to
structural issues it may not be adequate to keep the sheep and the miniature pony separated. In addition, the
outside enclosure fence facing the road of this sheep enclosure has an opening at the bottom of the fence which is
12 inches wide by 8 inches tall by 8 inches long. The opening could allow unwanted animals to access the
enclosure which could cause injury or death to the female pregnant sheep. All fences should be structurally sound
and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were numerous round bales of hay stacked outside on the wet ground under the trees in the woods. They
were placed on the wet ground and were not covered. The bales appear wet with discolored grey/black portions.
They feel wet 6 inches in from the surface of the bale. Poor hay storage with no protection from the weather
elements can cause deterioration and/ or contamination of the hay which could result in nutritional deficiencies or
disease spread in animals fed this hay. The animals may refuse to eat the affected hay. Hay must be stored in such
a manner to prevent deterioration, molding, or contamination.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are 2 alpacas in a smaller fenced in enclosure area with a shelter that is not tall enough for the alpacas to
adequately stand up in without bumping their heads. The height inside the shelter has been diminished by the
addition of layers of hay on the ground to provide warmth and respite from the muddy ground for the alpacas.
Normally the alpacas spend most of their time outside the shelter however due to the excess water and mud from
drainage issues there are no dry areas in the enclosure for them to stand in. The alpacas need to have a shelterwhere they are able to make normal postural movements without bending their heads down which could cause
discomfort and physical stress to the head and neck.
3.127(c) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several enclosures have severe drainage issues with standing water and thick mud present. The animals cannot
avoid the mud when in their enclosures and when walking to their feed and water receptacles.
*One enclosure housing two alpacas: The alpacas have no dry area in their enclosure-mud is present throughout.
Standing water is present in the hoof print indentations in the mud. The caretaker has placed some hay in the
shelter to provide some protection from the mud. Both animals were standing in the mud and their lower legs and
feet were covered in dry and fresh mud.
*One enclosure housing an elderly deer has no dry area in the enclosure. There is standing water in one corner.
The rest is mud. The deer was noted having difficulty walking in the enclosure to a spot where the caretaker placed
some hay for her to lay on.
*One enclosure houses two nilgai. The entire enclosure consists of mud. The area at the front of the enclosure
along the fence is a mixture of deep mud and standing water. The nilgai walking through this area sunk several
inches deep into the mud with each step and made a sucking sound when lifting each foot from the mud. When
standing, mud covered the entire feet and part of the lower leg. Both nilgai were noted to have the lower portion of
their legs covered with dry and fresh mud.
*One enclosure houses one nilgai, five goats, one alpaca and one dog. Three quarters of the enclosure is covered
in thick wet mud with impressions of hoof imprints. The area in front of the fence is especially thick with mud. The
nilgai had to use extra effort to pick up her feet to walk. When standing, her feet and part of her lower leg were
noted covered with the mud. The alpaca had mud coating its lower legs.
*One enclosure housing three mouflon sheep was extremely muddy and wet with areas of standing water. One area
of standing water next to the shelter was covered with green algae indicating long standing water.
Wet enclosures can lead to discomfort to the animals, injury due to slippery footing and health problems/diseases of
the feet and legs. The enclosures shall be provided with a method to provide rapid elimination of excess water or
the animals should be moved to drier enclosures.
3.132 DIRECT REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The facility currently houses over 100 animals. The facility lacks enough employees to take care of this number of
animals adequately and lacks on-site supervisors with experience in animal husbandry. The owner is currently not
able to be working at the facility regularly. Part time employees and relatives help out taking care of the animals.
One part-time caretaker who does have animal care experience comes daily to feed and water the animals. Shehas told us however that feeding and watering are her only duties. She stated that cleaning enclosures and
ensuring veterinary care are not her responsibilities. A relative of the owner, who has no animal experience prior to
coming to this facility, helps out and handles maintenance and building chores. He stated that animal care is left to
the previously described caretaker and the owner. A part time worker comes irregularly to help with equipment and
miscellaneous items. These workers are currently not working under a supervisor knowledgeable about animals and
are unfamiliar with the Animal Welfare Act regulations /standards and professional husbandry standards for the
animals at the facility. In addition, there is a distinct lack of or breakdown in communication and delineation of
responsibilities especially as relates to daily observation of the animals and communication with the attending
veterinarian. Lack of an adequate number of trained employees working under a knowledgeable supervisor can
lead to inadequate care of the animals as evidenced at this facility by numerous non-compliances including both
direct and repeat non-compliances. The facility shall maintain a sufficient number of trained employees working
under a supervisor to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices.
Inspection conducted on 1/28/15. Exit conducted on 1/29/15.
