Cleaning of primary enclosures
There is an excessive accumulation of waste material and dust under the water receptacles, under food
receptacles, under the PVC and wire enclosure frames, and on the doors leading to the outside runs. Unproperly
sanitized surfaces can become potiential hazards and can attract insects or vermin, as well as germs and odors.
The facility must be properly sanitized for the health and well being of the animals.
