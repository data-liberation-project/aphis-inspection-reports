2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An eight year old tri-colored female Beagle (ID# 057571894), has an excessively thick buildup of dark grayish to
brownish material on the lower and upper cheek teeth on both sides of the jaw. These teeth are not easily visible
because of the buildup of material covering the surface. The gum line has also receded from the cheek teeth. There
is a more pronounced area of gum recession directly above the upper left cheek tooth. There is a grey material
along the gum line on the left canine tooth.
The licensee stated that he acquired the dog about a week ago and was unaware of the dental problem.
The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures, be painful,
impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
