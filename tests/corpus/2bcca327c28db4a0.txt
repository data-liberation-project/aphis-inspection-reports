2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* (cid:28)"Madison(cid:29)" a black and white female Shih Tzu (# 455B4C5D57) has crusty matter around both eyes. The right
eye has a grey spot (approximate pencil eraser size) located toward the outside edge of the pupil. The hair above
the left eye is vertically pulled over the eye and matted down into this crusted material around the lower eyelid,
causing the hair both above and below the eye to pull at the skin when the dog blinks or opens its eye. This crusted
material and hair also interferes with her ability to see. (DIRECT)
* "(cid:28)Luther",(cid:29) a male Wheaton Terrier (#48345B3821) has an excessively matted hair coat. The dense hair matting
did not allow for matt separation to allow for skin visualization. Excessively twisted, densely matted hair covered and
dangled off most of his body. This condition could promote and foster skin infections because of the trapped
debris/moisture and the lack of air circulation. The licensee must remove the matted hair from this dogs. A program
of coat maintenance must be established and maintained to ensure that excessive hair matting does not occur.
"Luther" also has an accumulation of green/brown material completely coating and obscuring the (cid:28)cheek teeth" and
molars. This material is also present in various amounts on all the other teeth in the mouth. Gums are red, swollen,
and receded to expose obscured tooth roots. Dental issues can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth/ mouth
structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally. (DIRECT)
* "Wheaton Terrier" (# 442E5C4763) has an accumulation of off-white/brown/grey material completely coating and
obscuring the "cheek teeth" and molars. This material is also present in various amounts on all the other teeth in the
mouth. Gums are deep red, swollen, and extremely receded to expose obscured tooth roots. There is a creamy
white discharge along the gum line. Dental issues can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth/mouth structures,
be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally. (DIRECT)
* (cid:28)"Mandy",(cid:29) (# 093093000), a female King Charles Cavalier has a thick, cloudy discharge that is starting to
accumulate around her eyes. The inside of the left ear appears red, inflamed and slightly thickened. The ear has a
moist, cream to yellow in color, discharge oozing in and around the ear canal. A foul odor is present when the ear is
lifted. (DIRECT)*"(cid:29)Mandy"(cid:29) still has an accumulation of brown material completely coating and obscuring the "cheek teeth ", molars
and the canine teeth. The gums have receded away from the canine teeth and some of the molars exposing and
allowing significant tooth root surface area to become encased in this brown material. This was cited on a previous
report. (DIRECT)
* (cid:28)"Mandy(cid:25)s" toenails were excessively long and curving down toward the pad of her foot. The length of the toenails
did not allow for her to stand in a normal postural manner and could become caught in the enclosure and cause
injury. Licensee must ensure a method of nail trimming occurs in a timely manner to minimize excessive toenail
length and injury and to allow for normal postural stance. (DIRECT)
** The above four dogs are under direct non-compliance and need to be seen by the attending veterinarian by
C.O.B., 3-November-2014.
* "Raven," a female King Charles Cavalier (# 0A01784917) has a hazy appearance to the surface of both eyes. This
dog(cid:25)s eyes were reevaluated July 10, 2014 and the previous treatment of applying Rugby Artificial Tears Ointment
was to continue. However, the overall appearance of the eyes has remained the same since July 7, 2014. There is
a buildup of green mucoid matter (moist to dry in appearance) on the surface of the left eye. There is also a thick,
clumped, crusted green dried material that has matted the hair down around the entire eyelid of both eyes. The
accumulation of green moist to dried discharge in and around the eyes may be indicative of infection, hinder the
effectiveness of the artificial tears, cause skin irritation and pain to the dog. Due to the ongoing condition of the
eyes, the licensee must have this dog reevaluated by the veterinarian for additional veterinary care and a detailed
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
* Upon initial inspection, "(cid:28)Michael"(cid:29) a male, Yorkshire Terrier (# 44346A593E) appeared to be squinting in the
outdoor portion of the enclosure. Both eyes are entirely bluish-white in color, no pupil is visible and do not appear
normal. Licensee did not have any medical treatment/ diagnosis available with regard to this condition. Michael also
has long toenails that do not allow him to stand in a normal manner. Licensee must ensure a method of nail
trimming occurs in a timely manner to minimize excessive toenail length and allow for proper postural stance.
* (cid:28) "My Marshmellow(cid:29)" (# 4A3A1C033B), a female Bichon Frise had excessively long toenails that were starting to
curve around. The length of the toenails did not allow for her to stand in a normal postural manner and could
become caught in the enclosure and cause injury. Licensee must ensure a method of nail trimming occurs in a
timely manner to minimize excessive toenail length and injury and to allow for normal postural stance.2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* In the Whelping Barn three dogs were not identified. The licensee must ensure all dogs are properly identified.
Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
record keeping requirements.
To corrected by, 1-November-2014.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* On the north side on the Small Dog Kennel, top row counting from the east, the panel divider between enclosures
two and three is not fasten to the back wall. The unfasten panel is not structurally sound and not in good repair.
The loose panel could injure the three adult dogs housed in the enclosures. All housing facilities for the dogs must
be kept in good repair and must protect the dogs from injury.
To be corrected by, 10-November-2014.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* 13 panel dividers in the small dog kennel, housing 22 adult dogs, are excessively rusty. The metal surface of the
panels is flaking and is corroding away along the bottoms in areas. These rusty surfaces prevent required cleaning
and sanitization. Improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease potential for the dogs. The flaking or
corrosion can affect the structural strength of the metal surfaces. Structurally jeopardized panels can break allowing
for the dogs fight between enclosures or escape. These metal dividers must be repaired or replaced. All surfaces
must be free of excessive rust. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization and provide a structurally sound
surface.
3.4(c) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* The two outdoor enclosures, housing five adult dogs, have approximately three to six feet long by ¼ inch wide
cracks in the concrete flooring. These large cracks prevent required cleaning and sanitization. The cracks can
harbor waste. The disease potential can be increased as a result of improper cleaning and sanitization. The cracksmust be repaired. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. This will allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization, thus decreasing the disease hazards for the dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Seven puppies (total) from two different litters were observed to have legs and feet that passed through the wire
flooring of the enclosures they were in. Animal(cid:25)s legs and feet that are allowed to pass through enclosure flooring
can cause injury and prevent movement. Licensee must ensure that all flooring provided is constructed in such a
manner as to prevent all legs/feet from passing through to minimize possible injury.
To corrected by, immediately "corrected at time of inspection".
3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The following is the measurement of three adult dogs:
1. A Wheaton Terrier (not identified) measured 20 inches. (20 inches + 6 X 20 inches + 6= 676 inches).
2. A Chinese Crested (not identified) measured 20 inches. (20 inches +6 X 20 inches + 6 = 676 inches).
3. A Chinese Crested (not identified) measured 16 inches. (16 inches + 6 X 16 inches +6 = 484 inches).
100 percent required total space for these dogs is 1,836 inches. (676 inches + 676 inches + 484 inches = 1,836
inches).
The enclosure is (36 inches X 27 inches) allowing for 972 square inches of total space. Therefore, 864 inches of
additional space is required All dogs must be provided with the required amount of floor space to comply with the
regulations, allow for proper exercise and socialization.
To be corrected by, 30-October-2014.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The areas underneath raised enclosures, inside the Medium Barn housing 25 adult dogs, have an accumulation of
fluid and fecal waste, dog hair and leaves. This indicates the areas underneath are not being cleaned as often as
necessary. This can increase the disease hazards, attract insects, pests and cause odors. The area underneath of
the raised enclosures needs to be cleaned more often. More frequent cleaning will reduce disease hazards,insects, pests and odors.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Six metal self-feeders (feeding seven adult dogs) in the large dog kennel and three red plastic self-feeders
(feeding seven adult dogs) in the Medium kennel building have an accumulation of dark brown to black organic
matter, food debris and grime. This indicates these self-feeders are not cleaned and sanitized as often as
necessary. The disease potential can be increased for the dogs from infrequent and improper cleaning and
sanitization. All self-feeders must be cleaned and sanitized at least every 2 weeks or as often as necessary. More
frequent cleaning/sanitization will prevent an accumulation of organic matter, debris and grime and decrease the
disease potential for the dogs.
