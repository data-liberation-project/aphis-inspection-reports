ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection, the following animals were identified in need of veterinary care:
- A large cinnamon colored male hedgehog named Nepal, housed with a female in enclosure A6, was found with
lesions behind both ears. The largest lesion behind the right ear was approximately 1 inch long extending towards
the neck. The lesion was reddened, bloody and moist with crusty dried blood along the edges. A small laceration
could be seen in the area closest to the ear. A smaller circular lesion approximately 0.5 inches in diameter could
also be seen behind the left ear. The lesion was reddened, bloody and moist. Upon closer examination, a large
amount of brown crusty material could be seen inside both the left and the right ear.
- A grey and white female mini pig located in the barn, obtained on a breeding loan, was seen limping on her right
hind leg. She had difficulty pivoting and seemed hesitant bearing weight on the right hind leg when turning. The pig
would consistently lift her right hind leg up, shifting her weight to her other limbs, when standing.
The conditions affecting these animals were not identified by the licensee, therefore the veterinarian had not been
contacted and care had not yet been provided. Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment
and causes undue pain and distress in animals with conditions such as these listed here. The licensee must ensure
that daily observation of all animals occur in order to assess their health and well-being. Timely communication with
the attending veterinarian must occur to provide proper diagnosis and medical attention.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two bush babies housed in a tall metal parrot enclosure beneath the barn did not have sufficient shelter from the
elements. The barn had a roof but was open on 2 sides and therefore did not completely block the wind or protect
against the cold. The bush baby enclosure did contain 2 Fleece pouches, a heating pad and straw for warmth.
However, without an enclosed shelter, there is insufficient protection against the wind and the heat dissipates easily.
An IR gun revealed the temperature within the enclosure to be 37° F at the time of inspection. Adequate shelter is
necessary to provide comfort and protection to the bush babies. A more substantial shelter providing better
protection from the wind and the cold should be provided. The outdoor housing for the bush babies must provideadequate shelter from the elements at all times including protection from the sun, rain, wind and any weather
conditions that may occur. The shelter must safely provide heat to prevent the ambient temperature from falling
below 45° F.
