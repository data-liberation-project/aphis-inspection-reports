HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
2.131 (d) (2) Handling of animals
During the time of inspection in the lower enclosure holding two llamas and 25 fallow deer, there was not an
identifiable attendant present when the public was in contact with the animals through the enclosure fence. While
conducting the inspection the attendant returned on or about 15 minutes from the start of the inspection on this
enclosure. An identifiable attendant should be present when the public is able to contact the animals in order to
prevent injury to the animals and/or public and to ensure that all handling and feeding is done according to the
requirements of this Section of the AWA regulations.
During all times of public contact there must be a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or
attendant present.
This is a repeat from inspection conducted on November, 18, 2013 with an original correction date of December 19,
2013.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural Strength
The upper enclosure holding the four male fallow deer, on the back side of the shelter there are broken boards with
gaps large enough for animals to get their hooves/foot caught and potentially cause injuries.
Maintain outdoor facilities so that it is structurally sound and good repair to protect animals from injury.

SANITATION.
3.131 (a) Cleaning of enclosures
The upper enclosure housing the four male fallow deer had excessive feces inside the shelter structure; the excess
accumulation of feces can cause diseases, parasite and pest infestation.
Remove excreta in the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination, minimize disease
hazards and reduce odors.
