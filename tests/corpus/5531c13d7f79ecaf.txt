3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The insides of the enclosures housing the animals appeared to be clean and sanitized on a regular basis. But many other
surfaces in the sheltered housing facility (which houses both puppies and adults) had a layer of dirt/grime/dust/waste
indicating they had not been cleaned or sanitized in many months. Although the dogs weren't in direct contact with these
surfaces, they were in very close proximity to them. There was a 5-gallon bucket filled with fecal-contaminated washdown
water which was emitting a foul odor that had been left just a foot away from an enclosure housing two dogs. Some of the
electrical outlets, directly connected to the outside of the dogs' enclosures had a build-up of waste. The dogs were raised
a few feet off the floor in their enclosures, but the floor beneath them was very unsanitary and the actual flooring was
barely viewable beneath the layer of built-up brown/black organic material. There were multiple items being stored in the
housing building which were collecting thick layers of dust, such as an old fan and unused flooring material. Additionally
the white PVC pipes leading from the washdowns to the outdoor sewage, had an external buildup of brown grime and the
areas between the pipes and the wall had a buildup up of dust, grime, and dead bugs. These unclean/unsanitary
surfaces were all within just a few feet (less than 6) of the dogs and in some cases just inches away, right outside their
enclosures.



*Adult dogs and puppies are at a higher risk of becoming ill when they are housed in unsanitary conditions.

**The licensee must ensure that even the surfaces of the housing facility which do NOT come in contact with the dogs are
still cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

This non-compliant item must be corrected by: 28 February 2021.

The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
