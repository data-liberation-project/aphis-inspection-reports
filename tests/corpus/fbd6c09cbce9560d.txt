2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male 5 year old Takin ("Oliver" # 51) was lame on the right front limb and was only placing the lateral claw of this
limb on the ground while walking and would toe touch this limb while standing. He is also lame on the left front limb
and both medial and lateral claws were extremely long. A soft ball-size swelling is present on the anterior side of
the left carpal area. The facility representative stated that he had been lame with his left front limb since they
acquired him in November 2013 and the other facility had documented the problem. From a review of the written
veterinarian medical records for (cid:28)"Oliver" an intermittent lameness had been documented since March 2014. The
attending veterinarian has been made aware of the condition of the left front limb. The attending veterinarian was
not aware of the right front limb lameness and thus no treatments have been administered. "Oliver" was observed
by the inspectors at approximately 2 pm and according to the facility representative the veterinarian rounds with the
AV occurred earlier in the day and that he was there every week for 4 hours on Tuesday mornings. The
representative called the AV and the inspectors accompanied him to "(cid:28)Oliver's"(cid:29) enclosure around 5 pm. The AV
stated (cid:28)that "even his grandmother could see that he was lame."(cid:29) Lameness may indicate an underlying disease
process. The facility must establish and maintain an appropriate program of veterinarian care to prevent, control,
diagnosis and treat disease.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Bird droppings were observed on the pipe supports in the giraffe building as well as on the door tracks in the
bison/elk building. Bird nests were observed in the giraffe building and the elk/bison building. Birds were observed
flying around the giraffe building and the elk/bison building. Birds were also observed perching on a water
receptacle in the giraffe building. Birds and bird droppings can contribute to disease transmission in animals, and
can contaminate food,water and living areas. A more effective method of bird control still needs to be established
and maintained.
In addition, this inspection followed up on the veterinary care of the male black rhinoceros ("Howdi") identified on
the June 11, 2013 inspection date. This animal received a series of veterinarian treatments over several days inearly January 2014.
This routine inspection was conducted with the Zoo Director on 20 May 2014. The attending veterinarian was also
present for a portion of the inspection. The exit interview was conducted on 21 May 2014.
