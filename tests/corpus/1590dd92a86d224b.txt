**** There are three dog houses, igloo style, that the dogs have chewed the front tunnel back enough that wind, rain
and or snow to enter the dog house. This impacts the animals ability to stay warm or dry from inclement weather. All
dog houses must have wind/ rain breaks on the entrances to protect the dogs from getting wet or being impacted
from inclement weather.
