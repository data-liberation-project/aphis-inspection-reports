TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
2.50 (a) One adult Cardigan Welsh Corgi dog named "Teagen" did not have proper identification during the
inspection. The licensee stated the animal had been previously micro-chipped, but the inspector was unable to
locate or verify the identification of this animal.
Proper identification is essential for tracking movement of animals and to facilitate the inspection process.
All live dogs held on the premises must be properly identified.
