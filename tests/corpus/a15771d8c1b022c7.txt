CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the night quarters for two golden lion tamarins there were an abundance of ants all over the food in the feeding
bowl, trailing the walls and their enclosure. Also in the night quarters for three emperor tamarins there were several
trails of ants within their enclosure. It was stated that the facility is currently using a gel substance to control the
ants. Even with this pest control program in place there is still an infestation of ants in these facilities. An effective
program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates must be established and maintained
so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
