Facilities, general.
There are several areas of primary enclosure fencing that requires repair or replacement. This includes areas in the
enclosure housing 6 goats, the enclosure housing 6 cows, and the enclosure housing 3 adult cows in the rear of the
property. Several areas of fencing were noticed to be damaged or pulled away from the structural supports. These
areas are a potential injury hazard to the animals and also affect the structural strength of the primary enclosures. The
licensee must repair or replace these areas to ensure the safety of the animals and maintain the structural strength of the
enclosures. Correct this by repairing these areas and developing a system to identify and fix these issues in the future.

Facilities, outdoor.
A pig was observed walking around within its primary enclosure where there is no dry area available for the pig to get out
of the wet mud. In some areas, the wet mud was belly deep. The mud covered the pig’s legs, face, and sides.
Insufficient drainage that permits accumulations of water and mud can expose the pig to potential physical injury, disease
hazards, and mental stress. Correct by ensuring that the enclosure has an adequate method to rapidly eliminate excess
water and therefore provides a clean/dry area within the enclosure

Watering.
The water receptacle for one adult pig is filled with muddy water. The water is black and it is impossible to see through
the water to the bottom of the receptacle. The water receptacles for the goats and cows are also in need of cleaning.
Although the water in these receptacles is clear, the bottoms of all of these receptacles are dirty, covered with dirt and a
greenish/gray film. Failure to provide a potable water source for the animals can lead to increased disease hazards.
Correct this by cleaning and maintaining the water receptacle for all animals to ensure a safe, potable water supply.
