ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 14:14 on
17-Aug-17.
Contacted a facility representative that informed me that the responsible person was out of town and unavailable for
an inspection.
