3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The outdoor enclosure, housing two adult dogs, had an accumulation of fecal waste on the concrete surface. The
fecal waste was a gray to dark brown color. This indicates daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. Without daily
spot-cleaning the accumulation of waste can attract pests, vermin and increase the disease hazards for the dogs.
All surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often enough for the prevention of an accumulation of waste
and reduction of disease hazards.
