2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Yorkshire Terrier, microchip #106812330, was observed with her entire right eye covered with a heavily
encrusted matt. The eye itself was not visible. The licensee removed the matted hair from the around the eye. After
removing the matted hair the eye appeared cloudy and had a small pinpoint divot-like lesion near the center of the eye.
There was also a small acorn-sized raised mass on the side of her head near the left ear.
Upon closer observation it was also noted that this dog had very heavy accumulation of a dark brown plaque and tartar
build up on her upper back molars. It was hard to distinguish individual teeth on the left or right side. The gums
surrounding the affected teeth were reddened and inflamed.
The licensee was not aware of this dog’s condition nor had he contacted a veterinarian.
These conditions could be a sign of infection or other medical conditions.
This dog needs to be seen by a veterinarian so that a diagnosis can be made and a treatment plan developed and
followed.
All animals must receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
