Facilities, indoor.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing areas. There were windows that were open a
small amount but the pens were in need of more frequent cleaning to minimize ammonia odors.
Failure to provide fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
The guinea pig pens contained a large amount of fecal material with little clean bedding present and the pens were in
need of more frequent cleaning. The licensee said the last cleaning was 7 days ago.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
