One bottle of injectable Baytril and one bottle of injectable Ivermectin were found inside a storage cabinet with no
refrigeration and with a needle attached to draw the medication without an attached syringe. The open end of the
needle is an access point of air or any contaminant that may spoil the medication. The expiration date was good
and the Ivermectin bottle was nearly full.
In order to provide appropriate methods to treat diseases, parasites, etc. medicines must be kept in a proper
environment and free from contamination.
To be corrected immediately.
