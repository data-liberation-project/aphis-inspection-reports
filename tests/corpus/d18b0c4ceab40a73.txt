3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility reported that on June 25, 2019, the carcass of the facility’s juvenile North American Porcupine was
discovered in the enclosure of a Red-Tailed Hawk that was adjacent to where the porcupine was housed with it’s
dam. Both the porcupines and the Red-Tailed Hawk were housed in chain-link enclosures while the shared wall
between the two enclosures was modified with wire, vinyl slats, and corrugated plastic so as to prevent contact
between the porcupines and the hawk. Additionally, there are vinyl slats on the wall of the enclosure facing the
aisle in front of the two enclosures and, for management purposes, the Red-Tailed Hawk is tethered within it’s own
enclosure.
The carcass was heavily predated upon when found during the facility’s morning checks and while there were no
open gates to either enclosure and the shared wall was in good repair, it was determined at necropsy that the width
of the head and chest of the porcupine were 38mm and 52mm, respectively. Further inspection of the enclosures
revealed that the gaps between the gates and the door jambs were approximately 50mm of both of the enclosures.
The most likely scenario is that the juvenile porcupine, already identified by the facility as smaller than previous
juvenile porcupines housed in this enclosure, was able to exit the enclosure in the gap of the door jamb, travel down
the aisle, and then enter the enclosure of the adjacent Red-Tailed Hawk through a similar-sized door jamb, where it
was then attacked by the hawk.
In response to the incident, the facility reviewed all enclosures and identified no other animals or enclosures that
presented a similar risk in which an animal would be able to escape through a door jamb. Also, any change in
inhabitants of the enclosures will result in a similar review of animal size and door jamb width to ensure that new
animals introduced will also not be able to escape. Modified chain-link enclosures will no longer be used to house
pregnant porcupines. Instead, they and their young will be housed in enclosures with a maximum wire and door
gap width of 1in (25.4mm).
All indoor and outdoor facilities need to be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and be constructed in such
a manner as to contain the animals. Failure to do so can result in injury or death to the animal.

Correct by continuing to ensure that all animals are housed in enclosures which are properly maintained and willprevent escape of the animal. Corrected by the time of inspection.

SANITATION.
During inspection of stall 1 in the facility’s zebra barn, which is currently used for storage, several rodent droppings
were observed behind a wooden pallet that was propped up against the wall. Similarly, in the barn housing the
Flemish giant rabbits and several of the goats and sheep as part of the KidZooU area of the zoo, there is a room
where hay is stored as feed for the animals and rodent droppings were again observed in a corner of this room.
The facility had stated that they had started a new pest control program in the zoo using traps that would not pose a
health risk to the animals housed there. However, in these two areas of the zoos, traps were either not in place or
not maintained.
Facilities are required to have a safe and effective program for the control of pests, including mammalian. Failure to
do so can have a negative impact on animal health through the spread of disease or contamination of feed.
Correct by implementing an effective pest control program in all areas of the zoo, including areas used for storage
of feed and other equipment. Correct by October 18, 2019.
This inspection took place September 16-18, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director of Animal Health.
