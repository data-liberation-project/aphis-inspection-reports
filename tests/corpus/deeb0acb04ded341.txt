INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
When speaking to a staff member we were informed that the electric circuit breaker, that controlled the heat source
in the (cid:28)Red Building(cid:29), had been tripped sometime between the night of Jan 2, 2015 and the morning of Jan 3, 2015.
This building also houses a variety of other animals, including marmosets, bushbaby, armadillos, prairie dogs,
Kookaburras, etc.. The morning of Jan. 3rd a keeper found a deceased Tamarin on the ground of its primary
enclosure. The staff member informed us that the keeper noticed that the temperature was ~ 50 (cid:19) 52 degrees when
they entered the building. It is unclear how long the power was out to this building. Therefore it is not clear as to how
low the temperature fell that night. Secondary backup systems for HVAC s should be in place for all indoor housing
facilities for animals to ensure that they are sufficiently heated when necessary to protect them from temperature
extremes and to provide for their health and well (cid:19) being.
*** To Be Corrected By: Corrected At Time of This Inspection- A secondary security system has been put in place
since this incident

At the time of this inspection it was noted that the far, back, left corner of the wolf enclosure was in need of
attention. The primary enclosure is constructed of an ~8(cid:25)high with a 2(cid:25) overhang chain link fence. However, in this
one corner the snow has accumulated and now the fence is ~5(cid:25) high. To ensure that the wolves cannot escape from
this enclosure this snow will need to be addressed.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the fluorescent light bulb in the cougar den was partially working. Theden is closed to the outdoors because of the cold temperatures and the age of the cat. The adjacent spider monkey
portion of the den is also partially closed off. Therefore, there is minimal light entering into the cougar portion of the
den. To ensure that there is enough light for routine inspection and cleaning this light fixture will need to be
addressed.
