Miscellaneous.
There have been four incidents of medication dosing errors involving non-human primates (NHPs) and one incident of the
incorrect divider placement for NHPs that were reported to the ACUC and OLAW since the last inspection in August 2021.
These incidents could have been prevented if the personnel followed established procedures:
-July 2021: the incorrect divider with mesh was put in place allowing two non-human primates (NHPs) to contact each
other through the divider and one lost the tip of its tongue. (Affected animal was appropriately treated and recovered).
-Sept 2021: an overdose of midazolam was given to a NHP because the concentration available was different than what
the infusion machine was set for.
-August 19-27, 2021: A NHP was given an overdose of a diabetes medication because the newly acquired medication
was 200mg/ml and what was used prior was 50mg/ml.
-October 07, 2021: Antibiotics were at times given to the incorrect animal because the orders were written under the ID of
its social partner, however some technicians knew which was the correct animal while others didn't and followed the
written orders.
-January 6, 2022: one NHP had missed its daily treatments of a glucoregulatory medication and liver function support
medication and a different NHP received it because the last 2 digits of the ID were verified but not the complete


identification number.
Handling of research animals must be done as carefully as possible.

Housing facilities, general.
In August 2021 a NHP was found to have its hand stuck between the perch and the wall. Staff removed it and it was
treated by staff veterinarians which included amputation of two digits. Records indicate it was appropriately treated and
monitored for recovery. Staff also report the perch involved and all perch fixtures of this design were evaluated and
reinforced as necessary to prevent further recurrence. This incident was reported to OLAW and the ACUC.

In December 2021 an enrichment device had been modified from its original design for use in a non-human primate
enclosure. The enrichment device originally had a sheath with a bungie to attach to the enclosure, however the sheath
became detached and when repaired it was modified to be held up with the two chains. The two chains used to suspend it
within the enclosure had enough space that a macaque was able to get its head between the chains and then couldn't get
back out. The facility found it caught and immediate CPR attempts were noted to be unsuccessful.
Note: The facility reports all enrichment devices of this design were removed to prevent further occurrence and noted
retraining of staff on appropriate enrichment device usage and device repair procedure/reporting would be put in place.
This incident was also reported by the facility to the USDA veterinary medical officers by the attending veterinarian in
December 2021 and also was reported to OLAW and the ACUC.

These two incidents involving furniture-type fixtures had a serious adverse effect on the involved animals and did not
provide for the safe activity for the NHPs that use them. Ensure that all furniture-type fixtures or objects remain sturdily
constructed and strong enough to provide for the safe activity and welfare of nonhuman primates that use them.



Maintain correct from this day forward.

This inspection of the non-human primates under LVSC was conducted with facility representatives from 4/5-4/7/2022
