ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was an adult male Maltese "Tibits"(#10 plastic collar, dog recently purchased, microchip # 057005780 on
disposition form) which was not bearing weight on the left front leg. On closer observation, the skin on top of the left
front paw was discolored reddish-purple and swollen. When the licensee picked up the dog and touched the left
front paw, the paw started oozing a blood like discharge. On top of the paw, there was an approximately 3 mm open
skin lesion which was oozing a bright red bloody-like discharge. The lesion on the left front paw could be the result
of injury, infection or a variety of veterinary medical conditions which may be painful. The licensee must have this
animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that a accurate diagnose is obtained and appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times.
The licensee had medications at the facility that were past the labeled expiration date. The expired medications
included: Oxytocin injection (Expired 6/13), Exceed (Expired 7/12), Panacur (Expired 10/13), and Ivomec (Expired
10/13). These medications were stored with other medications that were currently being used, and therefore ready
to use. Expired medication may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated or harm the animals. Licensee
must establish and maintain a program that ensures medications are not used past their labeled expiration date.
To be corrected by: April 8, 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
