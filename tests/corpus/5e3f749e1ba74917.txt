3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was a significant amount of excreta build-up inside two coatimnudi dens as well as on the shelf the dens sat
on. In one of the dens, the build-up was so significant that the floor could not be visualized and it was approximately
1/4-1/2 inch thick. An excessive amount of excreta was present inside the African serval enclosure. Proper cleaning
of primary enclosures is crucial to minimize disease hazards, reduce odors, and prevent pests. The primary
enclosures for these animals must be cleaned.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
A live mouse was observed in the breeding area of the facility. Rodent droppings were present in several areas of
the facility as well as in the hedgehog and capybara primary enclosures. All bait pouches were empty on
examination. Mice can be vectors for disease. A more effective pest control program must be implemented and
maintained to reduce the mice population at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
