Primary enclosures.
Three nursing female rabbits with litters had inadequate space in their primary enclosures. The cages measured 2ft x 2ft,
or 4sqft. The rabbits weighed approximately 10lbs, requiring 6sqft of space if they have a litter. The facility was aware that
the rabbits had litters because date of birth was marked on the cage cards and all 3 enclosures contained a nestbox. The
litters were confirmed to be in the nestboxes and were 4-5 days old. When not provided enough space, rabbits can
become stressed and engage in abnormal behaviors, including killing their litters. Rabbits must be provided a minimum
amount of floor space based on weight and reproductive status in order to allow for normal postural adjustment and
adequate freedom of movement. Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
