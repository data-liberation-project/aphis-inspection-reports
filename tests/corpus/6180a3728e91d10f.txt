FEEDING.
*There are open boxes of produce in the walk-in refrigerator in the commissary that are being stored directly under
the blower fans. The blower fans have an accumulation of dust and debris. Open food that is stored under dirty
blower fans is at risk for contamination.
*The storage buckets in the commissary containing raw bones and meat are not being cleaned and sanitized
regularly. Inadequate cleaning and sanitization of food storage containers can lead to contamination.
*The licensee must place and store food so as to minimize contamination. Food receptacles must be kept clean and
sanitary at all times. This was corrected at the time of inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
