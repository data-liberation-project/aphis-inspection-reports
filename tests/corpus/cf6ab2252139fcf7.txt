ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**There is a male French bulldog, #60, who has been receiving treatment for the last 2 days for an ear infection
according to the program of veterinary care. Today, the dog is shaking his head and has a large swelling of the
whole ear pinna. This is a painful condition and the dog is exhibiting signs of discomfort by shaking his head. This
is a more complicated problem than treating a routine ear infection, and if the swelling is left untreated it can
become very severely infected and lead to permanent ear problems. Correct by making an appointment for
diagnosis and treatment by a veterinarian.
