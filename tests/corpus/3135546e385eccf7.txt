MISCELLANEOUS.
During the inspection 6 adult male cynomolgus macaques were observed in restraint chairs for an IACUC approved
research protocol. The animals were restrained in a standing position with their collar fixed in the yoke of the chair.
After discussion with the facility, it was determined that the macaques would be restrained in the chairs for 2-3
hours.
The primate chair was designed for animals to perch in a natural position, hunched slightly forward, per the product
website. The position in which the animals are being restrained is not the appropriately ergonomic seated position
for which the chairs were designed and the duration for which they are held in this posture results in unnecessary
discomfort for the animals. Several animals were noted attempting to make postural adjustments seeking adequate
support for a species appropriate resting posture.
Handling of all animals shall be done in a manner that does not cause unnecessary discomfort. A system should be
in place to ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being of nonhuman primates plan on file primarily
addresses enrichment items provided to the animals. In the plan, the animals are provided with a toy, a food treat
and a foraging item every day, but only 1/3 to 1/2 of nonhuman primates in the facility had a foraging item at the
time of inspection.
In addition to these items, the plan is required to address the following elements: social grouping, special
considerations, restraint devices and exemptions.
The research facility must update their plan for environment enhancement in order to address specialconsiderations. The special considerations section needs to address the special attention regarding the
enhancement of the environment for certain nonhuman primates, for example animals showing signs of being in
psychological distress through behavior or appearance. During inspection, one animal was observed stereotypically
circling the enclosure, and there is no documented process in place to manage abnormal behaviors. Additionally,
the restraint and handling SOP does not include enough detail regarding the duration of restraint.
The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate
professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
