* The right eye of an adult female Pug (microchip # 4C23373F33) appeared dry and rough on the surface. There
was a thick matter with hair stuck to the middle of the surface of the eye that did not move when the dog closed its
eye. The licensee had not observed the condition and the animal was not receiving treatment. Eye conditions can
be irritating and painful and if left untreated can lead to serious medical conditions. The licensee shall have the dog
examined by licensed veterinarian to obtain a written diagnosis and treatment plan, which should be made available
upon the next inspection. Veterinary care shall be provided as prescribed and recorded in the animal's health
records. TO BE CORRECCTED BY: 11/7/2015
