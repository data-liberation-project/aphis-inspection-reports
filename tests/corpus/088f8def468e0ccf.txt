ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 pm on
05/23/2016.
I called the owners cell phone and left a message that I was there to inspect, and to provide an updated schedule of
known day/times that are best to inspect or avoid depending their work schedule. I tried calling the son however the
mailbox was not set up to leave messages. I waited 30 minutes in the driveway however no one was able to be
reached at this time.
