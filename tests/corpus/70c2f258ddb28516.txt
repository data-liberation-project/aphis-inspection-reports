HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The Raccoon Building has a high ambient temperature and humidity. The building is constructed of metal and is not
insulated. There are a total of six fans running at both ends of the building and there are windows that are open
along the sides. Towards the middle of the building there is little to no movement of air. The temperatures taken
throughout the building by the Kestrel at approximately 2:50 pm is 98.4 degrees F with a heat index 117.2 degrees
F, 100.3 degrees F with a heat index 123.3 degrees F, 98.9 degrees F with a heat index of 118.4 degrees F, and
101.4 degrees F and 101.8 degrees F. Numerous raccoons were displaying behaviors such as panting, drooling
and increased respiratory rate. The raccoons are also seen lying on their sides, backs, and abdomens with their
legs splayed out which could indicate they are uncomfortable with the temperature. There are approximately 290
raccoons housed in this building. High temperature and humidity could have a negative impact on the health and
well-being of the animals.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health and well-being, appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must reduce the temperature
and humidity inside this building to a level that is comfortable for the raccoons in order to support their health and
well-being.
