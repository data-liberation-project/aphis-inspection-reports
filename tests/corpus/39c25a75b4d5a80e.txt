ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The white yak "Max" and a fallow deer have overgrown hooves.
Overgrown hooves can lead to lameness and cause discomfort to the animal. It can stress ligaments and joints
from the abnormal movement. In addition, the misalignment it causes can contribute to degenerative joint disease.
Correct within 2 weeks for the yak (by 11/21/17).
Correct within 30 days for the fallow deer (by 12/7/17).
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
