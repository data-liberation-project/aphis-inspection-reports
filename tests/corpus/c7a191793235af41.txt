2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** A poodle “Grape” was in a whelping enclosure nursing 4 puppies. She is thin and her ribs, and lumbar vertebrae are
easily palatable, and her pelvic bones were easily visible, with no palpable fat. The licensee states this has always been a
thin dog and they supplement her with additional food and she remains thin. This could indicate another underlying health
problem. This dog should be assessed by the attending veterinarian prior to being bred again to determine if there are
underlying health problems that prevent her from maintaining a healthy body weight and condition during pregnancy.

*** At the time multiple dogs in the kennel had long nails that needed to be trimmed. The facility states they trim every 6
weeks, but the length of the nails indicates a shorter frequency is needed to prevent the nails from getting too long. This
needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.

*** A poodle, “Pepsi” had matted fur on her back and a patch of hair loss on the back towards her rear right leg.

*** A poodle, “Triscut” had long nails and her left ear had an excessive amount of wax and debris built up that was
blocking the ear canal. Regular ear checks and cleaning are needed to prevent this amount of debris build up in the ear
and prevent ear infections and irritations.


*** A cavalier, “Dagwood” had heavily matted ears that were filled with shavings stuck in the mats.
*** A Pomeranian, “Gummy Bear” had matted fur around her ears.
*** A Cocker spaniel, “Carson” also had matted fur around the ears.
*** A Cocker spaniel, “Teddy” had matted fur around his neck and ears and his ears were also dirty and in need of
cleaning.

Matted fur on these dogs, pulls and separates from the skin which can be painful and can hide skin irritations underneath
the matted fur. These dogs need to be groomed on a more frequent basis to prevent this matting from occurring for the
welfare of the dogs.

Contingency planning.
The facility does not have a documented plan that provides for the handling, housing, care and transportation for their
animals in the event of an emergency. Per this regulation, a developed and documented plan must identify the situations
that would require use of the plan, be reviewed annually, and be made available for APHIS upon request.

3.6(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
*** The enclosures attached to the main wall on the far side of the kennel need to be addressed. The white siding is
broken and cracked in multiple enclosures with some holes in the siding. This has created sharp edges in the enclosure
and allows for water and debris to become trapped behind the wall.


*** The wire mesh flooring in one enclosure is pulling forward and is off the wood frame where it meets the siding. This
has exposed the wood frame that is now being chewed on by the dogs, potentially impacting the structure of the
enclosure, as the mesh comes off the base support.

*** In the whelping room, a few of the plastic bins used for whelping are chewed creating sharp edges on the tops of the
bins. These sharp edges and rough areas need to be sanded down to keep the bins in good repair for the safety of the
dogs.

*** The large breed whelping enclosures also need to be addressed. There are metal supports that are used to create
dividers when the puppies are first born to give the mom another area to go to. However, when the dividers are not in, the
metal supports are exposed creating sharp edges in the enclosure and some of the metal looks like it has been chewed
creating additional sharp edges.

*** A large breed whelping enclosure housing a Golden retriever has an area directly above the feeder access that is
chewed with sharp edges. This area should also be sanded down and kept smooth for the safety of the dogs.

*** In the puppy room, one enclosure has a small hole in the side of the enclosure and a crack in the siding that needs to
be repaired.

Enclosures must be maintained in good repair to keep the enclosures structurally sound for the safety of the animals.

Watering
The facility uses stainless steel buckets to water the dogs. At the time of the inspection, two buckets were empty and
multiple buckets had shavings in the buckets. One enclosure housing 5 small breed dogs had an empty bucket. Once
water was provided, two dogs began to drink eagerly for an extended period. Potable water must be made continuously
available to the dogs for their comfort and wellbeing. They must also be kept clean in accordance with 3.11(b) as the
shavings left in the buckets can be a contaminant and should be removed daily when fresh water is provided.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A few of the enclosures are not being spot cleaned daily. There are areas on the floor with caked feces and shavings
ground into the floor that need to be removed. This needs to be addressed and these floors scraped daily to prevent the
dogs from becoming soiled.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
