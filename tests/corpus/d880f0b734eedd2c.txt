3.3(e)(1) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 3 dogs(1-Beagle, 2-blk Rat Terriers) in the Hot room that are on a cement floor in that is not sealed. The
three domestic dog-hybrids (three wolf-dog hybrid and two coyote-dog hybrids) that continue to be housed in a
sheltered enclosure towards the bear enclosure. The sheltered portion of the primary enclosure housing these dogs
is constructed of unsealed wood which is not impervious to water with support posts that have been chewed. The
dirt floors under the sheltered portion of the enclosure do not have access to direct sunlight and can not be
sanitized.
Walls and flooring constructed of unsealed wood and dirt which are permeable to moisture provide an optimal area
for bacterial and fungal growth both of which can cause disease in the dogs housed in these enclosures. Ultimately
the failure to construct dog enclosures out of surfaces that are impervious to moisture results in an inability to
properly clean and sanitize the primary enclosures and creates an increased risk of disease and illness.
Currently the new enclosures are being built and they are scheduled for completion that will house all wolf-dog and
wolf-coyote hybrids according to AWA standards and regulations. The licensee advised that the current enclosures
will remain as is until the animals are moved to the new enclosures. Failure to follow through with the planned
repairs or new buildings that meet the AWA standards and regulations will cause the animals to continue to be
housed in a structure that is not impervious to moisture and can not be sanitized due to chewed wood or unsealed
cement.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the 2 enclosures that house five dogs (three wolf-dog hybrid and two coyote-dog hybrids) are housed in a
sheltered primary enclosure towards the bears that have an accumulation of more than 2 days of fecal material and
hair. The accumulated debris is evidence that current cleaning and sanitation protocols are inadequate to prevent
their accumulation. The licensee has increased cleaning to every 2-3 days, however according to regulations spot
cleaning must be done daily.Accumulated organic debris provides an optimal area for the growth of bacterial and fungal pathogens creating a
disease hazard for the dogs. Additionally, this accumulated debris can attract pests including flies and vermin as
well as contributes to odors within the facility.
The licensee must increase spot cleaning of fecal material to be done daily and sanitizing at least once every two
weeks.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of the previous inspection four large felid enclosures (containing a total of 7 Tigers and 1 Lion) were
constructed with fencing that was less than 12 feet high. Currently the Tiger Pens' 2 and 3 have been corrected with
a 3ft kick in and high tensile electric wire added around the entire enclosure and are within standards.
The remaining four affected enclosures that need correction are:
Tiger Pen 1: contains two Tigers Jomba and BaBuVa
Tiger Pen 4: contains one Tiger referred to as Nahandi
Tiger Pen 5: contains one Tiger referred to as Glacier and one lion known Ungowwa
Lion Pen 1: contains one male lion referred to as Cheif and Bandit(dog)
None of these remaining pens have any angled top fencing (kick-in) or any species appropriate high tensile smooth
electrical wire to provide additional deterrents for escape.
In the Bear enclosure (four adult bears) with the pond, there were several broken pieces of a wooden walkway that
was lying on the worn pathway around the pond by the fence that had numerous nails sticking up through the wood.
During the inspection there was female bear that was pacing over the broken wood and nails.The bear appeared to
be avoiding the nails, however the possibility of injury is high with clusters of 2-5 nails approximately 1-2 inches in
length. In Tiger enclosure 4 there was a broken wooden spool that had collapsed with broken wood pieces and
exposed nails protruding through the wooden planks. Tiger enclosure 1 had multiple nails sticking out of logs that
were used as a shade area. All nails were rusty in appearance and long enough to cause potential injuries.
Exposed nails and broken pieces of wood can be sources of injury and infection if the regulated animals scratch or
puncture themselves on the materials.
The reported enclosures(Tiger 1,4,5 and Lion 1) need to be built according to standards and regulation as currently
they are not tall enough to properly contain the animals as these adult tigers could easily jump/climb out of the
enclosure if they were motivated to do so. An escape places the animal's life in jeopardy and may endanger the
safety of the public. All broken pieces of wooden material in walkways and climbing spools and any exposed nails shall be removed
and/or repaired to prevent any injuries to the regulated animals.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are six enclosures with 7 red foxs' and 1 gray fox, and 2 enclosures with 1 cougar female(Aurora) and 3
North American Porcupines that were on cement platforms out in the open, containing igloo dog houses or carriers
for shelter, however there was no shade available. A few of the foxes and the cougar were panting excessively as
they could not get away from the heat of the day, as the plastic igloos and carriers tend to hold heat and can
become hotter than the outdoor environment if not in a shaded area. There was a roll of shade material available
beside the enclosures that will be used to provide shade to the enclosures by the licensee, however it has not been
done at this time.
The inability for animals to get away from the heat by being provided a shaded area or structure that can protect the
animals from direct sunlight or heat buildup, can cause serious over heating and health issues and great discomfort
to the animal
Corrected by the end of the inspection.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
There were several Tiger water pools (enclosures' 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ) that were green with algae, including the bear
pond with (4 bears), 1 cougar and the 1 lion and dog(Bandit). The water pools had floating clumps of algae in some
areas or a coating of algae on the bottom or sides of the metal tubs/pools. The licensee is providing potable water at
least once per day via a hose that is offered to the tigers and lion for a half to one hour at a time. The licensee
advised that he was behind cleaning the tiger pools by three weeks due to construction of the new enclosures.
Algae buildup can cause the water to be a source of harmful organisms that can be toxic to the animal and cause
possible health issues. The buildup of algae can cause skin disorders and is not a suitable drinking source.
The licensee must clean the water pools and water drinking sources as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of
algae.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee and his wife.By the licensee signing this document, it is not an admission of guilt but serves to only reflect the licensees' receipt
of the report and exit interview.
