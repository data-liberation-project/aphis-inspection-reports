INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the latest semiannual facility inspection conducted by the IACUC, there was a major and a minor deficiency
noted. Both were reported to the IO. However, the IACUC did not assign correction dates to either deficiency.
Specific correction dates are necessary to ensure that all required repairs/corrections are conducted within an
appropriate time frame. When deficiencies are noted on a semi-annual inspection, the IACUC must submit a clear
plan with specific dates to address the deficiency.
To be corrected from this date foreward

ANNUAL REPORT.
The facility annual report for 2013 does not list any horses or cows. However, the facility used six horses and three
cows on teaching protocols which were obtained from another USDA licensed facility. These animals are
considered regulated and must be recorded on the annual report.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple vials of expired medication were found. In the large animal cart, and single tube of expired antibiotic
ophthalmic ointment was found. In the pharmacy, vials of expired Beuthanasia, injectable Rimadyl, and injectable
Cefazolin were all found. Expired medications may have unpredictable effects, and do not meet acceptable
standards of veterinary care. The facility must institute and maintain an effective system to detect and dispose of
expired medications.

3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL. In the large animal barn, a stall is being used as a temporary storage area for hay. This hay is in the process of
being picked through by facility staff in order to remove thorns and other unpalatable items. The waste is then
placed into large plastic bags and are thrown out as garbage. However, this temporary storage area is extremely
disorganized. There is what appears to be good hay in plastic buckets stored next to bags of "waste hay". The
entire area is jumbled and cluttered, with no clear distinction between waste and good hay. This is an ineffective
and unsanitary way to store food. The facility must clean and organize this area, and must ensure that all hay and
other food items are being properly and safely stored.
