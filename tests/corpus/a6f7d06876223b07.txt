2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** The female mouflon named Eudora in the loop area had a dime sized lesion on the front of her shoulder above
her right front leg. The facility representative stated that the lesion hadn't been noticed prior to the inspection. The
open lesion could've been caused by an injury. An open wound can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to
the spread of infection which affects the health and well-being of the animal. The licensee must have this animal
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis and treatment is provided. Any
medical records must be made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care to ensure the health and well-being of all of the animals.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
**** The holding barn area containing two grey foxes and a young pronghorn had an excessive amount of
overgrown vegetation surrounding the barn and the enclosures. The facility representative stated that the mower
used to trim the grass had been broken the day before the inspection. Allowing weeds, grasses and brush to grow
in the animal area could provide a living / breeding area for rodents, other pests and vermin. High weeds and
grasses can also prohibit the removal of excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. Potential health
risks exist if the animals begin to chew on and end up ingesting a weed that happens to be toxic. The licensee must
control all grasses and weeds to facilitate cleaning of the premises to protect the health and well-being of the
animals therein.
