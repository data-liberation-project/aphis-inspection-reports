FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The shed where the feed is stored is dirty, with spilled feed in piles and scattered on the floor under and around the
bags of food. The door was left open and there were insects and flies observed entering the storage area landing
on the spilled feed. The feed storage shed must be kept clean and the door closed in between retrieval of feed
bags to prevent contamination of the food stored there by insects, vermin, dirt and debris.

There is a large pile of bedding stored in the middle of a storage barn. The bedding pile is surrounded by
disorganized accumulations of discarded items and debris including: animal carriers, air conditioners,
de-humidifiers, plastic bags, plastic ties, wire mesh, tools, cardboard boxes, dirty plastic tubs and covers, hoses,
metal posts, boards, buckets, heavy machinery. etc... Pieces of debris, such as plastic, metal, strings, and caustic
fluid may contaminate the bedding. The disorganized piles of debris and discarded materials can also attract
unwanted pests such as rodents, snakes and insects. The waste from rodents and insects may contaminate the
bedding which could be hazardous to the health and safety of the animals.
Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
contamination,

3.26(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a strong ammonia odor in both of the buildings housing the guinea pigs and hamsters. The odors were
more intense in the large animal barn. The odor was strong enough to cause irritation to the inspector's nose and
eyes. Although there were several doors opened and fans being used to circulate the air, these were not adequate
to clear the air. The air conditioning and building ventilation system was not in use. The strong odors, inadequate
ventilation and availability of fresh air can cause discomfort for the animals and may result in respiratory health
issues. The facilities shall be provided with more fresh air, and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts and
odors.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were several water dispensers not functioning properly and not dispensing water to the guinea pigs and
hamster's primary enclosures. The inspector observed guinea pigs crowding around the malfunctioning dispensers
attempting to drink. The animal caretaker worked on the nonfunctioning dispensers at the request of the inspector
and as soon as they began to work again the guinea pigs rushed to drink. All of the drinking water dispensing
mechanisms must be maintained so that there is always drinking water available to the guinea pigs as required.
Corrected during inspection.
3.28(a)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Many of the primary enclosures for the guinea pigs have holes chewed in the front. The caretakers attempted to
close the holes with plastic and duct tape. The tape and plastic is not an appropriate material to adequately repair
the holes. The adhesive on the tape has not held, in addition the guinea pigs have chewed through the tape and
plastic repairs leaving openings in the enclosures for the guinea pigs to escape and/or unwanted animals enter.The
wire mesh covering the openings where the water dispensers are attached are separating from the plastic walls
creating gaps which the guinea pigs can escape through. If the guinea pigs escape through these openings they
will drop several feet in most instances, and either onto a cement floor or into the liquid waste filled tubs, and may
be injured. The inspector observed a guinea pig running loose in the building at the same time the doors were
open. The animal caretaker stated that he is aware that there are a few guinea pigs loose in the building and he is
in the process of trying to capture them. The loose guinea pigs are at risk of injury and exposure to hazards and
must be captured and returned to an enclosure. The primary enclosures for the guinea pigs must be constructed of
materials appropriate for the animals and be maintained to prevent injury, contain them safely, prevent escape and
so that they will not allow unwanted animals to enter. The primary enclosures must be repaired or replaced or the
guinea pigs moved to more secure housing.
Correct by September 26, 2014.
The loose guinea pigs were caught and returned to an enclosure. The tubs that were damaged with holes have
been replaced or repaired by the time the inspector returned to present the report and conduct the exit interview.
3.28(c)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The space provided for the guinea pigs in their primary enclosures does not meet the standards in this section.
Most of the enclosures have 20 guinea pigs each, a few had 30 guinea pigs, and a couple had 16-18 guinea pigs in
them. The dimensions of the plastic tubs are 48 inches long by 22 inches wide by 11 inches high with a total floor
area of 1056 square inches, however a portion of the floor space is taken up by a food receptacle which wouldshrink the space by the surface area of that receptacle. A sample weight was taken of the average sized guinea
pigs, these weights were: 284g, 315g, 369g, 381g, 387g, 341g, 441g, and 507g with g=grams. Each guinea pig
under 350g must have a minimum floor space of 60 sq. inches, and guinea pigs over 350g must have a minimum of
101 sq. inches of available floor space. For the current enclosures the most that they should contain based on
todays weights would be 10 guinea pigs. The number of guinea pigs in each primary enclosure must be reduced to
meet the space requirements in the Animal Welfare Act for the health and well-being of the animals.

3.29(d)
FEEDING.
The ceramic food receptacles that were in the enclosures were dirty and easily dumped by the guinea pigs. Food
was observed strewn throughout the enclosures combining with soiled bedding, and animal wastes. Eating
contaminated food may sicken the guinea pigs. Food receptacles shall be accessible to all of the guinea pigs in a
primary enclosure and located so as to minimize contamination by excreta. All food receptacles shall be kept clean
and shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
Correct by September 28, 2014.
3.31(a)
SANITATION.
The primary enclosures were excessively dirty. In several of the enclosures the floors contain hard and matted
accumulations of feces, hair, bedding and food debris. In two of the enclosures the inspector discovered
decomposing, dried out, flattened guinea pig carcasses with several live guinea pigs gnawing on them. The front
wire mesh covering openings where the water dispensers were attached have accumulations of hair, feces and food
debris, The walls of the enclosures had dirt and substances smeared on them. The enclosures that have some
loose bedding had large accumulations of feces and food debris scattered throughout. The new guinea pigs that
were delivered this morning were placed in enclosures that had not been cleaned and sanitized as required in this
section. There are plastic tubs in front of the racks that are filled with filthy liquid that appears to contain a sludge
composed of animal waste, discarded food debris, soiled bedding and water. Flies were observed by the inspector
swarming these containers and then entering the animal enclosures. There is duct tape and/or plastic covering
holes in the bottom fronts of most of the enclosures which are dirty with hair, animal waste and food debris.
Unsanitary living conditions for the animals such as described above are unhealthy and distressing to the guinea
pigs. The soiled bedding, accumulations of animal wastes and old food debris harbor bacteria that may sicken the
guinea pigs and attract pests including insects and unwanted rodents. The insects and unwanted rodents pose a
disease and parasite hazard. The animal caretakers stated that the enclosures and bedding are supposed to be
cleaned weekly.
The primary enclosures and the tubs beneath must be cleaned more often to facilitate the prescribed husbandrypractices set forth in this subpart as well as, for the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.
Corrected by September 26,2014.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
The inspector observed unwanted rodents entering and running around the animal enclosures in both the big
building and the building identified as the breeding building. The doors being opened without any type of barrier like
screening may contribute to the issue. There were numerous flies in both buildings and in proximity to both the
hamster and guinea pig enclosures. Insects and rodents may harbor and spread disease to the hamsters and
guinea pigs. An effective program for the control of insects and mammalian pests shall be established and
maintained.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Many of the wire mesh and wooden travel enclosures in which a shipment of guinea pigs arrived this morning were
damaged. There were sharp broken wires protruding into the enclosures. The sharp wires protruding may cause
injury to the guinea pigs. On some of the travel enclosures the wire had been separated from the wooden supports
and there were openings through which guinea pigs may escape. An employee stated that there were several
guinea pigs loose in the transport trailer when it arrived at the facility. The animal caretaker stated that when he was
unloading the shipment and picked up a travel crate the bottom fell out and all of the guinea pigs fell out too. The
structural strength of the enclosures must be sufficient to contain the guinea pigs and withstand the normal rigors of
travel. For all future transport the enclosures must meet these standards.
3.36(e)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
The guinea pig travel enclosures are 24 inches long by 15 inches wide which provides a total of 360 square inches
of floor space. The caretaker said that there were 15 guinea pigs in each travel enclosure. These enclosures
should not have had anymore that 8 guinea pigs each based on the sample weight taken of the animals delivered
by this inspector and a facility manager. Three out of the 3 out of eight guinea pigs sampled weighed over 350
grams but under 600 grams, therefore each guinea pig should have had a minimum floor space of 45 square
inches. Overcrowding in the travel enclosures may cause discomfort, fighting and injuries to the guinea pigs. The
space requirements in this section must be adhered to for the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.
Correct on all future transports.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The enclosures for the chinchillas and the ferret are dirty. There is a dried brown substance accumulated on the
rusty rims of metal boxes inside the chinchilla enclosures. The bedding is dirty with animal waste, and food debris
throughout. There are accumulations of feces in the corners and plastered to the wire mesh of the ferret enclosure
Soiled bedding and accumulations of animal wastes can harbor bacteria, creates irritating odors and attract
unwanted insects which increase disease hazards to the animals. The chinchilla and ferret enclosures must be
cleaned more frequently to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
