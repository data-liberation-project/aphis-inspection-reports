2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The record of acquisition and dogs on hand form (APHIS form 7005) is not complete. The "Acquired From" column on the
updated APHIS form 7005 is blank. This column must include name, address, USDA if licensed, or driver's license and
state and vehicle license and state for the person from where the dog was obtained.
Also, the licensee still did not have any records for the puppies that had been born and raised in the kennel.
Accurate and complete records are essential in keeping track of adult dogs and puppies in the kennel as well as following
them as they enter and exit the kennel. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records which correctly tracks all
animals in the kennel.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
