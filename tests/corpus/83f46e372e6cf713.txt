ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female fawn colored French Bulldog named Cola (tag number 141) had hair loss on a substantial part of her body
and a growth between the middle two toes on the front left foot. The skin on the chest and part of the abdomen was
pink and the dog was observed rubbing against the side of the enclosure, consistent with discomfort. The licensee
noticed the ailments on 3/18/18 and started treatment with Purishield. The ailments did not resolve within the
timeframe set forth in the program of veterinary care, and the licensee had not contacted the veterinarian before the
time of the inspection.
Lack of proper treatment can cause pain and discomfort. The license must have this animal examined by a
licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: The licensee spoke with the attending veterinarian and scheduled an appointment for the
morning of April 6, 2018.
This inspection was conducted with a facility representative, and exit interview was conducted with licensee.
