ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The facility had medications that were past the labeled expiration date. The expired medications included
Betagen topical spray (Expired 6/01/2015) and Doc Roy's Tri Omega 3 ( Expired 10/2014). These medications were
stored with other medications that were currently being used, and therefore ready to use. Expired medication may
not work as anticipated, could become contaminated or harm the animals. Usage of medications that are not
properly labeled may harm the animals. Licensee must establish and maintain a program that ensures medications
are not used past their labeled expiration date and ensure all bottles are labeled correctly.
