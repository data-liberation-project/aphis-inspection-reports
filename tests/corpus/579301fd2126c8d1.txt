A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:40 p.m. on

In addition to waiting 30 minutes, knocking on the residence door, and honking the vehicle horn, I called the phone
number provided and left a message. No responsible adult was available for inspection.
