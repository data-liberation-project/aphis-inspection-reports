SANITATION.
Along the left wall of the animal room, a yellowish brown liquid is noted to be staining the wall behind one bank of
primary enclosures. A wet, yellow to brown, organic material has accumulated on the floor around the caster wheels
of two of the banks along that wall. There is evidence of staining and corrosion on the affected wheels where the
liquid has dripped along the metal. An ammonia odor is present at the time of inspection. The accumulation of
malodorous material in the animal room could present a respiratory risk to the animals. Premises shall be kept clean
and in good repair in order to protect animals from injury and to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices.
