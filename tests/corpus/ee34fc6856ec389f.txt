The breeding shed had five enclosures housing a total of 17 ferrets that had broken wire with sharp points in the
back corner. The whelping shed had 25 enclosures housing a total of 57 ferrets that also had broken wire with sharp
points in the back of the enclosures. Sharp points could cause injury to the ferrets and broken wire may affect the
structural integrity, which could lead to failure to contain the animals. Remove sharp points by repairing or replacing
areas of broken wire to protect the animals from injury, maintain housing facilities in good repair and to contain the
animals. Correct by October 31, 2016.
