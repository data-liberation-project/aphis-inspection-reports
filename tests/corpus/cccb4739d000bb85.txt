ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care does not list drug names/dosages used for capture . There was a supply
succinylcholine in the refrigerator and the ranch manager indicated that was one of the drugs used for capture prior
to transporting exotic hoofstock. Paralytic drugs such as succinylcholine must not be used for capture. They have
narrow safety margins and a slight overdose can cause the animal to suffocate while conscious resulting in pain and
suffering.
The attending veterinarian must be consulted concerning drugs used for capture. The drugs with dosages must be
listed on the program of veterinary care and the recommendations must be followed to ensure humane and safe
capture for the animals.

algae growing in long strands from the sides of the trough. The algae extends from the sides of the trough to the
top of the water. Water bugs can be seen in the water. Animals need large amounts of fresh water in hot weather
and they may consume less if the water is contaminated. Potable water must be provided and water containers kept
clean to ensure the health and comfort of the animals .
