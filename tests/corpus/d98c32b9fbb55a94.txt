2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two goats in the pasture across the road each have an ~3cm wide fluid-filled swelling on the right side of the jaw.
These types of swellings can be infectious and need to be treated as such to avoid disease spread. These animals
must be treated according to the veterinarian's instructions.
The facility has been sprinkling fly bait in areas where the animals have access, and at least one animal had
evidence that it had been sniffing and/or eating the bait. The label on the bait states that this is hazardous to
domestic animals and must not be applied in areas where the animals have access.
Correct by 7/20/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
