ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:20am on
09-OCT-19.
I contacted the licensee by phone upon arrival to facility. The licensee informed me that he, nor his wife, were
available today to facilitate an inspection.
