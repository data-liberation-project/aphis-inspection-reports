FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the large outdoor enclosure for the goats and sheep there were several hazards. A low flatbed trailer is
accessible to the goats and sheep, and the wood on the platform is deteriorating with holes, broken sections, and
exposed rusty screws that extend about one inch vertically where the wood is now missing. In the event that the
goats or sheep jump onto this structure, which is only about one foot off the ground, they could be injured by having
limbs fall through, or being scraped by the protruding screws.
There are some large metal farming implements piled together - augers and a drag harrow - inside the enclosure
which have sharp metal edges, and pose a risk of limb injury / entanglement in the event that the animals climb on
them, or run into them.
In one corner there is a structure that contains miscellaneous equipment, including a small tractor / loader, a mower,
and some stacked animal crates. Additionally there are plastic containers that contain petroleum fuels located on a
low, unprotected shelf. These are accessible to the animals, and pose a risk of harm.
Animal enclosures must be appropriate for the animals involved, and should be free of items that could pose a risk
to the animals, in order to protect the animals from injury or harm.
To be corrected by 11/19/18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the assistant director of animal care, and the executive
director.
