Facilities, outdoor.
There is a large outdoor enclosure housing three groundhogs for public exhibit that has not been surrounded by a 6ft
perimeter fence. A variance to exempt the groundhog enclosure has not been submitted. While the enclosure is very well
constructed with a lockout area and double fencing and locked, it does require a perimeter fence according to AWA
regulations.

The perimeter fence provides a secondary measure to keep people and other outside animals from making direct contact
with the regulated animals, or as a secondary containment area if the regulated animal escaped thier primary enclosure.

All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient
height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Perimeter fences should be at least 6 feet high and at least 3 ft
away from the primary enclosure fence for other animals(not listed as dangerous animals), or provided a variance to be
without a perimeter fence that must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
