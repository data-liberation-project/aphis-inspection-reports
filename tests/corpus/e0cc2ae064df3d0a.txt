2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two animal incidents occurred in December, 2014 resulting in animal injury and possible animal injury.
On December 22, at the Yemassee center, two employees did not follow protocols when they left two doors open
while preparing to move cynomologus macaques into the heated backup areas and 26 animals escaped the
enclosure. The employees did not follow the escape protocol and call for immediate help. All primates were
recaptured within 48 hours, with only one injury which was treated. The two employees were fired and retraining of
all personnel in proper procedures was done.
On December 29, a primate about to be treated for minor trauma escaped from a transfer cage and ran over the
perimeter fence into the woods. Although searches were done the primate has not been found.
The facility needs to assure all handling protocols are followed to prevent further escapes and potential injuries.
Correct from this day forward.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
