ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
***On Tuesday, February 16, 2016, between approximately 11:58 AM and 12:35 PM, a responsible person was not
available to conduct an inspection. When the inspector arrived at the site, the door was locked and a message on
the door stated lunch was from 12 - 2 PM. The inspector called the number listed for the license, left a message and
then waited 30 minutes to see if anyone would call back. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
To be corrected immediately.
