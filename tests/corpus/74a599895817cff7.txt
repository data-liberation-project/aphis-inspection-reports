2.131(c)(1) Repeat

Handling of animals.
Since last inspection the facility added 2 clear tubes in to front wall of the Asian small-clawed otter enclosure for public
feeding interaction. Each is roughly 2.5 feet off the ground, 2 inches in diameter and 6 inches long extending into the
exhibit. These tubes are open at all times. During our inspection an otter on exhibit reached into the tube and touched a
finger of an inspector.
Unsupervised public can provide foreign material or food, and touch the animals. There are no barriers or signs present to
discourage public contact. Sufficient barriers are important to protect both the animals and the public, particularly when
there is not an attendant present to supervise interactions between the animals and the public. People or animals can be
injured by unauthorized direct contact and animals can become ill if they eat inappropriate food or objects presented to
them by the public.
The facility must must provide sufficient barriers or supervision to insure the safety of the public and the animals.
