Facilities, outdoor.
The back right corner of the perimeter fence outside of the hyena enclosure and backup area has began to slope
downward. Along this fence line, it now measures 93 inches instead of the required height of 96 inches.
Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
going through it or under it, permitting contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Fences less than 3 feet in
distance from the primary enclosure, less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, or use of an effective natural barrier to
protect the outdoor housing facilities must be approved in writing by the Administrator.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 8th, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
