ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1400 on
05/03/2016. The licensee was leaving soon and didn't have time to conduct an inspection with us at the time. I told
him we would come back another day.
End of report.
