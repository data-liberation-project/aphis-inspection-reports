2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
As stated by the licensee, part of the feeding process is to toss meat chunks through the feeding ports/holes in the
sides of the enclosures. This process unnecessarily causes the tigers to get excited, aggressive and rough with
one another as they run and jump towards the feeding port/hole. The process also encourages the tigers to stick
their heads out of the feeding ports/holes. The rough behavior created by the current feeding practice may cause
injuries to the tigers and must be discontinued or altered to reduce the potential for injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Many of the feeding holes created in the tiger enclosures are large enough for the tigers to put their heads, paws or
legs through. Although there are covers for these holes most are left open unless less experienced individuals are
working in the area per the licensee. These feeding holes pose a risk of injury to the tigers. If there are other tigers
in the enclosure and one has it's head or leg in the hole, one or more of the other big cats may jump or push and
cause injuries. The enclosures must be constructed and maintained to prevent injury to the tigers, therefore the
feeding holes must be altered to eliminate the animals from being able to put any part of their bodies through them.
