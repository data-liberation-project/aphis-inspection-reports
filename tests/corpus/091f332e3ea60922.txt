Item IACUC 2.31 d 8
At the time of inspection rabbit protocol 04-15-015 was reviewed. The protocol was approved for the investigator to
withdraw 25 ml of blood from the rabbit. In reviewing the rabbit surgery records the investigator withdrew between
28 to 30 ml of blood from the rabbits which was not approved by the IACUC.
The investigator needs to submit an amendment to the IACUC for the change in amount of blood withdrawn or
follow the approved protocol for 25ml .
