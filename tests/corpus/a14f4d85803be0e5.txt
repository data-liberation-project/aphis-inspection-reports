2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:20-1:50pm
on 09-OCT-18.
I, the inspector, tried to make contact at the house, shop and kennel. I honked my horn up by the house as well as
down by the kennel and shop. I waited in the driveway for 30 minutes. Once in an area with reception, I called the
number on file and left a message. I did not receive a returned call on 10/9/2018.
