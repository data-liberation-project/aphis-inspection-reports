3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility maintains one adult female bobcat, one adult male bobcat and two adult raccoons of unknown sex on the
premises. The perimeter fence enclosing the facility is less than six feet in height and constructed of widely spaced pipe.
The fence is inadequate because it cannot serve as a secondary containment system for the animals housed in the facility
and cannot prevent other animals and unauthorized persons from entering.
The licensee must modify the existing fence or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 6 feet in height (for
the species inventoried at the time of this inspection), a minimum of three feet from the primary enclosures, and
constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the animals in the facility.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
