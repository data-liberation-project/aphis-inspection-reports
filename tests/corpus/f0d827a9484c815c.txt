ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). However, the written
PVC is not complete.
-There is no current vaccine program for the young/juvenile goats which are born on the premises.
-There is not a complete description of the method of euthanasia performed at this facility. There is reference to the
AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia (June 2007), however, this document is not included in the paperwork or attached
to the PVC. Furthermore, the newest version of the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals is the 2013
addition.
-The Emergency Care section of the PVC does not adequately describe provisions for emergency, weekend or
holiday care. It does not include contact information such as a phone number or a veterinary clinic address for the
attending veterinarian or other designated emergency veterinarian.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a complete and accurate written program of
veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility. The written program of veterinary care will ensure that there
is accurate communication between the licensee and the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine
medications and vaccines provided to the animals by the licensee are done with the direction and knowledge of the
attending veterinarian.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a one gallon bottle of Betadine Solution (expiration date of 05/10) and a one gallon bottle of Veterinary
Surfactant (expiration date of 12/95) located in a cabinet in the Procedure Room.
There were several expired vials of vaccine products for goats and sheep (for example, a vial of Corynebacterum
Pseudotuberculosis Bacterin-Toxoid expired in April 2014) comingled with other medications/vaccines located in a
refrigerator in a laboratory room.Failure to properly label vaccines and medications as being expired and storing them with in-date medical materials
may lead to the unintentional use on regulated animals. As part of the program of adequate veterinary care, a
system
of timely and appropriate identification, separation, and labeling of expired medications must be in place to ensure
the
health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several goat pens with 1) multiple, protruding, fencing wires 2) gaps within the fencing material and 3)
gaps between the ground and the bottom of the fencing. In at least two of the goat pens, corrugated metal sheeting
with sharp, protruded edges was identified. Also, in Pen#4 there was an exposed nail head in a feed bunk.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.

WATERING.
-There were several water receptacles in the goat pens which contained an excessive growth of algae on the sides
and bottoms of the receptacles as well as several with long, strands of algae floating at the surface.
-At least two of the goat pens had an insufficient quantity of water provided given the number of goats present in
each
pen. The ambient temperature the day of the inspection reached above 100 degrees F.
Water receptacles which contain excessive debris or algae or those which have an increased temperature reduce
the
potability of the water. All water receptacles must be of sufficient size and be kept clean and sanitary. A system
which provides clean, potable water must be provided at all times or as often as necessary to ensure the health and
comfort of the animals.

- Procedure room: In general, there was a moderate accumulation of dust and dirt on the walls, floors, plastic
curtains
and equipment in this room. The floor was unsealed with several areas containing large cracks and crevices. There
was old, dried blood splatter on walls, cabinets, floor, stanchions, and other equipment and devices. The inside of a
few cabinet drawers and multiple stanchions contained a moderate amount of rust. There was an accumulation of
clutter, dirt, debris and discarded items including an old, blood-stained rag in drawers. One lower cabinet contained
old, dusty boxes, discarded medical use material such as intravenous fluid lines mixed with facility maintenance
products such as paint cans.
- The isolation pens were empty at time of inspection however they are not properly cleaned and ready for use. A
few pens had old, dried excreta on the ground. One pen contained old, brittle hay left-over in a feeding bin. Several
areas of these pens had a buildup of dirt, debris and rust including a platform for a mineral block. Also, there was a
water receptacle in one empty isolation pen which contained old, stagnated water with a heavy accumulation of dirt
and algae.
Premises including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean, free of clutter or discarded materials and
in good repair in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, to prevent the harborage of vermin and
pests, minimize disease hazards, and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. A system of maintaining
effective cleaning and housekeeping practices must be in place.
