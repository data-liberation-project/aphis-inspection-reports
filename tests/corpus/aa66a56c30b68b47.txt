CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, a large dog was transported to the International Terminal Customs Area from the cargo
hold of an airplane by Swissport, an intermediate handler, after arriving on Swiss International Flight 38 from Zurich.
There was no signed declaration from the consignor indicating when the dog was last offered food and water, and
what the feeding and watering instructions were to be during transport. The owner's declaration regarding food and
water is essential to help ensure the proper care of the animal, especially in the event of any unexpected delays.
Transporters should take steps to ensure that all dogs and cats that they transport will travel with this
documentation, and that it is securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a manner that makes it
easily noticed and read. The intermediate handler should take steps to ensure that the carriers for which they
handle animal cargo abide by these requirements from this time forward.
3.14(a)(6)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the time of inspection a large dog was transported to the International Terminal Customs Area from the cargo
hold of an airplane by Swissport, and intermediate handler, after arriving on Swiss International Flight 38 from
Zurich. The dog was in a crate which was not correctly labeled. There were no "LIVE ANIMAL" markings on the
crate, nor were there "Up Arrow" markings to indicate the correct upright position. The "LIVE ANIMAL" and arrow
labeling on the crate help to ensure that animals in transport are handled properly by all carrier and intermediate
handler personnel, in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the animals. Transporters should take steps to
ensure that all primary enclosures for dogs and cats are correctly labeled at the time of consignment with "LIVE
ANIMAL" on top, and one or more sides of the enclosure, and arrows to indicate upright positioning. The
intermediate handler should take steps to ensure that the carriers for which they handle animal cargo abide by
these requirements from this time forward.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
At the time of inspection a large dog was transported to the International Terminal Customs Area from the cargo
hold of an airplane by Swissport, an intermediate handler, after arriving on Swiss International Flight 38 from Zurich.There were no food or water receptacles in the enclosure. Food and water receptacles enable the dog or cat to be
offered food and water during transport, or at any time as needed, according to the consignor's instructions, or in
the event of delays, and are essential to ensuring the well-being of the animals in transit. Transporters should
ensure that upon accepting animals for transport there are food and water receptacles in place that are securely
attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure
without opening the door. The intermediate handler should take steps to ensure that the carriers for which they
handle animal cargo abide by these requirements from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with a Swissport representative.
