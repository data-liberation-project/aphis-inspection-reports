NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The licensee has not notified the Regional Office that this site is no longer being used. The persons managing this
site have moved and the reindeer has been moved. The inspector does not know the location of the new site and
so is not able to conduct an inspection of the facility and the animal(s). The licensee must notify the Regional Office
in writing of the location of the new site.

2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00 pm on
11/04/2015.
I spoke with the owner of the property and he said that the animal caretakers have moved and I verified that the
reindeer is no longer at this site. I tried to reach the animal caretaker by phone, but the number had been
disconnected. I called the licensee and left a message, but got no response.
