SANITATION.
Cleaning of Primary Enclosures.
**There were 9 adult male Yucatan pigs housed in one pen that was approximately 15' x 25' in size and the cleaning
of the pen is done once a day in the late afternoon. At the time of the inspection (11:30 AM) the entire floor space
of the pen was covered in a moist semi-solid mixture of fecal matter, urine, and saturated wooden shavings. There
was no dry, unsoiled floor surface in the enclosure, the feet/lower legs of the pigs were soiled with some of the
moist fecal mixture, and there was an unpleasant odor.
Per this Section of the Regulations, excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to
prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors.
More frequent cleaning of the primary enclosure and/or housing fewer animals in this enclosure are indicated to
prevent contamination, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.
Correct from this date 10/4/19 forward.
NOTE - Exit briefings held 10/2/19 on-site with facility representatives and on 10/4/19 by phone with the Licensee.
