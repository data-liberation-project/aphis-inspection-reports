2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male ShihTzu "Max" (0A01477902) was exhibiting watering from the right eye. Upon examination, the
conjunctiva appeared red, the cornea opaque and there was a green moist crust along the edges of the eye. The
licensee was not aware of the eye problem and had not consulted a veterinarian about the problem. Eye problems
be painful, rapidly worsen and lead to blindness. Licensee shall have the dog examined by a licensed veterinarian,
document the diagnosis and execution of any treatments.
The female Dachshund ( Wiggles or Sue, licensee unsure and the MC scanner not working) was removed from her
enclosure to examine her teeth. Upon examination the dog had a thick, blood-tinged, gray discharge coming from a
surgery site on the abdomen. The licensee explained the dog underwent a Cesarean-section a week prior. Even
though the sutures were intact, the edges of the skin were not apposed. Animals that have received a surgical
procedure should be monitored for secondary issues which can affect the health and well-being of the dog.
Licensee shall have the dog examined by a licensed veterinarian, document the diagnosis and execution of any
treatments.
**BOTH DOGS MUST BE SEEN BY A LICENSED VETERINARIAN NO LATER THAN NOON ON 8/24/2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
