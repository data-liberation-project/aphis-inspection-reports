Outdoor housing facilities.
There are four outdoor enclosures housing 13 adult collies. Three enclosures have three collies, and one enclosure has
four collies. There is another outdoor enclosure that houses 4 juvenile, approximately 4 month old, collies. Each
enclosure has a single igloo dog house contained in it.

Outdoor facilities for dogs must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor
facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner,
and to turn about freely.

Additional shelters must be added to these enclosures to provide the animals contained shelter from the elements and to
allow each animal in the shelter to sit, stand, and lie down freely. Shelters provide protection from rain, wind, and snow
and are required for the comfort and welfare of the animals.

To be completed by June 25, 2021.

Outdoor housing facilities.

There are 13 adult collies, 4 juvenile collies, one Rottweiler, 2 Labrador retrievers and 8 shelties in outdoor enclosures
with a single shelter. These shelters do not have wind and rain breaks at the entrance to the shelter.

Outdoor facilities for dogs must include one or more shelter structures with a wind break and rain break at the entrance.

A wind break must be added to the front of these enclosures to protect the animals from the rain and wind. Wind and rain
breaks are necessary to keep animals warm and dry and prevent discomfort.

Primary enclosures.
The licensee has two dogs tethered inside an enclosure. An female black lab with id 998554 is tied with heavy chain to
two 18" to 22" logs. The licensee stated this was done so that the dog could not jump out of the enclosure. There is a
male chocolate lab with id 22498398 in the same enclosure that is tethered to the fence to prevent it from escaping the
primary enclosure.

Permanent tethering of dogs is prohibited for use as primary enclosure.

Tethering is not allowed for use as the primary enclosure. Primary enclosures must be constructed to contain the animals
without the use of tethering. The use of tethers can lead to injury or strangulation of animals and possible death. The
female, black lab was unchained and placed inside the sheltered kennel at time of inspection.

In an outside enclosure in the second enclosure on the left with a 2 female collies with id's 17591, and 1532039, and 1

the dogs drank from 45 - 60 seconds straight.

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs.

Water must be provided to dogs constantly to prevent dehydration and risk of disease.

8712041 housed in sheltered housing that also has excessive feces in the primary enclosure.

primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
