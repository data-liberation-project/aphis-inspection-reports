HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The pigs were locked in a dark-colored metal livestock trailer at the fairgrounds at 2:30 pm when the temperature
was around 90 degrees F. Staff was not on site until 2:20 PM, when two employees arrived and opened the trailer.
There was an air conditioning unit, which was turned on low. An employee, who identified himself as the road
manager, stated that there was normally a fan in the trailer in addition to the AC unit, but it had been moved last
night. The AC unit had a temperature gauge at the level of the pigs and read 89 degrees. The independently
measured temperature was also between 89-90 degrees. During the whole period of observation, the animals were
not panting, did not appear to be overheating and displayed normal behavior.
As soon as the situation was identified, the AC was turned up to high, the front door of the trailer was opened for
cross ventilation and a misting squirt bottle was used to decrease the temperature to 85 degrees. The road
manager immediately sent an employee to buy additional fans for the trailer to replace the one that had been
moved. After the new fan was placed, the temperature measured at the level of the pigs was 82 degrees.
Animals need to handled in a way that prevents overheating. A system should be put into place to assure that the
temperature inside the animals' traveling housing structure is maintained within a range that protects their health
and prevents discomfort and overheating, especially during the hottest part of the day.Corrected during inspection.
