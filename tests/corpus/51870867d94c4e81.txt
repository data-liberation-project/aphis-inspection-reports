2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A dark brown male adult llama is extremely thin. The ribs, spine, hips, and shoulder bones are prominent with minimal fat
under the skin, and the abdomen is tucked. The owner stated that the llama had good body condition last year, but had
been out on the pasture over the winter, and when it was shaved on 4/29/21 the severe weight loss was seen for the first
time. The owner stated that the attending vet was contacted, and the animal was dewormed per the vet’s instructions and
it has been provided with extra food.
An adult female white, brown, and black domestic sheep is reluctant to bear weight on both front feet. When the herd of
sheep run, this sheep falls behind. The owner stated she had looked at the sheep this morning and did observe any
lameness, but that this sheep may not have been moving around when observed.
Llamas who are extremely thin may suffer from weakness, muscle loss, cold stress, electrolyte imbalances, and
weakened immune systems. Sheep who are lame suffer from pain, discomfort, and may be reluctant to walk to find food,
water, or shelter.
Correct by May 13th, 2021 by observing all animals on a daily basis to assess their health and well being, and ensure that
a mechanism for frequent and timely communication with the attending veterinarian is in place for communication about
any problems that are identified.
