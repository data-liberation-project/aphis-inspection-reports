ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One brown male Toy Poodle identified as “Bobzien's Tadpole” ( Microchip # 0006C39013, DOB 5-31-2009) was
observed to have a heavy buildup of brown calculus/tartar material over the upper canine teeth and lower cheek
teeth. No mouth discomfort was found during examination. Calculus/tartar buildup on teeth was found to be
partially covering the gum line on the upper canine teeth and the right lower cheek tooth. No active bleeding nor
discharge from gums was observed in these areas during the inspector exam.
Accumulation of large amounts of tartar or calculus on teeth may result in the development of gum disease,
infection and tooth loss. In turn, this may also further impact the well-being of an animal by causing chewing
discomfort, inappetence and weight loss.
Tadpole needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian within fourteen days and an appropriate plan of
treatment established to address the observed dental tartar issues. Written documentation of veterinary evaluation
and treatment also need to be available for review upon inspector request.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
