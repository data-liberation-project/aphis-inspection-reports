HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the baboon and bonnet macaque exhibit, there were swinging ropes that were frayed in many areas. Fixtures in
the enclosures should be removed or replaced when worn in order to protect animals from injury. A system of timely
identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In one of the tiger's night enclosures, the step box of the wood climbing structure was worn and created sharp
exposed edges and had a nail sticking up. The sharp edges and exposed nail could come into contact with the
animal and cause injury.
***The wire mesh material (used to prevent digging and escape) in a coyote enclosure, housing two coyotes, was
exposed in several areas. The exposed mesh poses a risk of injury to the animal such as by abrading the foot pads
or entrapment and fracture of the legs.
***The two houses in the wallaby and muntjac enclosure had light fixtures with exposed light bulbs that were not
covered. The exposed light bulbs poses a risk of injury to the animals if it breaks and glass gets into the enclosure
of these animals.
***The doorway of the house for the muntjacs was in disrepair and worn away on one side, exposing wood and the
mesh lining. Chewing and ingesting this material is a health risk and can cause injury to the animal.
Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. A system of
monitoring and maintenance should be in place so that all housing facilities remain structurally sound and in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.Date to be Corrected: November 20, 2017
