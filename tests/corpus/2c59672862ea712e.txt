2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are three bottles of expired injectable medications in the refrigerator of the whelping building: Combi-Pen-48
(2/2013), Bactracillin G Benzathine (5/2015), and Cal-Phos Sol (Nov 2010). The usage of expired medical materials
such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and
does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when
expired drugs are administrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The
applicant must ensure that all medications used are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard
veterinary practices. To be corrected by 23 June 2015.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The feet and legs on one Shiba Inu mix puppy were seen to pass through the openings of the floor of the enclosure.
Dogs whose feet are able to pass through the openings in the enclosure floor are at increased risk for injury. The
licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the
dogs' and cats' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' and cats'
feet to pass through any openings in the floor. To be corrected from this point forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees, Kendall Lundy, ACI and Margaret A Shaver,
VMO in attendance.
