ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The seven (7) brown fronted and six (6) ringtail lemurs are in appropriate social groupings and have an
adequately enriched environment. The spider monkey is single-housed in an adequately enriched environment and
is able to see other non-human primates.
However, there is no current written environmental enrichment plan available nor is there documentation or
provision of additional enrichment items to encourage appropriate species-typical behavior. The environmental
enrichment plan must be developed, and reviewed by the attending veterinarian to ensure the non-human primates
are provided with activities that allows them to express species-typical behaviors.A written environmental
enrichment plan must be developed with the attending veterinarian and implemented accordingly for the
psychological health of the animals. Additionally, the environmental enrichment plan must be available for review by
an APHIS inspector to ensure compliance with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength: Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or
electric wire. The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel
poles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest
upon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep
roots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is
approximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. The enclosure currently houses a ~3 year old male lion and a ~ 2
year old female lion with limited mobility. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure
containment of the animal. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats, additional
containment measures must be made to the lion enclosure to prevent escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were made.
The exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
