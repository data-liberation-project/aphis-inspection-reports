3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
One female husky is in a pen with a dog igloo shelter structure that is not large enough for her. She is several inches
taller than the structure and cannot stand in the structure or lie in a normal manner and turn about freely. This dog needs
a larger structure that provides adequate shelter from the elements while allowing her to be in the shelter in a comfortable
manner.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility uses a PVC pipe that runs down the far wall of the outdoor pen for the dogs to have a continuous flow of
water. In one enclosure the pipe opening had floating algae in the water and in a few other pens there was a layer of
algae and grime on the PVC opening. These PVC water receptacles need to be cleaned and sanitized at least once every
two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent this accumulation of algae and debris.
