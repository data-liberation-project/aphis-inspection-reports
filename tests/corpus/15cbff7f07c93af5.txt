ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While conducting this inspection it was noted that one of the rabbits was in need of attention. There was a long
haired, grey rabbit being housed in a newly constructed outdoor enclosure. It was noted that this rabbit had some
matted fur present. Due to the nature of this particular rabbits coat, this rabbit will need to be brushed out on a
regular basis. The matts will need to be removed and a system will need to be implemented to ensure that this
rabbit is observed daily and his coat is kept free of matting again.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
While reviewing the records it was noted that the acquisition forms, that contained USDA #'s, Driver's License #,
and Vehicle Plate #'s, information was no longer being used. Therefore, the required information was not being
collected on the newly acquired animals. It was also noted that there was no documentation on the animals that
were donated or sold. All records need to be kept currant, and accurate, as to whom they were acquired from or
donated / sold too.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
1. Behind the buildings there are outdoor, year round enclosures for the Canadian Lynx and 3 foxes, and other
animals during the summer months. However, during this inspection it was noted that the gate to the barrier fence of
the Canadian Lynx enclosure was left open. Due to the fact that the public has access to this area, this barrier fence
needs to be kept securely locked at all times.

2. This area is also enclosed with a perimeter fence. However, the gate to this area was simply being closed by the
chain link clasp. To ensure the safety of these animals this gate will need to be securely locked when the facility is
closed. ***To Be Corrected By: March 4, 2016

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
While conducting this inspection it was noted that the Vervet enclosure was in need of repair. This primate has
begun to pick at small pieces on the walls and ceilings. This is now exposing bare sheet rock, wall board. These
areas can not be readily cleaned and sanitized. Therefore, these areas will need to be addressed.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
While reviewing the Primate Enrichment Plan it was noted that the facility addressed 2 Ring Tailed Lemurs.
However, they have 3 lemurs. There is also a newly acquired vervet monkey on the premise. However, the
Enrichment Plan did not address this primate. This form will need to be updated, approved, signed and dated by the

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. In the large room that housed the palm civit, and other mammals, there was a small section of damaged
wallboard present. This area was to the left of the civit enclosure and under the bird "Tikki"s enclosure. The base
board is partially missing. There is a wood board over the majority of the hole. But there are areas to the left, and
right, of this board that expose jagged wall board. There is also a gap between the base of the wall and the floor.
This area can not be properly cleaned and can also be an area that the smaller animals can escape into. Therefore,
this baseboard will need to be replaced.

2. In the kitchen there is a hole in the drop ceiling panel just above the door. This hole was made for a hose to run
from the alligator pool to the kitchen sink. However, the hole is ~6" in diameter, while the hose is only ~1" in
diameter. This extra large space can allow for animals to escape or other animals to gain entry. To ensure that the
area is maintained structurally sound this panel will need to be repaired.
