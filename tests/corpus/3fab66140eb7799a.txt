Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The facility currently has two Animal Use Protocols for regulated species. The related records did not contain a letter
notifying the principal investigators and the research facility in writing of the IACUC's decision to approve the protocols.
The facility representative (an IACUC member) stated that no approval letter was written. Approval notification letters are
necessary to ensure that both the principal investigator and the facility know the IACUC has approved the protocol and
that animal use activities described in the protocol may begin. The IACUC shall notify the principal investigators and the
research facility in writing of its decision to approve or withhold approval of the activities related to the care and use of
animals or of modifications required to secure IACUC approval. Correct by Sept. 30, 2022.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The facility currently houses two guinea pigs that were acquired on Jan. 29, 2021 and are used for teaching students. The
protocol approving the teaching done on this species as stated by the facility representative lists multiple other species
but not guinea pigs. No other approved protocol including guinea pigs exists. A proposal to conduct an activity involving
animals must identify the species and approximate number of animals to be used so that proper oversight can be
provided to assure the well-being of the animals.


All protocols to conduct activity involving animals must contain an identification of the species and the approximate
number of animals to be used. Correct by Sept. 30, 2022.

Annual report.
The Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report submitted to USDA APHIS Animal Care did not list all animals upon which teaching
was conducted. The animals included guinea pigs housed long term at the facility and rabbits used on the 'AUP for Lab
Animal'. Accurately reporting all animals is necessary to ensure that Animal Care and the facility know the species and
numbers of affected animals so that professionally acceptable standards governing the care, treatment and use of
animals can be assured. The Annual Report shall state the common names and numbers of all regulated animals upon
which teaching was conducted. Correct by Sept. 30, 2022.

This inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The exit was conducted with a facility representative and the
attending veterinarian.
