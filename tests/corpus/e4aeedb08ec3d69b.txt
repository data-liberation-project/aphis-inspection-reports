Adult, male Yorkshire terrier with chip number 095 065 077 is limping on his left front leg when walking. When
standing still, he was seen holding up his left front leg multiple times. No sores or wounds were seen on the leg.
Limping is a sign that the dog is uncomfortable and can be caused by a variety of possible problems including
arthritis and trauma. The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,
including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the
inspector upon request.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**There are holes in the dirt floor of two enclosures on the east side of the property. One enclosure housing two
Labrador retrievers has a hole under the divider fence leaving a gap between the divider and the ground and
extending under the concrete apron of the shelter structure in the next enclosure. The other is in an enclosure
housing one poodle and is undermining the shelter structure creating a gap. Holes under fences and structures can
cause injury to dogs who try to crawl in the space between the fence/structure and the ground.
**There is a crack in the metal flashing in the door of one enclosure in the whelping building. The crack has a sharp
edge that is upturned on the surface the dogs walk on to exit the indoor section of the building risking injury to the
dogs.
***The licensee must maintain the facility in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals
securely.
The dogs cited under 2.40 b 2 on the inspection dated 24 March 2015 have been addressed.
This was an inspection of the facility only. Records were not reviewed during this inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative, Kendall Lundy, ACI, and Margaret
A Shaver, VMO in attendance.Additional Inspectors
