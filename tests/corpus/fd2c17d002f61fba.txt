3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure housing the bushbaby is not being maintained and is need of repair. The wire mesh at the top of the
enclosure is thin and the hammock the bushbaby uses is hanging from this wire mesh resulting in sagging and
instability such that there is a risk of the animal falling if the wire mesh breaks. In addition, there are small areas of
the wire mesh broken at the top of the enclosure with sharp points in the interior of the enclosure. This enclosure
needs to be addressed and maintained in good repair for the safety of the animal.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure housing the coati mundi, there are areas of the wire mesh where the mesh is broken or missing
with sharp points present.
In the enclosure housing the arctic and red fox, the wire mesh on the lower part of the enclosure is broken and bent
resulting in sharp points in the interior of the enclosure.
The enclosure housing the pig is not structurally adequate. The facility reported the pig has escaped the enclosure
several times which has resulted in damaged areas of the chain link fencing which are currently being held in place
by bungee cords and broken pieces of concrete positioned against the bottom of the fence.
Failure to maintain housing structures in good repair poses hazards including injury to animals and animals
escaping. These enclosures must be maintained in good repair for the safety and containment of the animals.
3.126(c)FACILITIES, INDOOR.
An insufficient amount of light is provided in the garage housing the pig and two foxes. Upon entering the garage,
the overhead lights were off and there is only a small window resulting in very little outdoor light.
Failure to provide ample lighting of good quality, may not allow for routine inspection and cleaning of the animals
and enclosures. Lighting in the garage needs to be addressed to facilitate proper husbandry practices.
