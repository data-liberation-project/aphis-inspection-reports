Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The protocols did not contain species justification. The protocol template was newly adopted and this section was
inadvertently omitted from the new template. Protocols must contain a rationale for involving animals, and for the
appropriateness of the species to be used.

Providing such a rationale is essential for the IACUC to review and assure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act in the
appropriate use of animals in research.

All protocols involving use of covered species must contain such a rationale prior to IACUC approval.

To be corrected by March 1, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
