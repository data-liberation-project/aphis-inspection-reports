2.31(c)(6) CRITICAL REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On April 17th, 2019, 4 cats underwent blood collection and bone marrow aspiration and were euthanized with
sodium pentobarbital. It was determined that the sedation regimen used did not adhere to the approved protocol
#201702530. Also, the procedure was not approved as a non-survival surgery. On May 9th, 2019 the lab technician
stated the medical records were incorrect, and that procedures had been conducted per the protocol and that
animals received proper sedation. On May 16th, 2019 the PI outlined the exact sedation protocol and procedures
that occurred and confirmed that they deviated from the approved protocol. The protocol included bupivacaine as a
local anesthetic to mitigate pain during bone marrow collection. The cats received only high dose ketamine and
acepromazine for the procedure.
As a part of the approved protocol #201808752 a procedure was performed on the right eye of a rabbit on June 8th,
2020. The rabbit appropriately received analgesia (Meloxicam) prior to the procedure. The following day during post
procedure checks, the laboratory noted that the animal was recovering well and behaving normally. On post
procedure day 3, the animal was reported to the veterinary staff for ocular inflammation when it was discovered that
the animal did not receive Meloxicam 24 hours after the first dose per the protocol.
By not following the approved protocol, a research animal may experience greater pain or distress than was justified
to or approved by the IACUC. Principal investigators will not deviate from approved protocols until they submit
proposed modifications to protocols involving animal activity for review and approval by the IACUC prior to
implementation of such changes.
2.31(d)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On June 18th, 2019 the University of Florida IACUC full committee voted to suspend two protocols: Study
#201609496 “Effects of maternal cortisol on perinatal cardiac metabolism and function” and Study #201709691
“Therapeutic use of dichloroacetate in treatment of perinatal mitochondrial deficiency and cardiac dysfunction.” The
IACUC chose to suspend these studies effective June 19th, 2019 at 5pm for eight weeks due to deviations fromapproved surgical technique and analgesia procedures, as well as due to housing sanitation deficiencies identified
in a May 16th 2019 USDA inspection report. These protocol suspensions were not reported to USDA, as required.
The facility must develop a system such that the Institutional Official, in consultation with the IACUC, shall review
the reasons for suspension of a protocol, take appropriate corrective action, and promptly report the action with a
full explanation to USDA. Failure to do so compromises APHIS officials’ ability to evaluate and monitor animal
welfare compliance in a timely manner.
Correct by August 15th, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
