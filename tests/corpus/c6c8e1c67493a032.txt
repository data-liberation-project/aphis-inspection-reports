NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
The registrant is operating a cargo office at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for various airlines that
transport animals. The Swissport personnel frequently receive and handle animals in transit for the carriers that use
this cargo office. Although Swissport North America Inc. is registered with USDA / APHIS / Animal Care as an
intermediate handler, they did not inform Animal Care that SEA should be included as an active site. The SEA site
was cancelled on 9 MAR 2015. Failure to notify Animal Care means that routine inspections cannot be conducted,
which could put animal welfare at risk.
The registrant must immediately notify Animal Care in writing requesting the SEA site be added to their registration.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the General Manager, Swissport Cargo on 11 JAN 2018.
