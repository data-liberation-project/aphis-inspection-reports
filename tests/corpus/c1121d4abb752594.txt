2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection only one elephant ("Beulah") was present. While looking over her nails, foot pads, and
cuticles it was noted that her cuticles were in need of attention. The cuticles were long and jagged and needed to be
trimmed. We reviewed their vet care log and it was documented that her toe nails and pads were trimmed on March
21, 2017. However, there is no documentation about the cuticles being addressed. To ensure her health and
prevent any injuries this situation will need to be addressed.
