2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility’s program of veterinary care did not include written provisions and outlined care for the newly acquired
species. The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian regarding the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written
program of veterinary care is available for review during all USDA inspections.
Each facility shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the applicant.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete acquisition records for the newly acquired prairie dogs and hedgehog. The complete
name, address, and required information of the person from whom the animal was purchased were missing. In addition,
disposition records were not available for a possum.
Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring


born on premise, are necessary to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care
and use. The applicant shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition of all animals that fully and correctly
discloses the required information.
