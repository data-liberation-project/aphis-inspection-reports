INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) only met once in 2014 and once in 2013. The meetings
were held on February 25, 2013 and November 5, 2014. Protocols were not reviewed during the last meeting.
IACUC oversight is intended to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Inadequate
program oversight may be detrimental to the welfare of the animals used in the program. The facility should meet at
least once every six months to review their program for humane care and use of animals, inspect all animal
facilities, and perform any other necessary functions required in paragraph (c).

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There were no protocols available for review at the time of the inspection. The facility did have incomplete
descriptions of some of the procedures used on animals. Protocols should include: the rationale for the species and
number of animals to be used with a rationale for the numbers, a complete description of the proposed use of the
animals, a description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that
which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research, and a description of any euthanasia method
to be used.The IACUC is responsible for reviewing and approving all activities using regulated species at the facility thus
ensuring facility compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Without complete written protocols the IACUC cannot
adequately perform these functions. The IACUC should ensure that proposals to conduct activities involving animals
include the appropriate information prior to approving the proposal. Additionally, any significant changes to activities
should have IACUC approval prior to their implementation.
