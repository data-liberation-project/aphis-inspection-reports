2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific
guidance for the animals regarding parasite control of intestinal parasites. There are no specific drugs, route or
dosing included with the following statement: deworm in spring and fall. Species specific drugs, dosing and route
must be included in the written PVC. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used
by the licensee. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure that the attending veterinarian is aware
of the current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide
adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing a complete, accurate written
Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility. Correct by November 19, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility owner and his wife.
