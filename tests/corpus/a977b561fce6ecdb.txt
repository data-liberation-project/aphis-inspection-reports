Feeding
Two metal self feeders, accessed by a total of approximately two adult dogs and three puppies, have an excessive
amount of wood shavings covering the food or mixed within it. The dogs cannot consume the food without potentially
ingesting the wood shavings.

Contaminated food may interfere with a dog's desire to eat and its ability to receive adequate nutrition which could result
in poor body condition, illness, and other serious health issues.

Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination. The licensee must remove all the wood shavings from
the feeders and ensure that all food provided to the dogs is clean and uncontaminated.

Veterinary care for dogs.
Review of the Program of Veterinary Care revealed that vaccination for Parvovirus should be given at 4 weeks of age and
6 weeks of age. The licensee is vaccinating for Parvovirus at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks of age.


The schedule for vaccinating for Distemper in the Program of Veterinary Care is 5 weeks and 7 weeks of age. The
licensee is vaccinating for Distemper at 4, 5, 6, and 7 weeks of age.

Failure to follow the vaccination schedule in the Program of Veterinary Care, which has been reviewed and signed by the
licensee's Attending Veterinarian, does not ensure the puppies are receiving appropriate protection against serious and
deadly diseases including Parvovirus and Distemper.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes a schedule for the vaccination of contagious and /or deadly diseases of
dogs. The licensee must follow the vaccination schedule documented in the Program of Veterinary Care to ensure the
puppies are receiving adequate protection against contagious and/or deadly diseases.
