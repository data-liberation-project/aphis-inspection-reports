2.38(f) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
On August 7, 2016, there was an incident involving gerbils in which intraperitoneal injections were administered and
next day 4 gerbils were found dead and 4 were euthanized by the attending veterinarian.
The PI self reported the incident to the IACUC and had a discussion with the research staff which concluded that
the culture media was contaminated due to a change in color of the culture media (yellow) which indicates that the
ph had change and there was a possibility of contamination. Regardless of the observation the staff decided to
wash the cultures with antibiotic media and proceeded to administer it to the animals.
The PI acknowledge that this is not an acceptable or standard working practice.
The PI provided a corrective action plan to the IACUC containing an sop for injection of gerbils and another sop for
retraining the staff involved in handling of materials used for injection in the study. Also samples suspected of been
contaminated will be reported to the PI and not injected to the animals.The PI will monitor laboratory staff to ensure
the corrective actions are properly followed.
The Plan was reviewed by the IACUC and approved and later implemented by the PI. The IACUC considered the
matter resolved in the September monthly meeting.
The incident was managed and corrected by September 23, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
