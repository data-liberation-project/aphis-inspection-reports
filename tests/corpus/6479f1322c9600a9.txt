2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A ten year old gray fox named (cid:28)Zoe(cid:29) died on 8/30/15. The day before, according to staff, she was observed to be
uninterested in food, and unwilling to leave her den, which was unusual. A staff member in charge of animal care
said that she was cold to the touch, and that they placed her on a heating pad. The staff member stated that the fox
was very old, and that she suspected the fox was dying. Another animal keeper stated that it was a Sunday, and it
would have been difficult to consult a veterinarian on a Sunday. The next morning she was found dead in her
enclosure. There was no veterinary consultation during this episode preceding the death of the fox.
The Program of Veterinary Care should include daily observation by staff, to include appropriate, prompt
communication with the attending veterinarian, or his or her alternate if not available, in the event that any health
problems are noted. Failure to consult with a veterinarian could result in unnecessary suffering and / or a poor
medical outcome for the animals.
This issue was cited previously in 2014, and was to have been corrected immediately.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
