**Upon arriving at the address the inspector noted the facility did not appear to be occupied. There was overgrown
grass and bushes in the front yard in addition to several unopened newspapers in the drive. An attempt was made
to call the licensee, however, the call was forwarded to voicemail. A note was posted on the front door indicating
the facility had been uninhabitable since June 5, 2015.
**The owner failed to inform the AC Regional Director about the change of address in a prompt manner.
**Due to the condition of the property and the note on the front door, it is clear the owner did not notify the AC
Regional Director about any changes within 10 days as required.
**The licensee shall promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of ANY change in the name, address,
management or substantial control or ownership of his business or operation, or of any additional sites, within 10
days of any change.
