3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Approximately 25% of the enclosures have side walls with a buildup of dirt and grime. Approximately 75% of the
enclosures have a buildup of bedding, fecal material, and debris between the wire dividers that separate one
column of enclosures from the next column.
Failure to clean enclosures to prevent a buildup of dirt and debris can cause unpleasant odors, lead to
contamination of the enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of
the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material
and sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.
