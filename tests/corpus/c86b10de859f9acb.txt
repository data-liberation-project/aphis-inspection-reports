3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several of the dog runs, the gates that divides the runs into two sections was in disrepair. The chain link used in
the gates was becoming unraveled at the bottom forming sharp edges, which could injure the animals in the run.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and must protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by June 1, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives.
