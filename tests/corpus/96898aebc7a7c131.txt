2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Shih tzu (“Mach”, 020-523-263) has an abnormal appearance to the left eye. The eye appears cloudy and is
light blue in color. There is a small amount of dark coloration in the center of the eye and the white of the eye is
slightly reddened. The licensee stated that the dog had been to the veterinarian within the last month for a dental
cleaning, but there is no documentation from the veterinarian about the condition of the eye. Poor eye health could
cause pain or discomfort to the dog.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment
plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times. The licensee spoke to the
attending veterinarian and transported the dog to the clinic for treatment at the time of the inspection.
The following two dogs cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on the previous inspection report were evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian and received treatment:
Male Golden Retriever (“Chance”, 0A0207441)
Female Shih tzu (“Ming Lea”, 0A02071258)
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
