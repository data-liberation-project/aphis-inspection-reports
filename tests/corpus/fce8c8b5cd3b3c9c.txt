2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public barrier in front of the wolverine enclosure to the left of the glass viewing area is not far enough back
from the enclosure. The inspector was able to reach across the barrier and grab onto the chain link fence. For the
safety of the animals and guests the barrier needs to be moved back so there is a sufficient distance and guests are
not able to touch the enclosures or potentially the animals.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The storage shed next to the kitchen area needs to be addressed. The facility is keeping recycling cans in the
building as well as cigarette butts in a can on a shelf. In addition there were mouse droppings and a dead mouse in
a container that need to be removed. These items need to be moved to another area to protect the food supplies
from potential contamination and to reduce pests in the area.
