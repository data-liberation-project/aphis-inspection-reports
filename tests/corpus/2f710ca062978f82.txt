FEEDING.
-There were at least three self-feeders with a build up of dirt and grime inside the mouth of the feeders where the
dogs access the food. There was also a feeder that appeared rusted in the base and mouth of the feeder where the
food rests. The rust, dirt and grime can increase the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that food
receptacles are kept clean and are sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart at all times. To be
