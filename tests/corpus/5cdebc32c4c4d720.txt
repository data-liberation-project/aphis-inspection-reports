ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** On March 9, 2016 the attending veterinarian conducted an exam of a female spider monkey and recommended
“diagnostics and physical exam” for an enlarged abdomen. The facility has not given the AV permission to
complete these recommended procedures. The animal is currently at the facility. The licensee must ensure that
all recommendations for treatment/care/exams/testing are followed and that the AV have the authority to make
those decisions. Failure to assure the appropriate authority of the attending veterinarian does not ensure adequate
care for animals at the facility.

2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Several sheep and goats on exhibit in the petting area enclosure are in need of veterinary care:
*At least four goats (two black and two brown colored goats) were noted to have multiple approximately silver dollar
size round to oval areas of hairloss on their sides/trunk. These areas had distinct margins between normal and
abnormal areas. The skin in these areas was flaky in appearance with white/grey flakes visible adhered to the skin.
*One adult large white sheep and one adult brown goat had visible areas of swelling. The white ram had a large
baseball size swelling under the left side of its jaw/neck. The brown goat had an egg size swelling in front of left
shoulder/lower neck area.
The facility representatives with the inspectors during the inspection were not aware of any sheep/goat issues when
asked. Multiple versions of caretaker records were reviewed. None noted the skin lesions. Regarding the swellings,
one version of the 8/8/16 record (Vet Care) show no mention of any goat or sheep issues. A second version of the
8/8/16 records (Daily Care) mentions that “noted female goat with abscess on shoulder will have vet check on Wed
and recheck lamb with growth on neck”. No previous notations of evaluations, diagnosis or treatment of a lamb with
a growth on neck could be found in the records. A veterinarian had been out to the facility on 8/8/16. He was
contacted and stated that he saw two other animals on the afternoon of 8/8/16 but was not asked to look at any
sheep or goats. He did state that he was coming out on Wednesday afternoon 8/10/16 to look at some animalsincluding a goat.
All daily observations of problems in animal health need to be communicated to the veterinarian to ensure that an
appropriate diagnosis is made and a treatment plan can be instituted to ensure the health of the animals and the
safety of the public that has contact with the animals. A veterinarian needs to examine the goats and sheep to
determine a diagnosis and set up a treatment plan for the skin lesions and swellings. Documentation should be kept
of all communications with the veterinarian, the diagnosis and all treatments.
*** A female spider monkey was euthanized on July 20, 2016 according to facility records. During the exit interview
the licensee stated that the animal had been going downhill for quite some time. There are no records on hand for
this animal prior to the day of euthanasia (7/20/16). After veterinary exam on 7/20 revealed difficulty breathing in
the animal, euthanasia was elected.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** During this inspection, the African elephant was observed on 2 occasions without her handler immediately
available when the public was present in the zoo. The first occasion was after the handler gave her a bath and left
her unattended while he worked on cleaning the barn. The second was after rides were completed for the day at
which time he drove up in his truck after inspectors noted the elephant was alone. The barrier between the elephant
and the public consists of either single strand electric wire fencing or areas of livestock panel/gates that are not
structurally strong enough to contain the adult elephant should she choose to get out of her area and into the public
areas. The facility must ensure that the handler is with the elephant at all times when the facility is open or choose
to construct a primary enclosure that will adequately contain the elephant.
*** The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of animals. This
includes camels, sheep, goats, muntjac deer, fallow deer, bongo, llama, giraffe, sitatunga, oryx, zebra, and kudo.
These animals are housed in the walk through area of the zoo which is open to the public. There are no barriers or
signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate and
coin feeders are located throughout the facility. Also, inspectors noted members of the public picking grass and
weeds from the facility grounds and feeding it to the giraffe. There are no attendants present during public contact
and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material
with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public contact does
not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must ensure that during periods of public exhibition
animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so
as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these
animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the
safety of both the public and the animals.Correct from this day forward
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The current primate enhancement plan still does not address special considerations for nonhuman primates that
need special attention regarding environmental enhancement, such as nonhuman primates showing potential signs
of psychological distress through their behavior or appearance to ensure that their psychological needs are met. As
part of the plan for environment enhancement, the licensee must ensure that all nonhuman primates showing signs
of psychological distress through appearance or behavior are evaluated by a veterinarian and provided special
attention regarding the enhancement of their environment in addition to, taking into consideration the needs of the
individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian. The facility must develop,
document, and follow an appropriate plan for the environment enhancement for these animals and any other
nonhuman primates requiring special considerations. No written changes to the plan have been documented.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The buried fence flooring for the African crested porcupine enclosure near the freezer has areas under both
shelters where the flooring has been significantly uncovered by the animals and/or the sand has eroded. This area
is in need of repair or replacement to ensure the animals are able to rest on a solid area not on wire and to avoid
potential injury to the animal feet/legs. The facility must ensure that all animal enclosures are maintained to
adequately contain the animals and protect them from injury.
3.127 REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The facility was notified by APHIS in a letter dated January 21, 2016 that the variance for the perimeter fence
was rescinded. Currently, there is no perimeter fence for several animal enclosures including the breeding farm
area (specifically the zebra and camels), and the breeding muntjac, fallow deer, bongo, camels, zebra, kudu,
blesbok, and portions of the giraffe and sitatunga at the main zoo.
*** Areas of the perimeter fence areas are impossible to inspect because it has been overgrown by brush. This
includes the west side of the facility and behind the fallow deer, bongo, and sitatunga enclosures. This area of
perimeter fence is not functional in its current condition. The licensee must ensure that no trees or brush are
affecting the structural strength or the ability to inspect the fence.
Failure to maintain a functional perimeter fence does not keep unwanted persons out or act as a secondary
containment for the animals. The licensee must conduct a thorough self-inspection of the entire perimeter to ensurethat all areas have an appropriate perimeter fence that is functional and complies with written requirements.
***Inspection conducted on August 9, 2016 with the licensee and other facility staff. Exit interview conducted with
the licensee on August 10, 2016. APHIS officials were Randy Coleman, ACI, Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO and two
representatives from USDA-APHIS Safety and Security Staff.
