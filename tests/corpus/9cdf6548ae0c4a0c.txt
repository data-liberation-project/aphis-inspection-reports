Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
One dog arrived at SAN on Alaska Airlines flight 1176 from Seattle, WA on AWB 027-92025382, and was inspected by
the APHIS official at 1:15 PM. Although instruction for watering was displayed on the shipping crate, there were no
instructions provided for feeding. Instructions that do not include feeding are not acceptable unless directed by the
attending veterinarian, and there was no evidence of such guidance from the attending veterinarian.

Failure to provide instructions for feeding during transport may result in handling that could be detrimental to the well-
being of the animal. It is the carrier's responsibility to ensure that instructions for feeding and watering are provided when
animals are accepted for transport.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the cargo representative.
