ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care does not provide a complete description of the veterinary care to be
provided the animals. There is no mention of any routine care to be provided the non-human primates. More
description is needed of what kinds of ectoparasite control will be done and how often especially because several of
the bovine species have too many flies on them. Dewormers should be listed and dosages given. The section on
euthanasia states the veterinarian or the licensee will do euthanasia, but does not say what AVMA approved
methods will be used. The written veterinary care program states fecal exams will be done yearly, but this is not
done. The licensee and the veterinarian need to describe in writing and full detail what veterinary care will be
provided and by whom. Although the licensee and the attending veterinarian have discussed changes to the written
Program of Veterinary Care, they have not completed it yet.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Three capybaras have lived in a dirt floor enclosure for several years. They are provided drinking water in a black
rubber tub and they have two turtle shaped kiddie pools for the purposes of soaking. These pools are only 12 inches
deep and during this inspection, a capybara was observed in one. It had defecated in the pool and was lying down
in the pool. The water level was maybe 4-6 inches deep, inadequate to even get the sides of the capybara wet.
Capybaras use water to cool down, for mating, and for foraging for food. The lack of an adequate body of water
(large enough and deep enough) for a capybara to submerge its body can lead to overheating, behavioral stress, or
unnecessary discomfort. A suitable water source needs to be provided for the capybaras. To be corrected by July
22, 2014.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wooden den shelter for the brown capuchin has a layer of old dried feces on the floor of the shelter. Den boxes
need to be adequately cleaned in order to prevent disease hazards. The hard surfaces with which nonhuman
primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta. Clean
surfaces daily in order to prevent accumulation of excreta.3.78(e) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The 4 foot chain link barrier fence in front of one row of primates, including rhesus and snow macaques, and a
spider monkey is 39 inches from the fronts of the enclosures. If an adult visitor reaches toward the fence, it is
possible to be close enough for the primates to reach out and easily come in contact with visitors. The fence needs
to be further away from the non-human primate enclosures so that visitors cannot reach the non-human primates
and so the macaques cannot spread potentially dangerous body fluids to the public. The owner has set the steel
posts for the new barrier fence however it is not cmpleted at the this time. The barrier fence should be completed for
the safety of the macaques and the public.

WATERING.
The automatic water receptacle that is shared between the aoudads, the 2 llamas, and alpaca has green algae
slime in the water on the llama side of the water receptacle. On the aoudad side of the water receptacle there are
numerous mosquito larvae. In order to ensure the health and the well-being of the animal(cid:25)s clean water needs to be
provided in clean receptacles. Correct by July 8, 2014.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
