Facilities, general.
Several sections of fencing around the barn area and front yard area are in disrepair and need to be fixed. These sections
have wires that are broken and protruding into the enclosure. There was a broken board with nails exposed that was
protruding out towards the runway where reindeer pass through to the main yard. Another section of fencing was leaning
and needs to be structurally reinforced. These sections of the primary enclosure must be maintained in good repair to
protect and contain the animals.

Sanitation.
Throughout the barn and surrounding enclosures, there are discarded materials including: broken wood pallets, large
round brushes down on their sides, blue plastic containers, worming syringe tubes, fencing that is not secured, feed
buckets and a wire dog crate. These items left in animal enclosures creates a safety hazard for the animals.

In the main barn, there is one stall that is closed off to the animals but contains trash, old grain bags and other discarded
items. A stall adjacent contains old reindeer antlers in a large pile. These areas can become a breeding and living area for

pests.

There was an accumulation of cobwebs, dust, fur and debris on the fans and walls in the main barn. This accumulation
can trap additional debris and contribute to an odor in the barn.

These areas must be kept clean and maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals and to facilitate good
husbandry practices. Areas that are designated for trash, should be cleared as necessary to protect the health of the
animals.

Sanitation.
There was an excessive number of flies throughout the barn area, around food bowls, fecal areas in the yards and on a
pull string for light in the barn. The facility representative states he is spraying for flies but this does not seem to be an
effective program to control the number of flies in the area. An effective program needs to be established which may
include a multi-prong approach to control the numbers of pests for the health and comfort of the animals.
