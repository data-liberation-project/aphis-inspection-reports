3.15(a)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
In January 2022, a poodle puppy (10 weeks old at pickup on January 7) was ground-transported from Missouri to Oregon
in a wire crate. The puppy arrived on January 24th, soiled, with urine and feces dried into the fur of her legs and perineal
area according to a veterinary report.
Transport of dogs in collapsible wire crates does not meet the criteria for primary enclosures in transport for a number of
reasons. They are not made to withstand the rigors of transport. The crates are easily damaged; the wires can be bent
and broken; there is enough flexibility that animals can escape around a closed door or through the bottom tray slide
access.
The large openings between the wires of the crate allow the puppy to get body parts out, and items that were placed on
top were accessible to the puppy in the enclosure, where the items could get chewed and/or ingested.
The wire crate had no handholds to allow for handling without possibility of contacting the pet inside.
The wire crate did not have the required Live Animal markings and markings indicating the proper upright position.
A primary enclosure must have a leakproof bottom and enough litter to absorb and cover excreta to prevent the dog from
getting soiled. The shallow plastic tray in the wire crate with a puppy pad does not meet this requirement, which resulted
in the puppy in the crate getting soiled.


Transporting dogs in wire crates can lead to soiling, injury, or escape.
Correct by transporting in appropriate primary enclosures from this point forward.
3.15(c)(2)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
The wire crate used to transport the puppy had no projecting rims as required to keep space between the crate and other
items in the vehicle.
Lack of spacers can result in items getting up against the sides of the enclosure, resulting in poor ventilation.
Correct by transporting in appropriate primary enclosures from this point forward.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
The food and water bowls are in a holder which is sitting loose on the floor of the crate. Food and water receptacles must
be securely attached inside the primary enclosure to prevent them spilling, so they can be accessed from outside, and to
prevent them from becoming projectiles on rough roads, with hard braking, or other transport mishaps.
Correct by using appropriately secured food and water dishes from this point forward.

This exit interview was conducted with the registrant by telephone. Most of these non-compliant items have since been
corrected. The registrant is currently transporting animals in "airline-style" plastic crates, with food and water dishes
secured to the inside of the door, documented with photos.
