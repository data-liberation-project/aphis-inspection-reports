Requirements and application.
This was a search inspection.
The facility had applied for a license to conduct regulated activity but failed their first prelicense inspection on February
11, 2020. At the time, they did not have a perimeter fence on the property. Additionally, they did not have a program of
veterinary care or environmental enrichment program for their nonhuman primates. After this prelicense inspection, I
instructed the facility manager to contact me for his second prelicense inspection.
Approximately one year later, the facility is still open to the public for tours as well as private interactions with 1 red
kangaroo, 1 black-tailed wallaby, 2 black and white lemurs and 1 common brown lemur. Individuals can sign up online on
the facility's website for the tours and interactions. Additionally, their social media page posts pictures of public members
interacting and feeding their animals. After speaking with the head keeper and the facility manager, they confirmed they
were conducting regulated activity. I made them aware that they were conducting regulated activity without a license and
that they would need to be licensed in order to continue to conduct regulated activity.
Conducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that APHIS
officials can assess the care of the animals. The facility manager must either cease regulated activity or obtain a license


from the USDA to continue conducting regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act.
No regulated activity may be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the head keeper initially with a follow up call to the facility
manager.
