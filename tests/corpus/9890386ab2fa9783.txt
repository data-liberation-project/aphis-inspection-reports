Handling of animals.
The licensee has three adult brown bears, two juvenile brown bears and two adult black bears. The three adult brown
bears are still housed in separate metal barrels that measure 4’ wide by 5-6’ long. The female black bear is still housed in
a metal barrel that measures 4’ wide and 5-6’ long. All four of these bears remain locked into these metal barrels with no
ability to move out of the barrels if desired. The 4-6 year old Female adult brown bear that is locked in a barrel (not
attached to an enclosure) now has an unknown number of cubs inside the barrel with her. These cubs could be heard
vocalizing, but could not be visualized in the barrel during inspection. When asked the licensee stated he did not know
the number of cubs inside the barrel. At the time of inspection, these bears were awake in their barrels with no access to
food or water. Additionally, the climatic temperatures was 32 degrees F.
Bears that are awake and locked into these metal barrels are in a state of unrelieved suffering as they have no ability to
move out of the barrels, no access to food and water and have limited ability to self-regulate temperature during winter
weather conditions. Bears that are awake during their hibernation period and housed in metal barrels are susceptible to
hypothermia as the metal barrels are not insulated and provide no warmth.
Handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

All animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Appropriate
space, housing, food, and water must be provided to these bears to relieve undue suffering.

Space requirements.
The licensee has 3 adult brown bears, 2, two year old juvenile brown bears, and 2 adult black bears. Three of the adult
brown bears are still locked in metal barrels that measure 4' wide by 5-6' long. The 4-6 year old female brown bear that
does not have an attached enclosure now has bear cubs. The bear cubs were vocalizing at time of inspection, but could
not be seen inside the barrel. The licensee is unaware of how many cubs are in the barrel with the female brown bear.
The female black bear is locked in a metal barrel that measures 4' wide by 5-6' in length.

Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal
postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Inadequate space may be indicated by evidence of
malnutrition, poor condition, debility, stress, or abnormal behavior patterns.

The metal barrels that 4 of the 7 bears are housed in are too small to allow the animals to move freely or make normal
postural and social adjustments. The bears cannot change position or turn around without contorting their bodies due to
the lack of space in the barrels. Appropriate enclosures must be provided to the bears to alleviate undue suffering.

Facilities, outdoor.
The licensee has 3 adult brown bears, 2, two year old juvenile brown bears, and 2 adult black bears. Three adult brown
bears are still locked in metal barrels that measure 4' wide by 5-6' long. The 4-6 year old female brown bear in a barrel not
attached to an enclosure now has had bear cubs. These bear cubs were heard vocalizing, but could not be visualized in

the barrel. The female black bear is also locked in a barrel that measures 4' wide by 5-6 ' long.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

Metal is unforgiving, and creates an environment around the bears that is too cold for the current outdoor temperatures.
An appropriate shelter must be provided to the bears to alleviate the state of unrelieved suffering.
3.129(a) Direct Repeat

Feeding.
Two of the adult brown bears, and the two juvenile brown bears were noted at time of inspection to be awake and moving.
Food is still not being offered to these bears.

The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health. Animals shall be fed at least once a day except as dictated by hibernation, veterinary
treatment, normal fasts, or other professionally accepted practices.

The bears must be fed daily, or at a minimum when they awaken from hibernation/torpor to ensure they maintain an
appropriate body weight to sustain them through the winter, and to alleviate suffering.

Watering.
Two adult brown bears and the two juvenile brown bears were noted to be awake and moving at time of inspection. The
two juvenile brown bears that were housed together in a single barrel have now been given access to their full enclosure

at time of inspection. The licensee stated that he had just given access to the entire closure for these juvenile bears just
prior to inspection. These bears were observed pushing one another to gain access to a small, frozen puddle of ice, and
also observed chewing and licking the ice. Water is still not being offered to these bears. At time of inspection the barrel
that the juvenile brown bears were housed in was opened to allow access to their enclosure.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal.

Potable water must be offered to the animals daily to sustain the health of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
