ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female black and white Juliana pig named Piggy Sue is walking abnormally. She is walking on the tips of
her back hooves, and her back appears slightly hunched over. The licensee had the pig walk around so the
inspector could better observe her gait. The pig limped slightly on her left hind leg, and while standing still, would
sometimes hold her left rear leg up under her abdomen. When putting the left leg back down, she would again
stand on the tips of her hooves. The licensee stated she had not noticed the abnormal gait before the inspection.
An abnormal gait can be an indication of illness, injury, and pain.
The licensee must have the animal evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and provide
the inspector the documentation of this visit upon request. The licensee must ensure there are appropriate methods
in place to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries for the health and well-being of all the
animals. *Note: The licensee made an appointment with the attending veterinarian for that afternoon during the
inspection.
