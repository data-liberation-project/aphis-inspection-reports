Facilities, general.
During this inspection it was noted that the wallaby enclosure is in need of repair. The walls of the enclosure are
constructed of fake rock work and bamboo slats. However, there are at least 4 areas were the bamboo slats are 8" - 12"
apart. These gaps are large enough to allow people to gain access to the animal and also for the animal to escape or
injure itself. To ensure the animal is securely contained within this enclosure, these areas will need to be addressed.
