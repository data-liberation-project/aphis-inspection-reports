No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.
This was a focused inspection on the NCIs' from the inspection on September 25, 2014.
Both dogs #103 M Pekingese and #168 F Shihtzu that had right eye issues have been seen by the attending
veterinarian who properly diagnosed and prescribed treatment for both dogs. On this date the eyes on both dogs
have improved and look like they are healing well. The licensee has increased their daily observations and is
keeping a detailed and updated treatment log of all animals in the facility and providing timely treatment by the
attending veterinarian as needed.
The licensee has reduced the number of dogs in each primary enclosure that was too small for 3 dogs down to 2
dogs per pen. Currently the spacing requirements are being met at this facility according to AWA regulations and
standards.
