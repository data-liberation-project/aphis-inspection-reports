3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wall behind the sixth enclosure from the right on the North side of the building has two holes in it. The larger
hole is approximately four inches long by two inches wide. The smaller hole is approximately two inches in
diameter. The holes are at a level that the three dogs housed there can reach.
These holes can cause an injury if the dog gets a limb caught in them.
Housing facilities must be kept in good repair to protect the dogs from injury. The licensee must repair these holes
and keep the facility in good repair at all times.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
