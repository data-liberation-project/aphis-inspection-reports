ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two Shih tzu dogs, 095 and 053, have discernible conditions affecting their eyes. #53, the white female, has the
right eye colored a filmy blue with a large white opacity on the surface, with thick yellow discharge along the bottom
eyelid and the face matted with wet fur. This dog's left eye also has a small amount of brownish yellow discharge
and a white pinpoint opacity on the surface. #95, the black and white female, has the right eye colored a filmy blue
with red streaks across it, and the white part of the eye is injected with red. This eye is similarly wet and the hair
surrounding is matted by a thick yellowish brown discharge. The facility representative was not aware of this
condition and no treatment was being administered at the time of the inspection. There was no eye medication on
hand during the inspection. When contacted by the inspector, the attending veterinarian stated that these dogs
need to have treatment initiated as soon as possible, and in accordance with the attending veterinarian's program of
veterinary care.
The eye is an extremely sensitive organ, and even slight problems are painful. Conditions affecting eyes that are
left untreated can also lead to irreversible blindness. Licensees must ensure that their program of providing
adequate veterinary care includes timely identification and treatment of eye conditions in accordance with the
veterinarian's instructions.
Corrected at the time of exit: the attending veterinarian was scheduled to evaluate these dogs and provide
treatment before the end of the day.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
