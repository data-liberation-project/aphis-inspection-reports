3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Roughly half of the outdoor portions of the enclosures (especially those facing south - the licensee's wife stated
these enclosures are used more often) have floors and dividers that have excessive rust where the black coating of
the wire has worn away and the underlying metal is exposed and rusty. Additionally, some of the dog door frames
on the indoor portions have rusted metal areas, and the hinges on the outdoor dog doors also appear rusted. Rusty
surfaces do not facilitate cleaning and sanitization, as the porous character of the metal can harbor disease agents
such as virus, bacteria, or parasites. Correct by repairing or replacing all surfaces affected by excessive rust to
allow proper cleaning and sanitization.
