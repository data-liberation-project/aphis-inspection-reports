3.28(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two out of five guinea pig enclosures were overcrowded. The enclosures measure 16x30 inches, providing 480
square inches of space. The regulations require a minimum of 101 square inches per animal over 350 grams, and
the average animal weighed 900 grams. One enclosure had 6 large guinea pigs, and the other had 7 large guinea
pigs, exceeding the four animals that fit in that space by regulation. Since they are sharing the enclosure, they only
have 68-80 square inches of floor space per animal.
The animals should be provided with adequate floor space so as to facilitate adequate freedom of movement.
Failure to provide adequate floor space could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals. A
system must be in place to house the guinea pigs in enclosures appropriate to their size.
