2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:38 on
18-JUL-18.
Upon arrival at the facility, I knocked on the door of the house located at the facility site. An adult answered and
indicated she is a tenant and that she has lack of familiarity with the animals, their care, and their records. She
relayed she did not have Mr. Roy's phone number, due to another family member being the point of contact with Mr.
Roy. I called Mr. Roy's primary phone number at 11:38 AM, and I left a message then waited at the site for 30
minutes. I then left the facility and returned approximately 45 minutes later, anticipating I might have heard from Mr.
Roy by that time, or that I might see him at his facility at that time. After recognizing he still was not at his facility and
had not called me back yet, I left the facility.
