2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care did not include all of the species located at the facility. The Dromedary Camel, and
domestic cats and dogs where absent from the plan. A facility representative stated they had the Dromedary Camel
since December of 2016. The dogs and cats became part of the exhibition when the property became a location of
public entrance for the viewing of all animals on the property. Previously, only animals that were taken to off-sight
locations for petting zoos were on exhibition.
The lack of guidance for appropriate methods to maintain the health of all regulated animals can cause preventable
injury or disease, and/or the wrong treatment and care for the animal when something does occur. The licensee
must make formal arrangements with an appropriate and knowledgeable veterinarian which includes a written
program of veterinary care for all regulated animals at the facility to include the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday
care.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A piece of wire fencing attached to the bottom of a metal tube gate had broken wires that stuck into the enclosure
with one farm hog and five potbelly pigs. The farm hog was rooting in that portion of the enclosure.
Broken wires and sharp points can cause injuries to the animals in the enclosure. The facilities shall be structurally
sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
TO BE CORRECTED: Corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.127(d)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence around the Dromedary Camel enclosure was not six feet tall in several locations. Also, there
were sections of approximately six foot fence that were supported with posts that were shorter than six feet making
it flexible. The fence was easily bent to the height of the posts with a light push from a human hand effectively
making it less than six feet in height
A perimeter fence that is not of sufficient height and construction does not protect the Dromedary Camel from other
animals and unauthorized persons. The fence must be at least six feet in height, and constructed so that it protects
the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized person from getting through it or under it and
having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility.
