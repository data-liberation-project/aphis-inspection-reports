2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male coati cannot use his hind legs to stand or walk. Durning the inspection, the animal appeared reluctant to
move unless the Director moved him. He also has hair loss and scab-like lesions on the left hip area. This animal
also has a thin body condition. The male coati became ill in December 2013. The staff found him outside in his
enclosure not acting normally. He was evaluated by the attending veterinarian on 5 December 2013 for this problem
and was given fluids and antibiotics for suspected frostbite.The facility has kept the coati in an enclosure in the
office building since that time where they have been trying to strenghten his rear legs and encourage him to eat.
They believe the right leg has started to improve. The zoo director states that the coati doesn't consistently well.
They know that there is one type of dog food he will eat readily but they ran out of that food about 1.5 weeks ago
and have not gotten more. The Director states that they talked to the attending veterinarian a week after the initial
evaluation and they continue to give him occasional verbal updates. The attending veterinarian has not revaluated
this coati since the initial visit in December. Regular veterinary evaluation and care, including when medical
problems do not resolve, are essential for the health and well-being of the animals. The facility must have this
animal examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on 5 April 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the last year the facility has added two new young white-tailed deer to the deer enclosure. These two young
deer are very outgoing and seek out attention at the enclosure fence. They were observed during the inspection to
come to the fence and try to reach and nibble anything accessable to them. There are no addtional public barriers
or sufficient distance to keep the public from having contact with these deer. The Zoo Director states that he knows
that the public often tries to feed them through the fence. He states that he always comes out when he sees this
happen but he is not at the zoo or available during all public hours. Sufficient public barriers provide sufficient
distance between the public and the animals to ensure safety to both. In this case the young deer are seeking out
attention from the public which puts them at risk of ingesting things that could cause them harm. The facility must
ensure sufficient distance and/or barriers are in place so as to protect both the viewing public and the animals. Tobe corrected 3 June 2014.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility has an environmental enhancement plan for nonhuman primates but they are not following the plan. The
plan outlines different activites or objects for them to interact with each day. Instead of these approved and
prescribed activities, the facility is currently changing toys/balls hanging in the enclosure weekly and offering seeds
and nuts on occasion (mostly when the weather is nice according to the Director). They are also offering a food
dispensing toy about every week. Environmental enhancement plans are part of the overall plan to promote
psychological well-being in nonhuman primates. The facility must develop, document, and follow an appropriate
plan for environmental enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being for the nonhuman primates.
The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate
professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian. This plan must be made
available to APHIS upon request.To be corrected by 3 May 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Zoo Director.
