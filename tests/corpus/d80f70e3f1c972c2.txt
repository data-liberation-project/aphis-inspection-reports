Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In different outdoor enclosures housing capuchins, squirrel monkeys and marmosets, there was a noticeable
accumulation of peanut shells and excreta on the floor that was growing mold. At this time, outdoor enclosures are
thoroughly raked at least once a month. Additionally, the indoor housing for approximately 10 tamarins had an excess
accumulation of excreta, urine and discarded food in the catch pans underneath the enclosures.
Excreta and food waste much be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily and from underneath them as
often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates
from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. Planted areas in primary enclosures
must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
To be corrected by February 1, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Executive Director and various facility staff members.
