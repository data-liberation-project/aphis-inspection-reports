Health certification and identification.
On 11/26/2021, the registrant transported a 4-month old female spider monkey across state lines without obtaining a
health certificate. Health certificates are important for ensuring that animals are healthy, fit for travel and appear free of
any infectious disease or physical abnormality that would be a danger to themselves, other animals, and the public. A
health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian, dated not more than 10 days prior to the transportation, must
accompany all non-human primates. To be corrected from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
