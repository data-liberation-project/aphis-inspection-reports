PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Additional space requirements for dogs.
***An adult female Miniature Pinscher was housed in the large kennel building within a stack type cage enclosure.
This enclosure was measured at 19 inches high. This height provided 3 to 4 inches of free head space for the dog,
not the required 6 inches. All enclosures must be constructed to provide at least 6 inches of free head space above
the dog's head while in a normal standing position. Corrected during the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the owner. The report is to be sent via email.
