ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Juja, a 16 year old orange tabby and white domestic long hair cat, is severely matted on the rear part of her body.
On the left flank area, large pieces of fur are matted and dark brown with what appears to be loose feces. The
owner states when he tries to brush her she hisses and bites. The extent of the matting was not palpated in order
to not upset her. The severe matting and fecal matter in her fur is dangerous to her health, in addition to being
uncomfortable.
Juga needs to be examined by the Attending Veterinarian and the mats and fecal matter removed. If she is unable
to be groomed or to groom herself adequately, then she needs to be taken to a groomer on a routine basis to keep
her fur short and clean.
To be corrected by 6-17-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
