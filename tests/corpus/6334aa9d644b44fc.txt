3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility has two perimeter fence lines where enclosures are less than 3 feet in distance from the perimeter fence. A
variance request was submitted but did not include both areas of the perimeter fence that did not meet the requirements.
The first perimeter fence line has two long fox enclosures containing 4 Red fox that measures 2 feet from the perimeter
fence on one end of the enclosure, and 2.5 feet in distance on the opposite end. The second perimeter fence line has two
fox enclosures containing 3 Red fox that measures approximately 1 foot from the perimeter fence. A perimeter fence that
is not sufficient distance from the primary enclosure can allow for contact between animals inside the enclosure with
animals or people outside of the perimeter fence which causes a threat to animal welfare. Correct by ensuring that all
perimeter fences are more than 3 feet in distance from primary enclosures or enclosures less than 3 feet in distance from
the primary enclosures are approved in writing by the administrator.

fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.


Conducting regulated activities without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
