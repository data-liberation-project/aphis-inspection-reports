FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** There is a small section of concrete floor broken in the lion holding area. The broken section is directly under a
section of the enclosure frame that is bolted to the concrete. If not addressed it can affect the structural integrity of
the enclosure. This area needs to be maintained in good repair for the safety and containment of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** There is hay and bedding stored in the front of the reindeer barn in an area also used to store various items,
tools etc. This area does not adequately protect the supplies from contamination so the hay and bedding should be
moved back to the designated food storage area in the back of the barn.
*** There are syrup bottles used to medicate animals stored directly in the bin with the reindeer grain. These bottles
are sticky and dirty to the touch and can easily contaminate the food in the bin. They should be moved out of the bin
to protect the food supplies.
*** The mini fridge in the bear holding area is rusted on the top of the fridge, along the sides and door. This fridge
should be replaced to assure food is adequately protected from deterioration.
*** There was a bag of opened bedding stored directly in the opossum enclosure. This bag of bedding should be
stored outside the enclosure to keep the bedding clean and for the safety of the animal.
*** The diet prep counter top adjacent to the aviary area between the nocturnal mammals and lion holding needs to
be addressed. The counter is worn to the point it can no longer be effectively cleaned. This counter top needs to be
replaced so the area can be effectively cleaned and sanitized to protect food from contamination during the diet
prep process.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection.
