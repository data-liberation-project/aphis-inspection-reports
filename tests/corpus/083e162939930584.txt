FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The chain-linked wire used for hair/skin scratching at the river otter enclosure has several exposed sharp ends.
These sharp wire ends are dangerous and potentially could cause injury/cuts to animals when engaged in
scratching behavior. Structural integrity of the scratching wire within the enclosure must be of sound design and
maintained in good repair in order to assure animal safety and prevent injuries. The scratching wire within the river
otter enclosure should be repaired or replaced.
