2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The current program of veterinary care has not been updated to include the following species: Patagonian cavy,
capybara, coatimundi and various exotic hoof stock. Formal arrangements with a veterinarian that includes the frequency
of visits to premises and a written program of veterinary care, ensures animals will receive consistent and timely
diagnoses and treatment of diseases, illnesses, and injuries.

Handling of animals.
In January 2020, seven Aoudads were released onto the facility’s property without closing the appropriate gates. During
the frenzy of the initial release, the animals saw the opening and proceeded through the gates. Four Aoudads managed to
escape; two were killed by hunters and two were eventually killed by the licensee after chemical immobilization attempts
failed. Additionally, one animal injured its front legs during the attempted escape. The animal was described as
ambulating on its front “knees” and was given access to food, water, and shade. The licensee’s AV evaluated the animal
and decided to give it a few days to heal without adding additional stress from capture. The aoudad was subsequently
euthanized due to poor prognosis. Handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a


manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary
discomfort.
Correct from this day forth.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility currently houses a male ringtail lemur out of sight and hearing from other nonhuman primates. The head
curator explained that the lemur was surrendered to the facility as a pet and required extensive medical attention. He did
not socialize well with the resident ringtail lemur group. The caretakers provide additional enrichment in the form of park
excursions in a harness and educational shows for the public; however, there is no formal documentation in the
environmental enrichment plan as to the reason why the animal is being housed individually and how the facility should
supplement his enrichment accordingly. Lack of social grouping can increase stress and discomfort. Additionally, it can
lead to behavioral and/or veterinary care issues. The licensee must ensure that social grouping is addressed and in
accordance with the direction of the attending veterinarian for all nonhuman primates as required.

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, two enclosures were identified as needing repairs. An enclosure housing two bobcats had a
weathered wooden platform with exposed screws and posed limb entrapment concerns. An enclosure housing two
raccoons had a section of the floor wire fencing exposed after a tree within the enclosure had been removed. The
exposed metal posed a risk of injury to the animals contained therein. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be
structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Sanitation.
At the time of inspection, there were two areas with a large accumulation of animal feces. The indoor housing area for two
sloths had evidence of old rodent feces on the floor. Additionally, the “hay loft” section of a barn in the petting zoo area
had a large accumulation of goat feces. Accumulations of feces pose disease hazards to the animals, give off unpleasant
odors and have the capability of attracting other pests. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent the contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce
odors.
