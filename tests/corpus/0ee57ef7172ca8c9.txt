ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care remains incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of
veterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written
PVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended
treatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no
manufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding
frequency of administration the written PVC says (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) for the majority of the species. There is no guidance
elsewhere clarifying what (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) means. During this inspection, several drugs were found in various storage
areas (including ivermectin, banamine, gentamycin, LA-200, and Resflor Gold) that are not labeled for all of the
species that these drugs can potentially be used in. Additional guidance for the use of these drugs must be
provided in the written PVC for all species for which these drugs are intended to be used. Failure to include
complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure welfare of the animals maintained by the facility
as miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for prevention, control, and treatment of disease.
Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that complete guidance regarding the dose, route, and
frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species that are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer
are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. At a minimum guidance must include species-specific
directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and the prevention, control, and treatment of internal
and external parasites. During this inspection, the farm manager stated that no written updates to the PVC are
complete.

*** A brown and white Nubian goat was found with a circular mass on the point of the right shoulder. The Farmmanager was not aware of this condition in the animal when asked. The facility has not started any treatment for
this animal. During this inspection, the farm manager moved this animal out of the pasture and placed it in a stall to
begin treatment as written by the attending veterinarian.
*** A zebra in the drive-through area was observed with a large crack located on the front aspect of the distal third
of the left front hoof. This crack has the potential to expose the sensitive tissues underneath that are normally
protected by the hardened hoof material. This animal must be examined by the attending veterinarian so a
treatment plan can be developed. The licensee must ensure documentation of this exam and the plan is
maintained for future review by APHIS officials.
*** The current program of veterinary care still authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for
(cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority
of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai,
Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. During this inspection, the Farm Manager stated that no changes to the written
Program of Veterinary Care have been made in regards to the use of this drug.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.

*** The public are still permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of animals.
This includes camels, sheep, goats, African porcupines, kangaroos, muntjac deer, and mini-zebu cattle, and 4-horn
sheep. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the walk through area of the zoo, the production barn,
the dairy barn, the Daughty barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to the public. There are no barriers
or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate.
There are no attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the
animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through
and touch the animals. Unattended public contact continues to be a problem at this facility and has been
documented on many previous inspections. Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public
interaction with these animals. Licensees must ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled
with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety
of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these animals or by ensuring
that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the safety of both the public
and the animals.

*** Guests are still allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendant is present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: deer,
antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry
gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding. This facility also has
horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows public feeding with an attendant present. When asked, the
Farm Manager again stated that guidance to guests has not changed regarding feeding from cars. Allowing guests
to feed from vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a
barrier or distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public
contact.
