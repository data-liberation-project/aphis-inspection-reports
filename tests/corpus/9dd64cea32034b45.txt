SANITATION.
The door flap between the indoor and outdoor areas of the serval enclosure, and the outdoor walls and fixtures
have excessive accumulation of urine spray and hair accumulation. Accumulation of urine residue and hair can
support bacteria growth and odors, as well as affect air quality. This can negatively impact the health of the animals.
The enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to maintain a clean and healthy environment.
Correction date: Deep clean by close of business 6/5/2017, and as often as necessary thereafter.
