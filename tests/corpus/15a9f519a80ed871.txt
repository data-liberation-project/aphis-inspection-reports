open wound on the right side of his neck. This dog has been examined on February 8, 2016 by a veterinarian,
written instructions included treatment and a plan for a follow up visit to the veterinarian for fourteen days post
exam. The instructions by the veterinarian included antibiotic treatment with Cephalexin 500mg (20 pills) twice daily.
The bottle of Cephalexin handed to the inspectors by the facility representative still had ten pills inside. The licensee
stated that there had been another bottle of the antibiotic at the facility and that the medication had been given to
Louie twice a day for either five or seven days.

today, February 18, 2016. Not following the directions of a veterinarian can lead to worsening the condition or an
extended healing period. The licensee must follow the instructions given by the veterinarian and assure that all of
the regulated animals are provided with adequate veterinary care as required.
