FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing for the goat enclosure had broken boards with jagged and chewed edges. In addition one corner of the
metal wire at the bottom of the fencing had come apart from the vertical post creating a sharp jagged edge. This
could cause the animals housed within the enclosure to become injured and possibly caught within the fencing. The
licensee needs to ensure that enclosures are maintained in good condition and repaired within a timely manner.
The facility needs to correct this issue.
