Female Neapolitan Mastiff (#102) has yellow colored discharge located in the interior corner of the left eye. The
discharge is also coating the hair above the left eye and around the exterior corner of the left eye. The white of the
eye is moderately reddened and the eye appears cloudy and slightly blue in color. There is a small amount of
yellow discharge located in the interior corner of the right eye. The facility representative stated that the dog is not
currently receiving any treatment for the condition of the eyes.
Female Husky (#43) has an open sore on the outside of the right front leg. The sore is hairless, moist, and red in
color and the hair surrounding the sore is dark colored. The area of the leg located around the sore appeared and
felt slightly swollen. The facility representative stated that the sore was caused by the dog excessively licking the
leg. Written documentation indicates the dog was initially treated with hot sauce placed on the sore December
7-11, 2016. The dog was then examined by a licensed veterinarian on January 18, 2017 and the written statement
from the veterinarian said that tabasco sauce should be used to stop the dog from licking the sore, but there is no
indication of how often the tabasco should be used or for how long. The veterinarian also provided further
information about the cause of the licking behavior and that disagreeable tasting products should be placed on the
wound to stop the licking. Written documentation indicates that the last time the dog was treated with the tabasco
sauce was February 23, 2017. The facility representative said the dog has received no further treatment for the
sore and the dog was examined on March 22, 2017 by the attending veterinarian but there is no written
documentation about the sore.
Poor eye health and open sores could cause pain and discomfort to the dogs. The above mentioned dogs must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment. The diagnosis
and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspectors upon request.
