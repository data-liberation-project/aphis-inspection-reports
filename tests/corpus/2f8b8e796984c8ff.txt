2.31(d)(1)(iv)(A)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A review of sheep surgical records revealed the euthanasia method as a compound which is not available in a
pharmaceutical formulation. There is no justification for using a non-pharmaceutical grade compound for euthanasia in the
IACUC approved protocol. The use of non-pharmaceutical grade substances for euthanasia must be documented and
justified and approved by the IACUC. The facility must correct this issue.

Personnel qualifications.
In reviewing the approved protocol 10-18 it was determined that the study staff made a significant change regarding the
euthanasia method used after the surgical/study procedures without the IACUC first reviewing and approving the change.
This change was made by the investigator without notifying the IACUC and allowing them to review the modifications.

To ensure the well-being and humane treatment of all research animals, it is important for the IACUC to review and
approve any significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing research activities. Correct by allowing
the IACUC to review and either approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes


regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.
