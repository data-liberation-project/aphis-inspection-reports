ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:55pm on
15-May-18.
Contact was made with a family member who informed me that the licensee was at work. No other person has
been designated in her absence. Licensee contacted me by text that she wished to terminate her license as she is
no longer conducting any animal welfare activity.
