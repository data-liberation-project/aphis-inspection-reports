ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany the APHIS Official during the inspection process at 3:50 pm on
04/03/2014.
An adult at the facility told the inspector that the exhibitor and the animals were not available for an inspection
because the exhibitor was out of state doing performances. The exhibitor must submit an itinerary to the Regional
Office anytime that he is doing performances that require overnight travel.
