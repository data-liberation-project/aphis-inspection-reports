FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside Romeo and Valkyrie’s enclosure, is a upright cattle panel. The end of the cattle panel has 10 exposed points
approximately 4 inches long. Romeo and Valkyrie have easy access to these points and can be injured. A program
that quickly identifies and corrects this non compliance to protect the animals from injury must be implemented.
To be corrected: From this day forward.
