3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
The interior height of the primary enclosure for the dog named “Frankie” was not at least 6 inches above his head, while in
normal standing position. Frankie measured 15 inches tall when standing normally and the interior height of his enclosure
measured 18 inches.

Adequate interior height of a primary enclosure is necessary to allow the dogs to make normal postural adjustments.

The interior height of all primary enclosures must be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the
enclosure when standing in a normal position.

This was corrected at the time of inspection: The licensee provided a new enclosure with adequate interior height.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
