ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1220 on
24-JUL-19. I went to the licensee's house. I knocked on the back door. No one answered. I honked my car horn
and then called the owner and left a message on her phone. She called me back and informed me she wasn't
available for inspection and she wouldn't be home anytime soon to do the inspection. She gave me her optimal
hours. I informed her I would try again another time and that I would send out this attempted inspection report by
mail.
End of report.
