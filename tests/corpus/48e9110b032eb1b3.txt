2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown adult Chihuahua identified as 'Millie' with tag number 034, has a heavy coating of dark brown and greyish
matter covering most of the remaining teeth. The abnormal buildup of material on the teeth can cause damage to
the gum tissue and tooth structure, be painful and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health
of the animal. The licensee must have the animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate plan administered.
The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
