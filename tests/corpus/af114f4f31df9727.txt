INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Upon a review of facility records, it was discovered that the facility has no Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC).
The CEO of a research facility must appoint an IACUC, qualified through the experience and expertise of it's
members to assess the research facility's animal program, facilities, and procedures. Failure to have an IACUC can
negatively impact animal health and welfare as there is no institutional oversight of animal care, handling, and
procedures performed on animals.
Correct by instituting an IACUC and following the requirements set forth for an IACUC in the Animal Welfare Act
and Animal Welfare Regulations. Correct by September 26, 2020.
2.35(a)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
This facility has no established IACUC and, therefore, does not have the required IACUC records.
Research facilities must maintain minutes of IACUC meetings, records of proposed activities involving animals and
proposed significant changes in activities involving animals, and records of semiannual IACUC reports forwarded to
the Institutional Official (IO). Failure to maintain these records inhibits the ability to provide proper oversight to
animal use and activities, which can negatively impact the health and welfare of animals being used in these
activities.
Correct by creating and maintaining required IACUC records. Correct by February 26, 2021.
