***Changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are not always being reported to the IACUC
before the changes occur.
The IACUC approved protocol for test article administration approved the following two doses: 10 mg/kg and 100
mg/kg. Animals received a 5 mg/kg dose or a 20 mg/kg dose of test article, both doses were not approved by the
IACUC.
Unapproved significant changes to the protocol could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal's
welfare at risk. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC
prior to implementing the changes.

***On 4/26/16, a female pig (ID 120) underwent an IACUC approved activity. According to facility records, at 16:17
during the post-operative recovery, the pig exhibited clinical signs that met the IACUC approved humane endpoints
and warranted prompt euthanasia. This animal was euthanized at 16:45. When asked the clarify why euthanasia
was prolonged for 28 minutes, facility staff stated, the euthanasia solution was in an office and it took some time to
get it.

Failure to have the appropriate equipment, including euthanasia solution when mortality and early termination are
expected, may have resulted in prolonged pain and distress. As part of the facility’s programs of adequate
veterinary care, registrants must ensure that appropriate equipment, including medications and euthanasia solution
are readily available when needed to comply the regulations and standards and to not prolong pain and distress.
Additionally, study staff should have adequate guidance, from veterinary staff, on appropriate care and use of
animals regarding analgesia, pain management/monitoring and euthanasia.
To be corrected by 8/1/16.Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
A second exit briefing was conducted via telephone on 7/29/16 with the attending veterinarian regarding specifics of
the inspection report.
