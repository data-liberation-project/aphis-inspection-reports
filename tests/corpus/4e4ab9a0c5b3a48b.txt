TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***In the whelping portion of the facility, there were eleven unweaned puppies that had no form of identification. In
the broker facility, there were ten puppies in mixed litters that had no identification attached to the dogs. Appropriate
identification of dogs is necessary to meet record keeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and
healthcare documentation. The licensee must identify all puppies as required. Acceptable forms of identification
include a microchip, a collar and tag, a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written, or a cage card
as long as all the puppies in the enclosure are from the same litter and in the breeding portion of the facility.
To be corrected from this day January 24, 2017 forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
