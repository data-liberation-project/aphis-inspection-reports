Housing facilities, general.
The primary enclosure housing the single capuchin has two areas of disrepair that are causing sharp point. The first area
is on the left perch. The perch is made of a metal frame with welded wire as the resting area. Two rows of the wire used
for the resting area have pulled away from the frame causing sharp points. The second area is on the front of the
enclosure. An approximately 12' row of the welded wire is in disrepair and has sharp points.

Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be constructed so that they are structurally sound, and must be kept in
good repair to protect the animal from injury.

Repair or replace these areas of the primary enclosure, and maintain the primary enclosure in good repair to protect the
animal from injury.

To be corrected by January 10, 2021.
