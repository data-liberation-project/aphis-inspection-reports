CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The whelping boxes and attached wire mesh enclosures are not being sanitized effectively between litters. There
is an accumulation of hair and debris embedded between the wire mesh and wood frame that is not being removed
prior to cleaning. Proper sanitization practices involve removing all organic material prior to applying a disinfectant.
The whelping room has a strong ammonia odor due to this build up of hair and debris. These enclosures need to be
sanitized properly between litters for the health of the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** In the whelping room, the bottles of Pyrantel and Albon need to be cleaned. The tops of the bottles are very dirty
with caked on suspension. In addition, the shelf is dusty and cleaning items are stored above the medications and
next to used syringes. This area needs to be cleaned and maintained to protect the medical supplies from
contamination.
*** There are several empty enclosures that have feces still in the wire mesh. These enclosures need to be cleaned
in a timely manner after the dogs are removed to reduce the risk of disease hazards and to promote good
housekeeping practices.
*** There is an accumulation of hair and debris hanging down underneath the wire mesh enclosures in the main
kennel that needs to be removed. This excess hair and debris can trap urine and feces which has caused a strong
ammonia odors throughout the building.
*** There is an accumulation of dust and debris throughout the wire mesh enclosures that are not being used, along
the window ledges and in the corners of the building. This excess dust and debris needs to be cleaned on a routine
basis to promote good housekeeping practices. Correct by: April 16, 2015

*** There were mouse droppings along the tops and in a few of the old unused feeders being stored in enclosures in
the main kennel area. An effective program for pest control needs to be maintained to reduce contamination by
pests in animal areas. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.
