*** The interior height of the enclosure housing two puppies is only three inches above their head in a standing
position. The interior height of the enclosure must be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the
enclosure when it is in a normal standing position. These puppies need to be moved to an enclosure with enough

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The enclosure for the Capuchin has paint that is flaking off the ceiling and underneath the paint, rust is evident.
The floors of the enclosure are no longer impervious to moisture and need to be resealed. The brackets connecting
the igloo to the elevated shelf are also rusted and need to be addressed. Rusted areas prevent the enclosure from
being readily cleaned and sanitized. This enclosure needs to be maintained in good repair to facilitate cleaning of
the enclosure and for the safety of the animals.
