2.31(c)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility personnel reported three seperate adverse events under protocol #79 since June of 2013. In each case
the IACUC investigated and took corrective action which included approving amendments to the protocol. The
amendments were not incorporated into the most recent version of the Protocol. The protocol that is printable for
distribution must have the most recent updates and be followed as written to assure that the animals are being
handled in the manner approved by the IACUC. This assures that the needs of the animals have, and will be,
addressed by the facility. Correct from this point forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the IACUC Chair
