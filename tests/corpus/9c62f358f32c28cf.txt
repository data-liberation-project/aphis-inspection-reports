Housing facilities, general.
Numerous bags of unopened dog food and wood shavings are stored directly on the floor. Unopened food and bedding
material stored on the floor could attract pests such as rodents or insects and increase the risk of disease towards the
dogs.

Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and
vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls. The licensee must store the
unopened bags of dog food and wood shavings off the floor and ensure all food and bedding material is properly stored at
all times.

To be corrected by: The licensee moved the bags of food and shavings off the floor at the time of the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
