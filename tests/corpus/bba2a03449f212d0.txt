2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is currently treating "Spice" with Thyrovet for a chronic condition. This dog gets one pill twice a day.
The medication expired on February 19, 2014 and this has been administered to this animal to date.
Administering expired medications is not considered adequate veterinary care and not an appropriate method to
treat or control disease.
The trainers were unaware that they were administering expired medications. When this was discovered during the
inspection, the veterinarian was immediately contacted and a unexpired bottle of medication will be picked up
tomorrow.
Discuss with you veterinarian if additional testing/examination needs to be performed due to the administration of
expired medications for this chronic condition.
No further correction is necessary at this time.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee's dogs are transferred from their indoor housing to a hilly outdoor exercise area which is not constantly
monitored by a trainer. In this exercise area there are some long, unattached, pieces of bamboo dangling
overhead. This can cause a risk of injury if these bamboo pieces should unexpectedly break and fall on a dog.
The walls on the inside of the this enclosure are only approx 3 1/2 feet high in some areas. The giant/larger breeds
of dogs can get up and look over these short walls and have contact with the theme parks guests & employees
without a trainer present. Additionally, it is possible for one of these larger dogs to jump over these short fence
areas.
These walls are also bowed outward at the bottom of the fence in several areas due to the pressure created by soilerosion & soil shifting in this hilly enclosure. This erosion has also caused some of the PVC irrigation piping &
sprinkler heads to become exposed and stick up from the ground surface. This condition poses a risk of
injury/entrapment when the dogs run during their exercise periods.
All enclosures shall be in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely.
