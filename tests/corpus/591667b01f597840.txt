ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:25 pm on
11-Jul-18.
After not finding anyone at the kennel or at home, I called and spoke with the facility representative who said that no
one was available for an inspection and that she was out of state untll July 16.
