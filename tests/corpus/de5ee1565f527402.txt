2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are several puppy records that are missing the dates sold on the record sheets required for record
management. The Disposition 7006 forms are missing the name and address information on the commercial
shipper area of the record forms, and color descriptions of animals sold.
It is important to keep complete and accurate records for proper management and traceability of the regulated
animals.
The licensee must include all dates of disposition of animals sold, transferred, donated, died or euthanized on the
Puppy Records for traceability of the animals. All Disposition records should be filled out completely with full names
and addresses of transport companies, and descriptions of animals sold.

To be corrected by: August 19, 2016Inspection conducted with facility representative and exit interview done with licensee.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 16, 2016.
