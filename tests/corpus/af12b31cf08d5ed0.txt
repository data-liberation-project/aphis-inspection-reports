2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is inadequate, as it does not contain sufficient provisions for
emergency care. The current program, under the emergency care section, simply states “mobile veterinarian”. The
facility uses their attending veterinarian (AV) for emergency care but has no provision for veterinary care when their
AV is unavailable. From 9/10/16-9/14/16, while their AV was unavailable, one camel requiring veterinary
care/euthanasia (according to facility records & personnel) did not receive veterinary care and died on 9/14/16.
Failure to have a complete PVC, including appropriate provisions for emergency care, could jeopardize the health
and well-being of the animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals
at the facility and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The facility is not providing appropriate veterinary care nor has the availability of emergency, weekend and
holiday care. On 9/10/16 facility records for one female camel state “condition has deteriorated, did not stand for
food, eats if food placed in front of her, texted vet, and said I think she’s ready to go”. From 9/11/16 through 9/14/16,
the animal’s condition worsened, with the animal not standing or kushing and refusing to eat or drink. The animal
died on 9/14/16.
Although the facility contacted their veterinarian, no veterinary care was provided to this animal, as the veterinarian
was unavailable. Injuries, diseases and medical conditions that are not treated properly (as directed by a
veterinarian) may be painful and can lead to prolonged suffering.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend and holiday care for all of the animals at
the facility. ***One female coati has an abnormal left eye. At the time of inspection, the left eye was swollen, extremely
reddened, had an abnormally uneven corneal surface and some clear discharge. Facility records state this condition
has been ongoing since 5/5/16. The facility has been be treating the condition with ophthalmic ointment since that
time. This animal was last evaluated by the veterinarian on 8/25/16.
Although the facility has been treating this animal, the ocular condition remains unresolved (intermittent resolution)
since 5/5/16. The facility has not changed treatment regiments nor done any additional diagnostic testing.
Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical
conditions and can be painful and distressing. Furthermore, not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting
the health and well-being of the animal and has the potential for further injury.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by no later than 5:00 p.m on November 4, 2016, to
obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the ocular issue cited above. The outcome of this
consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the
veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian,
any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal
health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate
veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The enclosure housing five goats has standing water. The animals must go through and stand in the water and
mud in order to access their drinking water. Standing water can pose a health risk to the animals as it can contain
bacteria and parasites. Additionally, animals standing in water for excess periods of time are at risk for foot/hoof rot.
The facility must have a suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water from the enclosures.This inspection was conducted with the animal manager.
The exit interview was conducted via telephone on 11/2/16 with a facility representative.
