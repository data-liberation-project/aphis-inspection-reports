3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The animal in this facility is a very healthy 1.5 years old female tiger 200 to 250 pounds of weight approximately.
At the time of the inspection, the inspector found the primary enclosure door open in the cage of the tiger, the owner
told the inspector that he leaves the door open and the tiger can move around the "perimeter fence" when he is in
that area.
The use of this cage in this way demonstrates that it is using the perimeter fence as primary enclosure. The
perimeter fence is a chain-link of 12 feet tall with no kick in and no hot wire.
This perimeter fence is not adequate to work as a primary enclosure and contain this type of animal that can jump
or climb large distances. In addition, using the perimeter fence as a primary enclosure entails that there is no real
perimeter fence.
This facility currently has no functional perimeter fence. The female tiger is housed in outdoor enclosure that require
a perimeter fence. This fence is required to act not only as a secondary containment for the animal should escape
from their primary enclosures but is also required to keep unwanted animals and unauthorized persons out.
The use of the perimeter fence as a primary enclosure must be stopped immediately restricting the animal to its
primary enclosure all the time, or adapting the present perimeter fence as primary enclosure (add kick-in, hot wire
etc.) and building another perimeter fence at least 8 feet tall.
Correct by: Immediately.
