HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The Raccoon Building has a high ambient temperature and humidity. The building is constructed of metal and is not
insulated. There are large fans running at one end of the building and there are windows that are open along the
sides. Towards the middle of the building there is little to no movement of air and the temperature in this part of the
building as taken by the Kestrel at approximately 1:30 pm is 91.6 degrees F, the humidity is 84% and the heat index
is 111.7 degrees F. Multiple raccoons were displaying behaviors such as panting and lying on their sides and
abdomens with their legs splayed out that could indicate they are uncomfortable with the temperature. There are
approximately 290 raccoons housed in this building. High temperature and humidity could have a negative impact
on the health and well-being of the animals.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health and well-being, appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must reduce the temperature
and humidity inside this building to a level that is comfortable for the raccoons in order to support their health and
well-being.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple enclosures in the Ferret Buildings and outdoor ferret housing have broken wires creating sharp points at the
level of the animals. At least four enclosures, containing at least ten ferrets, have broken wires in the back corners
of the enclosures. At least two enclosures, containing at least seven ferrets, has broken wires around the opening
to the nest box. In at least five outdoor housing enclosures, containing six ferrets, there are sharp points created by
twisted wire that's attaching shelves to the sides of the enclosures. At least two of the outdoor housing enclosures,
containing two ferrets, have broken wires and sharp points in the back corners of the enclosures.
Multiple skunk enclosures have broken wires creating sharp points at the level of the animals. One enclosurecontaining four skunks has a large hole in the flooring created by broken wires. Sharp points surround this hole in
the floor. At least two enclosures, containing at least two skunks, have broken wires creating sharp points around
the opening to the nest box. Two enclosures, containing two skunks, have broken wires in the back corner of the
enclosure.
In the Ferret Building one enclosure, containing three ferrets, has an 1.5 inch gap between the nest box and the
cage. One ferret was seen with his head, neck and forelegs through the opening.
One enclosure, containing at least one skunk, has a wooden nest box and the bottom of the nest box has become
detached from one corner resulting in a large gap which the animal could be seen through.
Two other enclosures, containing two skunks, have large gaps between the nest box and the enclosure. In one
enclosure, containing one skunk, the wire flooring has become unattached to the wire side resulting in a large gap
and a broken wire.
Holes and gaps in the enclosure may allow animals to escape or cause injury. Sharp points can cause injury or
trauma to the animal. The licensee must eliminate all the sharp points, gaps and holes as well as, ensure that all
housing is constructed of material appropriate for the animals housed and is maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals safely. Continual monitoring and maintenance of cage and housing is
an ongoing process.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an excessive accumulation of fresh and old excreta beneath the enclosures located in the Raccoon
Building. Under several enclosures containing raccoons, there are numerous live maggots present in the piles of
excreta. There is also a significant accumulation of hair, organic matter, and other debris along the cage supports in
both Ferret Buildings and the Raccoon Building.
Excessive accumulations of animal waste in the housing area can lead to poor air quality, disease hazards and pest
infestations. Poor air quality is linked to the development of health problems and many fumes, such as ammonia,
can cause discomfort to animals and can lead to conditions such as respiratory and eye abnormalities. The licensee
must remove animal and food wastes as often as necessary to minimize the odors, vermin, and disease hazards for
the health and well being of the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION. Within the Ferret Building there is an excessive accumulation of ferret feces present in the back corners of at least
three enclosures, containing at least eight ferrets. One enclosure, containing at least one ferret, has an excessive
buildup of hair and dark organic material on the wire floor of the enclosure. One enclosure, containing at least four
ferrets, has a buildup of dark organic material in a corner of the nest box. This organic material is infested with live
maggots and the ferrets were seen stepping in the material and maggots.
Excessive excreta, hair and grime in primary enclosures can contribute to disease hazards, odors, insects and other
pests. The licensee must ensure that excreta, hair, and other organic waste is removed as often as necessary to
prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The Ferret Building and a Skunk Building has an excessive number of flies in the housing area, in and around the
enclosures and on the feed. A large number of flies were seen throughout the enclosures containing two spotted
skunks and on the ceiling directly above these enclosures.
The animals are fed a raw ground meat mixture that is placed on the top of their wire enclosures. In one outdoor
housing building the food on top of at least three enclosures, housing at least five skunks, has become dried and is
heavily covered in flies.
An enclosure located in the outdoor housing area has a large wasp nest made out of mud within the nesting box
that three ferrets can come in contact with.
The presence of pests can cause contamination of the food supply and also lead to health hazards for the animals.
The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective program for the control of flies and other pests.
