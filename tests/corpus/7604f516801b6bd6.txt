2.126 REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
At the time of inspection an itinerary covering this traveling exhibit was not available within the database. A phone
call to the regional office also did not uncover an itinerary. The absence of an itinerary inhibits
inspection for compliance with regulations and standards of the Act while the animals are away from the home
facility.
The licensee must submit an itinerary to the Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever
the animals will be exhibited at a location other than the approved site(s) and whenever travel extends overnight.
The itinerary shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of all animals intended
for exhibition at any location other than the approved site.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager by Curt McGruder-ACI. The exhibit was taking
place near Valles Mines, MO.
