ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One llama and five alpacas have heavily matted hair coats that need to be sheared. The hair coats on the llama
and an alpaca, with a brown coat and black face, are heavily twisted with large mats that cover the majority of their
bodies. The other four alpacas have hair coats with mats of varying sizes on numerous places on their bodies.
Matted hair coats can cause discomfort for the animals and lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. The
licensee must remove the mats and ensure that all llamas and alpacas have their hair coats routinely maintained in
order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases associated with excessive matting. Additionally, the facility
must ensure that the recently sheared animals receive adequate protection from the elements to prevent any
discomfort from cold temperatures.

***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete and does not reflect the actual preventative
care practices currently utilized by the facility.
The PVC states that the camels will receive “CDT vaccination twice in the first year of life, then annually.” To treat
intestinal parasites, the PVC states that “Ivermectin injectable twice yearly” will be administered, as well as “oral
fenbendazole twice yearly.”
Veterinary treatment records maintained by the facility indicate that “Fatima,” a female Dromedary camel; “Meshak,”
a male Dromedary camel; and “Sheba,” a female Dromedary camel were administered CDT vaccination, Ivermectin,
and Safeguard in December 2016. Based on facility treatment records, and a phone conversation between the
veterinarian’s office and the facility at the time of inspection, these camels have not received deworming
medications of Ivermectin or Safeguard since December 2016. Facility treatment records indicate that Sheba and
Meshak received Ivermectin and Safeguard once in 2015, however they did not receive the CDT vaccination that
year.
The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending veterinarian establishing standards of carefor the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC or failure to follow the PVC as written by the attending veterinarian
could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to
include all the regulated animals and the facility must follow the guidance of the attending veterinarian as
established in the PVC.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The licensee did not have complete acquisition records for four alpacas acquired on 09/25/16. The vehicle
license number and state, and the driver’s license number and state of the individual from whom the animals were
acquired were missing from the facility’s records.
Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those
offspring born on premise, are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to
ensure their humane care and use. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition of all
animals that fully and correctly discloses the required information.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***A large portion of the wire fencing enclosing the primary enclosure of six camels is in disrepair. The metal posts
supporting the wires are at an approximately 50 degree angle to the ground, leaning in an outward direction, away
from the enclosure.
This portion of the fencing is no longer structurally sound and minimizes the fence’s ability to contain the camels. All
enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and
maintenance must be in place.

that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
