NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
During the attempted inspection contact was made by phone with a friend that was listed on the application, who
advised that the registrant has moved out of the state and is not currently living in Illinois. There has been no
notification to the Regional Office of an address change or change in location of this Transport business, as is
required under regulations within 10 days of a change in address.
The registrant must advise the Regional Office of an address change as soon as possible in order to acquire the
proper license for the state they are living in and doing business. Regulated business can not continue until the
proper license is acquired.
To be corrected: From this day forward
2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 100pm on
05/12/2014.
Both doors of the residence was knocked on with no response. A message was left on the voicemail of the phone
number provided on the application form for the licensee to call the inspector with an idea of the best days and
times to conduct inspections. This message was left at the last inspection with no response from the registrant. A
second number was called that was on the application, and this person advised that the registrant had moved out of
Illinois and was no longer living at that residence. The phone number she provided was the same number I have
been leaving messages on, with continued negative responses from the registrant.
