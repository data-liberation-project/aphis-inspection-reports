SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two Patagonian cavies were moved from their outdoor location to indoor housing about 4 days ago as reported by
the licensee. The cavies' indoor enclosure is still under construction, so the cavies have been housed in their
transport kennel container that is not large enough to adequately allow both cavies to walk around more than a few
steps at the same time if they wanted to. They also have little space to avoid walking in excrement in this small
area. The licensee reported to be in the process of finishing the larger enclosure and planned to have them out into
the larger enclosure later this day. Housing animals in spaces that don't allow adequate movement could cause
animals discomfort and may lead to health problems for the animals. The facility must ensure that animals are
housed in areas with spaces large enough to allow adequate freedom of movement and allow normal social and
postural adjustments.
