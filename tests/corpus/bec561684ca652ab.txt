2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A tri-color adult guinea pig in Pen 34 had a firm movable mass
approximately 2 cm in size under the chin. The animal was in good body condition and did not appear lethargic. The
licensee had observed the health condition in the guinea pig but had not contacted the attending veterinarian and was not
administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided treatment
options.
Masses under the chin can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of
the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and
treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional
animals if the condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending
veterinarian to evaluate this animal and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
