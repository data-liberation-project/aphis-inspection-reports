Feeding.
Three containers of strawberries stored in the food prep cooler had excessive amounts of molding. The molded
strawberries were easily identified upon inspection, located on the top shelf of the cooler. Per the facility representative,
the strawberries were delivered yesterday afternoon, January 6th. The facility representative stated they are responsible
for checking the refrigerated cooler at the end of each day. They confirmed they were unable to check the cooler the
evening of January 6th due to leaving work early. Although the licensee stated these strawberries would not be used for
any animal consumption, they were stored with the rest of the produce that would be fed to the animals on hand.

This food was contaminated and unwholesome, which could result in illness and compromise in health to the animals.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative.
