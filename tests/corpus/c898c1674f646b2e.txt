WATERING.
Water was provided to a Wallaby in a tall bucket. The bucket was less than half full and it would have been difficult
for the Wallaby to reach the water. Also, the water was contaminated with two dead rats floating inside the bucket.
There was no other source of water available at the time of this inspection. Potable water is essential for the health
of all animals and water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary. All water must be easily accessible to the
animals and water receptacles should be cleaned daily.
Correct by: Sept. 14th and thereafter.

SANITATION.
The area to the end of the Wallaby enclosure was littered with trash, old feed bags, and old dirty hay. This
accumulation of trash was around the storage containers that contained feed for the Wallaby. The area around
animal enclosures needs to be kept clean to reduce the chance of vermin (rats and mice), and to ensure the health
of the animals. A regular program of cleaning around all animal enclosures needs to be in place and maintained.
Correct by: Sept. 29th and thereafter.
