2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:00 on
20-NOV-19.
Arrived at the facility and knocked on the door. After there was no response I returned to my car. I called both
phone numbers provided on file and left messages stating I was at the facility. I left my phone number and
requested a return call.
