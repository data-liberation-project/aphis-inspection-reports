2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A Pug (#340) has an excessively long toenail on the rear left foot that is curving and starting to twist to the side.
The other nails on the feet are of longer length also. Toenails that are long, twisted or curve to the side do not allow
the dog to stand in a normal posture or have a normal gait. This may cause muscles to fatigue, create soreness and
even cause lameness and pain due to use of muscles in an abnormal manner. Licensee must create and maintain
a method of regular toenail trimming as often as necessary to prevent long, splayed, twisted toenails for the overall
well being of the dog.

** Two bottles of expired medications (Gentamicin Sulfate expired 10/14, Primidone 250mg expired 2/15) and a
bottle of Ivomix with no expiration date were available for use on the dogs. Expired drugs or medications with no
expiration may not perform to expectation or become more concentrated, causing possible harm to the dogs.
Licensee must ensure that all medications have a readable expiration date, and that expired medications are not
intermingled with current medications to ensure accurate dosage/effects and to prevent any accidental usage on the
dogs for the dogs health and well being.

2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* At time of inspection 17 animals did not have any means of individual identification physically on them. Twelve
numbered tags were hanging on enclosures but there was no method to match the hanging tag with the individual
dog it belonged with. USDA regulations require that all dogs on the premise must either be collared, tattooed, or
micro chipped as the official means of identification to allow for individual identification. Individual identification of
dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport and healthcare
documentation. Licensee must ensure that all dogs are physically wearing uniquely numbered tags to allow for
individual physical identification of the animal.** To be corrected by: 4/29/15

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
* The sewer pipe that removes the waste from the dog building had broken in two separate areas. The waste
material (water, urine, feces, dog food, dirt) was piling up outside on the ground at the broken sites. This pipe is
located behind the row of outdoor enclosures containing two dogs. This type of waste accumulation can be a
rodent/pest attraction, cause odors and can harbor disease organisms. Licensee must remove, repair or replace the
broken pipe to ensure that animal waste/water can be disposed of in a timely manner and to minimize odors, pests
and other disease hazards for the health of the dogs.

3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* Two outdoor enclosures (containing 2 dogs total) had exposed cattle panels where the dogs had dug up the earth
flooring These cattle panels were exposed in such a way that the dogs could get a foot caught in the panel and
cause injury. Licensee must ensure that all outdoor enclosure surface areas are kept in good repair, and replaced
when worn or soiled for the overall health and well being of the dogs.
* To be corrected by: 5/15/15
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The self feeder in a outdoor enclosure (containing 1 dog) had a chewed/torn front metal flap that has sharp points.
These sharp points could cause injury to the dog while it is eating. Licensee must ensure that all primary
enclosures and objects within the enclosure are maintained to be kept free of sharp points to prevent injury to the
dogs.

3.12
EMPLOYEES.* The single employee caring for the dogs does not have adequate knowledge, background, or experience in the
proper husbandry and care of the dogs in a breeding facility. This employee indicated that he (cid:28)had about 3 weeks of
training" before being left in charge of the facility. This employee is unsure as to why certain medications are in the
facility, he is unaware of proper food storage, and did not know that the dogs had to be physically and individually
identified with tags. He repeatedly indicated (cid:28)that was "just how the owner left it", he had no knowledge of the "blue
book", and in general, he was unfamiliar with all of the required AWA regulations pertaining to the dogs, facility and
record keeping requirements. The owner of the facility has been out of state since September, leaving the
employee to continue to learn by trial and error. Employees who are not properly trained and/or supervised may
provide substandard care for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all employees involved with the animals
are knowledgeable and properly trained to be able to perform the level of husbandry/care and handling required by
the Animal Welfare Act.
