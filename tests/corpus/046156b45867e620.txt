Facilities, general.
***In the large Capybara enclosure, containing three Capybaras, there was a wooden shelter that contained a protruding
bent nail head on the right side frame beside the opening to the shelter. This nail head was protruding out approximately
2 inches and was bent at a 45 degree angle approximately 18 inches from the ground.
***In the petting zoo, under an old bird enclosure, where the goats are commonly seen, there was a screw that was not
screwed all the way in and sticking out approximately 1.5" and approximately 6" off the ground. Screws, nails and sharp
points create an area that could puncture or lacerate the animals. The licensee must remove or repair these areas and
ensure all areas of the facility are maintained as required.
3.131(d) Repeat

Sanitation.
***In the petting zoo area, containing small 14 goats and two zebu, there was a feed trough containing feed pellets. There
was a large amount of flies on and around the feed and trough. There were no current fly control measures being taken at
the petting zoo during the inspection. Flies can contaminate feed and cause bites to the animals. The licensee must
maintain an effective program of pest control as required.
