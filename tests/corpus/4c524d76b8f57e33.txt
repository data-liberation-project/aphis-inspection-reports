INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
During the inspection it was noted that a chemical grade form of a drug was administered to regulated species on
IACUC approved protocol #325. Justification for using the chemical grade form of this drug was not included in the
protocol.
Pharmaceutical-grade substances are expected to be used whenever they are available. Non-
pharmaceutical-grade substances should only be used in regulated animals after specific review and approval by
the IACUC. The IACUC must ensure that adequate justification is provided for protocols using chemical grade
substances.
