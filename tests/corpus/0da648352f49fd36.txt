ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, male Boston Terrier with chip number OAO1343048 has thick dental calculus on his upper premolar and
molar teeth (cheek teeth). The area of concern is over the left upper premolar teeth. The gums in this area are
recessed away from the tooth and are red and inflamed. This is a sign of dental disease in dogs. Dental disease can
cause damage to the gum tissue, tooth and mouth structures, can be painful, and can impact the ability of the dog
to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must
be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. This dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian by
20 February 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
