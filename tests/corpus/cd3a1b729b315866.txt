3.25(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three loose guinea pigs observed that had escaped from enclosures and are free on the floor of the
facility. Failure to contain the animals can lead to injury or death from falls to the ground, escape from the barn, or
becoming trapped outside of the pen.The facility must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair,
to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Four of the lower enclosures (Pens # 30, 34, 40, and 42) have an accumulation of water and fecal material directly
beneath the waterers with Pen #40 having feces directly surrounding the spigot. Dirty enclosures can cause
unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the water, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in
risks to the health of the animals. The facility must ensure primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
