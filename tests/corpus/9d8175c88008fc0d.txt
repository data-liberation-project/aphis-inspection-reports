RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection report dated October 24, 2017, records of animal births and deaths were not
maintained for the guinea pigs. Records need to be kept on animal births and deaths to comply with the regulations,
to keep track of animals, and for assessment of the animal care program. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
