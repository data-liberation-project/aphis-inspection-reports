Records: Dealers and exhibitors
Record of Dogs and Cats on Hand was not correct, and did not include the most recent cats acquired several months
ago. Records must be maintained and fully and correctly disclose the required information for every cat in her possession
or under her control or which is disposed of by that exhibitor.

Corrected during inspection.

This inspection was conducted with a responsible adult and the exit interview was conducted by phone with the licensee.
