HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the great ape escape area, the Orangutan day room contains numerous logs connected together providing
climbing/resting structures for the enclosed primates. There is a log that is broken and missing approximately 1/4 to
1/3 of the wood in a two foot section in the middle of the log. This log is located at the base of the structure and
many logs are attached to it. Due to the wood loss, this area may not be structurally sound and could affect the
integrity of the entire climbing structure. The facility must repair or replace this log, and must ensure that all
climbing structures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the marine mammal pools, there are multiple areas in disrepair. In the doorway between the night holding area
and the main outdoor pool, the concrete floor is cracked and broken. This is a potential source of injury, and also
makes cleaning and sanitizing this section of flooring more difficult.
In the winter pool, the outer surface of the wall has a very large, long, deep crack running approximately 1/3 the
length of the pool. It is difficult to tell how deep this fracture runs, and whether or not it affects the structural integrity
of the wall.
In the stadium pool, a pillar on the main platform has two large cracks in it which could potentially affect the integrity
and strength of this support structure. On the deck of the main platform, a section of the floor is cracked and feels
"spongy" to the touch. This platform is used by trainers and animals during public exhibition, and could have a
direct impact on the welfare of the animals.
All damaged areas in the marine mammal enclosures must be evaluated and repaired as soon as possible.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Several resting platforms, walkways, and wooden ramps have broken boards and eroding corners in the indoorsection of the big cat holding area. The areas of broken or eroded boards are in disrepair, are not structurally sound
and could result in injury to the enclosed animals. The resting platforms and the walkways should be repaired or
replaced to prevent injury to the enclosed animal.
- In the rhino yard, a large shift gate has a crumbling stone support column on one side. This could potentially affect
the structural integrity of the gate. This section of stonework must be repaired or replaced.
