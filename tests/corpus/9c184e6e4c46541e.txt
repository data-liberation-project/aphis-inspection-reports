2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Currently the facility is using two different vets for care when the animals show signs of illness or injury and take the
animals to the vet when needed. The facility must have formal arrangements with an attending veterinarian which shall
include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the facility. This is to assure that the vet has
appropriate authority over the care of the diverse species at the facility and to assure their health care needs are met.
