HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On the day of inspection on 8/15/19 the temperature reached ~104 degrees F during the inspection, at
approximately 5 pm. The forecasted temperature for the late afternoon was greater than 100 degrees and there was
an extreme heat warning in effect.
Many of the animals without additional water beyond drinking water were panting and appeared uncomfortable and
hot, especially the overweight animals (such as the caracal and clouded leopard). Open mouth breathing and visible
respiratory effort was seen in a coyote, clouded and snow leopards.
A Kestrel thermometer reading in front of a typical enclosure was 102-104.8 degrees F. An infrared thermometer
showed the surface temperature within the den box where a clouded leopard was panting to be around 106 degrees
F, and 110 degree F under the deck in the ringtail enclosure, where the ringtail was residing.
A few of the enclosures had a pool in addition to the drinking water, including the bears, fishing cats and two tigers,
as well as occasional smaller basins for some animals, but these were not large enough for the animals to get into.
These smaller basins only had a few of inches of water, which would heat up quickly in temperatures above 100
degrees. The majority of the enclosures did not have any additional basins of water supplied beyond drinking water
containers, which had no ice in them.
The following animals were observed to be in need of additional efforts to provide relief from the temperature due to
their continued panting and open mouthed breathing: the snow leopard Brenda II, the clouded leopards Nebula and
Rosie, and the coyote Wiley.
The facility has a water/cooling protocol which states that when temperatures are above 90 degrees, the animals
may be cooled using the various methods, however additional measures should be undertaken to prevent
overheating, and ensure the comfort of all animals during hot weather.
Severely hot weather can cause discomfort and threaten the health of the animals.
