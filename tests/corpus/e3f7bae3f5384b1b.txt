HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (3) Cleaning.
***In the outdoor facility there were housing units with an accumulation of dirt, grime, hair and/or thick dust covered
cobwebs. Some of the cobwebs were attached from the roof edge to the front wall covering the entire length of the
front wall. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential for a healthy environment and reduces disease hazards by
eliminating harboring places for diseases and pests. As a part of the facility's cleaning program, the licensee must
remove the dirt, grime and cobwebs from these areas and ensure that all hard surfaces that come in contact with
the animals are kept clean and sanitized at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: August 19, 2015.
***There was a general lack of cleaning in the whelping building housing adult dogs and puppies. The inside portion
of the sheltered building had dirt, dust, and debris along the floor, shelving units and window ledge. These areas
were only a few feet from where at least 2 adult dogs and 4 puppies were housed. Although the dogs weren't
coming into direct contact with these areas, the build-up of dirt and debris in the building where they are housed
increases the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of the housing facilities (including
the areas that do not come in contact with the dogs) are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices. TO BE CORRECTED BY: September 12, 2015.
3.9(a)
FEEDING.
***Within the outdoor facility, there was a food receptacle that contained a small portion of dry kibble which was a
greyish-white abnormal color. The portion of discolored, moldy-like kibble was mostly located in one corner in the
mouth of the feeder while much of the rest of the kibble in the feeder had a normal appearance. This self-feeder
provided the only source of food for two adult dogs within the enclosure. According to the licensee, the male dog in
the enclosure may have been urinating into the feeder. Contaminated food can decrease the animals' acceptance
of the food and can increase the risk of disease and health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the current
moldy-like feed. Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration and/or caking of feed at
all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: Close of business on the day of inspection on August 12, 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee on August 12, 2015. All correction dates werediscussed during the exit interview and acknowledged to be understood by the licensee on August 12, 2015.
