HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection of the barn area housing the animals several members of the public (adults and young kids)
were petting and feeding the animals. No readily identifiable employee or attendant was present. The young boys
were shucking ears of corn in a machine present in the barn and feeding the corn to all the animals including the
rabbits for whom corn is not an appropriate feed. One of the rabbits was noted eating the corn. A responsible,
knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact with the animals to ensure the contact is safe for the animals and the people. Correct by 10/6/17.

SANITATION.
There are a very large number of flies in the barn structure housing the animals during the exhibit. Numerous flies
were noted on the animals, on the feed and on the bedding of the animals. The program of veterinary care states
that fly spray should be applied daily. The facility says they are using fly spray on the premises weekly. Flies can be
irritants to the animals and can spread disease. The facility shall establish and maintain a safe and effective
program for the control of flies. The attending veterinarian can be used as a resource to develop such a program to
ensure it is safe for the animals. Correct by 10/10/17.
