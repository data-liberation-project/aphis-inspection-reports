Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were two bottles of Clavamox which contained a brown liquid. One was dispensed on 1/8/2022 and states on the
label “give 0.6mLs by mouth every 12 hours for 10 days. Discard remainder.” The second bottle was dispensed on
5/12/2021. There was also a bottle of Draxxin with an expiration date of June 2021 and a box of famotidine 10mg tablets
with an expiration date of 10/2020. The use of expired medication is not an effective treatment for animal issues and/or
diseases.
The licensee is responsible for the using appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and
injuries.

Facilities, general.
The singly housed African crested porcupine under the lean-to has two areas of its enclosure that have sharp points. One
area is on the right-hand side of the enclosure and consists of a 2” x 4” board that the porcupine has chewed exposing
several screws. There is another area where there is an approximately 1” X 3” wire that has sharp points where it has
been cut.


There are two adult fox and 5 fox kits in an enclosure. The fox den is set up on a shelf approximately 2 feet off the floor.
There is an approximately 4” board missing directly in front of the den. The board missing in front of the fox den may
cause an injury to the fox kits if they fall out of the fox den.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
The licensee must ensure enclosures are maintained in good repair, and do not have sharp points, to prevent injury to the
animals contained.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
Three African crested porcupines were housed outside. The facility does not have a perimeter fence built and was denied
a variance for the African crested porcupines in December 2021. The lack of a perimeter fence can lead to unnecessary
animal escapes because there is no secondary containment. Additionally, there is no mechanism to prevent contact
between humans and other animals and the animals contained at the facility to prevent injury or disease.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals or less than 6 feet high for other
animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in
the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.

Watering.
There is a single cavy housed with 2 capybara. The water receptacle is a large bucket that was elevated off the ground
with a carabiner to prevent the capybara from tipping the bucket over. The top of the bucket was approximately the same


height as the cavy’s head and was only two thirds full. When offered water in a smaller bowl that was easily accessible,
the cavy drank for over 3 minutes.
If potable water is not always accessible to the animals, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal.
A sufficient amount of water, in a receptacle that is readily accessible, must be provided to the cavy to ensure the cavy is
properly hydrated, and maintained in good health.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
Three hedgehog enclosures, housing 11 hedgehogs, had excessive fecal build-up. Upon opening one enclosure, a large
number of fruit flies were observed. Proper cleaning of primary enclosures is crucial to minimize disease hazards, reduce
odors, and prevent pests. The primary enclosures for these animals must be cleaned. Excrete shall be removed from
primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards and to reduce odors.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
