ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 11:00 AM on 8/11/14 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee was not on on the
premises. The individual who answered the door informed the inspector that the Licensee was at a distant off-site
location and would not be returning until later this evening.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility
representative available to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 8/11/14.
