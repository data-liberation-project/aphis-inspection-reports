3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are nine enclosures throughout the hoop barn and whelping building that have severely rusted cage fronts
and/or rusty feeders that are in direct contact with the dogs. The rust is pitted and flaking and in some areas it has
eroded through the metal surface creating broken wires and holes in the feeders. There are 29 dogs in the affected
enclosures. Rust can affect structural strength and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of surfaces,
which can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All rusted surfaces that come into contact with the dogs must be
repaired or replaced so they can be properly cleaned and sanitized and to ensure structural strength.
