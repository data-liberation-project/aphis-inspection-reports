Facilities, general.
There were four guinea pigs observed that had escaped from enclosures and were free on the floor during this inspection.
The four animals were males that escaped from the extra male enclosures. Housing facilities need to protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals. Failure to do so can lead to injury or death from falls to the ground from the racks,
escape from the animal room, or become trapped outside the enclosure. The facility must be structurally sound and kept
in good repair, to protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely. Correct by October 12, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
