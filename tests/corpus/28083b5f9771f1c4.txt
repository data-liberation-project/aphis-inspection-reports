ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The cougar cub born last fall was observed limping in the pen. The cub was not weight bearing on the right front
leg. There was a mark on the fur on the inside lower leg indicating a possible wound. The mark could not be
observed well due to the cub's movement. Facility staff confirmed that the cub had been checked the last two days
and was not observed to be limping nor injured in any way. The limping and non-weight bearing walking observed
during the inspection is an indicator of pain and injury to the cub. The cub needs to be examined by the attending
veterinarian to properly identify the injury and determine a treatment plan. The treatment plan should be followed as
directed.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility does not have a current written enrichment plan for the primates. The pens have only minimal stuffed
animals or kong type toys. There are two primate housed alone without any other primates within sight. One is
housed alone due to recent medical issues and veterinarian oversight. The other however, does not have a medical
reason to be alone. Primates housed alone, where they can not see and hear the other primates, are at risk of
becoming distressed. All the primates are at risk of developing mental health stress and disorders from the lack of
adequate enrichment and mental stimulation that toys provide. Failure to maintain an adequate enrichment plan
sigend by the veterinarian results in distress for these animals.
Develop an enrichment plan that fully addresses the social needs of all the primates with special consideration for
the singly housed primates and follow all other recommendations provided from the veterinarian regarding the
enrichment program to prevent social and behavioral problems.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The pen housing one of the lions has a bent broken wire. The broken wire can easily scratch and injure the lion.
The shelter for one of the foxes has a hole in the bottom left corner. The hole has rough surfaces and reduces the
effectiveness of the shelter.
Maintain the enclosures to provide a safe place for the animals.
