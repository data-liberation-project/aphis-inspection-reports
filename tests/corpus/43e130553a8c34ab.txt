CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
The food and water certificate attached to the top of the primary enclosure was not completed for a 9 week old,
female Shorkie puppy (see air waybill # 001 CMH 28637383). The food and water certificate was not filled out
indicating when the puppy was last offered food and water prior to delivery to the carrier or intermediate handler.
Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog for transport in commerce unless the consignor certifies
in writing to the carrier or intermediate handler that the dog was offered food and water during the 4 hours before
delivery to the carrier or intermediate handler. Failure to complete the food and water certificate could affect the
heath and well-being of the animal being transported. Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or
cat for transport unless the food and water certificate in completed and attached to the outside of the enclosure.
