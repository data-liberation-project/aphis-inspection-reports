2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult female Poodle (m/c# 00022995862) was observed licking her lips repeatedly during the inspection. She had a
large amount of tartar on most of her teeth. The tarter covered the entire surface of many of the teeth. Her gum line was
reddened and swollen. An adult male Yorkie (m/c# 933000320406052) was also licking his lips repeatedly and had a
buildup of tartar on some of his teeth. His gums were very reddened with a noticeable amount of swelling. An area
above the right canine tooth was bleeding. Dental problems are painful, can affect the dog's ability to eat, and can cause
other medical problems in the dog. The licensee must have these dogs examined by a veterinarian to address their
dental problems, must follow the veterinarian's treatment protocol, and must keep medical records for inspection.

Time and method of identification.
The licensee is not properly identifying puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Nine puppies that were from two
separate litters did not have any form of identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet
recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must
properly identify puppies with an acceptable form of identification, which include a cage card (if litters are not comingled),


a microchip, a collar and tag, or a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written.
