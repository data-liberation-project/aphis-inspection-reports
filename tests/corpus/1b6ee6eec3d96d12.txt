INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol using cotton rats describes that isoflurane anesthesia will be used once before inoculation of test
article for restraint purposes. In review of the study records, the USDA inspector noted that a mix of CO2/O2 gas
was used on several animals one day in lieu of isoflurane. This change was made without prior approval by the
IACUC and has the potential to harm the animals as it potentially has a lower margin of safety then does isoflurane
gas. The facility must ensure that any significant change to the proposed use of animals is reviewed and approved
by the IACUC before initiating for the health and well-being of the animals.
