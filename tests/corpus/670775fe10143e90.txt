3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The room for the hedgehogs has accumulated fecal material and bedding present on the floor. Clutter, dust and
debris are present throughout the room. Thick cobwebs and debris are present on the walls. Excess equipment
and supplies are filling one side of the animal room. In addition, a large accumulation of animal cages and other
equipment awaiting cleaning are present on the ground in front of the animal building. There is no organization of
these materials, and the majority is being kept in unsanitary conditions and could potentially contribute to disease
hazards within the facility.
Accumulated bedding and fecal material on the floor contribute to odor and make it difficult to maintain adequate
pest control. Excess equipment and clutter make the animal room difficult to clean and sanitize, and accumulated
caging and other equipment preclude adequate pest control on the premises.
The floors and walls of the animal housing room must be cleaned, and clutter and debris removed from the room.
The licensee must also ensure that all unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property, and
that the premises are kept clean in order to minimize odor and pests. Additionally, useful items must be properly
cleaned, organized and stored so that all areas of the facility, especially the animal housing room, are kept clean
and free of accumulation of materials in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 7/18/16 and 9/11/17.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
