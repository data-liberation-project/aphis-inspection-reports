The shelter building, housing 8 rabbits, has wood trim on exterior of shelter that is in disrepair. The trim on the far left is
severely rotted in two places at the base. The trim to the right, nearest the entrance into the shelter, is missing an
approximately 3” section of wood where it no longer meet the floor. The missing piece and the rotted trim leave the
shelter building in disrepair and it can allow access of unwanted rodents into the rabbit housing area. This damaged trim

Facilities, general.
There is a quarter sized hole in the drywall above an outlet, directly behind a chinchilla enclosure. This hole could allow
the entrance of mice into the room housing the exhibit animals and mice could spread disease to the animals housed
therein. The wiring in this outlet is subject to chewing by mice. Based on the soiling around this opening, it appears that it
is utilized by vermin. This opening should be appropriately repaired to prevent the entrance of rodents; prevent electrical
situations; and to ensure the structural strength of this wall.
