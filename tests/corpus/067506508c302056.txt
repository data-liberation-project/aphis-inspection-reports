ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A note on the feeding record dated June 9, 2016 stated a young female mountain lion was observed limping on the
right front foot. On the feeding record it stated that the attending veterinarian would provide an estimate of the cost
and to get approval from the director before allowing a radiograph to be taken of the abnormal limb. Nothing
diagnostically has been accomplished to date. Delay or denial of necessary veterinary care can compromise the
health and well-being of the animal.
Ensure that the attending veterinarian has the appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care and to oversee the adequacy of the care of the animals.

The older female Pronghorn antelope appeared emaciated. The ribs, lumbar vertebrae, pelvic bone and all bony
prominences were evident from a distance. No discernible body fat was observed and there was obvious loss of
muscle mass in the neck and hindquarter. The animal has poor hair coat and hair loss,along both the right and left
side. The body condition appears to have worsen since the previous inspection conducted March 2016. In addition
according to the last record received the attending veterinarian has not observed this animal since December 2015
when he stated "the older doe may become a victim of winter kill with her advanced age and slipping body
condition. I will be monitoring this situation and keep all interested parties apprised". Caretaker stated this was a
normal behavior/condition for an elderly animal. No medical records or daily observation records were available at
the time of inspection to determine that this animal had been evaluated for these conditions. Excessive weight loss
and poor hair coat can be indicative of disease or injury. This animal must be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian and a diagnosis and treatment plan must be established and maintained.
The two young mountain lions had both front feet declawed on May 2, 2016. Caretaker stated that it was done
because the attending veterinarian recommended it for human safety. Declawing can cause pain, discomfort or
other pathological conditions. Declawing of a wild carnivore is not appropriate veterinary care, unless prescribed for
the treatment of an individual medical problem of the foot. These declaws were not done for this purpose.
Currently this cat has been observed to be limping on the right front foot for an extended period of time. Daily
feeding record indicated that the young female mountain lion named "True" was limping on right front foot. Despite
this cats history of injury and amputation no radiographs or any other diagnostic procedures had been performed on
this animal. This animal has not been observed by the attending veterinarian since May 9, 2016,It was first noted
on June 9, 2016, but had been observed sometime prior to that date. It also was stated that the cat was initially
caught in a leg hold trap and had an injury to the right front foot due to the capture method. Animal was declawed
on both front feet on May 2, 2016 and evaluated by the attending veterinary on May 9, 2016 to remove the
bandages from the declaw. No medical or daily observation records available during the time of inspection. The
caretaker stated the animal was "active but not moving normally.,still favoring the right front foot". Limping can be
indicative of disease or injury and can have negative effects on the normal gait long term. This animal must be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian and a diagnosis and treatment plan must be established and maintained.
One Collard Peccary named "Pistol Pete" both inside rear hooves were long and crossing over the outside hoof.
Overgrown hooves can cause changes in the angle of the toes, change the gait, cause discomfort when walking
and can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs such as arthritis. The hooves must be trimmed and a plan
needs to be developed and documented, wit the input of the attending veterinarian, to address the need for hoof
trimming for all animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the development of chronic food and leg
problems.The following expired medications were found inside the commissary:
2 tubes- Pyrantel paste
6 tubes -Ivermectin paste
2 tubes -Banamine
1 tube - Duramectin
Expired medication may not act as expected or be effective which can prolong the medical condition. Facility must
utilize medication that is not expired.
This facility must ensure that the use of appropriate methods are in place to prevent control, diagnosis, treat
diseases and injuries.

An older female pronghorn and a young female mountain lion were noted to have veterinary medical issues that had
been ongoing for an undetermined amount of time. No medical and daily observation records were available at the
time of inspection. The caretaker could not be specific on duration, extent or cause of any of these problems. It
was not considered as an abnormal condition in an elderly animal (Pronghorn). The mountain lion was considered
to be improving because it was "more active" in the caretaker opinion. A mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is accomplished so that information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Daily observation of all animals will be accomplished to assess the health and well being of the animals.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The barrier next to the observation window for the bear does not adequately preclude the public from stepping over
or reaching across and being able to touch or grab the fence. The barrier along the side and in front of the
enclosure housing a bobcat named "Spark" does not adequately preclude the public from being able to lean over,
touch or put their fingers inside the animal enclosure. Along the walking trail next to enclosure #18 housing one
bobcat is an open gap between two cactus that the public has access to walk right up to the bobcat enclosure.These barriers do not adequately assure the safety of the animals and the public from possible injuries.
Ensure that barriers are of sufficient distances between the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
animals and the public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the commissary sitting on the freezer is a bucket of food for the black bear. Inside the bucket was two rotting
mangos that was going to be fed that morning. Inside the refrigerator located in the storage area and the main
commissary room several boxes had rotting fruit and corn. The rotting or contaminated produce that is located
inside the refrigerator can be fed to the animals. In the commissary pesticides/chemicals are being stored next to
wormer/medications which could potentially become contaminated by these pesticides.
Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities so that it is protected from deterioration, moldy and contamination.

SANITATION.
On top of the cabinet inside the storage room inside the commissary building is two feed pans with mouse feces
inside. The pans are sitting next to fire ant pellets and two cans of white lithium grease inside the pans. Insulation
has fallen down from the ceiling inside the storage room area in the commissary building. Cobwebs were hanging
down above the door inside the storage room and along the corner inside the commissary room. These conditions
are unsanitary they can attract pests which can potentially carry infectious diseases and impedes proper
housekeeping.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
