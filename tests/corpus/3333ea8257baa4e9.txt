the products used, the dosage, the route it is administered, how often it is used and what it is used for. The Program
of Veterinary Care must be accurate and update if changes are made to the Program of Veterinary Care. All dealers
must have a written Program of Veterinary Care to ensure that the animals at the facility are receiving proper
veterinary care. The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian is working on the new Program of Veterinary
Care, but it was not available for inspection by the USDA. To be corrected by: 05-13-15.
