ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:20 pm on
11/20/2014.
Inspectors arrived at the facility at approximately 1:20 p.m. and rang the doorbell. The wife of the licensee answered
the door and informed us that the licensee was out of town and that he may be back sometime next week but she
does not know for sure. I left my business card and asked for the licensee to call me with dates that he would be
available for an inspection.
Additional Inspectors
Moore Chad, Animal Care Inspector
