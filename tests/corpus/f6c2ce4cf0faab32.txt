2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The Attending Veterinarian has not been to the facility for a regularly scheduled visit since 11/10/21. The Program of
Veterinary Care calls for the Veterinarian to visit the facility 1-2 times yearly or more often if necessary. Not having the
Veterinarian visit the facility in the past year doesn't ensure that adequate veterinary care is being provided to the deer.
An appointment must be made with the Attending Veterinarian to have him/her conduct their annual visit to the facility.
Correct by 3/1/23.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records showing the date deer are received or when offspring are born and where they are coming from are not being
kept for the deer. Not documenting the required acquisition information for the deer doesn't allow for the proper tracking
of the animals by APHIS officials. All acquisition information must be documented for all regulated animals. Correct by
3/1/23.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.
