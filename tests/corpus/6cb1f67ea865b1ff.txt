FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The small exotic rodent trailer has 5 areas where the ceiling tiles are protruding out at the corners. These tiles are
damaged to the point where it is not safe for the racks of hamster enclosures below.
The ceiling must be constructed of such material and of such strength to protect the animals from injury in case one
of these tiles is to fall down on the stacked enclosures. The licensee must replace or repair all damaged ceiling tiles
to protect the health and well being of the animals.
