Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Animals on Hand is present but is not complete. The sheep, porcupine, wolf, and fox inventory is
inaccurate, and the serval and cattle are missing on the inventory paperwork. Births and deaths have not been recorded.
Names, addresses, dates, and license numbers are missing for most acquisitions and dispositions. Most recently,
approximately 24 sheep were sold/transferred to another facility without disposition paperwork or dates.

Incomplete records hinder traceability and management of animal ownership, diseases, and general commerce.
Complete and accurate records, including the number and species of animals on hand, dates of births and deaths, and
information such as names, addresses, dates, species, numbers of animals, and license numbers of buyers/sellers must
be made, kept, and retained for all animals. Correct by 8/16/21.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
