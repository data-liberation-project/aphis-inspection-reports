2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The acquisition and disposition records are incomplete. There is no record of the birth of one (1) guinea pig and
one (1) highland cow. Records of births must be kept to facilitate the regulatory requirements of the Animal Welfare
Act. Births of the guinea pig and highland cow must be recorded to maintain an accurate animal inventory and to
ensure the animals on hand receive proper care. Corrected during the inspection.
3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The floor of the black and white rabbit enclosure has 1 inch by 1 1/2 inch openings. The feet of the rabbits
housed in this cage can pass through the openings easily. A particle board has been placed in the enclosure.
However these boards do not cover the entire cage floor and may cause additional problems because of rough and
chewed edges. This was previously identified on the inspection report of 12-October-2016 and no change has been
made at the time of this inspection. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that protects the feet and
legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to to decrease the size of the openings for the
comfort of the rabbit and to prevent injury.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The build-up of the dark yellow material mixed with hair and debris still occurs along the back legs of the white
metal rabbit enclosures. Although the cages have been cleaned and sanitized, the product and methods to remove
the build-up is ineffective. Preventing the buildup of old feces and debris eliminates bacteria and viruses that may
cause harmful diseases and discomfort. The material must not be allowed to collect along the back legs of the
enclosures. A method to effectively remove the material must be used to prevent build-up and to minimize
exposure of the rabbits to disease.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. ***Goat enclosure: The gate for the goat enclosure is a wire panel loosely secured with carabiners and a chain. The
gate must be better secured, such as a hinge or metal fence clamps, to ensure the gate is kept closed to prevent
escape and the unwanted entry of patrons. The gate must be constructed in a manner that will allow the gate to be
properly closed to prevent unwanted person or animal escape.
***Highland cow / Zebu: On one end of the gate, a set of 4 rungs of board fencing are attached to a wood support
post and extends beyond the post but does not extend all the way to the metal support pole that secures the gate.
The unattached boards leave a gap between the fence and the gate, approximately 2 inches wide. Efforts have
been made to close the gap and secure the gate adequately with an additional metal pole and twine. A single chain
secures the opposite end of the gate. The gate must be secure in a fashion that would prevent an animal or person
from dislodging the gate to ensure the containment of the animals.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The deer feed trough has jagged edges from chewing, that resulted in two deep U-shaped crevices along the top
edge of the trough. A leg of a deer could get caught in the crevices or some other injury may occur due to the
jagged edges and the W-shape of the trough damage. The feeding trough needs to be replaced or repaired to
prevent injury to the deer in the enclosure.
***Mouflon sheep: The back of the shelter had not been repaired since the last inspection. The day of inspection,
work on the shelter had begun. The back was removed for replacement to replace the badly damaged side.
Shelters must be kept in good repair to maintain the integrity of the structure, prevent injury, and provide adequate
protection from various weather conditions.
NOTE: Materials have been bought to fix the shelter at the time of signing of the report on October 27, 2017.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Rat holes were still noted behind the white nosed coati enclosure. New rat holes have appeared since the last
inspection around the prairie dog, coati, and the petting zoo goat enclosure. The rat problem continues but their is
less evidence of their prescience. I did not observe any rats during the inspection. Rodenticide was recently placed
into some of the holes. Rats are known to carry various diseases that may affect the health of the exhibit animals. A
safe and effective pest control program is required to ensure good animal health. Implemented pest control
measures must be continued at an appropriate frequency to prevent harborage and recolonization of the rodent
population.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES. ***The facility houses 64 regulated animals, numerous birds, and one (1) turtle. There are only two (2) employees
and occasional help to feed, clean enclosures, and to conduct the maintenance of the enclosures and upkeep of the
property. The two main employees also keep records and provide the daily observations of the animals have
regular responsibilities for jobs unrelated to those of the zoo.
Based upon the number of animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal and
maintenance there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry
responsibilities of the facility on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out
the day to day husbandry duties and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed
to ensure that cleaning, animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at
professionally acceptable level for the number of animals housed at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
