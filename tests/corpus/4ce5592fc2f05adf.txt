2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Inspector reviewed the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). The PVC stated that ectoparasites will be
addressed (cid:28)As needed(cid:29). No notation was made regarding the type of medication, dosage, administration frequency,
and route used to administer medications. The PVC also states under the emergency care section that (cid:28)due to
distance we cannot guarantee availability(cid:29). A written PVC, which accurately reflects the arrangement of veterinary
care at the facility, is required in order to ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care. The licensee
must ensure that they are able to provide inspectors with current, written PVC, which has been developed in
conjunction with the attending veterinarian. The licensee must also ensure that if the primary attending veterinarian
is unavailable due to distance, that a secondary veterinarian is available should an emergency situation arise.

expiration date of May 2012, and a tube of Equimax dewormer (ivermectin/praziquatnel), with an expiration date of

not work as expected, may be contaminated, and could harm the animal if used. The facility must ensure that all
medications are not expired in order to protect the health of the animals.
