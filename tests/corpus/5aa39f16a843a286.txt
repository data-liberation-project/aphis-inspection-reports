3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The metal mesh flooring material in one rabbit enclosure is rusted in several places resulting in large holes in the
floor as well as wire points. This could result in injury to this rabbit. All primary enclosures must be structurally
sound and maintained in good repair to protect rabbits from injury, to contain them and to keep predators out.
