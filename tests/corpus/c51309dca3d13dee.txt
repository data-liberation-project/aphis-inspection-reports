Veterinary care for dogs.
Eight of the wolf/dog hybrids at the facility have not had a physical examination by the attending veterinarian within the
last 12 months. A complete physical exam from head to tail is beneficial as it may alert the veterinarian to health
concerns that require attention. In addition, a physical examination can help monitor any ongoing health issues.
