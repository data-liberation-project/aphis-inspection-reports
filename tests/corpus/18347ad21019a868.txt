3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Behind the white building there is an outdoor enclosure containing two dogs. The section of the wall of this
enclosure that is next to the gate has an excessive amount of dirt buildup on it. The buildup of dirt can increase the
risk of disease hazards towards the dogs. All used primary enclosures for dogs must be sanitized once every two
weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and reduce the risk of disease hazards.
