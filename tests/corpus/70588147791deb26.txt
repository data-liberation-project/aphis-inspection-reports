OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are five shelters within the white outdoor housing facility containing 11 dogs that do not have wind and rain
breaks at the entrance. In the far left enclosure a brown female Shiba Inu dog is observed shivering slightly at the
entrance of a shelter that does not have a wind and rain break. In the adjacent enclosure to the right, there is a
tri-colored female beagle that is also shivering slightly.
Lack of wind and rain breaks does not provide protection from the elements. The shelters being used must be
provided with a wind and rain break at the entrance.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
None of the shelters within the white outdoor housing facility contain any bedding material and is affecting 18 dogs.
According to the inspector's Kestrel device, the current air temperature recorded at approximately 2:00 p.m. at the
facility is 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Information provided by the National Weather Service states, the low temperature
last night was 18 degrees Fahrenheit and there will be a low of around 23 degrees Fahrenheit tonight. Several small
breed dogs are slightly shivering in the outdoor run area and in the sheltered portion of the enclosures. The facility
representative is not sure about the availability of bedding material on site and will have to speak to the licensee
about acquiring the materials needed.
Failure to provide clean dry bedding within dog shelters does not ensure the animals can remain warm and dry
during low temperatures which can lead to health hazards for the animals. Shelters for dogs must contain clean, dry
bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Additional clean, dry bedding is
required when the temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit or low. Sufficient bedding material needs to be provided
for all outdoor shelters being used.
