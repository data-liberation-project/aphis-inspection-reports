3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
-A Fennec fox was playing in its housing when the staff identified it was limping. The Fennec fox was taken to the
attending veterinarian’s clinic and an x-ray revealed a broken right rear leg. Surgery was performed to pin the leg. The
Fennec fox was not healing properly. During the third surgery to amputate the leg, the decision to euthanize was made
and performed.
-The housing for the Fennec fox led to a serious injury in the animal. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury. A routine review of the enclosure must occur to identify potential areas of
injury and measures taken to correct these.
Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
