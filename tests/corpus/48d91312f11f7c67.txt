ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The 500mg Cephalexin Capsules being administered to the female leopard for a foot abrasion were in containers
with labels that indicated the medication was expired. One of the bottles had an expiration date of December 2009
and the other October 2014. Using expired medication for treatment is not an accepted and appropriate method of
veterinary care. Expired medications may lose their effectiveness for treatment. Expired medication must not be
used.
Correct immediately.
