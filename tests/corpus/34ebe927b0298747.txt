ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*During the Dec. 15, 2015 inspection, two animals were noted requiring veterinary care. The non-compliance as
cited on the inspection report stated that the animals needed to be examined by a veterinarian. Review of facility
daily log records and conversations with facility staff showed that the facility attempted to take the animals to the vet
on 12/16/15 but the vet was unavailable due to an emergency. No record of a rescheduling of the appointment was
noted. Then on 12/18/15 there was a notation that the mouflon left the facility, taken by A. Another notation on
1/15/16 stated that E.C. took the savannah cat. There were no notations that the cat was examined by a
veterinarian between 12/15/15 and 1/15/16.
*The current written Program of Veterinary Care states that the attending veterinarian will visit the facility every two
months to ensure adequate veterinary care for the animals at the facility. The last notation or signature of the
attending veterinarian visiting the facility was on 10/23/15.

The facility must assure that the attending veterinarian is given appropriate authority to ensure adequate veterinary
care for animals. This includes ensuring that the veterinarian makes regularly scheduled visits to the facility and that
animals in need of veterinary care are examined and treated appropriately. Correct from this day forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The dispostion record information is noted in the daily log however the information is incomplete. The disposition
records note that A. acquired Hawaiian sheep and a mouflon on Dec. 18, 2015. Only a first name was recorded. No
last name or address was recorded. The number of sheep disposed of was not recorded. E. C. acquired a
savannah cat on Jan. 15, 2016. No address was recorded. It is difficult to determine the status of all regulated
animals if complete records are not maintained. It is required to disclose name and address of person to whom an
animal was sold or given,species of animals ,number of animals and date of transaction. Maintain disposition
records for all regulated animals. Correct from this day forward.
