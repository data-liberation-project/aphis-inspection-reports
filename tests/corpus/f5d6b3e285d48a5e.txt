FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the deer and elk enclosure there is a woven wire fence running along the center of the enclosure that can be
used to divide the area into two pens. In two separate areas of this fencing, the animals have torn through the wire
creating large holes in the fence. The areas of broken wire have resulted in sharp points around the edges of the
holes and the vegetation around these holes has been trampled forming dirt paths indicating that the animals are
walking through these holes.
Fencing that has broken creating holes and sharp points could cause injury to the animals. The facility must be
constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The outdoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the
animals.
The broken sections of fencing must be replaced, repaired, or altered in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to
the animals. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for the animals at all time.

SEPARATION.
There are three male elk and five female elk housed together in one large enclosure. An immature male elk (DOB
2012) was observed to have large sections of hair missing from both sides of his body and along the top of the hips.
The most extensive areas of hair loss are located along the ribs and flanks of both sides of the animal and on the
left shoulder. Some of the areas are completely free of hair and the skin is readily visible. The facility
representative said the two mature males in the enclosure would push and shove the immature male around. This
inspection occurred near the breeding season for the elk when the males could be more aggressive. The two
mature males both had a large set of antlers and were observed to be sparing with each other during the inspection.The harassing behavior by the mature males towards the immature male and the resulting areas of hair loss on the
immature male indicated that he is not compatible to be housed in this enclosure with these animals. Injury to the
immature male could result if he is continued to be housed with the mature males. Animals housed in the same
primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere with their health or
cause them discomfort.
The immature male elk must be separated from the mature males until it can be determined that they are
compatible to safely co-exist in the same enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all animals in the enclosure are
compatible in order to promote their health and well-being.
