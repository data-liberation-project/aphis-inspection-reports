2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee was not able to provide a written Program of Veterinary Care at the time of the inspection. The
licensee must maintain a written program when the attending veterinarian is part time and have regularly scheduled
visits to the premises of the exhibitor. When I contacted the attending veterinarian they acknowledged that they
have a veterinary client patient relationship but did not have a formal written arrangement on file or a regular
visitation schedule. A written program is necessary to ensure the health and safety of the animals exhibited by the
licensee. The attending veterinarian stated she has not visited the current site. Maintain a written program of
veterinary care including a regular visitation schedule when the attending veterinarian is part time.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
