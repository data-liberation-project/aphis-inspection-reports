HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility had areas of excessive clutter. In the puppy area housing 2 puppies, empty boxes, bedding, empty feed
bags and other items have accumulated. In between the stacked metal enclosures debris including dust, pet hair,
food, dog bones and snail shells were present. In the cat/dish-washing/medication room housing 4 cats, there was
an excessive amount of clutter on the counters where medications used on animals were intermixed with tools,
cleaning supplies and other items. Rodent droppings were interspersed among the items on the counter. Animal
housing areas must be kept neat and free of clutter to facilitate cleaning and pest control and to protect the health
and well-being of the animals.

3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lower metal pipe of the chain link fences running between at least 3 dog enclosures, housing 5 dogs were
rusted through affecting the structural strength of the enclosure, preventing the ability to appropriately clean and
sanitize the enclosures and exposing the dogs to the sharp surfaces of rusted pipe. At least 14 metal feedersaffecting 28 dogs were rusted in areas in contact with the food, feed stuck to the rusted portions, preventing the
ability to appropriate clean and sanitize the feeders to prevent spread of disease to maintain health and wellbeing of
the animals. Excessive rust inhibits the ability to thoroughly clean and sanitize the surface and can affect structural
strength. The licensee must repair or replace rusted feeders and repair or replace excessively rusted metal in the
affected enclosures.

3.9(b)
FEEDING.
Red plastic feed receptacles in at least 10 enclosures affecting 20 dogs were chewed and dirty. The feeders were
chewed along the upper edges with hair and dirt stuck to the chewed areas prohibiting appropriated cleaning and
sanitization. Several metal feeders that had just been cleaned and sanitized were resting on top of the enclosures
and about to be placed into the enclosures, were caked with food debris. Feed receptacles must be made of
durable material that can be easily cleaned and sanitized in order to provide wholesome uncontaminated feed. Food
receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste and other disease hazards.
