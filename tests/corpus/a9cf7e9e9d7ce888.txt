3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bottom of the metal siding of the barn housing three adult female camels has rusted and broken resulting in
sharp points and jagged edges at the level of the animals. At least on fence panel located near this section of the
barn has broken near the ground resulting in sharp points. Within at least two camel enclosures, containing a total
of four adult female camels, the fence is attached to the wooden posts by metal wire and the sharp ends of the
wires are protruding into the enclosures at the level of the camels. In the barn containing two adult camels and one
juvenile, there is a wire hanging from the fence panel covering the window directly above the automatic waterer,
which has resulted in a sharp point located at the level of the camels.

In the stall containing one camel the door is covered by a sheet of metal. The metal at the top of the door has
become loose and bent inward creating sharp points and edges that the camel could reach.
Sharp points and jagged edges could cause injury to the animals. Indoor and outdoor housing must be maintained
in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. The licensee must remove all sharp points and jagged
edges or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the animals. The licensee must ensure that the
enclosures are safe for the animals at all times.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is an excessive buildup of feces, dirt and hay covering the entire floor of the stall containing one camel. The
feces are mostly dry and located beneath the hay that is given to the camel. Some piles of fresh feces are located
on top of the hay and around the water bucket and are beginning to attract flies and pests. The facility
representative stated that the camel is given hay in a feed bunk in the stall but scatters all the uneaten hay around
the stall.

In the barn containing two adult camels and one juvenile camel, the entire floor is covered by an excessive buildup
of feces, dirt and hay. The feces near the door are dry and compacted onto the floor from the camels walking inand out of the barn. Buildup of organic waste material can increase the risk of disease hazards towards the
animals.

Excreta shall be removed from enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize
disease hazards and reduce odors. The licensee must clean all organic waste material from the stalls as often as
necessary to minimize the disease risk to the animals.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There are unused items stored in the corner of the stall containing one camel. The items consist of a plastic bucket,
metal fence posts, and sheets of siding. In the barn containing two adult camels and one juvenile there is a large
section of hay netting lying on the floor and hay netting is located in the fence panels covering the windows of the
building. There is also a roll of wire and loose cords hanging from the fence panel covering the window above the
automatic waterer. The unused items, loose cords and hay netting could pose an injury risk towards the animals
and collect dirt, dust and cobwebs.
In the outdoor section of the enclosure containing one camel there are three unused fence panels leaning on the
primary fence. Two of these metal panels have rusted and broken resulting in sharp points and jagged edges at the
level of the camel. In the enclosures containing six watusi cattle there is an unused chain link fence panel leaning
against the primary fence. The unused fence panels are not securely attached to the primary fence and could pose
an injury risk to the animals. The sharp points and jagged edges of the rusted unused fence panels could also pose
an injury risk to the animals.

Premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury and trash shall be removed as necessary
and placed in designated areas. The licensee must remove all unused fence panels and items from the animal
enclosures and place the loose hay netting in an appropriate area for trash. The licensee must ensure that the
premises is kept clean and free of clutter to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
