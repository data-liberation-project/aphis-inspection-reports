Six water tubs (affecting 17 sheep/ 22 goats/ 1 wallaby/ 1 kangaroo) in paddocks along the east side of facility had a
large amount of green slime on the bottom and sides of the tubs. Some had floating mats of green algae in them.
Contaminated water can be unpalatable and unhealthy for the animals. All water containers must be kept clean and
sanitary.
To be corrected by September 1, 2021. Scrubbing of affected water tubs had started by the end of the inspection.
