***A female Golden Retriever, microchip # 0A02074141, was observed in a very thin body condition. This dog
exhibited a significant abdominal tuck as well as a narrowing in front of the hip bones. A large amount of hair was
also shedding from the coat. It was observed that this female was currently nursing a litter of six puppies that were
approximately 5 weeks of age. Palpation of the dog's body revealed prominent protrusions of the rib, vertebra and
hip structures with little to no fat deposit. The owner stated she had placed this female a full feed diet of puppy food
but had not taken further steps to increase the conditioning of this dog. Poor body conditioning can substantially
impact an animal's ability to ward off disease as well as impair the ability to feed puppies. Consultation with a
licensed veterinarian is necessary to properly diagnose this dog's condition as well as establish a treatment and
nutrition plan. Documentation should be maintained for review on future inspections. To be corrected by: 06/26/14
Two adult poodles were observed in the sheltered kennel with extensive matting on approximately 85 percent of the
body. The matting covered the rib areas as well as both hind legs. The matting was discolored and flattened
against the skin. Thick, flattened matting can create areas that not easily observable as well as areas that are
conducive to skin disease and irriations. These dogs must be clipped to ensure easier observation of the skin as
well as reducing the potential of skin irritations. To be corrected by: 06/26/14
