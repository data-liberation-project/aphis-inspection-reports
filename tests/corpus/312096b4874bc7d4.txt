3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
There was no shelter from inclement weather provided for two enclosures each housing two camels. The inability to take
shelter from rain, especially seasonal winter rains, could cause discomfort to the animals and adversely impact their
health.
The facility should ensure that animals housed at the facility have access to shelter that will adequately protect them from
inclement weather.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
