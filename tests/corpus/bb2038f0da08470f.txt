2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 on
07-Nov-16.
Attempts to contact the licensee included knocking on doors of the house, calling the home and work numbers listed
for the licensee and leaving voicemails on each line. After waiting 30 minutes with no response, the inspector left
the premises.
Without a responsible adult, the inspection cannot be conducted, making regulation impossible. The licensee must
ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable adult is available during regular business hours to accompany inspection.
Correct from this time forward.
