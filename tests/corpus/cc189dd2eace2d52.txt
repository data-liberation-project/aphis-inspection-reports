FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Various wastes, including bedding, hay, debris, waste water, and rodent droppings, were visualized outside
approximately 60% of the primary enclosures.
Accumulations of waste in the facility can create disease hazards for guinea pigs. Disposal facilities must be
utilized, and wastes must be removed and disposed of, so that vermin infestation and other disease hazards can be
minimized. Presence of rodent droppings outside of the primary enclosures illustrates that vermin have been
present.
Wastes that have accumulated outside primary enclosures must be removed and disposed of by the licensee so
that vermin infestation, odors, and other disease hazards can be minimized.
