3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
All of the enclosures had a a buildup of dark brown greasy residue on the fronts, sides, water bottles, and on the
waste water piping. The licensee stated he removed the bedding from the enclosures and then sprayed a
disinfectant. No detergent was used to remove the organic material and greasy residue before the sanitizing
process.
The lack of removing the organic material can allow for harboring of disease and makes the sanitizing process
ineffective. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta
and debris, provide however, that such enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every two weeks in a manor
provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section; to include washing and sanitizing with hot (180*F) water and soap or
detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a
safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam.
