Facilities, outdoor.
There are multiple gaps beneath gates along the perimeter fence. These gaps range from 4-8 inches between the ground
and the bottom of the gates. Additionally, a section of the perimeter fence near the visitor parking lot has thick weeds
growing on either side of it. This obscures the bottom third of the fence from view and makes it difficult to assess if the
fence is structurally intact.
A perimeter fence that is not maintained in good repair can allow unwanted animals to enter the facility and potentially
harm the animals within. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
To be corrected by August 1, 2022.
