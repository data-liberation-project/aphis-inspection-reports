FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During this inspection it was noted that the siding on several of the buildings were in need of repair. The first pen
that housed 2 sheep and 12 goats had siding missing from the right side of their shelter and now jagged edges of
tar paper were present. The lower barn in the pen that housed 9 goats and 4 sheep also had damaged wood siding
and missing wood planks. Again, jagged edges of tar paper were present. The last pen that had an (cid:28)A(cid:29) framed
shelter in it also had a metal strip detaching from the wood frame and shingles were missing.
To ensure that these sheds are structurally sound, in good repair, and do not pose a threat to the animals they will
need to be addressed.
