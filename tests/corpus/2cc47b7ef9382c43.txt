ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female Welsh Corgi named Ellie Mae (last 4 digits of her microchip #0563) had been attacked through the
fence by another dog in an adjacent pen about a week ago. The kennel owner had made appropriate adjustments
to the kennel layout to isolate the aggressive dog and had cleaned the wound. Ellie Mae's left ear was missing a
large piece and it was red, crusted, and had pus oozing from the wound. The kennel owner was using a
non-prescription spray to clean the ear daily but had made no attempts to contact his attending vet in the preceding
week.
A 4 month old red and white male Welsh Corgi pup (last 4 digits of his microchip #211B) had large patches of fur
missing from his face and feet. The skin was red and darkened and had small scabs all over. His eyes had a yellow
creamy discharge. The puppy was not as active as its littermate in the same pen. The puppy had received no
treatment for his condition.
The kennel owner called the veterinarian during the inspection and left to take both animals to the vet at the
conclusion of the inspection. The vet confirmed that both dogs received treatment.
Adequate veterinary care must be provided to sick and injured animals. Communication with the veterinarian must
be timely and accurate to ensure best possible outcomes and improve animal welfare.
Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
