FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Harpo the goat pen: the shed rooftop has a hole (approximately 4(cid:29)" x 3"(cid:29) hole in the roof) on it. The animal could
get a hoof caught in the hole and injure himself. The roof must be constructed of such material and of such

the animals from injury and to contain the animals. A program is needed to routinely inspect and repair the pen and
structures within it.
