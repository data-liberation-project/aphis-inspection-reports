3.80(a)(2)(v) Direct Repeat

Primary enclosures.
One olive baboon is housed in sheltered housing. The shelter is attached to the outdoor portion of his enclosure. There is
no lockout inside the heated shelter. As a result, the nonhuman primate is locked outside and exposed to cold weather
and temperature extremes while his indoor housing facility is cleaned and sanitized and inspected. At the time of
inspection at approximately 12:45 PM, the lead inspector's Kestrel 3000 read a temperature of 28.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
Forcing the animal to stay outside during these events can lead to discomfort, suffering, freezing of fingers and toes, or
other injuries. The applicant must construct primary enclosures so that they provide adequate shelter and protect from
extreme temperatures and weather conditions that may be uncomfortable or hazardous to the species of nonhuman
primate contained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
