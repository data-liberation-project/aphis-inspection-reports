2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* “Georgie” a 12 year old female Tan Pomeranian (ID#: 095525563) was lethargic and thin in appearance. The
prominent ribs, backbone and hipbones could be observed and felt during the inspection. At the time of inspection,
a veterinarian had not been consulted. The licensee stated that he had noticed the dog losing weight over the last
two months.
When a dog continues to lose weight to the point the backbone or ribs are visible is a sign of potential health
problems for the dog. The continued loss of weight could be an indication the dog is not receiving adequate nutrition
or it could be internal problems.
This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administered.
Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments. All medical records must be
available to the inspector upon request. Additionally, all animals must receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three metal self-feeders were used in three enclosures to feed five adult dogs. The metal surface for the areas
where the dogs eat out of these feeders were excessively rusty and corroding. These metal surfaces cannot be
properly cleaned and sanitized. As a result, improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease potential
for the animals.
All metal surfaces must be maintained and kept rust free. This will allow for required cleaning and sanitization of the
surfaces and the prevention of disease potential for the animals. To be corrected by, 10-January-2017.
3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* An enclosure housing one adult dog had an approximately 2 foot long by 1 inch wide gap for the seam where to
two sections of mesh flooring meet. This gap can allow for the dogs’ feet to pass through or get stuck between the
two sections. This could injure the dog or affect the animals’ gait.
All mesh flooring must not allow for the dogs feet to pass through gaps and holes in the flooring. This will allow for
normal gait and prevention of injury to the animal.
To be corrected by, 28-December-2016.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The area where the back walls and ceiling meet directly above the dogs’ enclosures had an accumulation of cob
webs and dust. The PVC pipe water line fasten to the back wall above five enclosures had and accumulation of
brown dirt on the pipe. The two windows above two dog enclosures had an accumulation of cob webs, dead flies
and dust. This can attract and provide living and breeding areas for rodents, insects, other pests and vermin. As a
result, this can affect the health and well-being of 18 adult dogs.
All housing facilities must be kept clean and free of accumulation of discarded matter. This will facilitate pest
control, thus protecting the health and well-being of the dogs.
