FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A sloth is being housed in a temporary enclosure while a new permanent enclosure is being constructed. Inside the
temporary enclosure there were electrical wires within reach of the sloth. While these wires are encased in heavy
plastic, their accessibility to the animal poses a risk of electric shock in the event that the animal were to chew on
the wires.
All enclosures should be structurally sound and free of hazards that could injure the animals. Steps should be taken
immediately to minimize the risk of contact with electrical wires, and more permanent modifications should be
complete by 5/2/17.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence around the facility is not consistently six feet in height, as required. One section measured was
only 54 inches in height. The height of the fence has been reduced over the years by landscaping changes.
The purpose of the perimeter fence is to keep people and animals from coming onto to the premises by passing
under or through the fence, and also to act as secondary containment in the event that one of the exhibit animals
should escape its enclosure. Failure to maintain the perimeter fence in good conditions that meet the standards
specified in this regulation could put the animals at risk. The fence should be improved so that it meets the six foot
height requirement. To be corrected by 10/18/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
