2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The white llama has overgrown hooves on both the front and back feet. The
ends of the hooves are curved, causing the toes of the feet to be spread apart when the animal stands. Long
hooves may cause problems such as hoof rot and lameness. Each exhibitor must establish and maintain an
adequate program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries. Correct by having the hooves on the white llama trimmed. Correct by November 10,
2016.
