ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:45 pm on
13-Apr-17. I called two contact numbers, honked the vehicle horn, and waited in the facility driveway for 35 minutes
in an attempt to contact the license holder. All attempts were unsuccessful.
A responsible person shall be available to accompany inspection during business hours.
