2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection, the following animals were in need of veterinary attention:
-adult male Dromedary camel, “Zo”
-adult female Fennec fox, “Foxy”
-female Ibex, “Pixie”
-female coati, “Tuffy”
-adult sheep with ear tag 00384
-three female adult pigs located in the barn
-adult black and white female sheep
-adult male tricolor goat located in the barn
The facility failed to observe that these animals were in need of veterinary attention. Facility representatives
informed APHIS personnel that the attending veterinarian had not examined these animals and were unable to
provide any documentation indicating that the attending veterinarian was notified about the condition of the animals.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and
the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In one corner of the eland enclosure, the wire fencing along the bottom is curving in an upward direction, creating
a large gap between the ground and the fencing. This is unchanged since the previous inspection. ***There was a strand of broken metal fencing lying on the ground in the eland enclosure, with a sharp point facing
upward.
***In the eland enclosure, the base of a metal pole that serves as part of the fence is rusted through, thus
compromising its structural integrity.
***The gate in the young male Dromedary camel enclosure that separates his enclosure from an adjacent empty
enclosure is in disrepair. The gate is leaning inward and is attached to the structural post by baling twine. The metal
bar at the top of the gate is broken at one side and entangled in the wire of the gate. This is unchanged since the
previous inspection.
***The sheet metal in the stall containing three pigs was rusted and in disrepair, peeling off of the wall. It formed
numerous sharp edges that could come into contact with the animals. This is unchanged since the previous
inspection.
***In an enclosure containing 12 sheep, multiple screws were sticking out of the wooden boards into the enclosure.
***In the enclosure containing an adult male goat, Gozar, there was a metal pole lying on the ground along the
fence. There was a hole in the pole with sharp, rusted edges that could injure the animal.
***In an enclosure containing 8 goats, there was a metal stall with one of the walls in disrepair. The bottom portion
of the far wall of the stall contained sharp and rusted metal edges.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Several enclosures did not have adequate shade to protect all of animals from direct sunlight.
-An enclosure containing 9 goats
-An enclosure containing five goats and two pigs
-An enclosure containing 11 La mancha goats and 1 Boer goat
-An enclosure containing 2 adult water buffalo
The areas of shade provided were not large enough to allow all of the animals within the enclosure to be protected
from direct sunlight. At the time of inspection, the temperature registered on the Kestrel 4000 was 106.1 degreesFahrenheit. Several of the goats and sheep were exhibiting signs of a heat stress, as indicated by the animals
standing or lying down with extended necks and panting.
Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Near the eland enclosure, a large portion of the perimeter fence was in disrepair. One of the metal poles
stabilizing the chain link was leaning outward, away from the property at approximately a 30 degree slant. Another
metal stabilizing pole was leaning inward. Along one section of the fence, the metal bar at the top of the fence was
broken into two pieces.
*** At the front of the property, near the hinny and sheep enclosure, an approximately 100 foot long segment of the
perimeter fence was less than 6 feet tall.
***Near the enclosures containing the coati and Fennec fox, a tree was leaning on the perimeter fence.
All of the issues cited above decrease the efficacy of the perimeter fence to function as a secondary containment
system for the regulated animals and to protect them from outside animals entering the premises.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment
system. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
***In the center aisle of the barn there were two open bags of feed. They were next to a pile of of building materials
and feed bags, which were covered in dust, rodent feces, and spider webs. There were a few flies flying in and out
of the opened feed bags.
Contaminated food may harbor pathogens and cause disease in the animals. Also, the nutritive value of
contaminated food is unknown. The licensee must ensure that all food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from
contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.
To be corrected by: May 30, 20173.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Several enclosures had dirty water receptacles.
***In an enclosure containing 3 adult camels there was a buildup of a green substance on the interior surface of the
water receptacles along with debris floating on top of the water.
***The drinking water in an enclosure containing 5 juvenile goats and two pigs, as well as the drinking water in an
enclosure containing 2 adult water buffalo was a brown liquid.
***In the enclosure containing a combination of 22 sheep and goats there was a buildup of green substance on
interior surface of receptacle.
Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that animals are provided
with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate hydration. Water
receptacles should be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***In an enclosure containing one adult zebra and two adult donkeys, there was an excessive accumulation of
manure under both of the shade structures. Excessive accumulation of animal waste can increase risk of disease
and affect the well-being of the animals.
***In an enclosure containing two adult water buffalo, there was a mud wallow. There was a green substance
floating on the water. APHIS personnel noticed a foul odor when they approached the wallow. Dirty water can pose
a health risk to the animals as it can contain bacteria and parasites.
Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to
reduce disease transmission, and to prevent animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must
clean this enclosure and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as necessary to promote
normal husbandry standards.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***In the center aisle of the barn, alongside the stall containing three adult pigs, there was an accumulation of
building materials, feed bags, buckets, debris, and a skull, all covered in dust, spider webs, and rodent feces.
***In the stall containing three adult pigs there was an accumulation of cobwebs along the walls. Accumulation of materials and debris make it difficult to maintain husbandry standards, can be areas for harboring
pests which can transmit disease to the regulated animals and may be an indication of substandard husbandry
practices. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals
from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
To be corrected by: May 30, 2017
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***There were numerous flies on the growth on the chest pad of the adult male Dromedary camel, Zo.
***A female camel and her newborn (born on Sunday) had numerous flies on their hind legs. The adult had several
flies on and around her face. Additionally, there were numerous flies around the umbilicus on the newborn.
***There were numerous flies in the enclosure containing an adult male goat, called Gozar. The flies were crawling
along the wooden panels that were against the metal fencing.
There were several fly traps placed along different fence lines, however they were filled with dead flies and not
adequately controlling the pest problem. Excessive amounts of flies on or around the animals can be stressful to the
animal. Additionally, disease can be transmitted by the pests to the animals and they can contaminate feed and
water.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and
well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in all animal areas.
