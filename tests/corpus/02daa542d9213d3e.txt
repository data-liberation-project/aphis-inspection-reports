2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
In early November 2014, three macaques in the breeding colony were affected by a previous biosecurity breach, in
which one or more staff members had failed to adhere to established biosafety and infection control procedures.
This biosecurity breach led to the euthanasia of these animals. Handling of all animals should be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or
unnecessary discomfort. The IACUC acted by making the necessary changes in the SOPs, retraining staff and
implementing additional measures to prevent any further incidents.
Correct by: This incident has been addressed by the facility's IACUC and has been corrected.
The records review took place October 20, 2015 with APHIS personnel Dr. Simone Tomlinson, VMO, Dr. Tami
Howard, SACS and Dr. Elizabeth Meek, Assistant Regional Director. The exit interview took place with APHIS
personnel and the Associate Director of Veterinary Resources and Executive Director of Comparative Medicine.
