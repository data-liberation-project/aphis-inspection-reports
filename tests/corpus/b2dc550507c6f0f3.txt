2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
In November 2022, an adult male cheetah (“Santiago”) died after consuming parts of a lunch box and its contents (food
items) that had been dropped into the cheetah enclosure by a member of the public. The day of the incident, the attending
veterinarian observed two people riding on the ski lift overhead who yelled to her that they had dropped a lunch box into
the cheetah enclosure. The attending veterinarian immediately contacted animal care staff and the lunch box and its
contents were removed from the enclosure as quickly as possible, but the male cheetah (“Santiago”) had already
consumed parts of the insulated lunch box and it’s contents. Despite receiving extensive monitoring and veterinary care
the cheetah died a few days later. A large amount of undigested lunch box material was found in the animal’s stomach on
necropsy examination.
Animals who ingest foreign bodies may suffer from a blockage of the gut, discomfort, pain, or death. Correct by ensuring
that animals are handled and exhibited in a manner that assures the safety of the animals and the public. Temporary
correction due by January 1, 2023; permanent correction due by April 1, 2023.
3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.


Two primate indoor holding enclosures show signs of disrepair. The siamang enclosure, which holds two siamang, and
the chimpanzee enclosure, which holds four chimpanzees, both have a wire grate wall where the coating has completely
worn from the surface of the wire in some areas and the wire is severely rusted. The chimpanzee enclosure also has
areas of excessive paint chipping and missing grout from multiple locations along the concrete walls. This includes a 4’ x
8’ area of wall where the paint is chipped and missing along most of the grout lines, and chunks of grout are also missing.

Worn services that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized may harbor bacteria or otherwise be harmful to enclosed
animals, and paint chips could post a health hazard if ingested. Correct by March 31, 2023 by ensuring that all surfaces
are maintained on a regular basis so that they can be cleaned and sanitized adequately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Deputy Director.
