2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
The "Denmark" area of the facility housing 2 pigs, 2 wallabies and 2 rabbits lacks public barriers and allows public contact
with the animals. A readily identifiable attendant was not present during the inspection when members of the public were
observed walking through this area of the facility and came in contact with these animals. Lack of an identifiable attendant
does not provide the monitoring needed during public contact to ensure the safety of the public and animals. Provide and
maintain a readily identifiable attendant at all times during public contact with the pigs, wallabies and rabbits. Correct by 2
November 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Managers and Facility Representatives.
End of report.
