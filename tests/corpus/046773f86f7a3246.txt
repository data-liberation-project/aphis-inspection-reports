ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10: 50 on
02/19/2016. I also attempted to make contact by phone but voicemail was not active. I sent an email requesting
additional contact information.
