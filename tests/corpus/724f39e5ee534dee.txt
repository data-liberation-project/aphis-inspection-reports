2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
All of the dogs were last vaccinated for Rabies, Distemper, & Kennel Cough on August 5, 2014. The program of
Veterinary Care, and a conversation with the attending veterinarian's office, indicates that the dogs shall be
vaccinated yearly.
Yearly vaccinations are required to protect the dogs from communicable diseases, and the lack of timely
revaccinations are not an appropriate method to prevent diseases.
Your dogs shall be vaccinated according to the veterinarian's recommendations on the Program of Veterinary Care.
