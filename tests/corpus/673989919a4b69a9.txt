ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female beagle cross named "Lady," USDA #10, has an approximately 1-cm round raised hairless mass on the
outside corner of the right upper eyelid. The mass causes her eyelid to bunch up, and some minor clear discharge
is present on the inner corner of the eye, trailing down the side of her nose. The eye is very sensitive to discomfort
and drying out, and this mass can cause irritation either by rubbing directly on the surface of the eye, causing
infection, or by drying out the eye due to the eyelid being bunched and not closing smoothly over the eye when the
dog blinks. There is no record that the attending veterinarian has examined this dog or given any instructions as to
how to treat the eye in the event that any of the above circumstances occur. The licensee must have the dog
examined by a veterinarian and provide appropriate care according to their instructions. Additionally, a record of
this dog's condition and treatments must be kept and made available upon inspection to ensure adequate care is
being provided.
