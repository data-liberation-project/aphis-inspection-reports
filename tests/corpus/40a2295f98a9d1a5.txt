2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
A white tiger identified as "Diamond" delivered stillborn/premature cubs during 2013. The births were not recorded
or documented in the facility records. All offspring, including stillborn/premature births, must be included in the
records for any animal while in the possession of the licensee. Accurate records are necessary to fully and correctly
disclose information concerning animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his
or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by
that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possesion or
under his or her control.
Correct from this day forward.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There are two food bowls in the raccoon enclosure which contain meat and produce from the previous evening
feeding. Licensee acknowledged that the food had been in the enclosure for more than twelve hours. The
enclosure needs to be cleaned more often and food waste removed to reduce pest problems and to minimize
disease hazards.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The linoleum in the meat storage area still has multiple holes in it. The flooring along the left side as you enter the
meat storage area has areas of linoleum that is bubbling from underneath. This does not allow the floor to be
properly cleaned and sanitized as meat, water and debris can be lodged under it. The floor must be addressed so
that the floor can be cleaned and sanitized properly.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. Throughout the facility there are two live fire ant mounds. One of these mounds was against the enclosure fence for
the tiger ""Bocephus." The second mound was near the enclosure fence for the adult black bear. The licensee has
tested a new product in one area of the facility which appears to be very effective. The licensee plans to use the
product in the remaining animal areas. An effective program for fire ants shall be established and maintained.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
