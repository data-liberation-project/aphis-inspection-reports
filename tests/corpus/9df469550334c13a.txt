CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
***Inside the adult sheltered facility, there is an excessive amount of feces, food waste and grime under the pens in
the wash downs. Some of the feces had started to form a moving mass that looked like maggots. The excreta and
food wastes were attracting flies. The accumulation of feces increases the risk of disease by attracting pests and
providing an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must ensure that excreta and food waste are
removed from primary enclosures daily and from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an
excessive accumulation of feces and food waste in order to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
