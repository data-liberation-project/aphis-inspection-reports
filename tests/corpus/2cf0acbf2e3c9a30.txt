FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an enclosure housing a single kangaroo, a section of the enclosure fence is in poor condition with numberous
broken boards and numerous sharp points exposed to the enclosed animal. The condition of this fence is a source
of potential injury to the animal, and could potentially allow escape from the enclosure. The fence needs to be
repaired and maintained in good condition. All sharp points exposed to the animal must be removed.
