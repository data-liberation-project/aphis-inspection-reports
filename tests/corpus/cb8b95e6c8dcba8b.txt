TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are two young adult male dogs with no official identification. Proper identification is required in order to
ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements. All live
dogs held on the premises must be identified by an official tag affixed to the animal's neck by means of a collar,
legible tattoo, or microchip with available working scanner. To be corrected by 4 May 2017.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Of the eleven dogs listed on the APHIS form 7005 (Dogs on hand) the licensee reports that 5 are no longer on the
premises. Also, there are at least two dogs present in the facility that are not listed on the APHIS form 7005. The
lack of complete information on these forms makes it difficult to accurately track and monitor the dogs present in the
kennel. These forms must accurately and completely include all required information about all the dogs in the
facility. To be corrected by 4 May 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
