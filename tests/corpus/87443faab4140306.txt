ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A bottle of antibiotic that was being used to treat a dog was being stored without a lid in an open pill bottle. It was on
a shelf in a desk that had an accumulation of dust and debris, and one of the shelves was collapsing. Medications
that are stored in this manner can become contaminated and can affect their quality. This can affect the health of
the dogs. Medications need to be stored in a sanitary manner. This was corrected during the inspection.
********Corrected during the inspection
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the run building there was a wall board which had come apart from the bottom support board creating a large gap
to the outside. In addition, there was evidence of rodent droppings in the area. This could cause harm to the
animals inside since pests transmit diseases. Facilities need to be maintained in good repair and must be
structurally sound. They also must not allow outside pests inside of the building. The licensee repaired the wall
before the conclusion of the inspection.
********Corrected at time of inspection
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were two bags of dog food which had holes in them allowing the dog food inside to be exposed. This could
lead to contamination of the food, and cause it to become unwholesome. This could possibly lead to illness of the
dogs. Food items need to be stored in a proper manner in order to reduce contamination.
