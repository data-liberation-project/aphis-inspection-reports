ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Inspector identified dog #10 to have an eye issue. Licensee stated that he had not noticed the eye issue prior to
today's inspection. Not having daily observation to identifying health issues delays treatment and can cause the
dogs unnecessary pain and discomfort. Licensee must have a routine for daily observation and communicate all
health issues to their Attending Veterinarian within a timely manner.
