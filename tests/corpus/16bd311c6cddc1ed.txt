ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a formal Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) in place; however the PVC does not include all species
covered by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) that are currently on the premises. The PVC must be updated to include
all mammal species except rats of the genus Rattus and mice of the genus Mus. If desired, more than one
veterinarian may complete a separate PVC for the species that he/she oversees care for at the facility. Have the
attending veterinarian(s) update the PVC to ensure appropriate veterinary care is documented and provided for all
AWA covered species in the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries;
A guinea pig was observed to limp on it's right hind leg. Most of the time observed, it would not bear weight on the
right hind leg. Workers report it was separated a couple days ago into it's own cage and had a note on the cage,
however the Attending Veterinarian has not been notified about the problem and the guinea pig is not receiving any
treatment. Limping and not bearing any weight on a leg can be a sign of a painful condition and must be addressed
promptly by a veterinarian so that the animal receives appropriate treatment and pain relief if necessary. Health
problems or signs of injury in animals must be communicated to the Attending Veterinarian in a timely manner.
