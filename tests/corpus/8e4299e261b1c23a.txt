Facilities, general.
The lower portion of a section of the enclosure fencing, close to the driveway entrance, was bent upward into the the large
hoof stock pasture. This left a gap at the bottom of the primary enclosure fence and a pointed corner positioned at the
level of the animals legs.

The structure of the fence is compromised and could lead to the injury and/or escape of animals. The fence must be
repaired in a manner that ensures structural strength and that prevents escape or harm.

Sanitation.
Large Hoof stock Pasture: Metal farm equipment were in the pasture. The farm equipment have parts that stick up with a
blunt point and horizontal openings that an animal hoof can pass through or become entangled. Also, hay bale wrap were
scattered in the pasture in a section along the driveway.

Farm Animal Pasture: Piles of wood and metal farm equipment with a point and blades were in the pasture where the
animals roam.



Hazardous items in the pastures where the animals roam can lead to animal injury or illness. Grounds should be kept in
such a manner that protects the animals from injury and disease. Equipment that is no longer in use and hazardous trash
must be removed from the pastures for the health and safety of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
