2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The following was noted in the Sheep Unit's laboratory classroom: A cabinet labeled "University Veterinarian Only" was
unlocked and 3 vials of Magnesium Sulfate Injection were left out on top of this cabinet. One vial did not have a top cap
and was ready for use. The facility representative did not know what the injectable was used for and stated they were
probably placed there when a student was looking in the cabinet for gauze. An expired bottle of CPB toxoid ( dated May
2022) was being stored in the refrigerator. There was a collection of used syringes and caps, and one empty medication
vial which were not disposed of properly and accumulating under the microwave oven. There was a sharps container
provided and was not full. The refrigerator labeled "no human food or drink" had ice cream being stored in the freezer. At
time of inspection, there was a class in session and students had access to all areas of the laboratory. The manner of
handling of these medical drugs and materials including storage and disposal may lead to unintended misuse and be
harmful to the animals and humans coming in contact with them. Expired drugs should be stored in areas separate from
those in-date and facility labeled signs or instructions on cabinets and refrigerators should be followed for safety
precautions. Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
Supplies of food were not being stored in a manner which adequately protected them against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin. There were 2 torn bags of small ruminant feed with pellets spilled onto the floor. There was a
storage bin containing 2 bags of animal pellets that was not covered because the bags were too large to allow coverage
with the lid. Rodent and wild avian fecal material was identified in the room on both a shelf and on the floor surrounding
the feed. The facility representative stated the open bags of feed would be discarded. Open bags of feed can easily
become contaminated and spoiled which may affect the health and well-being of the animals. Supplies of food and
bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The food storage room has not been maintained in a clean manner. There was clutter present and an accumulation of
dust and debris collecting on the shelves and some areas of the floor. For example, on a cluttered shelf/ counter where
wild avian fecal material was present, there were food buckets, equipment, a cushion, 1 container of veterinary
supplements, and other items being stored. The presence of clutter can impede cleaning which may affect the health and
well-being of the animals. A system should be in place to ensure premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean
and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth
in this subpart

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
