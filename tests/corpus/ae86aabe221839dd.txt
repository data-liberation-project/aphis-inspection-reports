Recordkeeping requirements.
Several inaccurate statements were included in the IACUC Committee meeting minutes from September 30, 2021. The
minutes contained an inaccurate record of the attendance by stating that six people were present and only one departed
early. Facility personnel confirmed there were only four people present at the meeting with one early departure.
Additionally, the minutes contain a description of financial discussions that facility personnel confirmed did not take place
at this meeting. Accurate meeting minutes, including accurate records of attendance, are necessary to ensure that the
IACUC has met the responsibility of assembling a quorum and to ensure accountability of the IACUC during meeting


deliberations. Correct by ensuring that the IACUC maintains accurate records of attendance, activities of the Committee,
and all Committee deliberations.

Housing facilities, general.
In one of the turnout pens adjacent to the patio runs of the main building located at the bottom of the chain-link fence
there was a hole about 7 inches high and 17 inches wide. The facility has made attempts to correct it but the patch work is
failing, and the dogs are pulling it up to get under it. This could allow an animal to get wedged or injured by the pointy
ends of the fencing. The facility must maintain the facility in good repair to prevent the animals from injury.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with IACUC representative.
