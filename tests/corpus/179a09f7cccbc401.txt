ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The three cotton-topped tamarins (animals numbered 101023, 101001, and 108020) that died between 23 Nov
2014 and 25 Nov 2014 were being treated for suspected tularemia due to the death of another tamarin about two
years prior (of tularemia) in the same enclosure and an ongoing, persistent rodent problem in this building.
Necropsy later determined that the animals had died of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV), known to be
transmitted through contact with rodents.
The notation in the daily observation reports stated that the attending veterinarian prescribed Baytril on 20 Nov
2014 to be given orally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly twice a day. The daily treatment sheet shows that the
medications were not started until (cid:28)"11/21 pm(cid:29)." In addition, the treatment sheet shows that animal 101023 only
received 75% of the oral medication given and animal 108020 did not receive any of the oral medication given on 21
Nov. On 22 Nov, all three animals were given medication only once (treatment record shows the only entry
as(cid:28)(cid:25)"11/22 p.m."(cid:29)). Failure to start treatment when prescribed by the attending veterinarian can lead to worsening of
a medical condition.
Also on 20 Nov 2014, the attending veterinarian directed the staff to administer fluids to the animal 20-30 ml of LRS
subcutaneously twice a day as the animals would allow. Also according to the daily observation reports, only one
animal received SQ fluids during the course of the illness (animal number 101023 received 20 cc on 22 Nov 2014).
There were no notations that attempts were made to give fluids but that the animals resisted the efforts. There is a
note in the keeper log that animal 101001 had been receiving SQ fluids but this note was recorded after the animal
had passed away. This is despite a notation in the daily keeper observation log on 22 Nov 2014 that (cid:28)"all three
tamarins have gotten progressively more sluggish and unreactive(cid:29)" and later on the same day "(cid:28)As of this evening,
two of them do not look good."
**Failure to give treatment to animals as prescribed by the veterinarian can result in worsening conditions and lack
of response to treatment provided.
According to the treatment sheet and the daily observation reports, there are no notations of the animals(cid:25) weights
being recorded. Also, no notations were made in the daily observation reports about percentage of diet not
consumed on the 21, 23, 24, and 25 Nov. (Note that not all animals were alive during that entire time frame.)
**Obtaining weights and recording food consumption during times of illness is good veterinary practice that allows
for feedback on the animals(cid:25) condition and to direct treatments such as fluid therapy and nutritional support.
The licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries. Correctfrom this date forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The three cotton-topped tamarins (#101023, #101001, and #108020) died between 23 Nov 2014 and 25 Nov 2014.
Animal keeper logs indicate that the animals had a decreased appetite on 11 Nov 2014. It was noted again on 19
Nov 2014. In addition, the notation on 22 Nov 2014, states that (cid:28)"All three tamarins have had a decreased appetite
for a week now." It is unclear from the notes whether the problem started on the 11th, on the 15th (approximately
one week prior to the 22nd), or on the 19th. There are no notations in the daily animal log about the appetite of the
animals from 11 Nov through 19 Nov. The first notation of communication of this condition to the veterinarian is on
20 Nov which is 9 days after the abnormality was first documented in the animal keeper log. Two of the animals
died 23 Nov and the 3rd animal died 25 Nov. There are also no notations of communication with the veterinarian
from 21 Nov through 25 Nov during which time the animals were deteriorating and dying.
Daily observation and direct, frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the health and
care of the animals. The licensee must establish as part of the program of veterinary care, a plan of daily
observation and a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct from this
date forward.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two cotton-topped Tamarins died on 23 Nov 2015 and one died on 25 Nov 2015. Before they were sent for
necropsy, all were stored in the refrigerator that is used for food storage in the building in which they were housed.
The rationale provided was that facility did not want possible infectious agents transported to other areas of the zoo.
The facility must still provide a means for storage for deceased animals that will not risk transmission of disease to
other animals either directly or through contamination of food. The licensee must ensure that dead animals, animal
parts, and animal waste not be kept in food storage or food preparation areas, food freezers, food refrigerators, and
animal areas. To be corrected from this point forward.
This is a focused inspection report to conclude the review of the incident with the cotton-topped tamarins. The
inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.Additional Inspectors
