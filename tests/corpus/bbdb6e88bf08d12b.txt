ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-There was an approximately four year old female blue merle Pomeranian that was observed with fecal material in
her fur under her tail. On closer observation, there was an approximately 1 1/2 inch diameter region of hair loss
underneath the dog’s tail. The fur surrounding the area of hair loss was matted with hard dry looking fecal material
in it. The fecal material was next to the dog’s skin. There were also some mats of fur with fecal material in it located
further below the area of hair loss. There was a large matted ball of hair noted on the top of the dog’s back near the
base of the tail. According to the licensee, one of his helpers had told him that a dog had been identified with matted
fur under the tail a couple of days prior to the inspection and some of the matted hair and fecal material had been
removed at that time. However, the licensee had not seen the dog himself and had not been aware of the dog’s
current condition. Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure
this dog is groomed and establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs to maintain a program of adequate
veterinary care. To be corrected by: March 7, 2020
-There was a blue unlabeled container that the licensee stated contained Vick’s and had been used on a litter of
puppies. There were no directions for use from a veterinarian on how to use the product on dogs and no labeled
expiration date. Unlabeled medications and with no instructions for use in dogs increase the risk of improper use
and could harm the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a program that ensures medications are
labeled correctly, not used past their labeled expiration date and have directions for their use dogs. The licensee
corrected this non-compliant item by throwing the container in the garbage during the inspection.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee was maintaining records at the facility that were missing required information. Cage cards were
missing information such as descriptions of the animals including the breed and the genders of the puppies. The
APHIS Form 7005 was also missing a couple of the animals' official USDA identifications. Proper record keeping is
required for tracking and tracing purposes. The licensee corrected some of the missing record-keeping information
during the inspection. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly
disclose the required information at all times. To be corrected by: March 19, 20203.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-There were surfaces at the facility which appeared worn and in need of maintenance and/or replacement. Within
enclosures housing adult dogs, there were several plastic-type hard surface mats which had roughened and/or
chewed edges of varying amounts. Some of the surfaces had grooves in them where dirt could collect. The
roughened edges also appeared jagged along their edges. Also, in one enclosure housing dogs, there was flooring
in the outdoor portion of the sheltered building that had panels which had become separated from each other in
front of the access door. According to the licensee, it appeared that a zip tie had come undone that would help hold
the panels together. There was now an approximately 6 inch region where the floors had separated and one panel
of the flooring was slightly raised in comparison to the adjacent panel. There was also a self-feeder that was broken
and split along its side. These surfaces need to maintained and/or replaced to ensure their function and to enable
their required cleaning and sanitization. To be corrected by: March 19, 2020
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
-There were several self-feeders in the sheltered facility with a build-up of material on their inside surfaces where
the dogs access the food. According to the licensee, the feeders had been cleaned on Saturday. These feeders
currently had a thick build-up of brown material and grime at the mouth of the feeder. The food appeared
uncontaminated. The build-up of grime on the feeders can increase the risk of disease hazards in the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that the self-feeders are kept clean and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if
necessary. To be corrected by: March 12, 2020
