HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(c)(1)
*****At the time of inspection, the two sloths that were being exhibited in the tree directly in front of the concession
stand, were surrounded by the viewing public a member was pointing at the sloths, had the arm extended and finger
pointing just a few inches of the sloths. This poses a risk to the viewing public and the sloths on exhibit. At time of
exhibition there should be sufficient distance/barrier/readily identifiable attendant in the immediate proximity to the
sloths on exhibit to prevent this from occuring.
