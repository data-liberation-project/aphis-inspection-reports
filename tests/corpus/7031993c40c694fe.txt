2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The cougar enclosure and coatimundi enclosure do not have an adequate barrier that prevents the public from
having contact with the animals. At the time of the inspection, several guests were trying to hand feed the
coatimudi(cid:25)s through their primary enclosure which can be a safety hazard to the guests. At the cougar enclosure,
the inspectors were able to reach over the barrier and grab onto the fencing potentially having contact with the cats.
The height on these barriers needs to be increased to prevent contact with the animals for guest and animal safety.

2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The facility is set up so that guests have the ability to buy food and feed the majority of animals throughout the
park. Currently the park uses employees that are engaged in other job roles (ticket sales, cleaning, and concession
sales) to act as attendants for times of public contact with the animals. Due to the amount of animals that are fed
interactively at the park there is no way for the employees to watch the animals while conducting their other job
roles. The facility needs to have some of the employees tasked with just monitoring the animals when periods of
high public contact occur for the animal and guest safety. Correct by ensuring that a responsible, knowledgeable,
and readily identifiable attendant is present at all times during periods of public contact with animals.

3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The metal panels in the holding area for the baboons are rusted along the base and pitted and in disrepair in
some areas. This section of the holding wall can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. This section of wall
needs to be replaced to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing of the area.
*** Much of the wood perching and wood base in the non- human primate enclosures are no longer sealed andimpervious to moisture. Surfaces and furniture-type fixtures must be constructed in a manner and made of materials
that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. These enclosures
need to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of the enclosures for the health of the animals.
3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is no environmental enrichment provided for the two ring tail lemurs that are still housed in the holding area.
There are shelves in the enclosure but no items that would add cage complexity or foraging opportunities for these
animals. The physical environment in the primary enclosures must be enriched by providing means of expressing
noninjurious species-typical activities. One of the lemurs was bouncing off the enclosure sides in an agitated state.
Lemurs in captivity often are enriched through the use of (hammocks, crates with bedding and various toy like
items). These animals need to have enrichment added to their enclosure for their psychological well- being.

3.84(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The main holding area for the primates and warm animals needs to be cleaned. There was still building materials,
dirty empty enclosures and excess clutter throughout the area. Excessive clutter prevents adequate cleaning and
can lead to insect and mammalian pest problems. This area needs to be cleaned and kept in good repair to
promote good housekeeping practices for the area.
3.84(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive amount of fruit flies still in the holding areas around the lemurs. Some method of pest
control needs to be implemented to reduce the flies in the area to reduce contamination to the food and for the
health of the animals. Correct by ensuring that there is an effective method for the control of insects and other
pests to promote the health and well-being of animals at the facility.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL. *** At the time of the inspection a young Muntjac had gotten out of its enclosure and was in the Capybara enclosure.
The facility was able to retrieve the animal and get it back into its enclosure, but the Muntjac enclosure needs to be
assessed and all fencing secured to keep the animal contained in its primary enclosure. This needs to be addressed
for the safety and containment of the animal.
*** The Muntjac enclosure has large pipes coming up out of the ground right in front of the shelter area which can
be a hazard for the small deer and cause potential injury to their legs. These pipes need to be buried under the
ground for their safety and to keep the enclosure in good repair.
Correct by ensuring that this enclosure and all other enclosures are constructed of appropriate materials for the
species, structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect all animals from injury and adequately contain
them.

3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The freezer storing frozen meat products for the carnivores at the facility still needs to be addressed. The seal
along the freezer door is missing in some areas and the door is not sealing properly. Due to this issue, there is a
build-up of ice inside the freezer along all the boxes of food. This needs to be addressed to adequately protect the
food supplies against deterioration and for the health of the animals.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The adult black bears are housed in an enclosure with a concrete floor that slopes down to a drainage area. There
are several concrete rocks secured to the floor in the enclosure and a small pool that would allow one bear to sit in
and serves as a water source for both bears. The bears are approximately mid 20's in age. Both bears still have
much of their winter coat because there is nothing for them to rub against to remove the excess fur except concrete.
The female was breathing heavily while resting possibly indicating that she was hot. The female was moving
forward on her front limbs and elbows and she was very slow to stand. Her movements appeared painful when she
stood up and laid down and the facility representative stated that they believed this bear had arthritis. This
enclosure does not allow these animals adequate freedom of movement for species appropriate behaviors. Blackbears normally engage in postural behaviors of swimming, climbing and digging. These bears have no ability to
express these behaviors in this enclosure. The female is showing signs of debility consistent with being housed
exclusively on concrete (evident by her painful movement and suspected early arthritic changes). There was no
fresh hay or soft areas in her den area for resting. This enclosure needs to be addressed and maintained to provide
the opportunity for the bears to engage in species appropriate behavior.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
*** The chicken being fed to the big cats is still being given out frozen. Feeding out frozen meat items is not
palatable for the animals. The facility manager states frozen food is placed in the enclosures around 3pm but is not
consumed for several hours. So the meat is left to thaw in variable temperatures on the ground of the enclosures.
APHIS considers frozen food wholesome when it is thawed in an appropriate manner (e.g. under refrigeration) to
prevent contamination. Currently the facility has no designated area to thaw food items appropriately to reduce
contamination. This needs to be addressed so that food items are fed out in a manner that ensures them to be
palatable and free from contamination.
*** Due to the variety of species in the park, overall diets and feeding practices need to be discussed with the
attending veterinarian to assure the animals are being fed nutritionally complete diets for their age, weight and body
condition.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The Capybara shelter area needs to be cleaned. There is an excessive accumulation of feces in the shelter that
needs to be removed and there are cobwebs, dust and debris hanging from the ceiling almost to the tops of the
animal(cid:25)s heads. This shelter needs to be cleaned more frequently to reduce this accumulation and for the health
and comfort of the animals.
