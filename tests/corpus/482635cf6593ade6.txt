2.134

Contingency planning.
The licensee does not have a complete written contingency plan in place that adequately identifies emergency scenarios
and the resources, equipment, and personnel needed to cope with those scenarios. The licensee has an understanding
of the potential contingencies and responses, but it is not documented or been trained on. The licensee must develop,
document and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care
of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be
detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals in their possession). The contingency plan must include all of
the information and documentation as detailed in Section 2.134(a-c) of the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare
Regulations. Employees must be trained on the contents of the plan.
