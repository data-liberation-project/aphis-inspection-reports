SANITATION.
The facility had multiple large cobwebs hanging from the ceiling, dirt on the walls of the facility, piles of used
bedding and droppings on the floor, and several loose guinea pigs (at least 4). Facility cleanliness is important to
minimize the presence of environmental sources of disease, as well as pests which also pose a disease hazard to
the covered species. Facility must be kept clean and in good repair and primary enclosures must prevent animals
from escaping.

SANITATION.
The floor of the facility was littered with old bedding and a large amount of rodent droppings. It is unclear whether
these droppings came from escaped animals or if there is a pest problem (wild rodents) present in the facility. Pests
pose a risk to covered species by being a source of disease spread. An effective program for the control of
mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Facility cleanliness must be maintained to ensure continued
monitoring of the pest control program efficacy. Escaped animals must be captured to prevent disease spread.Correct by September 12, 2014.
