Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two recently acquired pigs were scratching and rubbing their bodies excessively along inanimate objects throughout the
pen. They both also had multiple areas of alopecia with dry skin. A neighboring group of three piglets were also rubbing
and scratching their skin in a similar fashion. The attending veterinarian (AV) was not made aware of these issues. Failure
to notify the AV in a timely manner could lead to injury and/or death of an animal. A mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being
is conveyed to the AV.

required information, including any offspring born of any animal while in the possession of the exhibitor.

Primary enclosures.
There were 4 rabbits in suspended metal cages with excessive rust - especially along the bottom of the cage. One of the
white rabbits’ hair was stained from the rust along the underside of its trunk and lower extremities. Enclosures that are not
maintained in good repair can impact the welfare of the animals contained therein. Primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so as to enable the rabbits to remain dry and clean.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The Non-Human Primate (NHP) Environmental Enhancement plan does not address the special considerations for the
individually housed Black and White Ruffed female lemur that is unable to see and hear NHP’s of her own or compatible
species. Individually housed NHP’s require special attention, and without it, they could start to experience psychological
distress. The special considerations for individually housed NHP’s need to be documented with the rest of the
Environmental Enhancement Plan.

There were several areas throughout the facility with sharp points or edges, including: Pieces of the outside camel wire
fence enclosure – the portion that connects to the barn – had areas with pieces of wire projecting outwards away from the
rest of the fence, along with exposed nails along the barn doorway; There were similar findings along the wire fence
enclosure housing the partially-blind goat; on the right backside of the barn wall, within the outside enclosure housing the
llamas, fallow deer, etc., there was a metal panel that was broken away from the wall, measuring approximately 5 x 4
inches; In the outside portion of pen #10, there was a large hole in the lower portion of the back metal fence, with pieces
of the wire sticking outwards; and lastly, in the enclosure housing the lemur, there were exposed nails along the top
inside border of the outdoors portion of the enclosure. There was a large hole in one of the fences bordering the outdoors
portion of the sheep and goat enclosure.

Facilities that are not maintained in good repair can lead to escape, injury and/or death of an animal. The indoor and
outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
to contain the animals therein.
