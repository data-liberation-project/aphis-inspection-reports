3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The new lemur enclosure housing two lemurs is constructed of untreated wood. Untreated wood is not impervious
to water and thus cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized to prevent odors and disease spread. The surfaces
of the lemur enclosure in contact with the animals must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 6/23/14.
3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The new lemur enclosure housing two lemurs has a large viewing opening at the front. This opening is covered with
two overlaying layers of wire mesh fencing with openings about 2.5inx1.5in. The lemurs were noted being able to
extend their head through the openings of the two layers. The lemurs may injure themselves or trap themselves in
this current wire fencing setup as the openings are too large for their size. The lemur primary enclosure must be
designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound for the lemurs. Correct by
6/23/14.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility has placed some welded wire fencing on the ground extending from the enclosure fencing about 2 ft into
the enclosure to keep the cavy from digging out of its enclosure. The wire fencing is exposed and contains some
sharp points and raised overlapped areas. The cavy may injure itself on this fencing as it is exposed. If the welded
wire fencing is used as skirting material on the inside of the enclosure it should be covered with dirt or other material
such that the cavy cannot injure itself on fencing material. Correct by 6/23/14.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
