2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I arrived at the facility at 1:00 pm. I called all of the contact numbers available but only one contact number
allowed me to leave a message. I knocked on the door at about 1:20 pm and no one answered. I called the contact
number again with the voicemail and left a message that I was on the premises and would like to conduct an
inspection if anyone was available. I explained the importance of this inspection and that it was the third attempted
inspection. At about 1:50 a family member pulled up and explained that she and the mother were unable to conduct
an inspection at that time. I explained to the family member the importance of conducting the inspection and that
since they were unable to do so that this would be considered an attempted inspection. I let her know that she
would be receiving a report in the mail and gave her my business card if she had any further questions. I left the
facility at 2:00 pm. A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection
process at 1:00 pm on 09/15/2014. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials
during the inspection process.
