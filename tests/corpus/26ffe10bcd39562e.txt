2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Maltese (DOB 08/02/2019, #0A01310862) was observed to be excessively licking the right side of her
mouth. Closer observation of the dog revealed that at least one cheek tooth on the bottom right side of the mouth is
loose and easily moved when the inspector touched it. The entire surface of the cheek teeth and half the surface of
the canine teeth are covered in a gray/tan material. Loose teeth and poor dental health can cause pain and
discomfort to the dog and lead to further health issues.
The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
