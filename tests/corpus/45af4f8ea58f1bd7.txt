2.1(a)(1) Critical

Requirements and application.
This facility is a breeder of dogs. The facility representative acknowledged sales of animals to pet stores, a regulated
activity for which a license is required under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). The representative further acknowledged that
they had received a copy of the AWA regulations and application packet for licensing, but he has not yet applied. These
materials were delivered to the representative on 26 May 2021 by another USDA Veterinary Medical Officer.

The kennel area was unable to be viewed because the representative cited a personal matter for being unable to be
available for this inspection.

Being licensed is necessary for USDA Animal Care to assure compliance with the AWA and the humane care of animals
covered by these regulations.

The facility must apply for and become licensed before any future regulated activity.

Correct by: The application for license must be submitted to Animal Care by 24 September 2021.



NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
