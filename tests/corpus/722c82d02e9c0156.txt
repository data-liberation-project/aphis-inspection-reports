3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The flooring for the two ringtail lemurs is AstroTurf. Food, hair, and fecal waste has ground into the material and it
is in need of replacement. The surfaces of housing facilities--including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses,
dens, and other furniture-type fixtures or objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of
materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. The
licensee has already acquired the new material to replace the old pieces.
