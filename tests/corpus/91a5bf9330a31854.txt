2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
- At the time of inspection the animal inventory was not up to date (inventory on hand was dated December 30,
2014) and the licensee was not able to provide an accurate animal inventory. There were no Jacob sheep present
on the inventory list and four Jacob sheep were present in the park. Complete and accurate records are necessary
to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace those animals. The
licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all animals at all times and must ensure those records are
available to the inspector upon request.
3.80(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- The lemurs are currently being housed inside a temporary cage, contained inside a building in the walk through
area of the park. A door had been created in this cage by cutting a square section out of the bars, then wiring a
small metal door in place of the opening. This had left numerous sharp points above and below this door where the
cage bars were cut. This is a risk of injury to the enclosed primates. These sharp points must be removed or
repaired. All enclosures must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
3.80(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- The lemurs are currently being kept indoors in a temporary cage inside a building in the walk through area of the
park. The cage is close to the adjoining walls, and on these walls are least four exposed electrical outlets which are
within easy reach of the enclosed primates. There is also a powered electrical cord on the floor just in front of the
cage, also within easy reach of the animals. This is a clear risk of danger to the animals. The cord must be
relocated out of reach, and all outlets must be covered so that they no longer pose a risk of injury to the primates.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- The lemurs are currently being kept indoors in a temporary cage inside a building in the walk through area of the
park. There were no enrichment items present in the enclosure. There were also no perches or raised resting
areas. The facility employee stated that enrichment currently consisted of food items. All nonhuman primates
require adequate environmental enrichment. This can consist of a variety of items and interactions. An adequate
written enrichment plan developed with approval of the attending veterinarian must be used for these animals.

FEEDING.
None of the food receptacles for the nonhuman primates had been sanitized for at least 8 weeks. Food receptacles
for nonhuman primates must be cleaned and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks to minimize build up
of bacteria and other potential infectious organisms which pose a risk to the heath of the animals.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Four Jacob sheep being kept in an outdoor enclosure in the walk-through area of the park had access to multiple
areas of unsafe fencing and housing with numerous exposed sharp points. There is also a piece of broken rebar
extending from the ground in front of the shelter. There is a non-powered electrical cord partially buried in the dirt in
front of the shelter. The sharp points consist of exposed nails, rebar, and wire. These areas of fencing are a
potential source of injury to the enclosed animals. This fencing must be removed or repaired. All enclosures must
be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
- The watering container in the Jacob sheep enclosure at the time of the inspection had moderate amount of
greenish colored debris concentrated on the sides and bottom of the container. This is an indication that this
container is not being cleaned frequently enough. Water receptacles must be clean and contain potable water for
the health and well-being of the enclosed animals. More frequent cleaning and sanitizing is needed.
