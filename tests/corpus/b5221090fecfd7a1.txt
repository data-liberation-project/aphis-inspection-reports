2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is no written program of veterinary care available for review. Discussion with the licensee indicates that since
the passing of the previous attending veterinarian there has been no formal arrangement made with a local
Veterinarian. Formal arrangement shall be made with a local Veterinarian and a written plan developed covering
the animals at the facility.
3.50(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength
There is a ramp placed at an incline leading into the rabbit housing. One of the three rabbits is hesitant to use the
ramp to go down into the larger part of the hutch containing the food and water. We observed him several times
attempt to go down the ramp, but would not proceed. The ramp is slick, and very chewed and needs to be repaired
or replaced to make it safe for all the rabbits to have safe access for going up, or down, the ramp. Facilities for
rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury.
3.50(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Storage.
The rabbit food is stored in a barn with other livestock food supplies. These barrels contain no lids. There are
rodent droppings around the food storage area, along with spider webs, an old Christmas tree, dusty saddles and
riding equipment hanging directly over the open barrels. A thick layer of dust covered all the supplies in the room.
This condition creates an enviroment for contamination and health hazards for the rabbits. The area needs to be
thoroughly cleaned in order to protect the well being of the rabbits.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength
Throughout the entire facility, there is chewed wood, broken wire with sharp points on the fencing,and broken wood
fencing. In the barn area containing a mother llama and her 3 week old baby there is broken concrete leaving deep
holes, areas of piled up wood, equipment, and other discarded materials. This creates multiple areas of disrepair
around the entire facility. All of these areas need to be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
(a) Cleaning of enclosures.
Within the barn where the llama is housed, there is a large build up of mud and feces in both the stalls and the open
area in the middle of the barn. This is a health hazard, attracts pests, and odors. Excreta needs to be removed as
often as necessary to prevent and minimize disease and control odors and pests.
To be corrected by April 26th, 2015.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
(c) Housekeeping
There are severral piles of old construction material (wood with nails exposed, tin with jagged edges, old fence wire,
etc.) throughout the hoof stock enclosures. There are also several old vehicles in the hoof stock enclosures. Old
vehicles may contain automotive liquids that could cause sickness if ingested. The hoof stock have access to the
vehicles as well as the piles of supplies which may allow them to become entangled or injured. The hoof stock shall
be prevented from accessing these materials or the piles of materials, and vehicles shall be removed to protect the
hoof stock from illness or injury.
To be Correct by June 26, 2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
(d) Pest control.Within the barn is the room where the food for all the animals is stored. Rodent droppings were seen, as well as a
large amount of spider webs. This condition can result in contamination of the food supply for the animals. A safe
and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established
and maintained.
