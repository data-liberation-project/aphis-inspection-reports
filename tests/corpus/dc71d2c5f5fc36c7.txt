ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* "Cissy" (# 012-288-296) a female Poodle appeared to have a slight head tilt and unbalanced. She was seen to be
shaking her head vigorously numerous times. Upon exam, the right ear had a thick accumulation of black, sticky
material in the ear canal. The teeth are completely covered in a thick green-brown color hard material. The gums
were a very dark pink-red color. This dog needs to be evaluated/diagnosed by a veterinarian and an appropriate
treatment plan followed. Licensee must ensure that the dog is evaluated and a written diagnosis and treatment plan
must be available for review upon request of the inspector.

* "Beckley" (# 012-315-098) a black and white Poodle that is densely matted on the top of the feet, legs and a large
matted ball of hair by the right eye that occludes the dogs ability to see.
* # 031-113-634 a white Maltese has densely matted hair all over the legs and dangling over the face.
* A non -identified red/chocolate Poodle has thick, densely matted hair to the skin on the back, neck and balled up
matted hair under the ears.
* A non- identified white female Maltese in the Whelping Building has areas of hair missing along the back and sides
and thick, densely matted to the skin clumps of hair on the face, body and legs.
Matted hair does not: provide insulation against the elements, allow air circulation to the skin, can trap moisture and
debris causing skin irritation, pull on the skin causing pain and limit natural movement and eyesight. Licensee must
remove the matted hair, establish and maintain a grooming practice that ensures the dogs do not have matted hair
for the health and well being of the dog.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.

3.2(b) REPEAT
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* A strong ammonia odor was present in the Whelp Building (housing fourteen dogs and nine puppies). This odor
permeated throughout the building, irritating the inspectors nose and causing them to catch their breath. This odor
can irritate the respiratory tracts of the puppies and dogs. Licensee must provide sufficient ventilation to provide for
the animals health and well-being, to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation.
3.8(a)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
* A non- identified female Maltese in the Whelp building was in an enclosure that measures 29" x 29" by herself.
This enclosure provides 5.8 square feet. She measured 16 inches long requiring 3.3 square feet but when housed
singly, she requires double that for exercise (6.6 sq. feet). This enclosure is not large enough to both house and
provide space for exercise for this dog. Licensee must move the dog to an appropriate sized enclosure that provides
the required living and exercise space for this dog.
