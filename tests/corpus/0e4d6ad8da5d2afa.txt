Housing facilities, general.
On 02/03/22 the following non-compliance was noted by USDA Inspectors.
In the Thunder dome building housing four spider monkeys, the primary enclosure had severe rust along the frame of the
enclosure that was pitted and flaking. In this enclosure primarily the corners of the frame were severely rusted and the
rust is pitted and flaking.

In the Funky Monkey Town (FMT) building there are two enclosure Funky Monkey Town 1 and 2. Funky Monkey Town 1,
containing two spider monkeys, has several areas throughout the frame and chain-link fencing where rust is pitted and
flaking. The second primate enclosure (Funky Monkey Town 2), containing two spider monkeys, has several areas
throughout the enclosure where the metal frame in these areas is rusted and the rust is pitted and flaking.

Excessive rust can affect the structural strength of surfaces and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of
enclosures. Any surface that comes in contact with the nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents
the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.


When speaking with facility representative they stated the facility has a plan to replace the rusted caging in the near future
but has not yet completed the project.

Correct by ensuring that these areas are repaired or replaced and that all surfaces that come in contact with the individual
animals including primary enclosures, perches, shelves, swings, etc. are constructed and maintained in a manner that
allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized and are removed or replaced as needed.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
This inspection spanned over the course of two days, 02/03/22 and 02/04/22.

On 02/03/22 the following non-compliance was found in the Thunderdome indoor enclosure. The indoor primary
enclosure houses four spider monkeys. The monkeys have free access to the outside. Multiple piles of dried, caked on
feces were found inside and outside the enclosure. There was also pooling of a dark yellow liquid, consistent with urine
along the inside wall of the building. The room had a strong odor, and the spider monkeys were seen in the enclosure.
The enclosure is not cleaned daily, and collection of fecal material and urine were seen. On 02/04/22 newspapers were
seen on top of the pool of urine but were not removed. The same dried fecal piles were also seen.

On 02/03/22 the following non-compliance was found in the Funky Monkey Town indoor enclosure. Multiple piles of dried
fecal material were seen on blankets and on the perches. On 02/04/22 the same piles were seen with a strong odor upon
walking into the enclosure.

Indoor enclosures must be cleaned daily to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta, to reduce
disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Facility Representative.
