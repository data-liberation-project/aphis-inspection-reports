ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00 pm on
September 2, 2014. The cougar is no longer at the facility and the door to the residence is boarded. The licensee
has moved to USDA licensed facility in South Carolina and has not yet notified the USDA eastern regional office in
writing. On September 4, 2014, I spoke to the licensee by phone and she stated her cougar was being housed but
not exhibited at a licensed facility in South Carolina. I told the licensee that she needed to contact the eastern
regional office in writing within 10 days of her new address and change of business.
