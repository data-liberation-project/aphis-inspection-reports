ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One black and white lop eared rabbit has an eye problem that has not yet been appropriately diagnosed by a
veterinarian. The right eye has visible irregular areas of red within/ throughout the eye and a light bluish cast to the
upper portion of the back of the eye. The owner states that the eye problem started this summer and hasn't gotten
worse or seemed to bother the rabbit.
A veterinarian needs to see the rabbit to ensure that appropriate methods are used to diagnose and treat the eye
problem.
