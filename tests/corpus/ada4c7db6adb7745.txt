ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:40 pm on
02/11/2015.
I was first at your facility at 11:37 am. I went to both the kennel premiese and the owners residence each time. No
one was available each time. In addition to waiting 30 minutes both times, I contacted the phone number provided
an left a message.
This attempted report will be sent both regular and certified mail.
