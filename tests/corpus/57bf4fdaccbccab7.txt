3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure.
***In the sheltered housing there was a hole in the wire divider panel in between two enclosures, affecting 7 dogs.
The hole in this divider panel was approximately 5 inches long by 3 inches in height, about 3 inches off the floor.
Dogs from the adjacent enclosures were observed sticking their heads through this hole into the adjoining
enclosure. There was also hair along some of the edges of the hole.
Throughout the facility there were at least 5 enclosures affecting approximately 13 puppies and 5 adults that had
carpet on the flooring with frayed edges and piles of loose carpet fibers throughout the enclosures.
The hole in the divider panel could entrap the dogs or cause injury. The frayed carpet edges and/or loose carpet
fibers could increase the risk of an animal getting entagled, increase the risk of ingestion of a foreign body and/or
other injury. The licensee must repair or replace the divider panel and carpet flooring, and ensure that all enclosures
are kept in good repair and must protect the dogs from injury at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative, Erika Leisner VMO, and Chad Proctor
ACI.
