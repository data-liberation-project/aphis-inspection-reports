2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility does not have updated acquisition or disposition records for several animals. They are missing the acquisition
dates for the following:
**1 domestic calf born approximately 2 weeks ago
**3 domestic goats born approximately a week ago
**2 sheep born approximately a week ago
**2 adult domestic sheep
**1 striped skunk
The facility is also missing the disposition dates for the deaths of one striped skunk (different than the above mentioned
skunk) and one female goat. The facility representative states they did not have time to update these records, but a
Patagonia cavy, born on 20-October-2022, was updated. Updated acquisition and disposition records are necessary for
APHIS officials to identify animals present at the facility and to trace their movement.
Each exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information
concerning animals, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under
his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor. The records shall

include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.
To be corrected by: 7-November-2022.
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
The facility did not have adequate staffing to supervise public contact with the animals. The facility has animals across
approximately two acres, with several buildings. On the day of inspection, there were two employees working.

One employee is responsible for taking admissions in one building while simultaneously watching a second unattached
building. The unattached building contains the warm room animals with an open garage door for the public to enter at will.
Some animals in the warm room are behind a public barrier to prevent public contact, but the public can still reach a
young goat, a pot-bellied pig, two Patagonia cavies and two capybaras.

The second employee is responsible for watching one section of animals (two domestic pigs, two mini yaks, two mini zebu
and three llamas) which are located behind a separate building. A second section of animals (19 goats, eight sheep, a
nilgai, a mini zebu, a camel, and two highland cattle) located across from the admission building between two barns. An
indoor barn area connected to the second section, and a third area behind this barn where four domestic cattle are
present. All these areas don’t have a barrier large enough to prevent public contact. Additionally, the facility allows public
feeding of above-mentioned animals except the pot-bellied pig, Patagonia cavies and capybaras which are listed with “no
feeding” signs.

The facility representative stated they usually have three employees working, but one is off today. The inspector observed
at least one occasion of lack of supervision where two adult patrons entered the barn that connects to the

goat/sheep/nilgai enclosure.

During periods of public interaction, a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee must be present at
all times to ensure the public’s safety as well as the well-being of the animals. The facility must have enough employees
to supervise all public contact with animals at all times.

To be corrected by: From this day forward.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Two enclosures have sharp points present. The outdoor shelter for 4 domestic cattle is a metal sided building. The metal
siding has become damaged in two spots leaving large sharp edges at the height of the cattle. These are the same two
spots identified in the last routine inspection. An outdoor enclosure for one African crested porcupine had at least 2 pieces
of thick gauge metal wire several inches long projecting into the enclosure at a 90 degree angle from the wall. The facility
representative states they covered the points with dirt, but the porcupine must have dug them back up. The sharp edges
may cause injury to the animals housed in the above-mentioned enclosures.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. The metal siding and projecting wire points must be repaired so sharp edges and points are not present.
3.127(c) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
There are two enclosures with drainage issues. The outdoor enclosure that contains 4 domestic cattle has a large
accumulation of mud around the grain feeding receptacle. The cattle must walk through mud to get to their grain. This
enclosure’s drainage issue has not been fixed from the last routine inspection. The outdoor enclosure that contains 2 mini

yaks has a leaking automatic waterer; the water is not being rapidly eliminated. This is causing a muddy area with
standing pools of water around their waterer and the mini yaks must walk through the mud to get to their water. The
facility representative stated they haven’t had time to fix the waterer.
Poor drainage with areas of mud leads to animals being forced to walk and stand in wet conditions while eating or
drinking and may cause health problems. Cattle are more likely to have foot problems if kept in a wet environment for an
extended period of time. The outdoor enclosures must have adequate drainage so water may be rapidly eliminated and
provide the cattle have a dry place to eat.
3.130 Repeat

Watering.
The water receptacles for 3 mini zebu and 2 Scottish highland cattle were not clean and sanitary. The water receptacle
for the 3 mini zebu has a dark brown layer of organic material on the sides and bottom of the bucket. Several leaves,
sticks and food were also present in this water bucket. The water in the automatic waterer for the 2 Scottish Highland
cattle was a dark brown color and the inspector could not see the sides or bottom of the waterer. These are the only water
sources for the above-mentioned animals. The facility representative states that the receptacles were last cleaned the
previous Saturday, 6 days ago, and get cleaned on Saturdays. Buildup of organic material in water and discolored water
does not provide the animals potable water and may lead to health problems like dehydration or disease.
Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. All water receptacles
shall be kept clean and sanitary. The facility must provide potable water and ensure the water receptacle is kept clean
and sanitary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
