ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1150 on
14-MAR-19.
I arrived at the facility at 11:50am. The house appeared empty. No one answered when I knocked on the door. I
called and left a message at the number I had on file. 10 minutes later, a business colleague called back to let me
know that the licensee's business had been repossessed and that no one could locate the licensee.
