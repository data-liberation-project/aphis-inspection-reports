2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
An incident involving a vole who underwent surgery was reported during the month of November 2016 and was
found dead in his cage.The cage had a "special care" sign and it appears that due to miscommunication between
the investigator and facility personnel the animal was not properly fed.
Corrective actions included retraining personnel and implementing a log when the animals are fed by the
investigator.
An incident involving a NHP on July 2017 in which a technician took the animal to necropsy for euthanasia when the
animal identification code was mistakenly entered to the necropsy schedule.
Corrective actions to prevent incorrect animal codes to enter the necropsy schedule had been implemented by
double checking (necropsy supervisor and technician) and lab confirmation that the animlas entering the necropsy
schedule are correct.
An adverse event was reported on August 2017 in which a NHP underwent a planned donor nephrectomy and 7
days later had to be referred for surgery again to remove a gauze sponge from the abdomen.
Corrective actions were implemented by halting surgeries until radio frequency implanted gauze sponges have been
procured to be used in future surgeries to avoid human error counting the gauze sponges.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and facility personnel.
