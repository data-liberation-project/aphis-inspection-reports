2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee's state that they walk through the kennel and observe the animals daily. During the inspection
process several animals were noted to have husbandry concerns. A Boston had pressure sores on her hindquarters
that were healing but there was no mats or way for her to get off the wire to assist with healing. A Yorki that had
recently been groomed had feces stuck to the anal region that needed to be removed. Another Yorki had matted fur
around the eyes that needs to be removed. Several dogs with short fur had long nails that need to be trimmed. One
female Maltese was very thin and housed with a fat female Pug. It is highly possible the Pug is not allowing the
Maltese to have access to the food. (the Maltese was moved to another enclosure at this time and given food)
Based on the inspectors observations it seems evident that although the licensee's are walking through the kennel
they are missing some of these husbandry concerns. The method of daily observation needs to be addressed so
the animals with these types of issues are being identified and then the issues addressed in a timely manner. This
needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The licensee states that he does not spot clean the enclosures daily. Several enclosures had feces that were not
falling through the wire mesh floor. When feces are not falling through the wire mesh then the enclosures need to be
spot cleaned and feces removed daily to prevent the animals from becoming soiled. This needs to be addressed for
the health of the animals.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
