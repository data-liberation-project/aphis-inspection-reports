2.131(b)(2) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On January 19, 2019, a volunteer at the facility was bitten by an adult male orangutan. The volunteer was hand
feeding an orangutan pair when the male orangutan pulled her arm into the enclosure resulting in the bite.
Additional staff responded immediately and were able to assist the volunteer in removing her arm from the
enclosure without injury to the orangutan. The zoo completed a full investigation of the incident and determined that
human error, specifically a momentary lack of situational awareness and personal safety, lead to the incident.
Handling of animals (including feeding) must be done as carefully as possible and in a manner that does not cause
trauma or physical harm. Following the zoo’s investigation, they have implemented methods to prevent similar
situations in the future.
This inspection was conducted from 2/5/2019 to 2/7/2019 with several staff members.
This exit interview was conducted on 2/8/2019 with the Curator of Mammals and other staff members.
