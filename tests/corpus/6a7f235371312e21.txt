2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A brown and white adult guinea pig in Pen 22 had areas of hair loss
with reddish skin over the rump area. The animal was in good body condition and did not appear lethargic. The licensee
had not observed the condition, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was not administering any treatments.
Abnormal skin conditions can cause distress or worsen if not addressed.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to evaluate the animal and determine an appropriate plan of
diagnosis and treatment.
