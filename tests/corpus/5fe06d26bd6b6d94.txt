FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of inspection, a secondary shelter for the white tailed deer was missing several wooden panels from its
roof. The shelter did not protect the animals from the outdoor elements and the roof is in need of repair or
replacement. All outdoor and indoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 10, 2016.
