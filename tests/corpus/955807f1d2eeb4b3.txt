2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS 7005 form is not being properly completed. The form lists 43 dogs on hand, but the actual count of
animals on hand was 26. Disposition dates are not being noted, and multiple animals had no identification number
in the record. The 7005 form is necessary to track and monitor the population of animals in the facility. The
licensee must update this form to accurately reflect the dogs on hand, address all required form fields, and must
properly track and record animals that enter and leave the facility.
