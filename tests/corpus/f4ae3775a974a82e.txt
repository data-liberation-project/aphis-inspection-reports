2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocols for surgical procedures did not contain
descriptions for procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that which
unavoidable for the conduct of animal activities; including provision for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and
tranquilizing drugs. While a separate protocol listed pre-operative and post-operative medications, there was no
description of how or when medications should be used in the medication protocol, nor in the surgical protocols.
Inadequate descriptions of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that
which is unavoidable for the conduct of the animal activities may prevent the IACUC from identifying deficiencies
and ensuring that animal activities are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. It is the responsibility of the
IACUC to ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of proposed procedures designed to assure
that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited in order that those activities may be adequately reviewed and
determined to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.
