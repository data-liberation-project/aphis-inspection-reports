PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
The facility had over 50 'skinny pig' guinea pigs for sale at the Expo. The guinea pigs were being transported in
multiple plastic shoebox type containers most of which were 13inx20inx4in high. These containers were not
manufactured for animal transport or housing. Someone had drilled a round hole about 1 cm in diameter
approximately every 3 inches in one row just under the lid on each of the four sides of the enclosure. The lids had
no holes. The number of ventilation openings were not sufficient to provide needed ventilation for the animals. This
was evidenced by condensation forming on the inside walls of a couple of the containers. When these wet
containers were opened, a rush of warm wet air was released. Lack of adequate ventilation can lead to
condensation and heat buildup and over time lead to air quality issues that may affect the health and life of the
animals. The facility shall ensure that an adequate amount of ventilation openings are present (at least 8% of the
total surface area of each wall if all four walls are ventilated) and that there are ventilation openings on both the
upper and lower half of the enclosure. Correct from this day forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
The facility had over 50 'skinny pig' guinea pigs (adult and young) for sale at the Expo. The guinea pigs were being
transported in multiple plastic shoebox type containers most of which were 13inx20inx4in high. These containers
were not manufactured for animal transport or housing. Taking into account about half an inch of shavings in the
enclosures this leaves only about 3 1/2 inches of height for the guinea pigs. This does not provide enough height for
the guinea pigs to stand up and make normal postural adjustments. The interior height of enclosures used to
transport guinea pigs shall provide at least 6 inches for guinea pigs weighing up to 500 gm and 7 inches for guinea
pigs over 500 gm. Correct from this day forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
The facility had over 50 'skinny pig' guinea pigs for sale at the Expo. One enclosure with condensation/ventilation
issues measured 13inx20inx4in and housed five adult and 1 young guinea pig. The enclosure provided 260 sqinches of floor space (13x20). The five guinea pigs required 305 sq inches of floor space (55x5 + 30). The
overcrowding of the enclosure contributed to the ventilation issues. In addition, lack of floor space can lead to
animals not being able to make adequate postural adjustments and increased stress to the animals. Each live
guinea pig transported shall be provided with the minimum required floor space. Correct from this day forward.
