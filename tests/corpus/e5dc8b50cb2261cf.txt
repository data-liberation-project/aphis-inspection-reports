3.14(c)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Upon inspection, the carrier had not obtained certification statements with the required information for the dogs and cats
transported. Receipt of feeding and watering instructions for each animal received is imperative, as well as confirmation
that food and potable water were offered within four hours prior to transport. Doing so addresses the animals’ needs
during transit, as well as aids in their comfort and wellbeing.
Carries and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport unless the consignor certifies in writing to the
carrier or intermediate handler that the dog or cat was offered food and water within four hours preceeding delivery to the
carrier or intermediate handler. Instructions provided must be in compliance with 3.17 and provide the required
information for each dog and cat.

3.18(a) Critical

Care in transit.
On June 5, 2021, two puppies passed away while in transport. During a route heading north from Louisiana to Rhode
Island, two of the puppies began to decline. Once identified, the puppies were provided with additional supportive care by


the operators of the carrier, while traveling to the final stop. The carrier stated their plan was to get the animals out of
transit as soon as possible, in hopes the puppies would recover better when they were no longer in transit. Although the
carrier attempted to provide extra care and comfort, veterinary care was not obtained when signs of distress were first
observed.

Failure to appropriately seek veterinary care can lead to a decline in health, pain, or exacerbation of other problems for
the affected animals. The regulated person must ensure that the operator or person accompanying the operator
determines whether any of the dogs or cats are in obvious physical distress, and obtains any veterinary care needed for
the dogs or cats at the closest available veterinary facility.
