2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***The primary enclosure for the wolves, llama's, nilgai, muntjac, wallaby, pig's, fallow deer, axis deer, goat's and
cow do not have a barrier fence. These areas are not constantly monitored by a zoo employee, the public can easily
get to the enclosure fence and put their hands or other objects through the enclosure.
All enclosures must have a barrier fence that is at least 3 feet from the enclosure on all sides to protect the animals
and the public from injury.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The patas monkeys have a tree stump in their enclosure that is covered in green growth indicating that this
surface is not readily sanitizable or can not be readily sanitized. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates
come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent disease hazards. Correct by September 18,
2014.
***The straw bedding in the lemurs dens had insects and bugs crawling throughout it. Contaminated material must
be removed or replaced whenever raking or spot cleaning does not eliminate diseases, insects, pests, or vermin
infestation. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy
generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. Correct by September 18, 2014.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the pig's and llama's primary enclosure the shelter located in the back was in disrepair. It is leaning and is not
structurally sound. The shelter must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury. Correct by September 18, 2014
***During the inspection there was a pig that walked around the facility. The pig was able to walk under the barrierfencing allowing him to walk up to the nonhuman primates enclosures. This pig should be properly contained for its
safety and the safety of the nonhuman primates. This animal shall be contained to prevent transmission of disease,
minimize public contact and prevent injury. Correct by September 18, 2014.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** Along the perimeter fencing adjacent to the diet facility there was a space approximately a foot from the ground
to the bottom of the fencing. There was an overgrowth of foliage and the fencing was rusted and broken at the
bottom of the fencing. These areas of deficiency are extensive and the entire perimeter fence should be checked.
This space at the bottom of the fencing could allow predators or unwanted animals access to the premises. All
outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. The fence must be at least 8 ft in height. The fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. Correct by September 25, 2014.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the Conservation Program Coordinator.
