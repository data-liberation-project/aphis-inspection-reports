2.31(c)(1) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility failed to conduct a review of the humane care and use program when the corresponding inspection of
the animal facilities was conducted on 3 September 2014. The facility also could not demonstrate that the review of
the humane care and use program was completed in March 2015 in accordance with the once every six month
requirement. This failure does not allow oversight of animal use and the humane care and use program by the
IACUC. Without this oversight lapses may occur that could affect adequate husbandry of the animals and their
health and wellbeing. Conduct reviews of the humane care and use program at least once every 6 months and
include the results of these reviews in the reports sent to the Institutional Official.
2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility could not demonstrate that a report reflecting the review of the humane care and use program and
inspection of the animal facilities, to have been completed around March 2015, was submitted to the Institutional
Official. In addition, the report to the Institutional Official submitted on 3 September 2014 included only information
regarding the animal facilities' inspection. Failure to submit reports to the Institutional Official does not allow for a
method to keep the Institutional Official informed on the nature and extent of the research facility's adherence to the
regulations and standards. Have the IACUC prepare and submit reports following the required once every month
review of the humane care and use program and inspection of the animal facilities as required. Correct
immediately.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the Director, Office of Grants and Research and the Institutional Official.
End of report.
