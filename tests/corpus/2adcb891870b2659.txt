ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Female Yorkie #40 was in a fight with another dog on 4/23/14. The dog sustained an eye injury and was
examined by the attending veternarian on 5/13/14. The treatment recommendations included enucleation or
humane euthanasia if treatment was not successful. Today, the dog's left eye is opaque and has a greenish
discharge. The dog is not squinting and the eye does not appear to be painful. Although this dog has been
previously examined and treated by the attending veterinarian the eye has not progressed to be free of signs of
infection as is seen by the discharge. This dog must be re-examined to determine if this ongoing problem can be
improved and to document an expected prognosis or end point for treatment, or a management plan if the condition
is expected to become chronic. The licensee must document and maintain record of this examination and treatment
for future inspection by APHIS officials. Failure to ensure ongoing treatment for dogs with chronic medical
conditions can lead to pain and suffering in the affected animals.

MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
***Puppies from one litter of Boston Terrier puppies documented to have been born on 5/12/14 on litter records (pup
ID #14-31, 14-32, 14-33, and 14-36) were sold on 7/2/14 at the age of 51 days according to APHIS Form 7006
records. Another litter of Bichon/Cavalier cross puppies (IDs #14-04 through 14-09) born on 1/10/14 (according to
litter records) were sold on 2/25/14 with documentation on APHIS Form 7006 which did not match the birth records.
These pups were sold at 46 days of age. No dog shall be offered for transport before 56 days (8 weeks) of age.
Removing animals before this age can cause additional stress, social anxieties, and lead to disease problems since
immune systems have not fully developed before this time. The licensee must ensure that birth dates are
cross-checked properly before offering pups for sale or transport to prevent animals from leaving the premises
before they reach the required minimum age.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The outdoor washdowns on both sides of the main kennel have an excessive accumulation of feces and
staining. The licensee stated that they are cleaning these washdowns twice weekly. These washdowns must be
cleaned and maintained on a more frequent basis to reduce disease hazards, minimize odors, and satisfy accepted
cleanliness standards. Additionally, the outdoor exercise area has an accumlation of feces throughout the area that
must be removed on a regular basis. The licensee stated that they do not clean this area very often. Correct this
by cleaning and maintaining these areas on a regular basis.
