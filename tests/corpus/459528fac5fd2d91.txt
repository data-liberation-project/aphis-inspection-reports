2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are no records being maintained to document the number of rabbits held for breeding or currently on the premises.
Not all enclosures contain cage cards and the information on several of the cards that are present is incomplete. Several
of the cards do not accurately state the number of unweaned bunnies in the enclosure. The dealer shall make, keep and
maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information concerning the animals acquisition, offspring
born and their disposition.
3.53(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
There are several enclosures that have rusty corroded and broken wire on the sides and flooring. The structural strength
of these enclosures are compromised leaving broken wires, holes and sharp points that may allow the rabbits to become
injured or possibly escape. The enclosures must be repaired or replaced to protect the rabbits from injury and to
maintain them securely within.
3.54(b) Repeat

Feeding.
There are several metal feeders containing food that are attached to the enclosures. The feeders are rusted and
corroded leaving sharp and jagged edges which may cause injury. The rust and corrosion inhibit proper cleaning and


sanitation which may allow the food to become contaminated. The feeders shall be repaired or replaced to protect the
food from contamination and prevent injury.
3.56(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
The vinyl mats provided in the primary enclosures have a build up of excreta. The excreta has accumulated in the holes
of the mats, the edges and the bottom surfaces between the mat and the wire cage floor. The current method of cleaning
the mats is inadequate. Improper cleaning and sanitation increases the risk of bacterial growth and other disease hazard
which may cause illness. The enclosures and items in the enclosure shall be properly cleaned and sanitized to prevent
accumulations and reduce disease hazard.
3.56(d)

Sanitation.
In the last section of the rabbit barn there are swarms of flies around the suspended rabbit cages. Swarming flies
increase the risk of disease hazard and can cause discomfort. An effective program for the control of insects shall be
established and maintained to protect the rabbits health and well being.
