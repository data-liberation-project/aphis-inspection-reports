ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One llama, white with brown markings, is in need of foot care/trimming on all four feet. The hooves are overly long
and are curling and rotating due to their excessive length. While standing still it appears the llama's foot/ankle joint
is positioned/held in an abnormal, dropped position due to the excess length of the hooves. The llama was
observed walking around a large area without any obvious limp. The licensee stated she did not know when the
farrier would be available to trim the hooves. Excessively long hooves can lead to lameness and be potentially
painful. All animals requiring hoof trimming need to have their hooves trimmed promptly and as frequently as
necessary for foot health.
