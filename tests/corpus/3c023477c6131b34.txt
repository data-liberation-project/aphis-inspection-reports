Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One white female adult lop-eared rabbit had severe crusts and redness in both ears. The left ear contained waxy brown
crusts extending half way up the length of the inside surface of the ear. The skin along the margins of the crusted area
was dark pink, slightly swollen, and inflamed. The ear canal was narrowed by the excessive buildup of crusts and debris.
The right ear contained dark brown waxy debris and crusts extending one third the length of the inside surface of the ear.
The adjacent skin was inflamed, and the ear canal was narrowed by the presence of the waxy buildup. The rabbit was
observed to be shaking her head repeatedly. The licensee stated that he had not observed this problem in the rabbits
ears prior to the inspection and had not yet contacted the vet but would do so today.
Rabbits who experience build up, infections, or extensive crusts in the ears may suffer from pain, discomfort, infection,
and decreased interest in eating, drinking, and other normal behaviors.
Correct by tomorrow, 08/11/21, by obtaining veterinary care for the rabbit.
2.131(b)(1) Direct

Handling of animals.
On inspection, a young female red kangaroo was temporarily being housed in a metal trailer that caused the animal to
overheat.


At approximately 1PM USDA personnel inspected a young (approximately 1.5-year-old) female red kangaroo who was
housed in a metal trailer which was parked in the direct sun. The trailer had metal slats. Along the sides there were with
gaps in between the slats, but these gaps were partially covered by boards. The licensee stated that the animal was
being temporarily housed in the trailer while undergoing treatment for an injury to the mouth. The kangaroo was quiet,
alert, with a moderately increased respiration rate. Her front limbs were extremely wet and she was observed licking her
front limbs repeatedly. The temperature in the trailer was 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
Animals who are subject to heat extremes may suffer from dehydration, stress, and poor immune system function.
Animals who already have an underlying health condition are especially vulnerable to the negative impacts of heat stress.
Correct by 10:00AM tomorrow (08/11/21) by providing the kangaroo with housing that provides protection from extreme
heat (overheating) and adequate ventilation.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner. A complete routine inspection was conducted on
8/10/2021. This inspection report is limited to the Direct non-compliances identified during that inspection. An additional
inspection report will be delivered with the other issues identified during the inspection.
