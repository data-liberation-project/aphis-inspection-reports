Facilities, general.
On 11 November 2022, staff discovered beaver “Gladys” (AF3223) had escaped from her enclosure into an area of the
building with employee-only access. The latch on the beaver enclosure had broken. Given when she was last observed,
the beaver was out of her enclosure for no more than three hours. Staff reported that the beaver was immediately
returned to the enclosure upon discovery and monitored carefully. The next day, a lameness was noted in the animal and
subsequent diagnostic imaging revealed a pelvic fracture. The licensee must ensure that the housing facilities be
maintained in good repair, protect animals from injury and contain the animals. This was corrected before the time of
inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
