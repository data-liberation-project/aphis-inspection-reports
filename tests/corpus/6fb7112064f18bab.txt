3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
Several rabbit enclosures in each of the rabbit housing rooms were noted to have a build-up of hair and solid
excreta adhered to the interior floor in the corners of the enclosures. It was determined that some of the rooms had
already been serviced by facility personnel and the pans under these enclosures had already been cleaned prior to
the inspection.
Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures should be kept reasonably free of excreta and hair to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices. A build-up of excreta and hair inside primary enclosures can affect the
health of the animals, soil their coats, as well as contribute to unpleasant odors.
The facility needs to increase the frequency of cleaning of individual enclosures to minimize the build-up of hair and
excreta to ensure the health and well-being of the animals, as well as to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices.
Correct by 1/27/17.
