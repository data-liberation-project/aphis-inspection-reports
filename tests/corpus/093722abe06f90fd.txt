2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**An approx. 5 week old female Shiba Inu puppy had a portion of the right rear leg that was missing. The licensee
stated that the dam had chewed off that portion of the leg shortly after birth; however, it was not discovered
immediately. According to the attending veterinarian, the licensee contacted her by phone. However, as the
licensee stated the leg was not bleeding and did not appear painful, there was no treatment provided nor was the
puppy seen by the veterinarian. Acute trauma causes pain and distress and can be life-threatening. The licensee
was required to have the puppy examined by the attending veterinarian by 8/30/19.
**Female Shitzu "Turner" (6 yrs old) had a thick buildup of brown tartar covering the entire surface of the upper
cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. Nearly the entire surface of the upper front and canine teeth are also
covered in thick brown tartar.
**Female Maltese "Carrie" (3 yrs old) had a thick buildup of tartar present on the cheek teeth on both sides of the
mouth. When the licensee chipped off a portion of the tartar, the gums began to bleed.
**Male Toy English Cavalier "Carl" (3 yrs old) had dark brown tartar present on the cheek teeth.
Lack of veterinary care for dental disease can lead to pain, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally, and can
contribute to further disease conditions in an animal. These dogs must receive dental care by a veterinarian.
Correct by 9/20/19 for "Turner" and "Carl" and by 10/22/19 for "Carrie."
**Female English bulldog/pug mix "Cindy" (2.5 yrs old) had been treated for demodectic mange. Both ears had
thickening of the skin. The skin was also crusted on the back of the ears and ear margins. According to the
attending veterinarian, she had provided treatment instructions to the licensee. In discussion with the licensee
during the inspection, these instructions had not been followed. Further, no treatment notes were available.
**Male Shiba Inu "Kim" (4.5 yrs old) had a skin condition present on the left rear leg. There was hair loss on the
side of the leg, and both hair loss and ulceration of the skin present on the front of the lower rear leg. Skin
conditions can be caused by underlying medical and behavioral issues, parasites and diet, affecting the health andwelfare of the dog. The two dogs ("Cindy" and "Kim") must be examined by a veterinarian by 9/13/19.
**Female Shitzu "Jennel" (6 months old) had matting present. The hair was twisted and matted on her head and
along her back and sides. Matted hair can cause skin irritation, and also trap urine, feces and moisture. It can also
foster skin infections and interfere with normal movement. Correct by 9/13/19.
3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Building 1 for the whelping dogs and puppies had the strong odor of ammonia present. Although the building has a
ventilation system, the area around the filter was rusted, and the filter needed replacement. Indoor housing facilities
for dogs must be sufficiently ventilated to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation.
Correct by 9/12/19.
3.4(a) CRITICAL
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Five dogs that were housed in the outdoor facility died during the period 12/19/18 to 2/15/19. The licensee stated
the dogs had died due to severe cold weather conditions. The following dogs died during that time period:
#7736 - 7 year old Havenese died on 12/19/18
#2157 - 7 year old Shiba Inu died on 1/30/19
#5811 - 8 year old Shiba Inu died on 2/6/19
#7725 - 7 year old Dachshund died on 2/12/19
#6914 - 6 year old Dachshund died on 2/15/19
Low temperatures for the local area were: 42 degrees F on 12/19/18; 28 degrees F on 1/30/19; 13 degrees F on
2/6/19; 34 degrees F on 2/12/19; and 34 degrees F on 2/15/19.
Both inspectors confirmed that the facility lacked the required approval by the attending veterinarian to keep certain
categories of dogs outdoors, including dogs that are sick, aged, infirmed, young, those that are not acclimated, and
those that cannot tolerate the prevalent temperatures such as short haired dogs in cold temperatures.
Leaving small breed dogs that may be compromised by age and breed outside during extreme cold and wet
conditions can cause illness and death. Dogs must never be subjected to temperature and other severe climactic
conditions for a duration that are detrimental to the animal's health and well-being, taking into consideration such
factors as the animal's age, breed, overall health status and acclimation. Correct from this time forward.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Building 1 had accumulated excreta, bedding, hair, food waste, clutter and debris present. All of these issues can
contribute to disease hazards, insects, pests and odor. This building must be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.
Correct by 9/12/19.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
