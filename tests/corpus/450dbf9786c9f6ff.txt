HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
2.78 (c)
The registrant received two Pug puppies for transport that did not have a valid Health Certificate. The Health
Certificate accompanying the puppies was provided on 5/16/2015 and was valid for ten days; expiring on 5/26/2015,
six days prior to their transport. The puppies were received from another transporter who had picked them up from
the breeder and transported them to the meeting point. The registrant then transported the puppies to a second
pick-up point where a licensed veterinarian inspected the puppies and provided a valid Health Certificate. Dogs
must be examined by a veterinarian and determined to be free of infectious disease or physical abnormality within
10 days prior to the beginning of transport. The registrant shall ensure that all dogs are accompanied by a valid
Health Certificate from a veterinarian prior to accepting for transportation in commerce. TO BE CORRECTED BY:

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
3.14(e)(1)
There were seven of the enclosures on the transport vehicle in which the puppies were not provided adequate
space. Four of the enclosures do not provide adequate floor space for all puppies in the enclosure to lie down in a
normal position or turn around without contacting the other puppies in the enclosure. Three of the enclosures did not
provide adequate head space. The puppies(cid:25) heads touched the top of the enclosure and they did not have enough
space to stand or sit erect. Without adequate space these puppies cannot make normal postural adjustments which
are crucial to their health and well-being. Primary enclosures used to transport dogs must provide adequate space
for each animal to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position. TO BE

There were 8 of the enclosures on the transport vehicle that contained more than 4 puppies per enclosure. Seven of
the enclosures housed 5 puppies and one of the enclosures housed 6 puppies. Without adequate space these
puppies cannot make normal postural adjustments which are crucial to their health and well-being. No more than
four live dogs or cats, 8 weeks of age or older, that are of comparable size, may be transported in the same primary
enclosure. TO BE CORRECTED BY : 6/5/2015
