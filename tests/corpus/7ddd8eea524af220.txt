3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(1) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: An enclosure with 10 weaned guinea pigs and an
enclosure with 5 breeding guinea pigs and their offspring were excessively dirty. More fecal material was visible
than bedding material. Animals standing in fecal material are potentially exposed to bacteria and parasites. The
licensee must ensure that animal enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks and cleaned often enough
to prevent an accumulation of excreta. Remains uncorrected.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: The cart, knives and potato slicer used to prepare potatoes for the animals were
excessively dirty. The top of the rack for the hamsters had debris and many of the shelves on the racks for the
dwarf hamsters were excessively dusty. There was spilled feed and bedding on the floor around the storage area.
Rodent feces were along the walls and around the pallets of bedding and spilled feed, in the shipping/staging room,
and washroom. Dirt and debris may harbor bacteria and fungus and cause animal health issues. Food preparation
areas must be kept clean to prevent contamination of the food. Animal racks must be kept clean to keep the
animals healthy. Spilled food, bedding and rodent feces must be cleaned up to help prevent and monitor pests.
Premises must be kept clean. Remains uncorrected.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(c) Pest control: Rodent droppings were observed along the walls and by the spilled feed and bedding.
Rodents may spread contamination and disease between animals in separate enclosures. Wild rodents may
introduce diseases and parasites into the animal colonies. An effective program for the control of mammalian pests
must be established and maintained. Correct by February 11, 2015.
