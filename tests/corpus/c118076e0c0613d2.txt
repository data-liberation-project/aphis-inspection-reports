Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
* Computerized records (dogs on hand) being used by the licensee have incomplete information. Forty dogs have no
official identification listed on the computerized records at the time of inspection. Complete and accurate records are

Housing facilities, general.
* Fecal waste was observed accumulating on the ground in five outdoor enclosures housing seven dogs. An estimated
20 to 35 percent of the total floor area was covered with fecal waste. The licensee estimated the waste buildup to be a
weeks worth. Fecal waste can attract pests and rodents, become a disease hazard or area of contamination to the
animals. Odors, insects, disease hazards, and pest infestation from fecal waste accumulations can have an adverse
effect on the health and well-being of the animals at this facility. The licensee must provide for the regular and frequent
collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food waste, bedding, debris, garbage, water, other fluids and wastes, and
dead animals, in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Correct by 4/1/21.

* The ground surface consisting of a mud and standing water mixture was observed in two outdoor enclosure housing
three dogs. The mud and standing water are covering the entire outside ground surface area being provided for the
dogs. Mud can cause potential soiling on the dogs. Standing water can create an environment for the spread of
diseases. Dogs not able to remain dry and clean always can have a negative effect on the health and well-being of the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities are equipped with drainage systems that rapidly eliminate water
and animals stay dry. Correct by 4/1/21.
3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
* Two outdoor enclosures housing three dogs have no shade available for the dogs to have access to. Lack of
adequate shade from the direct rays of the sun can be stressful causing discomfort creating a potential negative impact
on the health and well-being of the dogs. In addition, dogs do not have the ability to regulate their internal temperature
which could lead to the dogs becoming overheated. The licensee must ensure that there is one or more separate outside
areas of shade being provided, large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays
of the sun. Correct 4/8/21.
3.6(a)(2)(v)

Primary enclosures.
* The interior of one sheltered housing unit has a mixture of water and bedding covering the entire floor area. Three
dogs have access to the sheltered unit located in outdoor housing. Standing water and wet bedding can create an
environment for the spread of diseases. In addition, this surface will not allow the dogs to remain dry and clean at all
times. Dogs not able to remain dry and clean always can have a negative effect on the health and well-being of the dogs.

The licensee must ensure that the dogs can remain dry and clean. Correct by 4/1/21.
