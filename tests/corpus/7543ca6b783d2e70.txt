***A male King Charles Cavalier Spaniel (m/c# 0A02065070) was observed to have an area on his neck under his
chin that had wet hair. Upon closer observation there was an area about 1/2 inch in diameter that was missing
some hair and had moist, reddened skin. The licensee had not noticed the problem and the dog was not receiving
treatment for this condition. This dog also had long, matted hair hanging from the back of both rear legs.
***A female King Charles Cavalier Spaniel (m/c# 003012368) had matted hair on her rump, sides, and tail.
Skin problems can be painful and can worsen with time. The licensee must ensure that proper treatment is
provided for the skin condition present on the male dog. TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 4, 2015.
Matted hair can result in skin problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair(cid:25)s ability to provide protection
from the heat or cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these animals and must establish an
effective program of haircoat maintenance. TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 4, 2015.
(Note: The licensee removed the matted hair from the female dog during the inspection.)
The inspection and the exit breifing were conducted with the licensee on August 03, 2015.
