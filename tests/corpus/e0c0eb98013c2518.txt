2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are 6 Bull Mastiffs that do not have collars. While the cages do have cage cards with their information, all of
the dogs are over 6 months of age and require permanent ID according to AWA regulations and standards.
It is important to have permanent ID tags/tattoos or micro chips identifying the regulated animals for proper
management and traceability.
The licensee must provide proper ID for all of the regulated animals once over 16 weeks of age using tags,
microchips or tattoos, the puppy cards are only good until 16 weeks of age for the puppies born on the property. All
collars should be sized and fitted without being too tight on the animals.
