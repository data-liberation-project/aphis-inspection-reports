During this inspection only one of the owners was available to conduct an inspection. He stated he did not know
where the records were and the other owner could email them. An email was sent around noon asking the owner
to email the records of acquisition and disposition by this evening. As of 2:30 pm the next day the records had not
been received. The records were cited on 7-21-15 due to incompleteness. All required business information
(Program of Veterinary Care, acquisition and disposition records) need to be available for inspection within a
reasonable time.
To be corrected with future inspections.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the middle enclosure are two Bengal cats and a Geoffroys cat. During the last inspection the licensee was told
that Bengal cats are considered domestics under the Animal Welfare Act and all requirements for domestic cats
must be met. This enclosure does not contain a litter box, which is required for domestic cats. A large enough
receptacle to accommodate these size cats, containing sufficient clean litter, must be provided to contain excreta
and body wastes.
To be corrected by 10-19-15.
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the first exotic cat enclosure containing 3 cats, the rotted stump next to the wire was treated for ants, but was
never removed after this was cited on 7-20-15. This rotting piece of a tree needs removal so as to not harbor future
pests.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
