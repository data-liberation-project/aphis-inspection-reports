ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The facility could only produce a program of vet care dated October 2013 and the only species listed were the
coati mundi's that have since left the facility. When the facility has a consultant arrangement with a vet there must
be a written program of vet care and regularly scheduled visits to the facility to assess the health and overall care of
the animals. In addition the species currently covered at the facility (sugar glider, hedgehogs, prairie dogs, rabbits,
ferrets) need to be on the written program to assure the vet is aware of the variety of species and that their health
and well being are being addressed.

RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
*** The facility is bringing in large numbers of hedgehogs and prairie dogs and then moving those animals to other
facilities in and out of the state. The facility is only recording disposition of the animals sold retail in the store and no
records are present for the large numbers of animals going to other facilities.
Feb 3, 2014- 70 hedgehogs came into the store and went to several other pet stores in the area but no records of
final disposition was available for review.
May 7, 2014- 104 hedgehogs came into the store and went to several other pet stores in the area but no record of
final disposition was available for review.
May 20, 2014 - 20 prairie dogs came into the store and were said to have gone to an exhibitor in the state but no
record of final disposition was available for review.

These records are an important part of the record keeping requirement to track the movement of the animals. These
records need to be maintained in a timely and accurate manner from this point forward. Correct by: Feb 28, 2015
