3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There was a broken pane of glass in the garage door in the building housing the guinea pigs resulting in an opening
approximately 4 x 9 inches in size with a feed bag placed in the opening.
In addition, one guinea pig was observed to be out of its enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Failure to maintain the building in good repair including repairing broken windows can allow birds, pests, or insects to
enter the facility and cause injury or disease spread to the guinea pigs. Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure
could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to access food and water.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
