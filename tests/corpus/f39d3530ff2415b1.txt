Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On 22-June-2022, Asher #71 an adult Yorkshire Terrier was left outside for approximately 50 minutes. During that time he
became over heated and was breathing heavily. The licensee and facility representative brought him inside and cooled
him down with wet wash cloths. They stated they called the veterinarian and were told to keep him cool and he should be
okay as long as he was eating and drinking. 2 days later on 24-June-2022 around 9pm, Asher was lethargic and
shivering. The licensee and facility representative called the veterinarian for advice, they were offered an after hours visit
but the licensee and facility representative thought he could wait until morning. Around 9:50pm that same night, Asher
started having a seizure (or what the licensee and facility representative assumed was a seizure) and subsequently died.
When the inspector talked to the veterinarian, they stated they were unaware of Asher's condition until the night of his
passing. He questioned the licensee and facility representative on how the dog had gotten heat stressed as it had been a
nice 70 degree day out, they stated it had happened a couple days prior when it was warmer.
Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being can be discussed and a treatment plan can be made. The licensee
must communicate any animal health concerns with their attending veterinarian so that an effective treatment plan can be
put in place.
To be corrected by: From this day forward.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
*There are 4 litters of puppies, 12 total puppies, (Dams: Poppy #108, Taylor #77, Josie #104, Johnna #96) without an
approved form of acquisition information. The facility is currently using a book to document the acquisition information for
any puppies that are born on the premise. The book the facility is using is not an approved form of documentation for the
puppies and is missing information that is required under this subpart. Acquisition information is necessary for APHIS
officials to make positive identification of animals during inspection or that are under treatment and to properly trace their
movements.

The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of documentation which fully and correctly disclose all
information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or
under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records
shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must
record the acquisition information on an approved document for all puppies. The licensee must ensure all required
information is properly and accurately documented at all times.

*The facility is missing the Record of Disposition of Dog (APHIS Form 7006) for at least 9 dogs; Shari #127, Pinky #128,
Johnny #129, Ringo #130, Dixie #132, Itsy #125, Cole #124, Ebony #122, Char #121. The facility put on the Record of
Acquisition the first name of the person to whom the dogs were sold but this does not fulfill the requirement to fill out a
Record of Disposition (APHIS Form 7006) for each dog that is sold, exchanged/transferred or donated. Accurate and up
to date disposition records are necessary to identify animals still present at the facility and to trace their movements after
leaving the facility.


The licensee must create disposition forms (APHIS Form 7006) for the dogs listed above that includes the following; the
name and address of the person to whom the dog was sold or donated to, that person’s USDA license or registration if
they are licensed under the Act, the date the dog was disposed of, the method of disposition (sale or donation), the official
USDA tag number of the animal, a description of the animal (species, sex, date of birth, color or distinctive marking), the
method of transportation including the name of the initial carrier or intermediate handler or the name of the owner of the
privately owned vehicle used to transport the animal.
2.75(a)(1)(ix) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing the disposition date for 10 dogs;
Shari #127, Pinky #128, Johnny #129, Ringo #130, Dixie #132, Itsy #125, Cole #124, Ebony #122, Char #121, Asher #71.
Incomplete acquisition and disposition records may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to accurately inventory the
animals, identify individual dogs and to track their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose the date each dog was
disposed. The licensee must add the disposition dates to APHIS Form 7005 and always maintain all required information
at all times.
3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The sunroom where dogs are walked through to go outside had a moderate amount of brown organic material buildup
covering approximately 50% of the floor. The dogs would have to walk on the very edges of the walkway to avoid a soiled
surface. The facility representative stated they were going to clean it 2 days ago and even scraped up the buildup into a

pile on the sunporch, but admittedly cleaned a different area that day and didn't go back to finish cleaning the sunporch.
They were unsure of how long it had been since it was last cleaned and sanitized. There was a couple handfuls worth of
organic material present in the walkway that had been scraped up that included dust, excreta residue, hair and dirt.
Improper cleaning/sanitization and the accumulation and/or buildup of excreta and other waste materials could cause the
dogs to become soiled and expose them to disease hazards that could impact the dog's health and well-being. All hard
surfaces for which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized every two weeks or as often as
necessary in accordance with 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent the accumulation of dust, excreta residue, hair and dirt
and other organic material.
3.10(a)

Watering
Two adult dogs were present in a wire crate with a dry water bowl. The licensee stated they hadn't done chores yet today.
The inspector asked the licensee to provide the dogs water and they were let out of the enclosure into the main living
area. Neither dog went to the water bowls to drink.
Dogs that do not have access to water may become dehydrated and reduced water consumption may lead to additional
medical problems. Potable water must be continuously available for the health and well-being of the dogs, unless
restricted by the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by: From this day forward.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has not vaccinated any of the dogs identified as overdue to various vaccines in the previous inspection
report.
*At least 14 adult dogs and 5 puppies have been due for their vaccines according to the schedule on the licensee’s

Program of Veterinary Care. The APHIS inspector called the licensee’s veterinary clinic to confirm which dogs were due
for their vaccines due to lack of medical records available for inspection. The Program of Veterinary Care states dogs will
be vaccinated for Parvovirus and Distemper at 6-7 weeks, 10 weeks and annually. Rabies is to be given at 3 months,
annually and then every 3 years after. The licensee currently has the veterinarian give all vaccines. These dogs are due
for the following vaccinations:
**Rabies: Candy #117, Taffy #118
**Distemper and Parvovirus: Oakley #87, Tobi Mac #62, Roxy #56, Shelby’s 2 puppies (11 weeks old), Romi-Belle’s 1
puppy (10 weeks) and Paris’s 2 puppies (9 weeks)
**Rabies, Distemper and Parvovirus: Shelby #109, Remington #81, Ashley Wilkes #79, Taylor #77, Baxter #112, Carmel
#116, Lexi #119 and Sampson #120.
Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must follow the schedule for Rabies, Distemper and Parvovirus vaccines
written in the Program of Veterinary Care to protect the dogs from these contagious and/or deadly diseases. The facility
must vaccinate all dogs in need of the vaccines listed above and maintain the vaccine schedule n all dogs from this day
forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
