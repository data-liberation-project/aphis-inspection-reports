ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(a) (1)
***** The licensee retained a new attending veterinarian in May 2014. By the veterinarians own admission, she
does not have experience with large exotic cats. The animals at this facility range from middle age to geriatric and
have had minimal veterinary care over the past several years. During the Aug 19, 2014 inspection USDA officials
directed the facility to obtain a veterinarian with large exotic felid experience or a consultant to work with the current
attending veterinarian to ensure these animals receive adequate care specific for the species. As of the Nov 5th
inspection a written document confirming they have retained a consultant under formal arrangements to work with
the current attending veterinarian has not been provided.
As of the Nov 5th inspection the minimal treatment provided by the current attending veterinarian is concerning.
The only documents of veterinary care provided by the attending veterinarian were laboratory results for fecal
exams done on all of the large cats. Those documents showed Sampson (19 year old tiger) and Boudreau (19 year
old cougar) were positive for the intestinal parasite Spirometra. There are short email statements received on Sept
29, 2014 from the attending veterinarian that had been sent to the facility director and forwarded by the Director to
APHIS officials stating she prescribed Panacur 10 mg/kg for 3 days for treatment of the Spirometra. Panacur is not
considered an effective treatment for Spirometra. Moses, the 8 year old lion, was positive for fluke ova. There is a
short email statement received on Sept 29, 2014 from the attending veterinarian stating she prescribed Panacur 10
mg/kg for 3 days. Panacur at this dose is not an effective treatment for intestinal flukes. Documents have not been
provided indicating follow up fecal exams have been done to confirm effectiveness of treatment. The above does
not constitute adequate veterinary care for the animals. The licensee is responsible for ensuring the attending
veterinarian provides the regulated animals with adequate veterinary care.

(b) (2) ***** ***** Batman is a 12 year old male lion with an ongoing problem with his right eye. According to the few health
records provided by this facility after the Aug 5, 2014 inspection, Batman has had a problem with his right eye since
March 2014. USDA inspectors have observed this animal with varying degrees of eye squinting and third eyelid
prolapse at all 6 inspections that have occurred since July 22, 2014. According to veterinary records an attempt
was made by the current attending veterinarian to evaluate the eye on Aug 10, 2014 but no abnormalities were
found.
Despite repeated requests by USDA officials for documentation on diagnostics and treatments that have occurred
since Aug 10th for this eye problem, adequate veterinary records have not been provided by the Attending
Veterinarian or the facility. An email from the attending veterinarian received on Sept 9, 2014 states (cid:28)Batman hates
the supplement but is receiving it. Ataxia is not evident, eye is still draining. We will try repeating oral antibiotics
since eye did improve on them.(cid:29) This is the only communication received thus far from the Attending Veterinarian.
At the Aug 19th and Sept 23rd inspections USDA officials recommended a veterinary ophthalmologist be consulted
since the current attending veterinarian has been unable to resolve the eye problem. As of the Nov 5th inspection
there have been no documents or records indicating that any further diagnostics or consultations have occurred.
Appropriate means of diagnosis, treatment and control of this ocular disease or injury does not appear to have
taken place given the chronic 8 month duration of the problem and there has been no resolution for the animal.
Batman has had to suffer with an eye problem for 8 months. Eye issues can be extremely painful and distressful.
The licensee does not appear to be concerned with this animal(cid:25)s discomfort, pain and suffering. The licensee is
responsible for ensuring appropriate methods are used to adequately prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases
and injuries.

INFORMATION AS TO BUSINESS; FURNISHING OF SAME BY DEALERS, EXHIBITORS, OPERATORS OF
AUCTION SALES, INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS, AND CARRIERS.
On the 9/23/14 inspection documentation requested of any nature such as a plan of veterinary care, contract for
services agreement, or other type of agreement between all veterinarians and the facility to provide services for
adequate veterinary care to the animals at this facility and assistance to the ATV by the veterinarians who have
experience with all aspects of exotic felid medicine which the licensee states has been arranged has not been
provided to APHIS officials as of 11/5/14.
2.131 REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.(a)
*****Adequate experience and knowledge of the species maintained by a facility is required.
The general husbandry practices of feeding and cleaning alone does not demonstrate this skill. The ability to
recognize the proper required materials for building enclosures, housing units and enrichment choices is lacking.
The lack of ability to recognize the condition of the animals themselves to aid in evaluating good nutrition and the
lack of ability to recognize an animal which is acting abnormally (which can be an indication of a health issue) so
that this can be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner are further examples of this facility(cid:25)s
failure to exhibit that they possess adequate experience and knowledge of the species under their care.
If the facility personnel are not certain of the needs of the regulated species then they should seek out other
persons in the same type of business or similar business such as zoos other individuals who have similar animals.
They should be able to determine the types of building materials and enrichment items which would be appropriate
or not for use around the animals if they have the appropriate experience and knowledge of the species they are
working with.
This facility currently lacks a person of experience and knowledge of the regulated species and needs to incorporate
into the facility a plan for gaining this help from a person that possesses this experience and knowledge on a routine
basis or that can help to educate those personnel at the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a)
***** The enclosure housing the following two tigers named Putty Tat and Gomez fails to be maintained in good
repair. The height of the enclosure and configuration of the construction fails to meet the current guidelines provided
to the licensee which would prevent the potential for escape. This guidance was provided to the facility during an
inspection in which the Animal Care Big Cat Specialist was present and provided her recommendations as well as
on a prior inspection report for the inspection conducted on 7/22/14.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(b)
***** At time of inspection the concrete block housing unit for the leopard continues to remain too small to provide
adequate protection and to prevent discomfort from the elements for this animal. Guidance for this facility in aninspection report dated 7/22/14 regarding this housing unit has been ignored.
A similar housing unit had been constructed for the cougar which was also not large enough to prevent protection
and discomfort from the elements. A new housing unit for the cougar had been constructed and was present during
the inspection of 9/23/14 which provided all the requirements for this animal to be protected and provide for its
comfort during periods of inclement weather. This was discussed with the Director of the facility during the
inspection as being the type of housing unit needed for the leopard as well, this guidance has been ignored as well.
This inspection and exit interview conducted by APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE personnel and the director for the
facility.
