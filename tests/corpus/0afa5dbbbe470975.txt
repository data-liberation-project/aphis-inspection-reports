Space requirements.
The trailer housing three adult female California sea lions while the show pools were being cleaned contains a dry resting
area that fails to meet the minimum size required under the Animal Welfare Act. The flat metal rectangular dry resting
area in the trailer is 84 inches long by 94 inches wide, giving the animals 7,896 square inches (54.83 square feet) of dry
resting space. The average length of an adult female California sea lion is 5.7 feet. The minimum dry resting area
required for one adult female California sea lion is 5.7’ x 5.7’ = 32.49 square feet. Three adult female California sea lions
require 32.49 x 3 = 97.47 square feet of dry resting space in their primary enclosure, so the trailer lacks 42.64 square feet
of dry resting space.
The inspector arrived at the exhibition at 11:13am and the facility representative stated that the animals had been inside
the trailer since 8am while they vacuumed the pools. The three adult female California sea lions had been kept in a space
that does not meet the minimum requirements for dry resting space for at least three hours. The sea lions must have
access to the show pools and main deck at all times in order to meet primary enclosure space requirements.
Adequate dry resting space is important to allow animals to rest and make normal physical, postural, and social
adjustments when out of the water. The facility must house animals in primary enclosures that provide at least the


minimum amount of dry resting space for the animals within the enclosure as required by the Animal Welfare Act.
To be corrected from this day forward.

Space requirements.
The trailer housing three adult female California sea lions while the show pools were being cleaned contains a pool that
fails to provide the minimum surface area required under the Animal Welfare Act. The pool in the trailer is rectangular and
has a surface area of 94 inches by 96 inches, equal to 9024 square inches (62.6 square feet). Half of the surface of the
pool is under a metal shelf, and a facility representative stated that when animals were housed in the trailer the pool water
was filled up to about 6 inches below the bottom of the shelf. The pool surface area uncovered by the shelf is 94 inches
by 48 inches, equal to 4512 square inches (31.3 square feet). Three adult female California sea lions require a pool with a
surface area that is at least equal to the minimum size required for their dry resting area. In this case, the minimum
surface area for the pool in the primary enclosure is 5.7’ x 5.7’ x 3 = 97.47 square feet.
The inspector arrived at the exhibition at 11:13am and the facility representative stated that the animals had been inside
the trailer since 8am while they vacuumed the pools. The three adult female California sea lions had been kept in a space
with a pool that does not meet the requirements for minimum surface area of a pool for at least three hours. The sea lions
must have access to the show pools and main deck at all times in order to meet primary enclosure space requirements.
Marine mammal pools must have adequate surface areas to allow animals to make normal physical, postural, and social
adjustments while entering, exiting, and swimming in the pools. Pool areas under a low overhang do not provide enough
space for sea lions to make normal physical, behavioral, and social adjustments. The current uncovered pool surface area
is 31.3 square feet; an additional 66.17 square feet is required to meet the minimum surface area required by the Animal
Welfare Act. The facility must house animals in primary enclosures with a pool that provides at least the minimum amount


of surface area required by the Animal Welfare Act.
To be corrected from this day forward.

Space requirements.
The trailer housing three adult female California sea lions while the show pools were being cleaned contains a pool that
does not provide the minimum horizontal distance required under the Animal Welfare Act. The pool in the trailer is
rectangular and is 94 inches (7.8 feet) wide and 96 inches (8 feet) long. Female California sea lions require a pool with a
minimum horizontal distance of at least 8.55 feet (102.6 inches), calculated as 1.5 times the averages adult body length of
5.7 feet. The pool in the trailer is 8.6 inches short in width and 6.6 inches short in length.
The inspector arrived at the exhibition at 11:13am and the facility representative stated that the animals had been inside
the trailer since 8am while they vacuumed the pools. The three adult female California sea lions had been kept in a space
with a pool that does not meet the requirements for minimum horizontal distance for at least three hours. The sea lions
must have access to the show pools and main deck at all times in order to meet primary enclosure space requirements.
Pools in marine mammal enclosures must provide adequate distance (length) to allow animals to swim normally, turn
around, and make normal physical, behavioral, and social adjustments while in the water. The facility must house animals
in primary enclosure with a pool that provides at least the minimum horizontal distance required by the Animal Welfare
Act.
To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection was conducted on the “Hawaii Unit” at the Greeley Stampede in Greeley, Colorado.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and a Colorado Parks and Wildlife Officer.
