Handling of animals.
During a recent kinkajou encounter at this facility a young child was scratched by a kinkajou. A staff member was in the
enclosure with 2 children. One child had a bowl of food while the animal sat on the other child's shoulder. According to the
assistant manager, the kinkajou jumped off the child's shoulder to get to the bowl of food. The animal scratched the face
of the young child as it leaped off of his shoulder. Therefore, it is apparent that the animal was not handled in a manner
so that there was a minimal risk of harm to the animal or the public. Each animal encounter needs to be conducted in
such a way that the animals and the members of the public are safe from harm / injury.

Facilities, general.
During this inspection it was noted that the wooden door frame in the African Crested Porcupine enclosure was in need of
attention. The wooden door frame to the back, staff access area, has been chewed by the porcupine on the bottom, right
side. There is now bare and splintering wood present. To ensure the safety of this animal, this door frame will need to be
addressed.

Sanitation.
There is a wall between the Bengal cat and kinkajou enclosures. This wall is constructed of a wooden frame with
plexiglass panels screwed into the wood. The kinkajou enclosure had once been a part of an aviary. During this
inspection it was noted that there was an accumulation of feathers and bird seed between the wood frame and plexiglass.
This area will need to be cleaned and kept clear of any further debris.
