2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** A white tiger "Bogdan" approximately 5 years old died in late August. The owner noticed several days prior to
going out of town August 28th that "Bogdan" was eating less and drinking more, appeared to be losing weight and
was more distant from his cagemate "Sable". The owner stated upon returning on August 29th, "Bogdan" was still
not eating and drinking normally and was subsequently found dead the morning of August 30th. The veterinarian
was not contacted when it was initially noted that "Bogdan" was not eating and drinking normally. The veterinarian
was eventually contacted via phone and indicated based on the information conveyed by the owner that the death
of "Bogdan" may have been attributed to kidney failure. No clinical workup or necropsy was performed by the
veterinarian. A veterinarian was not contacted in a timely manner for a proper diagnosis or treatment.
The lack of proper diagnosis or treatment of an animal in a timely manner can cause unnecessary pain or
discomfort for the animal.
The veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the animal. Proper records should be kept
of the diagnosis and treatment, if required, after the veterinarians consultation.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.
Note: The previous 2.40 (b)(2) non-complaint item cited on inspection report dated August 9, 2017 has been
corrected.
