.
Items to be corrected before licensing can proceed:
Sec. 2.40 Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors) (a)(1)
The approved written program of veterinary care (PVC) does not include an armadillo, a hedgehog, and an
opossum. All animals intended for covered activities should be included in the written program.
The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending veterinarian establishing standards of care
for the animals. These species should be included to assure the veterinarian is aware of their presence at the facility
and to prescribe a health program for the facility to follow.
The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at the facility.
* The above items must corrected and pass inspection within 90 days ( May 4, 2015 ) from today.
* Only two more inspections are allowed within this 90 days to check for corrections.

Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
