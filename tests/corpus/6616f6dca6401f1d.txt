ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adequate Veterinary Care
A female Corgi (microchip number 003814847) had excessively long nails to the point that they were beginning to
curl. Overgrown nails can result in abnormal gait, broken nails or lameness. Trim the nails of this dog and maintain
appropriate methods of care such as regular nail trims to prevent them from being overgrown and to provide for the
dogs' overall health and well-being.
A male Poodle (microchip number 087340601) was observed to have soaked fur around its mouth. Closer
inspection revealed that a dark brown material was adhered to the surface of all the teeth. The upper and lower
cheek and canine teeth had a gray colored creamy material along the gum line extending down into the spaces
between the teeth. The upper left cheek teeth had a visible separation between the gums and the teeth. Failure to
properly identify and treat dental health issues can lead to a poor state of health and nutrition by causing pain or
leading to loose teeth, abscesses, and bone loss or infection. This dog must be examined by the attending
veterinarian to receive veterinary care for this dental health issue. Documentation must be maintained by the
licensee on the veterinary exam and treatment provided to this dog.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records
The facility records do not contain all required information including the following:
*The acquisition record for 1 male Bichon on loan for breeding (dog is not listed on APHIS Form 7005).
*One disposition record for the same Bichon when it went back to the original owner.
*The record of disposition for 9 puppies is not clearly and accurately completed resulting in unclear information as to
exactly where the animals went to.Incomplete records do not allow for proper tracking of the animals. Maintain records that are complete, accurate and
contain all required information.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Condition and site
There is a large round fan used for ventilation hanging from the ceiling on the left hand side of the housing facility as
well as a ventilation fan on the ceiling in the middle of the building that both have a significant accumulation of
animal hair, dust, cobwebs, and brown matter covering them. The enclosures under and around the large round fan
have the same buildup on the tops of the wire enclosures. Areas around and in the housing area that are not
maintained, cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis can harbor insects or bacteria, and can contaminate food or
water supplies or cause animals to become ill. Soiled areas around and in the housing must be maintained,
cleaned, sanitized, or replaced in order to satisfy husbandry requirements.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces--(1) General requirements.
***There were three occupied raised enclosures housing a total of 4 dogs where the metal wire mesh panels
constructing the sides of the enclosures have rust leaving a rough surface to the wire.
***The heavy metal paneling used on one of the ground Corgi enclosures that housed 1 Corgi during the beginning
of the inspection has areas of rust leaving a rough surface to the metal.
***A metal wire panel inside the sheltered portion of an enclosure housing 2 Corgis had an accumulation of rough
rust covering the entire surface of the panel.
***In one of the raised enclosures housing one Pregnant Corgi there are wire 2 sided boxes on each of the 2 front
corners of the enclosure that have been used in the past to keep a feed and water dish from moving. These metal
wire boxes have excessive rust on them that the animal has direct access to.
Failure to maintain surfaces that can be readily cleaned and sanitized may increase disease hazards or affect
structural strength. Replace, cover or repair rusted surfaces in these enclosures to ensure structural strength and
cleaning and sanitizing of the surfaces.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.(c) Surfaces--(3) Cleaning.
An accumulation of hair, and excreta is built up in the large sheltered exercise pen currently occupied by 2 Corgis
and one large ground enclosure that was occupied by 1 Corgi at the beginning of the inspection but was moved
during the inspection. Additionally, the ground enclosures had an excessive accumulation of a brown organic
matter smeared on the white plastic side walls. Inadequate cleaning can increase disease hazards, odors, pests
and soiling of the animals. Remove waste from the enclosures and maintain daily.
3.6(a)(2)(12)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General requirements.
The plastic mesh flooring for one primary enclosure housing an adult female Corgi was sagging in the middle. The
sides of the flooring were detached from the supports allowing the floor to sag and leaving a gap at the edge of the
flooring where it meets the sides. The gap could result in injury to the dog and sagging floor may affect the comfort
of the dog and ability of it to move around in a normal manner around its enclosure. Repair or replace the flooring to
prevent sagging.
Correct by 8/23/2014. Note: The licensee corrected this during the inspection.
3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Additional requirements for dogs--Space.
One enclosure housing two adult dogs did not provide the minimum amount of floor space required. The enclosure
measured 24 inches by 36 inches with food and water receptacles taking up .5 square feet of space and therefore
providing a total of 5.5 square feet of floor space. The dogs measured 16 inches and 18.5 inches in length. These
dogs housed together require a total of 7.53 square feet of floor space and therefore were short 2.03 square feet of
floor space. Inadequate space could affect the comfort of the dogs and limits opportunity for exercise. Provide these
dogs with the required minimum amount of floor space to ensure their health and well-being.
Correct by 8/23/2014.
Dog numbers 087340601, 003812574, 004039873, 072551323 and 108367547 as documented under 2.40(b)(2) on
the previous inspection report dated April 23, 2014 have been addressed.
