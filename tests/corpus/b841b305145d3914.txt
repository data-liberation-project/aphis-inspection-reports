2.40(b)(5) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On June 23rd 2021, an adult male Cynomolgus macaque (ID #MB-996) died unexpectedly during a routine blood
harvesting procedure while anesthetized. Upon initiating the procedure, the employee noticed the primate’s blood was
darker than normal, alerting the licensee who was also present in the room. Chest compressions were initiated, but they
were unable to resuscitate the primate.
Immediately following, the employee expressed concern that MB-996’s demise was a result of oxygen deprivation due to
improper placement on the transport cart prior to the procedure. When questioned about the positioning of the four
sedated primates for this procedure, no malpositioning was identified by anyone present in the room, including the
employee who voiced this concern.

The facility conducted an internal investigation, interviewing all parties involved. Though the employee stated they began
CPR after noticing MB-996’S dark-tinged blood, another technician present stated the employee was unaware the primate
stopped breathing. It wasn’t until the technician brought it to the employee’s attention 5-7 minutes after the procedure
began that chest compressions were initiated; blood was already drawn and collected in tubes by this time. The internal
investigation concluded MB-996 was alive when placed on the employee’s processing table, and remained in the same


position for several minutes before it was declared deceased. There was no overt evidence derived from direct
observations by anyone in the processing room that observed MB-996 was in respiratory distress prior to its death.
The inspector followed-up with the attending veterinarian during the inspection. They suspected the cause of MB-966’s
death was not related to the transport cart conformation, but the lack of observation and monitoring in the processing
room.

Insufficient monitoring practices impede sound oversight of the nonhuman primates cared for, leading to circumstances
that compromise the health and well-being of the animals. The dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care in accordance with established veterinary
medical and nursing procedures.
