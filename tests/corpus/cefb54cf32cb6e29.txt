SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two nonhuman primates (an olive baboon and a macaque) are being housed in a sheltered facility. The interior
portion of this area is still under construction, and there is currently no air conditioning system or any other climate
control in this area. The ambient temperature in the interior of the building was 98.5 F at approximately 1330 hours.
Both primates were bright and alert, and neither appeared to be suffering any ill effects from the heat at this time.
Sheltered facilities must be able to maintain the interior temperature between 45 and 85 degrees F. Failure to
control temperature extremes can have a serious impact on the health and well being of enclosed animals. The
facility is correcting the current problem by moving both primates to outdoor enclosures until construction of the
sheltered portion is completed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures housing, respectively, a single adult lion and a single adult tiger are open topped cages, with fence
heights approximately 10 feet. There are short kick-ins on both fences. Cage fences of this height may not be
sufficient to adequately contain adult lions or tigers. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing adult big
cats are constructed and maintained to adequately contain the animals. The licensee has made progress on
constructing a closed top for the tiger enclosure, but it still does not meet current requirements.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
