2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An exhibition of sheep, goats, a calf, and a llama at the Rocky Mountain Pumpkin Ranch in Longmont, CO did not
have an attendant to monitor the petting and feeding of the animals through the enclosure fencing by the public at
the time of this inspection. The responsible employee stated that an attendant is present only when there are
guided tours or on busy weekend days and that there are no mechanisms in place to prevent public contact at times
when no attendant is present.
Attendants are required during public feeding and handling of exhibit animals to prevent rough handling, feeding of
inappropriate food or other items, and to minimize potential injuries to the animals or the public.
A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.
To be corrected by 10/11/2014.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with employee.
