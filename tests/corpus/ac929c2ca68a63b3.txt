3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
A fox escaped from it's holding area at approximately 11:30 am on November 8th 2019. The licensee self reported that
the fox had escaped. Despite numerous attempts to recapture the fox by the licensee, they were unsuccessful. An area
of the enclosure that housed the fox was previously noted by staff to have a gap in it that allowed the escape. It was
repaired immediately after the escape before any other animals were housed in the enclosure.

Failure to contain the animals can result in inability to access food or water, and possibly result in injury and/or death.

The enclosure must be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.

Corrected by: from this day forward all animals must be contained in their enclosures.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
