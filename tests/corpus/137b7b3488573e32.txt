ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the inspection, a bottle of euthanasia solution was found past its expiration date. This bottle was available
for use should the need arise and not clearly marked as expired or to be disposed. None of the ongoing animal
activities require routine use of euthanasia solution; however, it is maintained on hand for medical euthanasia
purposes. When alerted that the bottle was out of date, the IACUC chair stated that the bottle would be disposed of
properly and that the committee would ensure proper expiration dates for all medications are being observed by all
study directors and animal care staff. The use of expired drugs, particularly those for anesthetic, analgesic, and
euthanasia purposes, is not consistent with adequate veterinary care. Medications are not guaranteed to be
effective and/or safe past their expiration dates. Correct by establishing a program of veterinary care that allows for
the availability of appropriate equipment, including medications, to provide adequate veterinary care.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC chair and animal care staff.
