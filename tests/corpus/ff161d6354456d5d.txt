2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
On 6/10/22, 21 voles were scheduled to be transported from one facility building to another. During transport, the facility
employed driver began to experience severe symptoms of a medical emergency. At this time the employee altered the
planned route and drove directly to another facility building adjacent to the hospital and parked the vehicle in the loading
area. The employee proceeded directly to the emergency room. After approximately 3 hours from acquiring the animals
for transport, the driver contacted another member of the transportation team, while still under care at the emergency
room, to complete the transfer. Although the second driver was able to pick up the animals and complete the transport
within an hour of being notified, it was an unusually warm day for this location, and upon delivery, facility staff noted that
10 of the animals were deceased. The facility notified inspectors at the time of the incident and has taken appropriate
action to prevent recurrence.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Corrected by the time of inspection.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
