ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0945 on
31-May-18. I knocked on the licensee's door. No one answered. I honked my car horn. I then contacted the
licensee by phone and left her a message. I did not receive a phone call back. After 30 minutes, I left the property.
End of report.
