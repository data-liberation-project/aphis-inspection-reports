FEEDING.
Dry dog food being fed to the bears was past the manufacturer best use date of January 22, 2018. There were
approximately 36 bags of the dry dog food with the same date in the facility feed room.
Food that is past the manufacturer recommended use date may be lacking in nutritional value and/or palatability
which may have a negative impact on animal health. The facility should ensure that food be wholesome, palatable,
and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.
