INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives.
1. Protocol #14-05 included a procedure that would be considered more than momentarily painful or distressful and
the written narrative of the animal use proposal referenced the use of a database in the search for alternatives.
However, the database search included in the proposal that was approved by the IACUC in August 2014 had been
conducted by the principal investigator in the year 2002 and therefore did not describe a search that was adequate
to determine that alternatives were not available for the procedure.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more
than momentary pain or distress to the animals, the investigator is required to consider alternatives to those
procedures and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available. Whenever a database search is utilized to fulfill this requirement, it should be
conducted closer to the time the proposal is submitted in order to determine that alternatives were not currently
available.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for this protocol.

2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Complete Description of Animal Use.
1. Protocol #15-05 did not contain a complete description of the proposed animal use. The protocol approved by
the IACUC in April 2015 contained a description of the administration of the study agent by injection but it was
learned during the inspection that the study animals on the premises had received the study agent by the oral route.
In addition the approved protocol did not identify the study agent and the dose of the study agent to beadministered to the animals was not included.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a complete
description of the proposed use of the animals so the IACUC can determine that the components of the proposed
activities related to the care and use of animals are in accordance with the requirements outlined in this subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for this protocol.
Correct by 6/29/15.
