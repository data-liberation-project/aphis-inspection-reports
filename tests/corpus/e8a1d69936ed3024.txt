Brown and white female English bulldog with microchip 0A0232916 has a small amount of discharge from her right
eye. Her eyelids appear to roll inward, causing hair to be in contact with her cornea. The cornea has areas of dark
brown discoloration, consistent with chronic irritation. This is a source of constant discomfort and pain. She has
recently whelped and Licensee stated he treats her periodically, and is treating her now, with eye ointment. No
documentation of veterinary assessment and treatment plan is available.
Brown and white female English bulldog with microchip 0A01396028 has a large amount of thick, greenish white
discharge in her left eye. The conjunctiva around the globe appears red and swollen. The cornea is opaque.
Treatment was recommended by the attending veterinarian on April 23, 2015. Though Licensee stated he has
provided treatment, the condition persists, has not resolved, and appears painful.

Brindle female French bulldog with microchip Avid 014623773 has two nodules on her hind end. One is on the side
of her right hind leg. It is a firm mass about thumb sized which is hairless. The surface skin is broken, ulcerated,
and moist. There is another smaller, softer mass on the back of her left hind leg which is also abraded and weeping
fluid. These open wounds increase the risk of infection and other complications that can affect the health and
well-being of the dog.
Male Yorkie with microchip Avid 083080629 has a very firm, walnut sized mass on his abdomen near his sheath.
Surgery was recommended by the attending veterinarian (AV) on a previous exam, but has not yet been performed.
Licensee has not developed a plan or schedule to follow the AV(cid:25)s recommendations. The mass may indicate
problems that can compromise the dog(cid:25)s health and well-being.
The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be utilized. The
dogs listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment,
treatment, and plan must be maintained for examination by APHIS officials. All veterinary recommendations must
be followed exactly and in a timely manner.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the back outside area of the kennel was found on the floor one open bag of dog food with the consistent risk of
contamination. Open bags of food may attract vermin and lead to deterioration of the food. Paper bags resting on
the floor may absorb moisture leading to molding and deterioration of the food. It is important for the health of the
animals to have a clean and uncontaminated feed.
All open bags of food should be stored in tightly closed nonporous containers. All unopened bags should be kept up
off the floor. All food and bedding supplies shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies.
