FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The pool inside the black bear enclosure was in need of attention. The pump in the pool was broken, so the pool
had not been cleaned for approximately one week. The water was dark in color and there was an accumulation of
miscellaneous debris. Water in enclosures should be clean to ensure the health of the animals.
In the aoudad, Jacob sheep, and goat enclosure there was a small wood side shed being used for a shelter. A
board had fallen off the side of the shed and was on the ground leaving 2 holes in the middle of the wall. Chicken
wire mesh was loosely hanging from the top right side of the shed. All structures in enclosures should be
maintained in good repair to prevent injury to animals.
In the badger enclosure, there are three spots along bottom perimeter of the enclosure that has exposed chain link
mesh due to the badger digging. The exposed chain link should be covered to prevent injury to the animals.
