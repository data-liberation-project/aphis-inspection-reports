Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
At least three female baboons have undergone multiple major operative procedures on more than one IACUC approved
protocol without prior approval from the APHIS Administrator. Protocol 21-003 involves a major operative procedure from
which animals are recovered. Medical records and study records indicate that, three adult female baboons (ID #: 26876,
26741, and 28768) have each undergone major operative surgeries on prior protocols as well as the current protocol.
1. Female Baboon ID# 26876: Underwent 3 cesarian sections: twice on protocol #18-006 on 4/18/2019 and 1/10/2020,
and once on protocol #21-003 on 6/17/2021.
2. Female Baboon ID# 26741: Underwent 3 cesarian sections: twice on protocol #15-009 on 9/20/2016 and 8/28/2017,
and once on protocol #18-006 on 3/20/2020.
3. Female Baboon ID# 28768: Underwent 3 cesarian sections: once on protocol #15-009 on 3/27/2017, and twice on
protocol #18-006 on 7/22/2019 and 4/15/2021.
Protocols 15-009, 18-006, and 21-003 are a continuation of the same study with identical study objectives. The protocols
indicate animals will be undergoing multiple major surgeries but do not provide a scientific justification nor have approval
from the Administrator. These protocols, which have each been reviewed and approved by the IACUC, have spanned
over 6 years. According to the facility, due to the multiple surgeries performed, the IACUC created a policy to limit the


number of major operative procedures an individual animal can undergo to a maximum of six in the animal’s life. The
facility has not sought or received approval from the Administrator for any of the animals that have undergone multiple
major operative procedures on any of the protocols.
Animals that undergo major operative procedures and are recovered are subjected to stress, pain and discomfort.
Correct by the end of 9/15/2021 by not allowing any animal to undergo more than one major operative procedure from
which the animal recovers, without a justified scientific reason by the principal investigator and/or receiving prior approval
from the USDA Administrator.
3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
One female chinchilla (2689L) was injured by a plastic hut that was used in the primary enclosure. Records from Protocol
19-015 indicated that this animal had a toe caught in the hut on 03/18/2020. This was observed on the same day a
protocol procedure was performed. The animal was treated with pain relief in accordance with the protocol and referred to
veterinary staff for evaluation and treatment. It was diagnosed with a dislocated and/or fractured toe and ultimately lost
part of the digit.
Injuries such as fractures or loss of a digit are painful and cause unnecessary discomfort.
Following this incident, the facility changed the type of huts used for all chinchillas to an alternate style. There have been
no additional occurrences since that time. Correct by 9/15/2021 by ensuring that all facilities housing animals are
maintained appropriately and protect the animals from injury.

This inspection was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, IACUC administrator, and Project Manager. The exit
interview was conducted with the Institutional Official, IACUC Chair, IACUC administrator, and Project Manager.
