HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The top of the shelter box for the 2 brown lemurs housed next to the main barn is coated with poultry feces . The
chickens and guineas are using the top of the enclosure as a roost . Bird feces pose a health hazard to non human
primates and must not be allowed to accumulate in the enclosures. Hard surfaces which non human primates come
in contact with must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta to prevent disease
hazards. CORRECT BY : 12/19/16

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The non human primates housed outdoors ( lemurs and bushbabies ) have shelter boxes but no supplemental heat
is provided. Temperatures at night over the last week have dropped below 45 degrees and more cold weather is
predicted in the next few days. The shelter for non human primates must safely provide heat to the non human
primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 45 degrees except as directed by the attending
veterinarian and in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices . Adequate shelter
that will maintain the temperature as described must be provided before predicted cold weather . CORRECT BY :

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The Bushbabies and Lemurs and several marmosets had no environmental enrichment in their enclosures at time
of the inspection . The written plan was not available for review during the inspection. All non human primates must
be included in the written plan/vet approved plan for environmental enhancement . The plan must be followed ,
documented and made available to USDA upon request to promote psychological well being for non human
primates. CORRECT BY : 12/19/16
3.131(a)
SANITATION. Feces and food debris are accumulating on top of shelters and platforms in many of the enclosures housing
kinkajous and coatimundis . Such accumulations are an attractant for pests and a source of odors and create a
disease hazard . More frequent cleaning is necessary to prevent animal contamination and reduce disease hazards.
