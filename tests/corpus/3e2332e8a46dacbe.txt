Section 3.52(d) Protection from predators: There is no gate or door to close the large opening in the wood fence
that contains the eight outdoor rabbit enclosures by the side of the barn. Predators such as fox or coyotes could

the rabbits from predators.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The enclosure housing 6 sheep, 4 goats and 2 calves needs repairs. The
section of small wire mesh has wire strands detaching and pulling away from the underlying wire fence on the side
opposite from the shelter. The wire ends may injure the animals. This same side of the enclosure fence has a hog
panel detaching from the fence post and leaning in toward the enclosure. An animal may try to go into the gap
between the detaching hog panel and the wire fence and get caught in the fencing. The fence must be repaired to
prevent injury to the animals.
