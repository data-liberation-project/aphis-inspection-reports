ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1514 on
04/25/2016. The license was contacted by phone and I left a message for them to call me back. I waited in my car
for thirty minutes and then left the facility. I did not receive a call back from the licensee.
End of report.
