than the person's approved site shall submit a written itinerary to the AC Regional Director to facilitate the
inspection process and protect the welfare of the animals. The licensee must ensure that an itinerary is received by
the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate
information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's
approved site.
To be corrected this day forward.
