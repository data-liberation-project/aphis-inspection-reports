Protocol 15101501, which is active and was approved on October 25, 2018, states that sheep will be housed for the
duration of the protocol at a facility not owned or operated by the University. This facility was not included in the
semiannual facility inspection and program review conducted in November 2020. Animals were housed at the off-site
facility in January and February 2021. Inspection of animal housing facilities is important to ensure animals are housed in
facilities that are appropriate, safe, and in compliance with the applicable regulations under the Animal Welfare Act.
