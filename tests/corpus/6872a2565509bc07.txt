2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:55 PM on
03-APR-19.
Knocked on the door and there was no answer. Called the phone number listed in ACIS and left a message. Went
around the driveway to the back of the house and yelled Hello two times. Waited in the driveway for 30 minutes to
see if someone returned my call, or returned to the facility.
