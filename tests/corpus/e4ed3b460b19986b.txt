2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On June 13th, 2022 a 10 year old boy was bitten by a 1 year old male ring tail lemur during an animal encounter
conducted at the facility. The lemur was sitting in a log and the boy was standing in front of it. The lemur jumped towards
the child and as the boy was putting his hands up to cover his face, the lemur bit his hand. At the time of the incident the
minor was in the company of an adult. The facility documented the incident and quarantined the animal. Members of the
public that have been bitten by animals may suffer from injury, infection, pain and/or trauma. The facility was unable to
assure the safety of both the public and the animal. Animals handled in a way that does not minimize the risk of harm to
both the animal and the public can lead to serious injuries or health impacts of either the animal or the public. The facility
must ensure there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the
safety of the animals and the public.
