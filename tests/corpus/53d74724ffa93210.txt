2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3 pm on
08/02/2016. This is the third consecutive attempted inspection. Animals were identified during the inspection
conducted 06/16/16 which needed veterinary care. This series of repeated attempted inspections has prevented
re-evaluation of these animals by APHIS Officials. Licensees had not communicated that they would be unavailable
today. No one was home. Inspectors called, left a message, and waited one half hour, but no one returned the call
or came home during that time. Licensees must call with availability as often as necessary to facilitate inspection.
