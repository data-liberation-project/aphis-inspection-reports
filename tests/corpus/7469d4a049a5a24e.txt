SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
This was a focused inspection involving traveling exhibition space.
On March 28, 2014 one animal (zebra) was on public display in a 5'x10' enclosed area.
The 5'x10' enclosed area did not allow the animal to make normal postural or social adjustments.
Providing inadequate space may lead to stress and/or abnormal behavioral patterns.
Animals that are not in actual transit are to be provided with and/or have access to an area that provides sufficient
space.
Exit interview conducted with the facility representative.
