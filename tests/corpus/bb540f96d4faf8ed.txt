2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Yorkshire terrier (microchip number 7E1007003) had two loose top incisors when examined by the inspector.
The cheek teeth had mild build up of brown material and the adjacent gums were mildly reddened. Facility records
indicated a dental cleaning was completed on 7-15-21 and no loose teeth were noted at that time. Daily observation of
animals is necessary to assess their health and well-being. This dog must be evaluated by the veterinarian.
Note: The licensee contacted the veterinarian during the inspection and scheduled an appointment.
2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
The facility doesn't have individual identification numbers documented on the cage cards for two different litters, totaling
five puppies born on 1-29-22. Individual identification of puppies is necessary to account for animal births. Assign
individual identification numbers to the puppies in a timely manner.
Note: The facility generated new cage cards with individual animal identification numbers before the completion of the
inspection.
