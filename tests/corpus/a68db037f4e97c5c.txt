Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:28 AM on 24-
JUN-21.

The inspector arrived at 10:28 AM on 6/24/21 to conduct an inspection. The inspector contacted the Licensee by phone
and learned that he/she had 2 programs scheduled today at off-site locations. She/he was about to leave for the first
program and would not return until later that afternoon.

An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility representative
available to accompany the inspector. Unannounced inspections are used to evaluate compliance with the AWA
Regulations and Standards. This is the FIRST attempted inspection of the Licensee.
