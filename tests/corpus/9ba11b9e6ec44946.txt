Time and method of identification.
There are 5 litters of puppies who have no form of identification. There are 2 litters of 3 puppies approximately 3 months
of age, 2 litters of 2 puppies that are more than 8 weeks of age and weaned, and 1 litter of 4 puppies less than 4 months
of age. Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
record keeping requirements that includes the ability to track the dogs that are purchased, transported, traded, sold, or
leave by other methods and for accurate health care documentation. The owner must provide identification at all times for
each puppy born on the premises.
