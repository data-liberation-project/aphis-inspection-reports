2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a female, adult Boxer (#92) who was very thin. The dog's ribs, spine and hip bones were easily
visualized from a distance. According to the licensee, a veterinarian had not been consulted regarding the dog's
body condition nor was the dog currently receiving any treatment. The licensee stated that the dog had whelped
approximately 10 weeks ago and is always this size. Poor body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate
nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee must have this dog examined by a licensed
veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must ensure
that the treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. TO BE
