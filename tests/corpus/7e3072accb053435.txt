INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Four protocols (12-0705, 12-0706, 13-803, and 14-0905) from three principle investigators had searches that did not
focus on the painful/distressful procedures as required by the regulation. Proper searches are the best method of
identifying alternatives (Refinements, Reductions and Replacements) that will minimize discomfort, distress, and
pain to the animals. The principal investigator must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than
momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals. Correct from this point forward on protocols submitted for
approval and renewal.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The shelter in the rear of the quarantine pen containing 13 sheep had a gap under the far side at ground level. This
gap was sufficiently large to allow a sheep to pass its head under the wall and possibly become entrapped. Possible
sources of entrapment and injury must be identified and corrected to avoid injury to the animals, The indoor and
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by: 29 June 2015
An exit briefing was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, IACUC Chair, OLAR director and ORIC staff.
