HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general.
At time of inspection one outside dog house housing two dogs had a hole in the top of the roof. This means the
house is not in good repair. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are kept in good repair and protect the
animals from injury at all times. To be corrected by 10-10-16.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At time of inspection all fifteen outside dog houses housing twenty four adult dogs and feeding receptacles were
dirty with dirt and grime. Cleaning and sanitization of surfaces that are in contact with dogs is necessary to prevent
an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards. Unsanitary living conditions and
potential transmission of diseases exists when surfaces are not cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if needed. To be corrected
by 10-10-16.
