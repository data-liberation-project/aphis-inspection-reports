2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee failed to provide an itinerary for an animal exhibit in Edgerton, WI, that lasted at least two nights. The
Animal Care Operations Office had not received an itinerary from the licensee prior to overnight travel. The lack of
an itinerary doesn’t allow inspection for compliance with regulations and standards of the Act when animals are
away from the home site.
An itinerary must be submitted to the Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever the
animals will be exhibited at a location other than the approved site(s) and whenever travel extends overnight. The
itinerary shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of all animals intended for
exhibition at any location other than the approved site.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
