ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is no written program of veterinary care available for review. The animal caretaker said the program is in the
office which is located off site. Access to the program of veterinary care was documented on the previous
inspection as well. To date we have not been able to review the plan. The written program of veterinary care shall
be kept on hand for review by USDA Officials during unannounced inspections.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are 11 recently acquired goats and one sheep in the goat pen behind the play yard. We observed at least 5
of the goats and the 1 sheep with dry and crusty material on their nostrils. One of the goats also had similar
discharge from her eyes. The condition of these animals had not been observed by the caretaker prior to this
inspection. Untreated illness can lead to further spread of disease and possibly death. These animals shall be
examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment provided. Correct by July 23, 2016.
The large male goat that is singly housed was observed kneeling in his enclosure. When the goat was encouraged
to stand he was observed to be lame primarily on his right forelimb. Upon closer observation of the hooves it is
noted that the toes on the forelimbs are overgrown forcing the toes into an abnormal position. This goat shall be
examined and treated as required for his condition. Correct by July 23, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a ramp in the rabbit enclosure that was placed to allow the rabbits access to the raised rabbit house. The
ramp has become warped and is bending down in the center. There are slats running crosswise on the ramp to
provide additional footing for the rabbits. These slats are attached with one screw in the center. The top slat has
turned and is vertical which will not provide any grip for the rabbits. Two of the slats have become dislodged and
are laying on the floor of the rabbit cage, one of these is turned upside down exposing the pointed end of the screw
which may cause injury upon contact. The ramp is not structurally sound. The ramp shall be repaired or replaced
to protect the rabbits from injury and allow them access to their house.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength
The area containing 21 goats has holes in the fencing large enough for the heads of the larger goats to become
entrapped, and for the smaller goats to possibly get out of the enclosure.
The barn containing 17 young pigs has an old metal gate laying down in the mudded area. This could pose as an
injury risk for the pigs.
The area containing 7 Pot Belly pigs has areas around the enclosure that have large gaps under the fencing that
could easily allow for the pigs to escape, or become lodged under the fencing.
Along the outside bottom of the barn used for the 21 goats night housing is panels of tin. This tin is rusted, and torn
with jagged edges sticking out.
Throughout the entire facility, there is broken wood on the fencing and broken wood being used as a stabilizer for
the wire fencing. There are areas of broken down, pushed down, and large holes in the wire fencing. The wood
fencing has broken boards, slats, and splintered areas. This creates multiple areas of disrepair around the entire
facility. All of these areas need to be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The area containing 21 goats, had an old, broken down tractor, with several piles of wood, and other debris within
the enclosure. The goats all have access to this debris, and can easily climb, and walk in, on, and around it. This
situation of machinery, wood piles, and miscellaneous debris creates an injury hazard for the goats within the
enclosure.
The area containing the Camel had an open gate leading into the area where machinery is stored. This area had
automotive supplies, an old bus, and several piles of lumber and debris. The Camel has access to this area during
the day when in his grazing pasture which could easily create an injury hazard to the animal.
Premises containing animals must be kept clean and free of any obstacles that could pose as a hazard to the health
and well being of the animals involved.The inspection and exit briefing conducted by Brenda Pietrosante, ACI and Michelle B. Williams, VMO with the
Animal Caretaker.
