2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is still inadequate, as it does not contain sufficient
provisions for emergency care. The current program, under the emergency care section, simply states “mobile
veterinarian”. The facility uses their attending veterinarian (AV) for emergency care but has no provision for
veterinary care when their AV is unavailable. From 11/18/16-3/07/17, while their AV was unavailable, one female
coati and one female goat requiring veterinary care, (according to facility records and personnel) did not receive
veterinary care or treatment. This is the critical noncompliance for this section.
*** The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete. The attending veterinarian last signed the
PVC on 09/04/15.
Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The facility should
establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at the facility and regularly scheduled visits to the
premises. Facility visits are necessary to ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care is being understood and
followed by the licensee, to check the health and well-being of the animals and to determine if changes in the
Program of Veterinary Care are needed.

***There are three female adult pigs, housed in an indoor barn, that are in need of hoof trims, which were pointed
out to the animal manager during the inspection. The hooves on the animals were excessively long, extending out
approximately four to six inches. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which
could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
The licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a
timely manner by a veterinarian as part of the facility’s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility use
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times. Additionally,veterinary and behavioral observations and evaluations by the veterinarian and facility staff must be documented
and readily available to APHIS upon request and include sufficient detail to demonstrate the provision of adequate
veterinary care.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female Coati named “Shyla” still has an abnormal left eye which has significantly worsened in severity
since the previous inspection. The eye is protruding and extremely swollen, approximately the size of a golf ball. It
is an extremely reddened mass of tissue and has a dark crusty scab on approximately one third of the surface area.
Fluid appeared to be leaking out of the eye onto her face. There were flies observed in the open wound around and
on the eye. APHIS staff observed the animal clacking its teeth loudly and pacing up in the top corner of the
enclosure. The overall condition of the animal has changed since the last inspection. The animal now has a dull
hair coat and appears to have lost weight. The animal was shaking her head and pawing at the injured eye
frequently during the inspection. She appeared to be suffering, as she exhibited signs of extreme stress and
discomfort for the species.
The last time the attending veterinarian examined the animal was on November 18, 2016. On January 27, 2017 the
licensee noted in her log that she spoke to the attending veterinarian and discussed the eye problem, but that the
AV was out of town and would come by to see the animal when she gets back. There was no notation of any
attempt to contact an emergency or alternate veterinarian at any time during the months of November through
March the animal’s deteriorating condition.
As of today, March 7, 2017 the coati has still not been seen by any veterinarian despite the condition of the eye
continuing to worsen as noted and observed by the facility staff. They have also completely stopped providing any
treatment and have discontinued recommended treatment by the AV. Failure to properly communicate animal
health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the
animal and potentially worsen a current medical condition.
***An intact adult male tricolor goat was non-weight bearing on his right front limb. The goat was lame at the walk.
The animal manager had not noticed that the goat was lame until the time of the USDA inspection. Lameness and
non-weight bearing is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes including both
infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment
can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
***A juvenile female goat had abnormal skin covering the tips of her ears. The skin was crusty and dry, with large
areas of hair loss. Her overall hair coat appeared dull and she was seen to be scratching her shoulder along the
chain link fencing. The animal manager stated that he had not noticed this skin condition prior to the USDAinspection. Skin disease can be caused by a variety of problems, including infection, allergies, injuries, irritation, or
other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing to the animal.
***In an enclosure containing three fallow deer and a camel, a female fallow deer had a fresh wound over the left
point of the shoulder. The wound was approximately two inches in diameter. There was complete hair loss at the
site of the wound, with reddened tissue exposed. A clump of white hair was seen beside a metal feeder. The animal
manager stated that he had introduced the deer and the camel into the same enclosure two days ago.
Injuries, diseases, and medical conditions that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be
painful and can lead to prolonged suffering.
***A young gray and white female goat, which was being housed alone in the barn, was unable to straighten her
front legs at the knees. This inability to straighten her front legs caused her to place all of her weight on her toes.
She was unable to stand or walk normally. The animal manager mentioned that he noticed the condition two weeks
ago but the condition has worsened since then. The animal manager stated that he thought the licensee had
contacted the veterinarian regarding this animal, however they “have trouble getting the vet out here.” The goat has
not been seen by a veterinarian nor received any medical treatment. Upon further questioning with the licensee,
she stated that she had not had a chance to discuss this specific animal with the veterinarian. Failure to properly
communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner can result in prolonged pain and
suffering for the animal and potentially worsen a current medical condition.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems, in a timely manner, can result in prolonged
pain and suffering and the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct
daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***Upon arriving to the facility, while still in the car, APHIS inspectors saw three members of the public feeding
alfalfa pellets to regulated animals. There were no facility representative in direct view of the members of the public.
There are not an adequate number of attendants present at all times when the public is allowed contact with the
animals. The public is allowed to walk through the facility unescorted on designated paths. The public is allowed to
contact and feed the animals. At the time of inspection, only three employees were present to watch the public
(approximately 15 people throughout entire facility). Of these three employees, one employee was escorting APHIS
personnel on inspection, one was collecting money at the entrance with limited view of the animals, and the third
employee was at the back of the property or in the barn with no view of the public. Furthermore, during theinspection, several other members of the public were seen feeding several goats and adult camels alfalfa pellets
provided by the facility.
An adequate number of attendants is needed to ensure the health and safety of the animals and to decrease the
likelihood of activities (rough handling, improper feeding, etc) that are harmful to the animals.
A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***A goat was sticking his head out through the wiring of his enclosure, through the gap in the wood paneling of the
adjacent camel enclosure.
***The gate in the young male Dromedary camel enclosure that separates his enclosure from an adjacent empty
enclosure is in disrepair. The gate is leaning inward and is attached to the structural post by baling twine. The metal
bar at the top of the gate is broken at one side and entangled in the wire of the gate.
***In the goat enclosure containing a combination of eight goats and sheep, there were several nail heads sticking
out of the wooden fence boards.
***In one corner of the eland enclosure, the wire fencing along the bottom is curving in an upward direction, creating
a large gap between the ground and the fencing.
***In the goat enclosure containing 30 goats a section of the wood panels is elevated off of the ground. In the space
between the ground and the bottom of the panel, a 10 foot long portion of the chain link fence is coming through,
with the wires protruding into the enclosure.
***In an enclosure containing eighteen sheep and goats a metal uprights of the shade structure were in disrepair.
Two legs were completely rusted through, creating sharp points that could come into contact with the animals in the
enclosure.
***In an enclosure containing eighteen sheep and goats, a particle board housing structure was in disrepair.
Portions of the particle board had been worn and rough, causing screw heads to be visible and protrude from the
wood.
***In an enclosure containing twenty goats and one pig, a roughly four foot long gap approximately 6-9 inches in
height was created between the ground and the bottom of the chain-link fence. Two sharp point were also pointingdownward, where the goats could come into contact with them.
***In the enclosure of “Pinkie,” a female Dromedary camel, there was a deep hole roughly a foot in diameter dug by
the Sulcata tortoise. The animal manager put his foot into the hole, illustrating that the depth was a minimum of two
feet.
***The sheet metal in the stall containing three pigs was rusted and in disrepair, peeling off of the wall. It formed
numerous sharp edges that could come into contact with the animals.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***A two and a half month old female Dromedary camel was in an outdoor enclosure that did not provide any shade
to protect the animal from direct sunlight. The animal manager stated that the camel is placed in this enclosure daily
at 9:00am and is taken out of the enclosure at 5:00pm. Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may lead to
overheating or discomfort from squinting.
Sufficient shade by natural or artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect
themselves from direct sunlight.
The camel was removed from this enclosure at the time of inspection and placed in an enclosure with adequate
shade structures.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***A two and a half month old female Dromedary camel spends the night in an enclosure that is not surrounded by a
perimeter fence. The camel is transferred from her night enclosure to her daytime primary enclosure by being let
loose and running between the two enclosures without being led by a handler. The perimeter fence only surrounds
the daytime primary enclosure. The area between the two enclosures is not surrounded by a perimeter fence.
Allowing the camel to run loose without a perimeter fence in place jeopardizes the safety of the animal as she has
the potential to run off of the facility premises.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals andunauthorized persons from having contact with the animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment
system. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.
The animal manager moved the camel into a different enclosure at the time of inspection and told inspectors that
the camel would be staying in that enclosure permanently. The perimeter fence surrounds the enclosure that the
camel has been moved to.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
***A two and a half month old female Dromedary camel was in an enclosure that was approximately 6ft by 12ft. The
animal manager stated that the camel was in this enclosure daily from 9:00am to 5:00pm. The camel was only able
to stand and turn around due to the size of the enclosure. The enclosure that contained the camel at night was
approximately twelve square feet in size. She was not able to exhibit normal species specific behaviors in either
enclosure.
Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal
postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.
After the inspection, the animal manager moved the camel into another enclosure that was approximately 1800
square foot enclosure. The licensee informed inspectors that the animal began running around and bucking upon
introduction to the new permanent enclosure.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***In the indoor barn housing three adult female pigs, there was an excessive accumulation of excreta on the
ground. Large portions of the enclosure were heavily saturated with urine and feces buildup. When APHIS
inspectors opened the stall door, there was an overwhelming odor of ammonia coming from the enclosure.
Excessive accumulation of animal waste can increase risk of diseases and affect the well-being of the animals.
Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to
reduce disease transmission, and to prevent animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must
clean this enclosure and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as necessary to promote
normal husbandry standards.This inspection was conducted with animal manager and exit briefing was conducted with licensee and animal
manager.
