Primary enclosures.
At time of the inspection, there were exposed electric cords for heating pads extending into the shelter boxes for 1
bushbaby and 2 marmoset enclosures. The heating pads were plugged in at the time and one has frayed edges that
indicates the animal may have chewed it. Exposed electrical cords pose a risk of injury to the animal if they bite into the
cord. A method must developed to prevent the animals from coming in direct contact with the electric cords to protect the
animals from injury.
