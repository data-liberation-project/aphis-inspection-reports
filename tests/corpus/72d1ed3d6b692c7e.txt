3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility uses wood shavings in the enclosures to absorb waste from the dogs. The unopened bags of shavings are
stored on top of bags of fertilizer. Storing bags of shavings on top of fertilizer could potentially cause contamination of the
shavings which may ultimately have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and
vermin infestation. The facility must move the bags of shavings to a location which eliminates the risk of any
contamination in order to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class "A" license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 17-October-2021 or the Applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.
