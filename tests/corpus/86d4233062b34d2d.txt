ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Anpawi" "Omaste", "Raz", & Gabriel" (tigers) have areas of small pea size to medium size wounds with pink to red
skin on their cheeks, legs, or armpits. These conditions may be attributed to excessive rubbing/irritation in these
areas and may have occurred during the transfer from the old location to the new one.
These conditions have been noted in the daily keeper records. There, however, is no documentation that these
animals conditions have been reported to the veterinarian and they are currently not receiving any treatments at this
time. Timely and frequent communication with the veterinarian is required to ensure that the animals are being
evaluated and provided treatment as determined by the veterinarian to alleviate pain & suffering.
The veterinarian indicated by telephone that he was unaware of these wounds. The veterinarian shall evaluate
these conditions and treat them based upon his diagnosis & professional judgement.
