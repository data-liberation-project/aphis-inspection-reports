3.26(b)

Facilities, indoor.
A strong ammonia odor was noticed upon entering hamster rooms #1 and #4. The rooms have fresh air vents in the
ceiling and rear exhaust fans, however, the air did not seem to be circulating adequately to clear the odor. The hamster
pans and bedding are cleaned at least weekly, and were last cleaned the previous Monday and Tuesday.
Failure to maintain adequate ventilation in hamster housing areas can have a negative impact on the overall air quality
which can be detrimental to the health and comfort of the animals.
Indoor housing facilities for hamsters shall be adequately ventilated to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation
while providing for the health and comfort of the animals at all times.
