HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.75(c)(3) Cleaning: The indoor portion of the enclosure housing five squirrel monkeys has an excessive
accumulation of feces and food waste adhering to the perches, branches and flat surfaces. The soiled surfaces
may promote the growth of bacteria and cause illness in the monkeys. The excreta may attract flies and produce an
odor. The hard surfaces in the squirrel monkey enclosure must be cleaned/sanitized at regular intervals to reduce
disease hazards, insects and odors.
