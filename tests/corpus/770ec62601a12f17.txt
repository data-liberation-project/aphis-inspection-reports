3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Heat lamps with exposed bulbs and lacking protective guards were found within two occupied primary enclosures
located in the whelping building. The lamps were on and within reach/contact height of two adult female dogs
occupying the enclosures.
Heat lamps with exposed heat lamp bulbs placed within contact reach of animals may present a burn or electrical
hazard to those animals held in the enclosures. Bulbs may additionally become broken and pose a sharp physical
hazard to the adult female dogs and their puppies.
All heat lamps need to be placed out of physical reach of animals or provided with guards to prevent direct contact
with animals within the enclosures.
