Facilities, general.
Welded wire strand flooring that separates two stack cages can allow urine and fecal waste to fall into the enclosure
directly below housing two chinchillas. At the time of inspection, no urine or fecal waste was observed in the feed being
offered or on any object in the bottom enclosure. The two chinchillas have access to uncontaminated potable water that
was being provided in a bottle that was hanging on the fence. Fecal waste or urine falling or collecting on anything in the
enclosure below could lead to a potential disease or health risks. Unsanitary conditions exists if fecal waste or urine falls
or collects in or on the feed container. Fecal waste or urine would contaminate the feed being offered to the chinchillas.
Feed containing a mixture of fecal waste or urine is no longer considered to be safe or healthy for the chinchillas to
consume. The licensee must provide for the regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food
wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Correct by 5/23/22.
