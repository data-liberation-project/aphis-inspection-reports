2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection rabbit M2170RF8 had crusty debris around the right eye, and the cornea appeared white. This
eye issue appeared to be present longer than a day, and that impression was confirmed by the attending veterinarian via
phone after inspection. At the time of inspection, the facility had not identified the rabbit as having a medical issue and
communicated with their veterinarian or initiated the treatment in the standard operating procedure approved by the
attending veterinarian. Daily observations to assess animal health and well being as well as timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health must be conveyed to attending veterinarian to ensure the welfare of the animals.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager.
