In a food preparation room, there is a moderate amount of clutter on the counter top. The presence of clutter may
impede the cleaning and sanitizing as required. Two cutting boards used in food preparation appeared worn and
should be replaced. Food preparation rooms, including cutting boards, counter tops and utensils, should be kept
clean and sanitized to facilitate the husbandry practices as required.
