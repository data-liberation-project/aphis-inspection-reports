2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The written program of veterinary care was not available for inspection. It appears that the AV was at the premises
on November of 2016 and a Muntjack was taken to a veterinary clinic on June 2017, so veterinary care has been
provided but a written PVC is not available for inspection as required by the regulations.
To be corrected by 7-30-2017.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The muntjack enclosure had accumulation of fecal material which increases the chances of animal contamination,
odors and disease hazards.
Primary enclosures shall be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent fecal accumulation and to reduce the chance
of contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
To be corrected by 7-20-2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
