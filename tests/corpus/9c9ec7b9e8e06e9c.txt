DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
During this inspection, the licensee stated that he moved 2 bears and a cougar from an exhibition in Ohio to an
unapproved site located in Indiana. The Indiana site was inspected on August 9, 2016 but was not compliant. The
inspection report from that date states “NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED FROM THIS SITE
UNTIL THIS SITE IS APPROVED”. All animal sites used for regulated purposes must be approved before use.
Failure to ensure all sites are approved makes it impossible to determine if facilities are in compliance with the
Animal Welfare Act and the supporting regulations. Correct this by ensuring all sites intended for regulated are
approved.
Correct from this day forward.
2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care for this facility is not current and lacks specific information. The PVC was
last signed by the attending veterinarian in July 2016. The program of veterinary care specifically lists the cougar
and the bear, but not the wolf. The sections addressing parasites and emergency care are blank. Additionally, the
euthanasia section lists "gun if down" as a primary method of euthanasia followed by "succumb." The boxes
pertaining to who will be responsible for euthanasia are not checked on the current PVC. This written PVC must be
complete and comprehensive enough that adequate guidance for the veterinary care of the animals is on hand to
ensure appropriate care for all animals at the facility. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the
attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has
accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing
a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although
there were portions 8 ft. high perimeter fence present surrounding the wolf enclosure, there was a gate and area
connected to an adjacent corn crib, approximately 6 foot tall, that had no preventives to stop an animal from
climbing or jumping over the perimeter fence. There were also two holes approximately 1 ft by 1 ft along the side
and back of the perimeter fence.A substantial perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair and not less than 8
feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that contain potentially dangerous animals. Perimeter
fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event of an accidental escape there is a secondary
containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the property and endangering public safety thereby
placing the animal(cid:25)'s life in jeopardy. Correct by ensuring there is an effective fence of at least 8 feet in height.

WATERING.
The water for the female wolf is greenish and cloudy. The sides of the water receptacle also had greenish build-up
and there was sediment on the bottom. This water receptacle requires cleaning. Failure to provide potable water
in a clean receptacle may lead to health problems in this animal. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining this water
receptacle in a sanitary condition.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The corn crib enclosure to which the wolf has access is excessively dirty. The floor along the walls of the enclosure
have a build-up of hair and fecal material. Multiple surfaces within the enclosure are rusted which further contributes
to the condition and build-up. Dirty conditions can contribute to odors inside enclosures as well as harbor potential
pathogens, exposing the animals contained therein to health risks and discomfort. Enclosures shall be kept clean in
order to facilitate professionally accepted husbandry practices associated with good health of the animals.
