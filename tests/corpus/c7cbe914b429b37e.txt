Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from 12:28-1:01 PM on
11-JAN-2023.

Upon arrival, the inspector noted the presence of one employee, who was occupied with customers. The inspector
proceeded to the front desk and attempted to contact the licensee via cell phone (at 12:28 PM), text message (at 12:34
PM), and email (at 12:44 PM). When the employee was available, she came to the front desk and also attempted to
contact the licensee. The employee explained that she would be unavailable to assist with the inspection due to pre-
existing customer reservations. The inspector received a text reply from the licensee at 12:48 PM. After attempting to
arrange another facility representative for the inspection, it was determined that no one would be available to accompany
the inspector that day. The inspector left the facility at 1:01 PM.
