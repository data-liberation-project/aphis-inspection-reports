(2) The use of appropriate methods...
***In the outdoor facility, there was an adult female Rottweiler identified as Natasha that had limited weight bearing
on her right front leg. The facility representative stated that it was not like that yesterday and that there had been
some compatibility issue with the two young Akitas in the next enclosure. They had not seen any compatibility
issues for sure with the Rottweilers, yet do not know of any other reason that this dog would be injured. Limited
weight bearing or non-weight bearing limbs are an indication of discomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the
risks of further deterioration if not properly diagnosed and treated or left if left unattended.
***There were two adult Mastiffs, one blue female identified as Betty and a fawn male identified as
#9810200019116 that had loose stool inside their primary enclosures. The facility representative stated that their
stool has been this way for a long time, that this situation had been discussed with the attending veterinarian some
time in the past and that the dogs are dewormed on a regular basis. Loose stools can be an indication of a
gastrointestinal problem, stress or discomfort. Left unattended any of these issues could worsen the health of the
animal.
The licensee understands that the Rottweiler identified as Natasha must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by
COB July 17, 2014 and follow any treatment plans. The licensee must contact a licensed veterinarian concerning
the loose stools in the two Mastiffs, follow any treatment plans and assure that all regulated animals are provided
with adequate veterinary care at all times as required.

(d) Pest control. ***In the outdoor facility, there were certain areas that contained an excessive amount of flies. Most of these were
seen on the back row on the south end. Fly traps and strips had been recently placed in the area, yet there were still
an abundance of flies. Pests carry diseases which increases the risks of contamination to the dogs, water and food
supply. The licensee must assure that measures are taken to reduce the flies and any other pests in the facility as
required.
To be corrected by 7/22/14.
