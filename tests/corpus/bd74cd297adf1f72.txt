3.26(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There are still areas on the floor where the white finish is worn or scratched off and the unsealed particle board is
present.The floor in the guinea pig room must be impervious to moisture so that the floor can be repeatedly cleaned
and disinfected and will not retain odors. The floor must be repaired, sealed, or replaced where the white coating is
worn or scratched off so that the floor can be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized. Remains uncorrected.
3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The guinea pig enclosures still have severely chewed edges on the PVC pipe that surrounds the automatic water
valves. The 72 enclosures currently in use have chewed edges on the PVC pipe that surrounds the water valve.
The chewed edges could injure the guinea pig while it drinks and the chewed edges makes cleaning and sanitation
more difficult. Improperly sanitized surfaces can expose the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi,
and parasites. Primary enclosures including accessories shall be constructed of smooth materials, be structurally
sound, and be maintained in good repair to prevent injury. Correct by replacing or repairing the chewed PVC pipes
that surrounds the automatic water valve. Remains uncorrected.
3.30
WATERING.
There were accumulations of dirt and debris by the automatic water valves and the PVC pipes around the water
valves. The water pipes and drainage pipes have accumulations of debris, grime, and dust. These accumulations
on the water valves and surrounding PVC pipes can expose the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria,
fungi, and parasites. Inadequate cleaning and sanitation of the water valves and surrounding pipes can result in
contamination and health problems of the guinea pig colony. Correct by keeping the water valves, water lines and
PVC pipes clean to ensure the health and well-being of the guinea pigs. Correct by November 9, 2016.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures. Guinea pig enclosures are not being cleaned adequately or often
enough to remove accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, debris and stains. There were accumulations of
excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, urine stains, and grime on the sides and floors of enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and
sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacteria, fungal, and parasites. Primary enclosure must
be cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, urine stains and grime.
Enclosures must be sanitized at least once very 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept
clean and sanitized often enough to prevent accumulation of excreta and debris. Additionally, ensure that all primary
enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by November 9, 2016.
