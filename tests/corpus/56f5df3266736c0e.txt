Facilities, general.
There are at least 22 enclosures, containing approximately 66 raccoons, which are covered with plastic tarps. The
raccoons have pulled parts of the plastic tarps into the enclosures resulting in the ends of the tarps becoming severely
shredded and frayed. The frayed edges of the tarps could cause the raccoons' digits to become entangled and ingestion
of the plastic material could be a health concern.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
licensee must remove the plastic tarps from inside the enclosures and ensure that all materials used for the raccoon
enclosures are appropriate to protect the health and safety of the animals at all times.

One nest box, containing 3 skunks, has a saturated wooden floor. One corner of the floor is peeling away and has an
approximately 1.5 by 2 inch hole. Structurally unsound floors could allow an animal to escape or become injured.

Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and

to contain the animals. The licensee must repair, replace, or alter the damaged flooring in a manner that eliminates the
risk of animal escape and injury. All housing facilities must be maintained in good repair at all times in order to protect the
health and well-being of the animals.
