3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
A portion of the perimeter fence for the facility is less than 3ft in distance from the enclosure fencing for one Red
Kangaroo. The current perimeter fence in that area is constructed of aluminum approximately 8 feet in height. The fence
must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between the animals
inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. It may be determined that the current
construction of the perimeter fence and enclosure fencing effectively prevents people and animals from entering the
facility; however, the facility must obtain written approval for such a determination from the USDA APHIS Animal Care
Administrator, as per subsections under 3.127(d).
