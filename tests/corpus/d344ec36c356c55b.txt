3.80(b)(2)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In building 7A there were seven enclosures each housing two rhesus weighing at least 1.76 kg. Four of these 14
monkeys were greater than 3 kg. These enclosures measured 26 x24 inches, and provided approximately 4.3
square feet of floor space. Each of the two non-human primates weighing between 1 -3 kg require a minimum of 3.0
square feet of floor space, and those greater than 3 kg require at least 4.3 square feet each. These enclosures do
not provide enough floor space for the animals housed within.
Additionally, In building 7A there were two enclosures each housing two rhesus. These enclosures measured 25 x
27
inches, and provided approximately 4.7 square feet of floor space. Three of the monkeys were greater than 3 kg in
weight. Each of these non-human primates require a minimum of 4.3 square feet of floor space for these animals
weight ranges. These enclosures do not provide enough floor space for the animals housed within.
Animals which are housed in enclosures that do not provide the minimum amount of floor space may experience
additional stress, resulting in potential fighting and/ or other behaviors which may deem the pair incompatible. The
facility must provide the appropriate amount of floor space required for animals to ensure there is enough space for
normal postural adjustments and for the animals to exhibit typical species behavior to facilitate social housing
situations.
The facility has been previously cited under 3.80 (b) (2) (iv) on November 12, 2013, August 12, 2013, May 21,
2013,and April 11, 2013.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.
