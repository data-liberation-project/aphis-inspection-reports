2.33(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Two Yucatan pigs (numbers 1123 & 4515) had overgrown hooves, and their hooves had not been trimmed since 3
February 2022. The previous hoof trim had been 4 November 2022, but this frequency is not adequate to maintain the
hooves at a normal length. The failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases or
injuries may negatively impact the well-being and quality of life of the animals. The facility should ensure that all animals
receive appropriate veterinary care, including hoof trimming as often as necessary.
