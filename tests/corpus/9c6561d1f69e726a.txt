Facilities, general.
Storage. There is spilled guinea pig feed on the floor underneath and around pallets. Bags of corn and other feed are
stacked on the floor along one wall. Food and bedding supplies must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such
supplies against spoilage, deterioration, infestation, or contamination by vermin. Stacking food supplies directly on the
floor and along walls can provide hiding and nesting areas for rodents. Spilled feed on the floor can attract rodents and
other pests. Licensee must ensure that food supplies are adequately protected from contamination by pests. Correct by
storing feed off the floor and away from walls to discourage rodents and cleaning floors regularly to remove spilled feed.
Correct by January 14, 2023.
