MISCELLANEOUS.
On September 20 2012, a 2 week old, male rhesus monkey, animal #529 was found dead with a laundry bag cord
wrapped around its neck. Three empty laundry bags had been placed on top of a hamper and were within reach of
the monkey . The animal was able to access a laundry bag cord by reaching through its enclosure.
Handling of animals includes appropriate care that will protect the animals from harm and ensure their safety.
Animal care and handling must be done as carefully as possible to prevent behavioral stress, physical harm,
trauma or unnecessary discomfort. The facility failed to provide a safe environment for this monkey, resulting in
physical harm, trauma and ultimately death.
Corrective measures have been implemented by the facility including removal of all laundry bags from animal
rooms, re-training of personnel and re-location to a new animal facility.
Correct by: Future handling must include adequate provisions for animal safety and protection.

Exit interview conducted with the executive director of animal care operations and the director of research
compliance.
