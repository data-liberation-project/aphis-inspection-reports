3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence between the sheep enclosure and one of the horse enclosures was in poor repair. Two horizontal boards
were not attached to the vertical post at one end. The metal fence panels in that section were bowed out as if the
sheep had attempted to push through.
The sheep could become stuck or be injured if they attempted to go through this area. Facilities must be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
