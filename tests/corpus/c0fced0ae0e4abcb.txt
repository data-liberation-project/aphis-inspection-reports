3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility's current cleaning frequency did not effectively eliminate the accumulation of feces and insect activity. The
feces was producing strong odors and attracted large groupings of flies that then could be seen within food bowls. The
facility must increase their cleaning frequency to reduce the accumulation of feces and odors that attract insect pests.
Additionally, accumulations of feces can present disease hazards to the health and well-being of the nonhuman primates.

3.78(d)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The perimeter fence was not structurally intact at the time of inspection. The back portion of the fence had been removed
to allow for construction of a new enclosure. Additionally, an enclosure had been constructed less than 3ft away from the
perimeter fence. A perimeter fence that is not maintained in good repair can allow unwanted animals and persons to enter
the facility and potentially harm the nonhuman primates within. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it
protects the nonhuman primates in the facility by restricting unauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks
and raccoons from going through it or under it and having contact with the nonhuman primates.

3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At the time of inspection, the vegetation adjacent to the perimeter fencing on one side of the property was overgrown and
obscured the lower portion of the fence. This made it difficult to walk the perimeter fence and confirm if the fence was
structurally intact. Housing facilities must be free of any accumulation of weeds. The vegetation along the perimeter fence
should be managed so that the fencing can be checked for structural deficiencies or evidence of pest activity. Additionally,
overgrowth of vegetation may harbor pests.

3.84(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was an excessive presence of insect pests in and around animal enclosures. The insects were congregating on
accumulations of animal feces and in food bowls. Insect pests can carry parasites and various diseases that could
compromise the health and well-being of nonhuman primates. Although the facility does spray for pests on the opposite
side of the property (where no regulated species reside), there were no other additional measures being used for pest
control. Licensees are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective program for controlling pests so as to
promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
