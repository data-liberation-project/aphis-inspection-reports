FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
* The primary enclosure fence, for the two camels, two sheep and eight goats, is sagging in areas between the
posts. The mesh wire was rolled over from the top and tangled together in areas. The smooth wire is not tight and
sagging between the posts. The fencing is not securely fastened along the top to the posts. The fencing is not in
good repair and is not maintained. This could allow for the animals to escape or get tangled in the wire from
escaping, resulting in possible injury. All outdoor facilities for the animals must be maintained and kept in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter Fence.
* There is no perimeter fence around the enclosure housing the two camels. The outdoor enclosure, housing the
camels, must have a perimeter fence at least six feet high and a minimum distance of three feet from the primary
enclosure fence. A perimeter fence will provide protection to the camels by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence
can function as a secondary containment system for the camels in the facility.
