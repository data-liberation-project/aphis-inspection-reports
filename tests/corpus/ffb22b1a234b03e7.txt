2.50(a)(2)(iii)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The weaned puppies were being identified by color coded fabric collars, but the puppies pulled all of these off and
currently only one puppy is still wearing one of these collars. The puppies need to be individually identified with
collars which contain the wording USDA, 56-A-0139, and that puppy's individual identification. Identification is
required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping
requirements. To be corrected by 9-30-16.
2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since obtaining her license, the licensee has not been keeping records of the puppies on APHIS 7005, only using
the APHIS 7006s when the puppies were sold. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that
each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. From this day
forward, all weaned puppies need to be recorded on the APHIS 7006 and those records kept for a year after the
puppies are gone from the premises. To be corrected by 9-30-16.
