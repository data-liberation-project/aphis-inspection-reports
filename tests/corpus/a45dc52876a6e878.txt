ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Prince, a female cream and white Shih Tzu (#185 DOB 6/30/09) had a white raised cloudy spot covering about half
of the external surface of the eye. The dog pulled away and turned its head when I got near it even to check the
teeth. This behavior is consistent with the eye being painful. The licensee did not know when this began, and said
they have treated something similar in the dog in the past.
Eye injuries and/or diseases can be painful, and deteriorate quickly if left untreated. The licensee must have the
dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, and follow the treatment plan prescribed by the veterinarian.
TO BE CORRECTED: A facility representative contacted the veterinarian and scheduled an appointment before the
inspection concluded.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and ACI Bartels.
