CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Several of the feeders need to be cleaned. Areas underneath the lip of the feeder had a layer of grime and
debris and the area where the feeder curves to the lip had food that was getting trapped and beginning to stick
together. These feeders need to be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks to prevent an accumulation of grime and
debris. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.
