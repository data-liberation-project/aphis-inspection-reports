REGISTRATION.
On April 11th from 11:30am - 12:30pm I arrived to conduct a routine inspection of Explora Biolabs at the Sorrento
Valley address. The signs directed me to a locked door, and when I tried calling the number in the file there was
only a directory. After trying to call, I proceeded to the additional site in Pacific Beach. At the Pacific Beach site, the
security guard informed me that there is vivarium space at that site, but the offices had moved last September. He
was able to reach the company and they provided the new address for the offices and vivarium space.

ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as a research facility, within 10 days after making such
change. Explora biolabs, as a research entitiy, must notify the AC Regional Director, by certified mail, of its change
in name, address, ownership and operation to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations and
standards.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol involving covered species did not contain an adequate rationale for the numbers of
animals to be used for that activity. The protocol stated that 240 animals would be used but there was no rationale
provided for why these were the numbers needed to make the procedures valid. An explanation is needed to justify
these numbers.
The rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals to be used in a study is an important component of
protocols that utilize animals. The rationale approved by the IACUC should provide assurance that the appropriate
number of animals is being used to obtain the information the activity is designed to provide. In addition to assuring
that the minimum number of animals is used to obtain the desired information, the rationale should also ensure that
enough animals are used to make the activity worthwhile. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that proposals to conduct activities in ongoing protocols involving
animals contain rationales that explain the appropriateness of the number of animals to be used in those activities.
Correct for all future protocols, renewals and amendments.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
