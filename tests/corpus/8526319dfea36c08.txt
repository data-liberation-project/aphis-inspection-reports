ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- Numerous buffalo in the drive through area of the park had red, open sores on their flanks, bellies, and backs.
These lesions were roughly circular, appeared to primarily affect adult animals, and tended to be no more than a
few centimeters in diameter. Some animals only had single lesions, while others had a cluster of sores. Many
animals had winged insects on and around these lesions. Many animals were scratching, moving, and rubbing on
or around these affected areas. The cause of these sores is unknown, and the facility is currently not treating the
lesions. Open sores are a clear health problem, may lead to secondary infections or other complications and are
indicators of distress or discomfort to the affected animals. The facility must contact a licensed veterinarian within
24 hours of this date to determine the cause of these sores, and then develop an appropriate treatment plan. The
facility must maintain written documentation of the veterinary consultation, and must be able to demonstrate
compliance with the treatment plan.

SANITATION.
- The buffalo herd in the drive through area of the park was covered with a large amount of winged insects.
Numerous animals appeared to be bothered by these insects, consistently attempting to dislodge the pests by
stamping, scratching, and moving. The park's current pest control program consists of several "rubs" located at
mineral block deposits in different areas of the park. These "rubs" are suspended several feet above the ground
and are impregnated with a permethrin designed to stick to the animals when they make contact with the rub.
However, the park is a very large facility and there are no more than 5 rubs covering this large area of land. Current
pest control practices do not appear adequate to control the insects infesting the buffalo. Insects are a nuisance to
affected animals, and may impact the health and well being of the animals.
The facility must develop and document a plan to control pests throughout the facility. This plan must detail steps
the facility is taking, and must account for any animals which are being particularly affected by insects and pests.
