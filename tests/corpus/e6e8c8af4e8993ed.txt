INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The following reviewed protocols do not contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals:
*Review of records and conversations with lab personnel for protocol M/07/258 show that a refraction procedure
involving the use of contact lenses and the routine post operative administration of Cerenia and Vitamin B-12
injections are not included in the IACUC approved version of the protocol.
*Review of pig anesthesia records for protocol M/14/154 show that general anesthesia is being performed in some
instances with isoflurane and others with sevoflurane. The IACUC approved version of the protocol includes only
isoflurane.
Protocols must include a complete description of the proposed use of animals to allow the IACUC and veterinary
reviewers to do a thorough review of the protocol. All proposals to conduct an activity involving animals must
contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. Correct by Nov. 30, 2016.
2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Two incidences involving a lack of timely communication between individuals making observations about animal
health and well-being issues and the attending veterinarian were identified during this inspection. Both incidences
were reviewed and addressed by the iACUC immediately after they occurred.
*A rabbit kicked its hind legs and vocalized loudly during anesthetic induction with injectable drugs at 7:55 am. The
researchers proceeded with the surgery and post operative records at 12:30 and 13:30 state that the "legs are
paralyzed". The postoperative analgesic was noted given at 18:30. A veterinarian was not contacted until the
following morning at which time the veterinarian recommended euthanasia.
*A galago recovered from a craniotomy surgery and study procedure (over 12 hour duration total) conducted under
general anesthesia sooner than anticipated and prior to the administration of the postoperative analgesic. The
researchers did not give the analgesic injection as the animal became agitated and aggressive after another post
operative medication injection. The researchers did not call a veterinarian for guidance. The following morning (8
hrs later) the vet tech gave an analgesic injection and contacted the veterinarian. The veterinarian evaluated the
animal 1 3/4 hours later and stated there were no health or well-being issues. Observations regarding problems of animal health, behavior and well-being may be accomplished by someone
other than the attending veterinarian but all such issues must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner to ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care. The facility shall maintain a program of
adequate veterinary care that includes a mechanism of direct and timely communication on problems of animal
health, behavior and well being to the attending veterinarian. Correct from this day forward.
2.33(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Protocol M/07/258 includes the use of multiple anesthetics and a neuromuscular blocking drug (NMB). Review of
the protocol shows that the intra-operative monitoring includes heart rate, respiratory rate and CO2 done every 10
minutes. During the use of the NMBs a ventilator is used. One record, for galago 7-14-1, shows that the NMB and
anesthetic were discontinued within the same 10 minute time block on the monitoring chart. There is no record of
specifically when the NMB was discontinued, the method used to confirm that the NMB was no longer effective prior
to reducing the anesthesia, when the animal returned to spontaneous breathing and when the anesthetic was
discontinued. Lab personnel stated that the discontinuation of the NMB and the waking of the animal occurred
almost simultaneously. They stated this happened so quickly that the personnel were not able to give the required
post-operative analgesic. Further conversation elicited the information that the research personnel were monitoring
anesthesia depth during NMB use with "heart rate and withdrawal reflex".
The appropriate use of NMB under anesthesia is critical to ensure that the animals do not feel any pain during the
procedure. The facility must ensure that investigators and other personnel involved in handling, immobilization,
anesthesia, and analgesia are given appropriate guidance to ensure these procedures are done appropriately.
