2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The current signed program of veterinary care (PVC) does not reflect current practices at the facility and needs to
be updated. The parasite control section does not include all the drugs being used. The facility is mixing together
several products (including fenbendazole and pyrantel) to administer for routine deworming to puppies and is also
administering Marquis routinely as an off label drug to all puppies. Some of the transfer bottles that hold the
mixtures are currently not labeled and there is no way to determine what drugs exactly are in the bottle. The PVC
only mentions pyrantel for routine deworming of puppies. In addition, the broker's instructions for the facility include
the routine administration of Draxxin to the puppies. This off-label drug use is not in the PVC.
The attending veterinarian needs to approve all routine preventative medications administered by the facility
including those recommended to the facility by the broker to ensure that the drugs are safely administered to the
puppies. The veterinarian needs to approve the use of all drugs and include directions (dose, route of administration
and frequency of administration) in the written program of veterinary care. All transfer containers shall be labeled
with drug information.
*The current PVC does not include any written dental care plan for the dogs. Several of the dogs are in need of
dental care. A written dental plan needs to be developed with the attending veterinarian to help address the care of
dogs with dental issues. The written PVC shall include a dental health plan that addresses monitoring of teeth,
preventative measures and treatment of dental disease.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three dogs were identified as requiring veterinary attention during this inspection:
*One female red and white Cocker Spaniel (microchip #0A01447166) was noted to have some thick tan material
adhered to her right eyelid margins. The white part of her right eye is very red. The colored part of her right eye has
a slightly bluish haze to it. There is section of reddish tissue swollen in the bottom inner corner of her right eye. In
addition, she has large amounts of tan brown tarter covering her teeth with her back teeth not visible due to the
amount of tarter. Her gums are redder than normal.
*One male white maltese (0A01535107) was noted licking his lips a lot. He has a large amount of tan brown tarteron his teeth. His gums are red and swollen. There is some white/light tan material adhered to junction of the gums
and back teeth on both sides. Several of his teeth are missing.
*One white with brown on the head female French bulldog was noted with skin and ear problems. The skin on the
inside of both ears was red, swollen and thickened. Scabs were scattered on the skin on the inside of the ears
where she has been scratching at the ears. A brown black debris was noted in the ear canals. The ear canals
themselves were extremely narrowed. She has several areas of sparse hair on her body including her
flanks/hindquarters and her feet. The skin of these areas is reddened. The owner reports she was diagnosed with
demodex about six months ago and had been treated. The storage room held an old rusted container of Taktic with
a manufacturer date of 2007. The only directions on the bottle were the manufacturer's for large animal species.
These three dogs are not currently on any treatment plan. These dogs need to be examined by a veterinarian to
ensure that a diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is instituted. Correct by 3/19/2017.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The puppy and adult acquisition records (7005 forms) are currently not complete.
*The puppies do not have a unique individual identification number.
*The adult dogs' 7005 forms are missing the date of birth, date of acquisition, name and address from whom they
were acquired and the USDA license number or driver's license and vehicle tag state/number if they don't have a
USDA license number. The owner has some of this information on other records such as health certificates but has
not transferred the information to the 7005.
Dog acquisition records must be complete in order to correctly individually identify all puppies and dogs and for
medical and legal traceback purposes. The 7005 forms must be complete and include all required information.
Correct by 4/8/17.
3.6(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The sheltered housing for adult dogs in the back barn needs repair. The wood pieces surrounding the doggie doors
and the posts near the doggie doors on the outside runs are worn. The wood is black and soft in places and is no
longer impervious to moisture. The wood of posts is also no longer impervious to moisture and is showing some
green algae like material growing on it. All surfaces in contact with the dogs need to be impervious to moisture so
that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 5/30/17. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
