CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The room next to the whelping area has several empty cages and runs that are still full of dirt and debris including
mouse droppings, old food and other dirt detritus. It is important that all areas around the regulated animals are kept
clean and free of debris and clutter that can be a source of contamination to the food or primary living area of the
regulated animals. The clutter and debris in the old cages next to the open area of the whelping enclosures is a
place where vermin and flies can live and be a source of disease exposure and possible health issues if not cleaned
out.
The licensee must clean out the empty enclosures of the old materials, dirt and debris and keep the room clean and
free of mice and other vermin that can be housed or feed in that area, in order to protect the regulated animals living
within feet of that area.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the whelping room there are two open windows without screens or the ability to close that allows free access of
flies into the whelping pens. There were hundreds of flies in the room along the walls, feeders and wire tops above
the puppies. Currently there is no pest control being used to control the flies in the facility. It is important to keep
flies and other pests from contaminating the facility in order to decrease the exposure of possible health risks and
disease transmission. Flies can spread disease when in contact with the food, water and living area of the regulated
animals.
The licensee must incorporate some sort of fly control in the facility to decrease the numbers of flies that have
contact with the regulated animals.
