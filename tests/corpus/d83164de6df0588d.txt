2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female 4 year old white Standard Poodle (microchip # 075091294) had small wounds on three legs. The wounds
were located on the lower part of both forelimbs and the right rear limb. The wounds were open, irregularly shaped
areas with hair loss that were superficial, and varied in size with the largest about 2 cm in diameter. The skin was
moderately reddened with no drainage. Both licensees stated that they had not noticed or treated the wounds prior
to the inspectors identifying the issue.
Lack of adequate veterinary care can cause pain and discomfort, and can lead to other veterinary care issues. The
licensee must identify, prevent, diagnose and treat injury and disease. A licensed veterinarian must evaluate this
animal for an accurate diagnosis, and to develop a treatment plan. Documentation regarding diagnosis, treatment
plan, treatments given, and the resolution of the problem must be maintained and made available to inspectors
upon request.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with licensees, ACI Bartels, VMO Cole and IDALS.
