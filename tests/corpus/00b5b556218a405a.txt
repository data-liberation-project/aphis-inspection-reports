While moving a rabbit from an inside enclosure to an outside enclosure on 12-26-2014, the employee lost control of
the rabbit and the rabbit escaped. This demonstrates a lack of experience in the ability to handle animals in a safe
manner that protects animals from injury or escape. Current employees with the most longevity need to ensure the
daily observation and husbandry practices of all animals. The licensee may need additional employees or additional
training of current employees to maintain compliance and ensure the health and welfare of the animals.
