SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Surfaces in contact with dogs must be impervious to moisture. The particle board siding on the inside of the
sheltered facility where dogs are in contact with, is not impervious to moisture. The owner stated the board siding
had not been seal or painted. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be cleaned and sanitized
properly. The owner must make the particle board/wood surfaces that are in contact with dogs impervious to
moisture. This will help in the good health and best care for the dogs in this sheltered facility. Correct by
