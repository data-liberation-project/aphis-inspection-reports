HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "lean to" portion of the red barn are six pens along the east wall of the structure. When entering from the
north end of this room the first, second and fourth pens containing a total of four dogs have one "bedding
containment" board in each pen that shows evidence of chewing. Surfaces and items that the dogs come in contact
with must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be repaired
or replaced when worn or damaged.
