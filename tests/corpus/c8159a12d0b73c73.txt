2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The facility has added a sugar glider to their exhibit animals. The written program of veterinary care has not been
updated to include this new species.
*The new written program of veterinary care lacks sufficient detail. It does not contain the attending veterinarian's
recommendations for routine preventative care (to include any vaccinations and parasite prevention etc.) or
euthanasia if needed for any of the species housed at the facility.
Failure to provide sufficient detail/recommendations may lead to a lack of delivery of adequate veterinary care to the
animals.
Additional detail shall be added to the PVC in the following areas for all mammalian species housed at the facility:
routine preventative care (including vaccinations and parasite prevention) and euthanasia. Correct by Oct. 16, 2014.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
