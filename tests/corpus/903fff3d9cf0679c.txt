Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Expired heartworm preventative (Interceptor Plus tablets) was present at the time of inspection. A plastic baggie
containing several individual sealed packaging pods of the 50-100 lb. size of Interceptor Plus included both expired
tablets and tablets still in date. A person grabbing a tablet pod package could inadvertently administer an expired tablet.
Expired medications may no longer be effective. All medications including heartworm preventative tablets must be in date
to be considered appropriate methods to prevent, control and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by 4/28/22.
2.50(b)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
Three adult (over 4 months old) dogs housed at the facility at the time of inspection were not officially identified. They
were not wearing a collar with tag. When asked if the dogs had microchips for identification the inspector was told no. All
dogs must be officially identified in order to be able to legally identify each dog, to coordinate records/care and to help in
the return of dogs in the event they get loose. All dogs held shall be immediately identified when obtained by the use of an
official tag with collar, a microchip or a tattoo approved by Animal Care.
3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.


Several metal sections of the dog runs are covered with pitted/rough rust. These sections include the black small mesh
frames added to the front of the enclosures to keep small puppies from escaping through the chain link fencing and the
bottom bar of the enclosure door of the two enclosures furthest from the entry to the facility. Pitted, rough rusted surfaces
cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized and may hide damage to the metal structure itself. Interior metal surfaces
and those that come in contact with the dogs must be free of rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization or
that affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct by 7/15/22.

The dog facility was inspected with the caretaker.
The records inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
