PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures where dogs are present must be kept in good repair. The wire flooring that dogs walk on must
be covered/coated with a material such as plastic or fiberglass if wire is less than 1/8 inch (9 gauge). The wire
flooring of the outside runs on the Sundowner like kennel where dogs walk and exercise have chips, worn spots,
and areas of bare wire. The bare wire in these areas are smaller than 9 gauge. The breeder must repair or replace
these areas of bare wire. Good flooring that meets the regulations of the Animal Welfare Act. (AWA) will help in the
good health and well-being of the dogs in these areas. Correct by 05-03-2017.
