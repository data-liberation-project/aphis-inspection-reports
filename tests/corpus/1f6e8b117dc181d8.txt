2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following dogs are in need of veterinarian care.
* One adult male Sheba (microchip number 448 793 780 ) has a swollen mass of tissue between the middle toes
on the right rear foot. The dog was unable to place any weight on this foot during the facility inspection. The
swollen area had a puffy feel when touched. Swollen tissue can be painful and could potentially affect the mobility
and daily activity of this dog.
*******************************
* One adult female Labrador Retriever (microchip number 079 275 569 ) has a swollen mass of tissue between
the middle toes on the right front and rear feet. Both feet had a puffy feel when touched. The skin had a reddish
looking color to it. Swollen tissue can be painful and could potentially affect the mobility and daily activity of this
dog.
* One adult female Elkhound (microchip number 048 306 812) has a swollen mass of tissue between the middle
toes on the right rear foot. The foot had a puffy feel when touched. The skin had a reddish looking color to it.
Swollen tissue can be painful and could potentially affect the mobility and daily activity of this dog.
****************************************************
* One adult female Siberian Husky ( microchip number 070 805 383 ) was observed limping and placing little
weight on the left front leg. The dog was observed holding the foot up an estimated 50 to 60 percent of a two to
three minute period. The licensee stated that this was the first time the limp had been noticed. At the time of
inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted. Foot problems can be painful when the dog has to
place weight on the foot affecting the mobility and daily activity of the dog.
******************************** One adult female German Shepard ( microchip number 033 264 621 ) has an open wound on the top of its left
ear. The wound was moist, reddened and inflamed and covered approximately one third of the surface area of the
ear. In addition, there was a yellowish, creamy looking discharge around the edge of the wound. The licensee has
permission to treat wounds with antibiotics from the attending veterinarian and is doing so. There was a large,
crusty scab on the ear before the licensee restrained the dog for inspection. The licensee per their attending
veterinarian recommendation is treating the wound with antibiotic ointment. The licensee stated that the wound first
appeared on 9/1/14. The dog had not been examined by a licensed veterinarian at the time of inspection and the
wound is still open, moist and inflamed. An open wound can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the
spread of infection which affects the health and well-being of the dog.
The licensee must have all five dogs examined by a licensed veterinarian by 9/11/14 in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis and treatment of the foot is provided. Any medical records must be made available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care to ensure the
health and well-being of the dogs.
***************************
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There was one 250 mg bottle of
Chloramphenicol pills with an expiration date of 12/1012. There was one 250 mg bottle of Amoxicillin pills with an
expiration date of 05/2014. These medications were intermingled with other products that are currently being used
at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not
considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The
effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be drastically
changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that all medications used have not gone past
the recorded expiration date.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Welded wire fencing attached to enclosure wall board is bent and has become detached from the wall board
creating an estimated three to five inch gap. One dog and five puppies are in contact with the affected area. This
could lead to puppies getting caught in the gap area and potential injury. The licensee must ensure all enclosure
fencing is kept in good repair to protect the dog from potential injury and contain the dog securely at all times.
********************************
* A two to three inch gap was observed at the top of one enclosure gate. The gap exists because the gate does
not securely close against the wood board frame it is attached to. Four dogs are in contact with the affected arealocated in outdoor housing. The potential for injury or discomfort exists if any dog gets caught in the affected area.
The licensee must ensure all enclosure fencing is kept in good repair to protect the dog from potential injury and
contain the dog securely at all times.
* Both NCI's correct by 9/22/14.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on an estimated 10 fiberglass wall boards. The enclosures
are located in the whelp trailer building. Ten dogs are in contact with the affected wall boards. The affected area
covers approximately 20 to 30 percent of the wall surface. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an
accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. It indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead
to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are cleaned daily and sanitized at
least once every two weeks or more often if needed. Correct by 9/10/14.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* An estimated five outdoor enclosures housing ten dogs have limited shade available for the dogs to have access
to. All enclosures have shelter housing placed under the shade area limiting the area that the dogs have access to
shade. Lack of adequate shade from the direct rays of the sun can be stressful causing discomfort and make
conditions dangerous for potential overheating. The dog does not have the ability to regulate its internal
temperature and could potential become overheated. The licensee must ensure that shade is provided and be
large enough to contain all the dogs at one time is necessary for the health and well-being of all the dogs.
***************************
* An estimated six outside enclosures containing 18 dogs have inadequate shelter. Each enclosure has only one
shelter structure being provided for the dogs to have access to. A lack of adequate protection from the elements
could potentially cause stress and discomfort because of inadequate shelter. The licensee must ensure that the
shelter structures are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely.
* Both NCI's correct by 9/22/14.3.9(b)
FEEDING.
* The trough area of one plastic food receptacle has a jagged, roughened, chewed surface with a sharp edge.
The receptacle is attached to an enclosure gate located in outdoor housing Two dogs are in contact with the
receptacle. The sharp, jagged edge could potentially cause injury and it prevents the cleaning and sanitation of this
receptacle. The chewed, roughened surface could harbor bacteria and other disease causing agents that can affect
the health and wellbeing of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that this and all receptacles can be properly
cleaned and sanitized at all times. Correct by 9/2/14.
*********************
* An estimated two feed receptacles used by four dogs have grime or rust collecting in the trough area. Surfaces
could harbor bacteria and other disease causing agents that can affect the health and wellbeing of the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that this and all receptacles can be properly cleaned and sanitized at all times. Correct by
9/2/14.
* The facility inspection done on 9/8/14 and exit briefing done on 9/9/14 were conducted with the licensee.
