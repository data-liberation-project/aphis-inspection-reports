HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One of the two female capuchins is occasionally taken out of their enclosure for public exhibition. This was a hand
reared capuchin who has worn a smooth link waist chain most of her life. The waist chain has a 10-12 inch catch
leash. Although the loose chain has not caused any known problems, the chain was observed to be disturbing to
the capuchin in that it is carrying the end of the chain with its tail. Because the length of the chain is causing
unnecessary discomfort or may become entangled within the enclosure, it needs to be removed or shortened to the
shortest length possible to still easily hand restrain the capuchin, but allow the capuchin to move freely without the
chain altering her movements or becoming entangled. To be corrected by 8-8-14.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. In the chute leading to a denbox for the bear Nikolai, part of the 4X4 heavy metal wire is missing
leaving a hole and one piece of wire poking up. The bear was pushing its face out of this hole and rubbing against
the broken wire. The hold needs to be repaired.
At the back of the ibex enclosure in the park the chain link is loose at the bottom of the fence in two areas leaving
gaps where the ibex and three deer could potentially get entrapped & injure themselves. This part of the fence
needs to be secured to prevent entrapment and injury.
In the cougar enclosure on the left (from the public's view), a 2 X 4 ceiling support board is loose at one end and
hanging down into the enclosure. The board needs to be repaired and any other loose boards secured.
The metal roof for the wildebeest barn shelter has multiple holes in a linear pattern. This is allowing rainwater to
wet the shelter floor. The roof needs to be repaired or replaced to prevent water entry.
In the safari area on the small hill where the deer often lay, a chain link tree guard is damaged and some wires are
protruding posing a potential injury hazard. The loose wires need to be repaired or removed. Two prairie dogs were placed on a small island in the main pond of the inside area of the park. The prairie dogs
swam to the adjacent island where 3 brown lemurs live. Because it is known that these prairie dogs can swim and
could leave this island, they need to be moved to a different enclosure where they can be securely contained.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter Fence: A two part gate leading to the service road from the parking area has been damaged and now
has a triangular gap between the poles. This gate is also over a foot off of the ground leaving too much space
between the ground and the lower portion of the fence to keep unwanted animals out. To the right of this gate there
is a gap large enough for a person to walk easily between the gate and the side fence. Two dog size holes have
been dug out and the wire pushed up on the perimeter fence along this same service road.
In the large enclosure behind the big cat den boxes, the perimeter fence has been pushed down along the top in
two places.

SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures. There is an excess accumulation of old (ash colored) feces and a rotted chicken piece in
the enclosure containing a tiger and the lion, Daktari. The barn shelter for the two wildebeests has a layer of fecal
pellets across the gravel floor.in such quantity that there would not be a clean areas for these animals to lie down.
There is also moldy rotted food and some feces is in the concrete den shelter for the female bear separated by
hotwire from the male bear. All enclosures need to be cleaned of feces and food wastes on a regular basis to
prevent excess accumulations, provide a clean surface to walk and lie down on, and to reduce disease hazards,
pests, and odors.
