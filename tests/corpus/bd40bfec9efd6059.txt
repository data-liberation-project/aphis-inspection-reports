DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
- The drive through area of the park is currently open for visitors, but is not an approved site. Site 002 (drive through
site) is not a valid site and must be in complete compliance with all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act prior to being
used for regulated activity.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, a rhinoceros, a tiger and a lion, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals might
negatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office with written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle
these animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site
can be approved for regulated activity.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- Pepsi cups full of feed are sold at the gift shop for members of the public to give to the animals. The drive through
area of the park had members of the public driving their cars through and feeding animals through open vehicle
windows. There were no park employees present during this public/animal interaction. Unsupervised contact
between animals and members of the public poses a potential risk both to the health of the animals, and the welfare
of the public. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable park employee or attendant must be present at
all times during periods of public contact.
