2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC (Institutional Care and Use Committe) approved protocol utilizing a regulated species did not contain any
rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals to be used in the study. The only reference to animal
numbers in the protocol was a statement that 10 animals would be needed every two months for the maintenance of
hookworm life cycle. No animal numbers were provided for other aspects of the activity.
An adequate rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals and the species being used must be
included
in each protocol in order that the IACUC may review the rationale and make decisions regarding approval of the
activity.

2.31(e)(3)INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol using a regulated species did not contain a complete description of the proposed use
of the animals. The protocol did not include any details as to how the animals were to be used in the study. Details,
such as how the animals are to be infected and monitored, should be included in the protocol prior to IACUC
approval.
The IACUC is responsible for reviewing all aspects of animal care and use, and for evaluating protocols in order to
ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. In order to properly accomplish this function, the IACUC must be
made aware of all procedures being conducted. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the investigator
provides a complete description of proposed activities that involve the use of animals in order that those activities
may be adequately reviewed and determined to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.
