3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Five enclosures each had an area with a piece of wire fencing bent out of shape so it protruded into the
enclosures. One of those sharp points was located so the dog could easily step on it and two others were located
on the ceilings of the enclosures but the dogs were able to hit their heads on the ceilings while jumping up. The
other two sharp points were located where the dogs could easily puncture their eyes when they jumped up at the
fronts of their enclosures. Sharp points could result in painful injuries to the dogs and could even cause infections.
** The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are maintained so they have no sharp points that could injure
the dogs. The licensee eliminated all five sharp points identitifed at the time of inspection.
3.10
WATERING.
* A long, horizontal, PVC pipe approximately 6 inches in diameter, had holes cut in the top and served as the
drinking water receptacle for 40 adult dogs. That pipe had an accumulation of brown sediment settled at the bottom
so that the bottom of the receptacle could not be visualized. The outside portion of that pipe had hair and a
tan-colored grimey substance on it. Water receptacles which are not kept clean pose a health risk to the dogs.
** The licensee must ensure that water receptacles are kept clean and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b). The
licensee was verbally instructed to correct this non-compliant item by 31 March 2015.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with the licensee, a facility representative, and an Animal
Health Officer from Missouri Department of Agriculture.
