3.13(c)(3)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At least two crates containing dogs to be shipped did not have instructions for the next time food and water must be
offered clearly visible and attached to the top of the crate. This information is important for intermediate handlers
and transporters to be certain that the animals are being offered food and water at regular intervals (i.e., water every
12 hours, food every 12 hours for animals <16 weeks, food every 24 hours for animals >16 weeks). Correct by
ensuring that a certification is securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure that indicates when the
animal was last offered food and water, and provides instructions for when the next time food and water must be
offered.
Correct by: This non-compliant item was corrected during the inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the cargo agent by the undersigned VMO.
