2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two fishers died in the spring of 2018 after staff failed to treat them for a severe flea infestation.
On 3 April, 2018 a caretaker entered a written note regarding the two fishers in the facility Mammal Journal stating
"...Also observed a lot of scratching today. May want to consider flea meds, if possible..." According to the facility
Curator no action was taken regarding the scratching observed by the caretaker. On 23 April one of the fishers was
found dead in the enclosure. No necropsy was performed. On 3 May, the second fisher was also found dead and
submitted to the attending veterinarian for a necropsy. The gross necropsy report stated "...OPENED BAG-
THOUSANDS OF FLEAS- FROZE BODY OVERNIGHT TO KILL...External exam:thousands of fleas..." The
necropsy report also noted multiple insect bites, white mucous membranes, and marked pallor of abdominal organs.
Failure to treat health conditions may lead to unnecessary pain and distress in animals, and in this case, their death.
The facility should ensure that animals are appropriately monitored and health conditions are conveyed to the
attending veterinarian in a timely manner.
Correction date: from this time forward.
