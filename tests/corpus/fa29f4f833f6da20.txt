ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. In Pen 6 there were 3 adult guinea pigs (2 black and
white and 1 brown and white) with head tilts. The animals were eating and drinking normally and appeared to be in
good body condition. The facility had observed these animals had head tilts approximately one month prior to the
inspection but had not contacted the attending veterinarian and had not applied the treatments described for
animals with head tilts in the Program of Veterinary Care. The attending veterinarian was contacted and agreed
these animals should be treated.
Head tilts can be due to various causes and delays in providing appropriate veterinary care for these conditions can
result in worsening of the condition and potentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature.
The licensee must initiate treatment as described in the Program of Veterinary Care or consult with the attending
veterinarian regarding the head tilts in these 3 guinea pigs.

WATERING.
There was a buildup of bedding, debris, and wet greenish material around the nipples of the automatic waterers.
There were stainless steel water bowls being used to administer treated water in 7 pens in addition to the automatic
waterers. The bowls were empty at the time of inspection but contained a buildup of bedding and debris at the
bottom of the bowls.
Failure to clean and sanitize water receptacles often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in
decreased water intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.
