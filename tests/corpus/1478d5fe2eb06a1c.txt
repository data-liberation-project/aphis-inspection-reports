ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The surgery suite which is used for surgeries on dogs was not being maintained appropriately.
- There was clutter present on a counter top, on a cart and on a metal table.
- The facility(cid:25)'s pet cat was observed walking through the surgical suite.
- In the recovery room, the enclosure used to recover dogs after surgery has a wire mesh top. There was a sharps
container, a net, a trash bag, and other items being stored on top of it.
Failure to provide an appropriate environment for surgical procedures and recovery could be detrimental to the
health and wellbeing of the animals.
Appropriate facilities should be available and maintained appropriately for aseptic procedures, such as those
performed at the facility.
The facility should ensure that steps are taken to maintain the surgery suite in appropriate condition.
To be corrected prior to any surgical activity.
3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The concrete floors, located at the back of the facility, leading to the outdoor runs, are not completely sealed. The
paint is peeling off and the underlying concrete material is exposed. At time of inspection, a dog and her puppies
were being housed on these floors. Although they were lying in a bed, they had access to the unsealed floors.
Unsealed concrete is porous and cannot be cleaned and sanitized as required. Fecal material and other debris can
accumulate in small crevices increasing the potential of disease hazards in these areas. The surfaces of housing
facilities must be constructed and maintained in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-The sink area used to clean and sanitize food and water receptacles for the dogs is a shared space for employee
use. At time of inspection, there was a dog food bowl and an eating utensil in the sink. In the cupboard above,
cutlery, plates, and other items are being stored. There was no clear separation of utensils being used for humans
or animals. Intermingling of utensils and other items between humans and animals may lead to cross contamination
which could adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals.
-The cupboard under the sink was cluttered and moderately dusty. There was a cardboard box filled with tubing, old
equipment, paper, and other items.
-Two refrigerators were cluttered and had a moderate accumulation of debris. Both were full of medical materials
and other items. The presence of clutter may impede cleaning.
A system should be in place and maintained to ensure premises are kept clean to facilitate the husbandry practices
required in this subpart.
