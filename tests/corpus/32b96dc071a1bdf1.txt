2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 11 Nov 2019, a guest and an employee were bitten by South American Coati "Gus" during a public interaction
session causing skin abrasions. The incident was self reported on 11 Nov 2019. The facility was allowing public
interactions without adequate barriers or direct control of the animals. One employee would be present while the
two coati were allowed free physical contact with the seated guests within the enclosure. This single employee was
responsible for both coati, treats and targets, photos, and the guests.
Coatimundi are relatives of the raccoon and have strong teeth and claws. They have the potential to cause serious
injury to a person.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.
Some of the ways this can be achieved are by a barrier between the public and the animal, a harness on the
animal, or training that requires the animal to respond immediately to commands.
Corrections implemented and demonstrated by the time of the inspection include adding a second employee
present in the enclosure during the interaction sessions, increasing target training, and refraining from use of "Gus"
in interactions until after his scheduled neutering.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
