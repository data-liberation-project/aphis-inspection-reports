and correction date. Correct by August 31, 2015.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
There are two small pigs housed in room 182 (id numbers 1091 and 1121) that are in need of hoof trimming. The
pigs are in enclosures with floors that are of a vinyl coated mesh with holes large enough that the smaller pigs could
get their toes caught in them and become injured. While the pigs are on study the hoof trimming might not be
possible until there is a break or resting period, during the lengthy study periods this may result in the hooves
overgrowing increasing the risk of injury in these enclosures. There is no plan in place to monitor these animals to
ensure that the hoof trimming may be completed in a timely manner. An appropriate means of managing these pigs
to allow effective husbandry shall be developed and implemented to ensure that the hoof trimming is not delayed for
an extended period of time and to minimize the risk of injury. The pigs hooves shall be trimmed to prevent injury.
