ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"BB" (tag # 277) was observed to have an smooth, abraded, pink/red, area on her nose bridge from rubbing her
nose on the chain link fence of the enclosure. The licensee could not tell the inspector how long this condition has
existed, but did mention that this has happened before when she goes into a heat cycle.
The licensee indicated that the veterinarian examined this cat (date unknown-may have been 3 months at the time
of her last facility visit). At that time, the licensee indicated that the veterinarian prescribed a lyme sulfur dip which
does not appear to be resolving the problem. A telephone call was made to the attending veterinarian from the
licensee's facility. The veterinarian could not come to the phone, but her office staff indicated from their records that
this cat (or any other cat) has been seen by the veterinarian for any medical conditions in the last 6 months (the
veterinarian has issued several health certificates for cats that were sold)
Have "BB" examined by your veterinarian and treat accordingly.

3.6(a)(2)(ii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
"BB" (tag # 277) was observed to have an abraded nose bridge. The licensee stated that she has a history of
rubbing her nose on the chain link walls of her enclosure during heat cycles. This rubbing causes the abrasion
observed.
Enclosures shall be constructed to protect the cats from injury. If this cat is known to exhibit this type of behavior
during her heat cycles she should be moved to a different (smoother walled or different materials) enclosure, or the
present enclosure shall be modified in a way to prevent this type of injury from occurring during future heat cycles.
