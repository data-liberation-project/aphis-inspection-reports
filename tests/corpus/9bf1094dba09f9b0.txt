3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A primary enclosure containing three dogs did not provide an adequate amount of space for the three dogs. The
enclosure measured 47.25 inches by 36 inches providing 1,701 square inches. The three dogs measured 18
inches, 19.5 inches, and 21 inches. Combined, these three dogs required 1,955.25 square inches. The required
amount of space was short by 254.25 square inches.
Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their cages. It
minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces and also minimizes the spread of disease. The licensee
must ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the minimum floor
space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
