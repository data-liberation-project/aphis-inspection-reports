FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(b)
****** At time of inspection the enclosures housing the 5 tiger cubs at the facility had only one housing structure
which was completed and allowed protection and comfort from the elements. We are currently experiencing
temperatures and wind chills into the high teens and 20 degree range with the chance for a winter mix being
possible.
There is construction that has been started on additonal housing structures that once completed will provide the
tigers protection and will help to prevent discomfort to the animals during periods of inclement weather.
