2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the outdoor section of one enclosure is a deceased female Chihuahua (microchip #0007296B3B). The dog is
located at the end of the enclosure lying on her right side up against the enclosure gate. There is a large, circular
open wound in the lower left side of the abdomen directly in front of the left hind leg. The licensee said this dog
tended to have intermittent issues with uterine infections during the time she has been at the facility.
The licensee stated that he normally conducts daily observations of the dogs in the evening, therefore had not
observed the dogs at the time of the inspection, but the licensee had observed the dog during the weekend and it
had been fine at that time. The day before the inspection, the licensee stated he had been inside the kennel three
times, but did not walk around the outside of the kennel at anytime and couldn't be sure this dog had been observed
on that day. Failure to make daily observations of the dogs may result in unnoticed health and behavioral issues that could have
a detrimental effect on the life and well-being of the animals.
Daily observations of all animals is required to assess their health and well-being. The licensee must ensure that
each dog is observed everyday in order to have the best possible chance of identifying any health problems and
reducing the negative impact these health issues may have on the animal.
Correction date: Daily observation of every animal must be done from this day forward.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
