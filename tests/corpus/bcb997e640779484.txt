3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The main kennel area had just been washed down prior to the inspection. A few of the dogs were pretty wet in
their feet and legs. Better care needs to be taken when cleaning to ensure the dogs are not wetted during this daily
process.
*** One section of drainage for the top section of enclosures needs to be addressed. There is a slight gap and
instead of water going into the top drain and bypassing the lower section of enclosures, the water is running down
into one lower enclosure. This needs to be corrected for the health of the dogs.
