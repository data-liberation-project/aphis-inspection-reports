ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, black, female Newfoundland Dog (ID# 7E10064278), has an abnormal skin condition. The affected areas
of skin are located along the inside of the hind legs, base of the ears, around both eyes, and slightly above the paw
on the left-hind leg. These areas appear mostly devoid of hair, dry and crusty. The dog is continuously scratching
areas around its left ear, lasting approximately 19 seconds. Immediately afterwards, the dog starts biting at areas
along its back. The facility representative stated that a veterinarian has yet to evaluate the dog. The facility
representative also stated that he first noticed the hair loss on 11/23/18 and made the decision to treat the dog with
a single dose of oral ivermectin the same day. The facility's program of veterinary care lists the use of oral
ivermectin as an approved treatment for specific conditions, however, the licensee and facility representative have
not obtained an official diagnosis from a veterinarian and therefore are unsure of the exact cause. In addition, there
is a moist greenish-colored discharge and dry crusty matter present around the dog's left eye.
Skin problems in dogs can be caused by inadequate nutrition, parasites or other underlying medical conditions. The
licensee must consult with a veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan
for this dog's condition. Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that the treatment plan is followed and that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The far west outdoor enclosure containing three adult Bernese Mountain Dogs and one adult Poodle, has fencing
that is in disrepair. There are multiple damaged areas of fencing which create physical hazards that the dogs can
come in contact with. Several wires tied along the edges of the fence have come apart, creating sharp wire points
that protrude inward. In addition, there are openings in the fencing large enough to allow each dog's head to pass
through. The facility representative pointed out new fence panels laying on the ground next to the enclosure and
plans to use it to replace and or repair the existing fence.Fencing that is not properly constructed or maintained can potentially lead to injuries and or may not contain the
dogs securely.

An enclosure located in the whelping room utilizes a gas heater that is hanging too low. There are six weaned
Burnese Mountain Dog puppies that can potentially come in contact with the heater. The heater does not have a
guard of any kind attached to the bottom that would prevent the puppies from coming into contact with the heating
element. The heater must be installed differently or modified to eliminate the risk of injury to the puppies.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. The licensee must
ensure the housing facilities are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injuries, contain animals securely and
restrict other animals from entering.

3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An enclosure in the whelping room containing six Burnese Mountain Dog puppies has not been properly cleaned
and sanitized. The metal food receptacle and the plastic grate under the automatic water line has a thick layer of
grime and organic material on the surfaces. The bedding on the floor contains a mixture of fresh and old feces. The
licensee stated that the solid feces is picked up daily but the surfaces in the enclosure have not been sanitized in
over 2 weeks.
Failure to properly clean and sanitize these surfaces have the potential to form hazards that may negatively effect
the health and well being of the dogs. All food receptacles, water receptacles and primary enclosures in use must
be sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often if necessary, to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris,
food waste, excreta and other potential disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, facility representative and IDALS official.
