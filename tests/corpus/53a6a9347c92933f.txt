2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At time of inspection the following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:

An adult female guinea pig (mostly black with some tan) in enclosure # 13 housing 8 adults and 4 newborns, had a solid
mass approximately 1 1/2 inches in diameter under her chin.

An adult female guinea pig (mostly white with black markings) in enclosure # 16 housing 7 adults and 6 newborns, had a
solid mass approximately 2 inches in diameter with hair loss on the bottom side of the mass.

An adult female guinea pig (brown and white) in enclosure # 16 housing 7 adults and 6 newborns, had 3 solid masses
approximately 1 1/2 inches in diameter each with hair loss on the bottom sides of the masses.

These 3 animals appeared to be eating and drinking normally. The treatment for masses is not addressed in the program
of veterinary care and there is no record that the facility had identified these three guinea pigs prior to today's inspection.
A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in delay of care
provided to animals and prolong animal health problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and

well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.

These 3 guinea pigs identified with masses require examination and treatment by the attending veterinarian to prevent
worsening of the conditions. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such examination and treatment to
APHIS officials upon request. Correct by August 12, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
