2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****A female Pekinese # 311 had a discolored spot on the left eye. The eye appeared to have an abnormal blue
haze within and/or on the central portion of the globe. A slight amount of creamy yellowish discharge was noticed on
the eye ball. The licensee was not aware of this, and mentioned the dog sometimes has a "cherry eye".
Discoloration to the eye could be the result of injury, illness or other medical condition which may be uncomfortable
or could lead to blindness. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****There was a female Bichon #347 that had the ID chain in its mouth and around the neck, pinching the lower jaw.
The chain was preventing the mouth from closing and the dog was struggling to try and get the chain out of its
mouth. The facility representative immediately removed the chain once pointed out. The skin was reddened under
the lower jaw. The licensee must ensure all animals are observed daily to asses their health and well-being.

incomplete and did not contain all the information as required on the APHIS form 7006 including the complete and
accurate information on buyer/seller, date of sale, date of birth, and who transported the animals. Complete and
accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to
facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The licensee must use a USDA form 7006 (Disposition of dogs) and complete
all the required information.
