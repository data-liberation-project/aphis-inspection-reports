FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was approximately six feet of electric cord hanging over the top of a wall in the enclosure of a year and a half
old female bison named “Rally.” The electric cord was coming up out of the hot water heater and was plugged into
an extension cord that was plugged into a wall socket outside of the primary enclosure.
A live electric power cord could cause injury to the bison if it is chewed on. All power cords must be installed in a
manner that protects the animals from coming into direct contact with the cords.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
The facility representative corrected this noncompliance at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and APHIS student trainee.
