SANITATION.
The following housekeeping issues were noted:
- There was a moderate amount of clutter and dust present in a lab area. The counter tops had cardboard boxes,
papers, and other materials being stored on it. There was dust surrounding these items. The presence of clutter
may impede cleaning.
- The refrigerator in the lab area is labeled "animal food only" and a heavy accumulation of dust was noted on its top
and along the inside seal of its door. There was also an accumulation of debris on the bottom shelf. Refrigerators
designated for animal food or materials should be kept clean to minimize the contamination of food.
Premises should be kept clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. A
system should be in place and maintained to ensure animal areas are cleaned as required.
