ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:28 pm on
08-Feb-17.
I arrived at property on Wednesday Feb. 8, 2017 at 2:27 pm. The gate was closed. I called the primary phone
number and left a message; then I called the daughter's cell number and left a message. An employee came to the
gate and stated that no one was home and they were not expected back until later, probably in the evening. When
asked if anyone was there that was authorized to accompany me on an inspection he said no. He called the owner's
cell phone and left a message. I departed at 2:40 pm. Report will be sent by email and certified mail.
