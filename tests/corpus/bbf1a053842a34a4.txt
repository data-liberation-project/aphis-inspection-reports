2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 8 guinea pigs with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary Care or
consultation with the attending veterinarian.
There were 3 guinea pigs with skin wounds. In Pen 5, there was a tri-color adult male guinea pig with hair loss over the
back between the hip and the spine on both sides. The areas of hair loss were approximately 1/2 inch by 2 inches on the
right and 1 inch by 1/2 inch on the left. There were irregular gaps in the skin approximately 1/2 inch by 1 inch on the right
and 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch on the left where the underlying pinkish red tissue was exposed. The wound on the right side
was oozing a bloody discharge. In Pen 6, there was a tri-color adult male guinea pig with an area of hair loss over the
back to the right of the spine approximately 1 inch by 3 inches in size. There were irregular gaps in the skin
approximately 1/2 inch by 1 inch in size where the underlying pinkish red tissue was exposed. In Pen 14, there was a tri-
color adult male guinea pig with a large area of hair loss and irregular gaps in the skin spanning the back over the hip
area on both sides. The area was approximately 4 inches by 3 inches in size and the underlying pinkish red tissue was
exposed.
In Pen 1 and 2 there were 3 adult tri-color guinea pigs with firm movable masses under the chin. In Pen 1 there was a
tan, black, and white guinea pig with a mass under the chin approximately 1 inch in size. In Pen 1 there was a black,


brown, and white guinea pig with a mass under the chin approximately 2 inches in size. In Pen 2, there was a tri-color
guinea pig with a mass under the chin approximately 1 inch in size. The animals were in good body condition and did not
appear lethargic.
In Pen 17, there were 2 guinea pigs with skin abnormalities. A brown and white weanling had circular areas of hair loss
with crusty skin on the bridge of the nose and near the right eye. A brown and white weanling had a circular areas of hair
loss with crusty skin on the bridge of the nose and between the nose and forehead.
The licensee had not observed the health conditions in these animals, had not contacted his attending veterinarian, and
was not administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed and provided treatment options
for the masses under the chin and the hair loss with crusty skin but did not address the skin wounds.
Open skin wounds, masses under the chin, and hair loss with crusty skin can be indications of disease or injury, can be
painful, affect the overall health and well-being of the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other
medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of
the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the condition is contagious.
The licensee must develop and implement a plan for effective daily observations and regular communication of those
findings to the attending veterinarian. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian about the animals observed
with health conditions to determine a plan of diagnosis and treatment.

2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 585 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of
adults, weanlings, or newborns present for the last few months (since September). There was also no record of the


number of dead animals.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Watering.
There was a buildup of bedding, fecal material, debris, and wet brown material in the PVC piping around the nipples of the
automatic waterers. The licensee stated he is flushing them with a hose weekly but does not clean and sanitize them on a
regular basis.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.

3.31(b)

Sanitation.
There was a build-up of bedding, spiderwebs, and debris adhered to the open wire sides and outside of the feeders of the
6 stacked pens. The licensee stated these areas are not being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to


facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
