The chain link on the front of the enclosure housing the capuchins has a gritty feeling. The surface of the chain link
is coarse allowing a build up of organic material on the surface which may increase the risk of disease hazard. It
does not appear that the surface can be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. The surface shall be prepared or the
chain link replaced to allow proper cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces. Correct by September 26, 2015.
The outside wall of the non-human primate building serves as one of the walls of the outdoor exercise yard for the
capuchins. There is a build up of organic material around the entrance to the inside enclosure and on the surface of
the bars used to access the door. These structures shall be cleaned and sanitized at a frequency that will prevent
excess build-up and thereby minimize disease hazard. Correct by September 2, 2015.

be cleaned and sanitized to minimize the risk of disease hazard. Correct by September 2, 2015.
