ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1252 on
12-Apr-19. I went to the licensee's house and the licensee was not home. I informed a family member that I would
send out an attempted inspection report and we would try again another day.
End of report.
