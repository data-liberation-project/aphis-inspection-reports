2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee has a newly updated, computer spreadsheet list of dogs on hand but it does not have complete
information that is required for all dogs. Six dogs do not have their identification/chip numbers listed and three dogs
do not have complete acquisition information listed. In addition, the licensee does not have a variance to use
computerized records other than the APHIS 7005 form. The lack of complete information on these forms makes it
difficult to accurately track and monitor the dogs present in the kennel. These forms must accurately and completely
include all required information about all the dogs in the facility.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The welded-wire fence in one enclosure with two dogs is bowed out from the panel fence resulting in a gap between
the two fences as well as wire points sticking into the enclosure. Also, in another enclosure with one dog there are
wire points sticking into the enclosure in one corner. Also, the edge of a metal strip holding down the flooring
material in one enclosure in the whelping building is turned up resulting in a sharp edge. Wire points and sharp
edges could result in injury to the dogs. All surfaces must be constructed and maintained in good repair to protect
the dogs from injury. Correct by 2 August 2017.
3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The common area of the whelping building has a collection of discarded clutter including old heat lamps, scrap
metal, and vinyl flooring pieces. Accumulated trash and clutter makes it difficult to clean the animal areas and
housing facility and can harbor pests. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities and areas used for storing
animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste material, junk, weeds, and other discarded
materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment,
furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and necessary for cleaning the area, and
fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices. To be corrected by 10 August 2017.3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The floor of one enclosure in the whelping building currently housing one female and her two puppies is constructed
of unfinished wood flooring. Unfinished wood is not impervious to moisture and therefore makes it difficult to clean
and sanitize the enclosure. The licensee must ensure that the floors and walls of indoor housing facilities, and any
other surfaces in contact with the animals, must be impervious to moisture. To be corrected by 10 August 2017.
3.9(a)
FEEDING.
The food for the 6 dogs in the outdoor housing enclosures is being placed in open food receptacles unprotected
from the elements. At the time of the inspection the food in these receptacles has become soaked by a recent rain
storm. Food that has become contaminated may no longer be palatable and result in the dogs not consuming it.
The licensee must provide food that is uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and
nutritive value to maintain the normal condition and weight of the animal. Correct by 31 July 2017.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
Two plastic food bowls in use in the whelping building have chewed edges are deeply pitted and dirty, The chewed
edges of the receptacles show decrease in durability and are difficult to clean and sanitize. When surfaces are not
sanitized they can play a role in disease transmission. When food receptacles become worn or chewed to the point
that they cannot be sanitized, they must be replaced. Licensee must provide durable food receptacles without
chewed edges that are easily cleaned and sanitized.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
