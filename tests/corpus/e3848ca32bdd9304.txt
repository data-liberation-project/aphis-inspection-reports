2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. In Pen 34, there was a tri-color weanling that was lethargic
with both eyes crusted shut. The guinea pig was sitting in one place not moving and at times would lose balance and fall
on its side. In Pen 59, there was a tri-color weanling that was bright and alert but had a right eye that was red and watery
and held partially closed. The licensee had not observed the conditions in either animal and was not administering any
treatments.
Guinea pigs that are lethargic with balance issues can experience pain or distress, worsen if not treated, and can spread
the condition to other animals if infectious in nature. Eye abnormalities can affect the vision, can be indicative of disease
or injury, can be painful, and affect the overall health and well-being of the animal.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate
plan for diagnosis and treatment.

Watering.


In approximately 50% of the pens, there was a buildup of bedding, fecal material, debris, and wet brown material around
the nipples of the automatic waterers. The facility performed their weekly cleaning the day before the inspection.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
In the first 2 rows of pens containing approximately 400 guinea pigs, there were several pens with spiderwebs with
bedding and debris adhered to the ceiling and walls of the pens. The facility performed their weekly cleaning the day
before the inspection.
Failure to clean enclosures adequately can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure, and attract
pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and sanitized at a
minimum of once every two weeks.

3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
There was a large amount of debris, bedding, fecal material, and grime on the floor under the first 2 rows of pens
containing approximately 400 guinea pigs. In particular, there was a build-up of bedding, debris, and grime on the floor
between the rows of pens and coating the PVC piping around the waterers on the rear of the pens. There were also
spiderwebs with bedding and debris attached on the outside framework of these pens. The facility had performed their
weekly cleaning the day before the inspection.


The lack of sanitation and presence debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and may contribute
to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
