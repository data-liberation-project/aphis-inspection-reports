2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A black and white adult guinea pig in Pen 1 was observed to have a
firm movable mass approximately 2 cm in diameter under its chin. The licensee did not observe the mass in the guinea
pig and was not administering any treatment. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and
provided treatment options. The attending veterinarian was contacted and was not comfortable with the licensee not
treating the animal as instructed in the Program of Veterinary Care.
Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of the
animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment
for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the
condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according with the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian
to evaluate the animal and develop an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

Watering.
The majority of water bottles for the guinea pigs had a buildup of green or black material coating the inside of the water
bottle. The facility stated they were last cleaned 2 months ago.
Failure to clean and sanitize water bottles often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized at least every 2 weeks to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.
