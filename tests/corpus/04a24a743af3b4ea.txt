FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are gaps under the perimeter fence in several places:
The fence is detached and pulled in from the bottom support bar creating a gap at an unnumbered gate near the
south east side of the property. There is a hole that has been dug under the perimeter fence south of the water
buffalo enclosure leaving a gap that is approximately one foot tall. There is a gap under the entire length of gate 9
(north side of property) that is approximately 1.5 feet tall. These gaps are all large enough to allow animals to enter
the facility.
The perimeter fence for the facility is not constructed or maintained so as to keep animals and unauthorized
persons
out or to function as a secondary containment system for facility animals. The gaps under the perimeter fence are to
be corrected by 18 June 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the General Curator.
