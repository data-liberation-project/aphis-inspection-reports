2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Upon arrival at the facility pig #1603, a young adult white Yorkshire cross female, was noted by staff to have what
was thought to be an abscess on the left side of it's neck. According to the licensee, the Principal Investigator
anesthetized the pig and opened the abscess in order to develop drainage of it's contents and administered
antibiotics to the animal. However the attending veterinarian was not contacted or notified of the pig's medical
condition. During the inspection the pig was noted by inspectors to have an open, draining wound on the left side of
it's neck approximately two inches by six inches. It is the responsibility of the research facility to contact the
attending veterinarian in order to assure the use of appropriate methods to treat animals housed at the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
An adult female New Zealand White rabbit in cage N30 was found to have an area on it's dewlap that was enlarged,
void of hair and which had a reddened and slightly crusty appearance. The licensee stated the animal had not been
observed with this condition by care staff and therefore had not received veterinary care. Not observing medical
conditions such as abscesses may cause discomfort, pain and distress to the rabbit. The facility must provide daily
observation of animals and promptly report any abnormalities to the attending veterinarian so proper care can be
provided.

FEEDING.
A small number of feeders display caking of the feed along the walls of the receptacles and approximately 35% of
the feeders have excess rust present on them. Licensee has a schedule for cleaning out the feeders but not for
disinfecting and sanitizing them. Contaminated feed receptacles may contain disease causing organisms that may
affect the health and well being of the animals. Licensee must develop a schedule for disinfection and sanitization offeeders at least once every two weeks.

3.56(a)(3)
SANITATION.
Excessive accumulations of animal excreta are present in the gutters underneath the rabbit cages in the facility. The
presence of this waste material can potentially harbor pests and create unhealthy living conditions for the animals
contained within the facility. The licensee must ensure there are adequate measures in place to remove feces, urine
and contaminated dirt and that the waste is properly disposed of at least once each week.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an area of fencing approximately twelve inches by six inches that has broken and created a sizable hole in
the bottom of the panel between the last two pig enclosures. Having fencing in disrepair may cause injury to the
pigs and weaken the fence.The licensee must replace or repair this divider panel.

3.126(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
At the outside corner of the swine building adjacent to the last swine pen is a concrete trough type drain that is
designed to drain waste water from the building floor. There is a large area of stagnant, pooled waste water that has
collected at the end of the drain. Stagnant pooled waste water is a breeding ground for flies, mosquitos and other
insects that transmit disease. Such drainage systems should be maintained to prevent backup of waste water.
Facility must correct this deficiency in the drainage system.
