Veterinary care for dogs.
The current written program of veterinary care (PVC) is not complete. It does not include provisions for a complete
physical examination of the dogs by the attending veterinarian every 12 months or preventative care and treatment for
hair coats/nails/eyes/ears/skin/teeth. In addition the instructions for sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests
are insufficient. They do not include instructions for certain organisms (coccidia, giardia), do not include any information
on sampling/testing and do not give treatment dosage recommendations. The PVC must be complete and include
instructions regarding regularly scheduled visits, annual physical exams, vaccinations, preventative care of


skin/nails/eyes/ears/teeth and sampling and treatment for parasites and pests in order to provide for the health and well-
being of the dogs. The facility shall ensure that they follow an appropriate PVC that includes all required elements and is
developed and documented by the attending veterinarian. Correct by 9/9/22.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility currently does not keep copies of medical records for the dogs. There are no records that include identification
of the dogs and the routine husbandry procedures performed on the dogs such as vaccinations and deworming/parasite
treatments. In addition, there are no medical records kept for problems identified and treated. Medical records are
necessary to document preventative procedures completed and medical diagnoses/treatments provided. The facility shall
keep copies of medical records for dogs that include the required information including the identifying information about
the dog, all preventative and routine husbandry procedures performed, information about problems identified,
treatments/vaccinations administered and results of all tests performed. Correct by 9/9/22.
