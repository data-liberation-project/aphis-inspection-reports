Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1130 on September
29, 2021.
Spoke to an adult at the listed address who stated the transporter does not live there. Two phone calls to the listed
number were made. I left a message on the first call. On the second call an adult answered, but she hung up when I
identified myself.
