ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****An adult black and tan male German Shepherd, (cid:28)Dude(cid:29) MC# 0A01447732, was noticed shaking his head
periodically. Also, the outside edge of the left ear was noted to have an irregular shape and appeared scab-like.
The inside of the left ear appeared moist, reddened and inflamed. An abundant amount of a thick yellow
mucous-like material was observed covering the inside of the ear flap extending down into the ear canal. The hair
around the margins of the inside of the ear appeared matted with some of this discharge-type material which also
had a black tarry appearance along this region. At least two small (approximately ½ cm diameter) red circular
sore-like lesions were noted on the inside of the edge of the ear flap. When asked to see the right ear of the dog,
the licensee attempted to show us but the dog growled and further attempts to visualize the ear were discontinued.
The licensee stated that (cid:28)Dude(cid:29) had been seen by a veterinarian in June for an ear infection. According to written
documentation at the facility, the licensee treated the ear for 14 days and treatment was stopped on June 28, 2016.
According to the licensee, she was unaware of the dog(cid:25)s current ear condition. This dog(cid:25)s current condition could
indicate an ear infection which could be painful & could lead to additional health problems for the dog. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made
and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and
make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate
veterinary care at all times.
A full inspection was conducted at this facility on August 10, 2016. This report only reflects the portion covering
"Veterinary Care Direct NCI". The second portion of the report will be delivered at a later date.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee and a facility representative by Erika Leisner VMO,
Bill Heine ACI and a representative of Missouri Department of Agriculture.Additional Inspectors
