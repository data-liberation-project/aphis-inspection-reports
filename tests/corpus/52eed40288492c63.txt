ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Two adult Servals were ill and not receiving veterinary care. Both cats were lethargic and reluctant to move.
Only half of the chicken fed the prior day had been eaten even though the animal caretaker said that normally the
cats eat the entire amount each day. Both cats were squinting in both eyes and were reluctant to open their eyes.
A dark discharge was coming from the eyes, forming mounds of dried crust between the eyes and nose.
****An adult Marmoset was ill and not receiving veterinary care. The monkey was sneezing and had a white
discharge coming from its left nostril. It was shivering and hung from the top of the pen directly under a lamp.
Anytime the lamp was moved, the monkey moved directly under the lamp as though it were seeking heat.
Untreated medical conditions can worsen, can be painful, and may be contagious to other animals in the facility.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JUNE 19, 2014.
The licensee must keep records of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care and must make these records
available to the inspector upon request.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(iii) PROTECT THE NONHUMAN PRIMATES FROM INJURY
Four enclosures, housing a total of 8 marmosets and tamarins, had heat lamps attached to their tops or sides. The
electrical cords for the heat lamps were laying along the tops and/or sides of the enclosures within easy reach of the
monkeys. The electrical cord for the heat lamp attached to the enclosure of the cotton-top tamarin had several
areas that appeared to be chewed to the point where the insulation was being pulled out of the cord. Chewed
electrical cords can result in electrocution that causes injury or death to the animal. The licensee must ensure that
electrical cords and other potentially harmful objects are out of reach of the animals.

3.84(a)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) CLEANING OF PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An indoor primary enclosure, housing three capuchin monkeys, had an excessive amount of fecal material and food
waste in the pans underneath the enclosure. The pans appeared to have not been cleaned in several days and the
room with this enclosure had a strong odor of fecal matter despite an open window and a fan. Excess fecal waste
can result in the animals becoming soiled, disease hazards, pests, and odors. The licensee must ensure that
excreta and food waste is removed from inside indoor primary enclosures on a daily basis and from underneath
them as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the animals from being
soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, odors, and pests.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 20, 2014.

EMPLOYEES.
The licensee was out of town and had left a single animal caretaker in charge of the non-human primates. The
caretaker had only been instructed on how to feed and water the animals. He was not aware that the Marmoset
was showing any clinical signs of illness and he was not adequately cleaning all the non-human primate enclosures.
Employees who do not have adequate training or supervision can compromise the health and well-being of the
animals and the safety of the employees. The licensee must ensure that all employees have adequate training and
supervision to carry out required husbandry practices and care.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JULY 1, 2014.

SANITATION.
(a) CLEANING OF ENCLOSURES.
****Two enclosures, housing a total of 4 hedgehogs, had an excessive amount of waste material. The animals were
not able to avoid their excreta when moving around in the enclosures.
****The enclosure housing two servals had a plastic litter box that was full of excreta. There also was excreta on
the floor of the enclosure. The licensee stated that it had been about a week since he had cleaned the litter box.
The room with this enclosure had a strong odor of fecal matter despite an open window and a fan.
Excess excreta can contaminate the animals, can cause odors, and can be a disease hazard. The licensee must
remove excreta as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and
reduce odors.TO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 20, 2014.

EMPLOYEES.
The licensee was out of town and had left a single animal caretaker in charge of the animals. The caretaker had
only been instructed on how to feed and water the animals. He was not aware that the servals were showing any
clinical signs of illness and he was not cleaning their enclosure or the enclosures of some of the other animals.
Employees who do not have adequate training or supervision can compromise the health and well-being of the
animals and the safety of the employees. The licensee must ensure that all employees have adequate training and
supervision to carry out required husbandry practices and care.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JULY 1, 2014.
Because the licensee was out of town, the inspection was conducted with a facility representative assigned by the
licensee. The exit briefing was conducted by telephone with the licensee on June 18, 2014.
