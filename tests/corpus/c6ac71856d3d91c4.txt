ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:38-11:11
am on 07-Sep-17.
The gate to the property entrance was closed, so I parked in the driveway. I honked my car horn with no response.
I called the licensee's phone number, but was unable to leave a message.
