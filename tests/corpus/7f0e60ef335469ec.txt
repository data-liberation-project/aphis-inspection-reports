3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wire mesh material (used to prevent digging and escape) in the grey fox enclosure was exposed in several
areas. The exposed mesh poses a risk of injury to the animal such as by abrading the foot pads or entrapment and
fracture of the legs. Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the
animals. A system of monitoring and maintenance should be in place so that all housing facilities remain structurally
sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The five separate enclosures containing two male sheep, one alpaca, and five zebu did not have adequate shade or
shelter to protect these animals from inclement weather or direct sunlight. The shelter and shade currently provided
is inadequate to protect the animals contained therein from direct sunlight and inclement weather conditions.
Inadequate protection from direct sunlight and inclement weather may lead to chilling, wetting, overheating or
discomfort.
Sufficient shade by natural or artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect
themselves from direct sunlight and weather extremes. In addition, the licensee must provide natural or artificial
shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to
prevent discomfort to such animals.
