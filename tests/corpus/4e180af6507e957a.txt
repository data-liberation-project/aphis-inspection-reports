HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside of the night house, housing two Schmitz's Spot-Nosed Guenons, the mesh wire enclosure was broken on
one side and caused a gap between the wire cage and the sides to which they were attached. Within the same
night house, in the adjacent enclosure housing two Black & White Rough Lemurs, there was a two inch gap with
exposed screws where the tunnel is adjoined to the night house. The broken edges created sharp points that could
injure the primates and the gaps created poses a risk of escape. Housing facilities should be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect and contain the animals.

3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Safari Park on the primate islands and in some primate enclosures on primate row, there were swinging
ropes that were frayed in many areas. Fixtures in the enclosures should be removed or replaced when worn in order
to protect animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** In the small mammal building, the enclosure housing 6 Red-Handed Tamarins, 4 adults and 2 infants, has a light
fixture which has an unsecured plastic cover protecting it and it was creating a gap large enough for a baby tamarin
to get inside and lay directly under the florescent light bulb. Exposed light bulbs in contact with the animals pose a
risk of injury to the animals in this enclosure. All enclosures shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury.*** The shade structures in 4 primate enclosures in primate row, housing Pileated Gibbons, Lar Gibbons, Siamang
Gibbons, and Vervet Monkeys, were ripped and hanging into the enclosures. Also, shade material was hanging 2
feet into the enclosure from the top, which the animals were hanging from. These pieces of hanging cloth in the
enclosures can present a risk of injury to the animals from entrapment or ingestion. All enclosures shall be kept in
good repair including the shade structures that are attached.
A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place to protect the animals from injury.

3.80(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the small mammal building, the enclosure housing 2 Common Marmosets has a concrete rock-like structure that
the paint is peeling off. The areas where the paint is peeling does not allow for those surfaces to be properly
cleaned and sanitized. Ensure that all surfaces that come in contact with the nonhuman primates can be readily
cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Inside of the African Walk-Thru Aviary enclosure, which houses one Blue Duiker, some of the metal fencing
along the bottom of the enclosure was is disrepair. Portions of the fencing were creating several sharp points that
were pointing inward into the enclosure toward the animals and could cause injury.
*** In the camel’s pen the corners, of the smaller metal roofed shade structure, were bent downward in multiple
areas and created sharp exposed edges that could come into contact with the camels and cause injury.
*** Inside the enclosure housing two leopards, the shade cloth was ripped and approximately one foot of it was
hanging into the animals enclosure. Chewing and ingesting this material is a health risk and can lead to a foreign
body. In the center of the enclosure a 6 ft long, 1 inch wide piece of shade material was hanging from the top of the
enclosure, this can present a risk to the animal if it gets entangled in the material and can lead to injury.
*** In the night house of the cheetah and tiger enclosures the three inch PVC drains did not have any covers overthem. The exposed holes in the floor present a risk of injury if the animals get their paws or legs stuck in them. The
indoor housing facility should be structurally sound in all aspects, including the floor, to protect the animals from
injury.
All enclosures and structures within the enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points and
protruding edges in order to protect the animals from injury. All enclosures and structures within the enclosures
must be kept in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility
repair, and maintenance must be in place.
