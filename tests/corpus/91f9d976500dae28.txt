ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog with USDA tag #261, White Female Poodle, was noticed to have a red/brown coloration around her mouth. In
addition, she was noticed to be excessively licking her mouth. Upon further examination, this dog was noticed to
have an excessive buildup of dental calculi on a majority of her teeth. Having dental issues can cause the dog pain
and discomfort if left untreated. This dog was recently purchased on 10/20/2014 and is currently bred. Licensee
must contact the veterinarian to set up and determine an appropriate timeframe for an examination. Documentation
of the examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained and made available for inspection. Licensee
should have this dog seen sooner if the dog is noticed to have trouble eating or is not maintaining normal body
weight.
This dog was also noticed to have excessively long toenails on both feet. Long toenails can easily be broken and
can affect the gait of the dog. Licensee must trim all long toenails. In addition, Licensee must establish a routine for
grooming, to include toenail trimming, for the facility.
