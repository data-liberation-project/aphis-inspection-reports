Water quality.
Water quality records for the AASC pools 1 and 2 housing whales Jetta (Pool 1) and Havana (Pool 2) were reviewed.
Both of these whales are under veterinary care. There were multiple instances of consecutive days in December 2021
when the coliform bacteria count of water samples of the pools far exceeded 1,000 MPN. In Pool 1 from 11/30/21 to
12/25/21 (26 days) there were only 6 days where the coliforms were measured under 1000 MPN (3 of those values were
in the 900’s) and 5 days of coliform values over 10,000 MPN. In Pool 2 from 11/30/21 until 12/30/21 (31 days) there were
16 days of high coliform counts with values on 4 of those days over 19,000 MPN and only 4 days where the coliform
levels were under 1000 MPN

During this same time period, there are entries in Havana’s medical record documenting instances of keratitis,
blepharospasm, inappetence, GI discomfort, and rubbing the skin of her fluke and rostrum on the sides of the pool. The
entry in her medical record for 12/8/21 after consultation with an ophthalmologist, states that “coliform changes may have
contributed to keratopathy, so plan to work with the LSS/WQ team (life support system/water quality) to mitigate even
small fluctuations”.



Per this Section of the Regulations the primary enclosure shall not contain water which would be detrimental to the health
of the marine mammal contained therein. Elevated levels of coliforms and other indicators of water quality, such as
oxidants in the water, are harmful to marine mammals and may cause irritation to eyes, skin, and the respiratory system.

Water quality.
**Water quality records for the two AASC pools were reviewed. There were two instances in December 2021 when the
coliform bacteria count of water samples for both pools exceeded 1,000 MPN and the next water sample recorded was
more than 48 hrs later. The coliform count exceeded 1,000 MPN on 12/16/21 and the next recorded coliform count was
96 hrs later on 12/20/21, and the coliform count exceeded 1,000 MPN on 12/21/21 and the next recorded coliform count
was 72 hrs later on 12/24/21.

**Coliform tests for AASC Pool 1 conducted on 10/2/21 and 12/5/21, and the coliform test for AASC Pool 2 conducted on
12/4/21 had values of “>24,196” MPN. These results do not reflect the actual coliform bacteria counts because there is a
“>” (greater than) sign in front of the number which indicates that the result exceeded the limit of the testing method used.
No other testing was done on these dates to determine the actual coliform count.

Per this Section of the Regulations, the coliform bacteria count of the primary enclosure pool shall not exceed 1,000 MPN
(most probable number) per 100 ml. of water. Should a coliform bacterial count exceed 1,000 MPN, two subsequent
samples may be taken at 48-hour intervals and averaged with the first sample. If such average count does not fall below
1,000 MPN, then the water in the pool shall be deemed unsatisfactory, and the condition must be corrected immediately.
Correct from this date 1/14/22 forward.



This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on 1/10/22. The exit briefing was held 1/14/22 with facility
representatives.
