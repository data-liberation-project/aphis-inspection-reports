3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the back room of the "Puppy Building" there is one enclosure, containing one adult dog, which has flooring
constructed of wire. In the back of the enclosure a section of the wire flooring has bent upward resulting in a sharp
point the dog could step on. Sharp points could cause injury to the dog.
Any enclosure surfaces that come in contact with animals must be free of sharp points or jagged edges that could
cause injuries. This wire flooring must be repaired, replaced or altered in a manner that it will not cause injury to the
dog. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp points and edges and remain safe for all
animals.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In two outdoor enclosures, containing three dogs, the concrete flooring is broken and cracked. These cracked and
broken areas have accumulated dirt, feces and debris in them. In one of these enclosures, containing one dog, the
broken concrete has resulted in a standing puddle of water. The puddle is located towards the front of the enclosure
and it contains yellowish/brown colored water, as well as leaves, straw and feces.
Broken and cracked concrete cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized which can increase disease risks towards
the dogs. All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be
readily cleaned or sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The broken concrete must be repaired, replaced
or altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitizing to occur at least once every two weeks or more
often if necessary. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces within housing enclosures are maintained in good
repair.
3.1(c)(3) DIRECT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.One enclosure in the outdoor housing area, containing five soft-coated wheaten terriers, has an excessive build-up
of feces present throughout the enclosure. There are piles of feces present throughout the enclosure along with a
thin layer of feces smeared throughout nearly the entire floor of the enclosure. All of the dogs in the enclosure have
wet and soiled paws. The dogs were jumping on each other during the inspection and, as a result, all of the dogs
had wet and soiled areas on their bodies (backs, sides, legs, etc.). Failure to properly clean and sanitize primary
enclosures can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks in order to prevent an accumulation of excreta and
reduce disease hazards.
To be corrected by 5:00 pm on November 5th, 2015.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the first room of the "Puppy Building" there is one enclosure, containing four puppies which has flooring
constructed of wire. In the back of this enclosure the flooring has broken resulting in holes in the floor. In another
enclosure, containing two puppies, the wire flooring along one side has broken creating numerous gaps and the
wire in this area has broken into sharp points. Flooring with holes could allow the puppies' feet and legs to pass
through which can result in injury. Gaps in the flooring could allow the puppies(cid:25) feet or legs to become entrapped
and the sharp points can cause injuries.
All primary enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that protects the puppies feet and legs from injury
and does not allow the puppies' feet or legs to pass through any openings. The damaged wire flooring must be
repaired, replaced or altered in a manner that keeps the puppies safe from potential injury. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures remain safe for the puppies at all times. The puppies were removed from both of these
enclosures during the inspection.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.6(b)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is one enclosure within the "Puppy Building", housing one kitten, that has a litter box that is excessively dirty.
The litter box has a very large amount of feces and urine present and an overwhelming odor. There is very little
unused, clean litter present within the box for the kitten to use. Failure to clean litter boxes and/or provide sufficient
clean litter for cats does not ensure a healthy environment for the animals. All primary enclosures containing catsmust contain a receptacle with sufficient clean litter to contain excreta and body wastes. The receptacle must be
cleaned with sufficient frequency in order to provide adequate clean litter for the animals and to decrease odors.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
