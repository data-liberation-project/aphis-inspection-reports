FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Official accounts report that the bobcat primary enclosure fence was cut open by vandals sometime between 24
June and 25 June 2015. As a result of this hole, the bobcat exited it's enclosure, past the public barrier fence and
went into the surrounding park. This animal was captured and returned to it's enclosure within a short period of time
after finding it in the park. The security alarms at the exhibit were not operating properly. Release of animals into
the surrounding environment can put them in danger. Among the conditions for a variance from a six foot perimeter
fence in a letter dated January 28, 2002 is an effective security system. An effective security system does not allow
vandals to scale a 3' 10" public barrier fence and cut a hole in the primary enclosure fence. The facility must have a
perimeter fence constructed in a manner that protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going over, under or through it and having contact with the animals in the facility. This
fence must also be constructed in a manner so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility. Or an effective security system must be in place to satisfy the conditions of the original
perimeter fence variance. Correct by 29 Sept. 2015.
This focused inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kendall Lundy, ACI and a facility representative.
