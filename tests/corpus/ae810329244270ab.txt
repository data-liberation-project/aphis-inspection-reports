ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 AM to
11:30 AM on 06-FEB-18.
Inspector attempted to contact licensee by knocking on the door, calling two cell numbers and sending a text. This
is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals. The licensee texted back at 12:44 PM. The licensee stated that he neglected to let
me know that he would be unavailable for inspection today.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
Additional Inspectors
