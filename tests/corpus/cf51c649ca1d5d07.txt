2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care (PVC) directs that Ivermectin should be administered to the adult dogs on a
monthly basis for internal parasites. The licensee is currently only giving Ivermectin quarterly. The PVC documents
other medication and supplements for parasite control and these other products are being given as directed and
appear to be efffective for intestinal parasite control. However, Ivermectin is the only product listed that would also
be effective as a heartworm preventative.
Animals housed primarily outdoors in a heartworm endemic area would be at high risk for heartworm disease
without the administration of an appropriate preventative. Ivermectin should be administered as directed by the
PVC for control of internal parasites. Facility practices should accurately reflect the guidelines and provisions of the
PVC in order to satisfy the requirements for adequate veterinary care under the Animal Welfare Act..
