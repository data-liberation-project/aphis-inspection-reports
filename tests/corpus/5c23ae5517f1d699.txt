SANITATION.
Petting zoo rabbits: Hardware cloth (1/2 inch wire) is used around the interior of the rabbit enclosure where the floor
meets the walls. The wire mesh has hay, hair and debris caught in portions of it and therefore the enclosure is not
maintained reasonably free of excreta, hair and cobwebs. The debris can promote spread of disease and harbor
pests that can create health risks for the rabbits.

Upper Idaho, roadside:
-Perimeter fence around dangerous animals is only 7 ft, 1 inch high, due to soil buildup around the base of the
fence. Potentially dangerous animals require a fence with an effective height of 8 ft.
-Same fence had a damaged and bent pole with chainlink separated from the pole, and pole was not firmly seated
in the ground. The fence must function as a secondary containment system for the animals.
Adjacent to Section 4 and chimps: Perimeter fence to the left of the storm gate has an effective height of
approximately 6 ft, at a junction where a lower section joins an upper section. There is a 1-2 ft hill next to the fence
