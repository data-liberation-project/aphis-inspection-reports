2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Disposition records were missing or incomplete for 2 nilgai, 1 chinchilla, 4 cavy's, 2 zebra, and 2 coatis. Acquisition
records were missing or incomplete for 5 rabbits.
Recordkeeping is important for animal welfare because it increases traceability of animals, allows for the recognition of
lost or missing animals, and aids in the investigation of missing or stolen animals.
Correct by 08/30/21 by maintaining complete and accurate records for animals on hand, as well as animals bought and
sold within the last year.

Facilities, outdoor.
Rabbits were not provided with artificial cooling when the ambient temperature exceeded 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
3 adult female lop-eared rabbits were housed in a large wood and wire primary enclosure, and 1 additional adult female
lop-eared rabbit was housed in an open-topped metal primary enclosure; both enclosures were located in the barn near
the entrance to the lemur encounter room. The ambient temperature in this area of the barn was 93.6 degrees Fahrenheit
and no artificial cooling was being provided for the rabbits. The rabbits were alert, hopping around, resting, and drinking
from water bottles. Two rabbits were breathing at a moderately increased rate while at rest.


In the feed storage room, 2 young rabbits were located in a plastic and wire crate (pet taxi), and one adult female lop-
eared rabbit was located in a wire cage. The temperature in the feed room was 91.9 degrees Fahrenheit and no artificial
cooling was being provided for the rabbits. The rabbits were alert, hopping around, resting, and eating.
Rabbits who are not provided with methods of artificial cooling when ambient temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit
may experience discomfort, heat stress, or dehydration. Young rabbits are especially susceptible to the negative effects of
exposure to hot temperatures.
Correct by 08/12/21 by providing rabbits with artificial cooling when ambient temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit,
and when needed to prevent overheating and discomfort. Immediately after the rabbits were inspected, the owner added
artificial cooling (fans) to the rabbit areas.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The property, which houses animals including kangaroos, porcupine, ring-tailed lemurs, pig-tailed macaque, and cavy’s in
outdoor enclosures, is not completely enclosed by a perimeter fence. Along the west side of the property there is no
perimeter fence at the back of the pasture adjacent to the creek. Along the driveway and along the road, there is a wire
fence that is approximately 4.5 feet tall.
A perimeter fence is required to prevent unauthorized entry of people and animals which could steal, injure, sicken,
harass, or kill the captive animals. Exotic animals such as these, housed in outdoor facilities, require a 6-foot-tall
perimeter fence around their enclosures.
Correct by constructing a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence of sufficient strength to prevent entry of unauthorized people or
animals. Alternatively, a variance may be requested in writing from the APHIS Administrator. A perimeter fence must also
be maintained as required by 3.78(d) for nonhuman primates.
3.131(d)



Sanitation.
There was a large number of flies in the barn, especially in the feed storage room and lemur/coati encounter rooms.
In the feed storage room (where 3 rabbits and 1 hedgehog were housed) there was a large number of flies on the floor, on
the walls, on feed bags, and flying in the air. There were numerous fly strips hanging from the ceiling, some of which were
completely covered with dead flies.
In the encounter room containing two adult red ruffed lemurs, there was a large number of flies on the walls, floor, and
flying in the air. There was a small amount of fecal material on the floor which was completely covered with flies, and
around which many flies were buzzing.
In the encounter room containing two juvenile ring-tailed lemurs and two juvenile coatis, there was a large number of flies
on the walls and on the bench seat.
Pests, including flies, can contaminate feed, spread disease, and bother or disturb animals.
Correct by 08/30/21 by maintaining a safe and effective program to control pests. Pest control must also be maintained as
required by 3.84(d) for nonhuman primates and 3.56(d) for rabbits.

This is a continuation of the report for the routine inspection conducted 08/10/21 and contains the remaining non-
compliances found during the inspection. The exit briefing was conducted with the owner on 08/12/21.
