FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On a majority of the enclosures there are extensive areas of rust and flaking paint covering the vertical cage bars
and horizontal beams near the bottom of the cages. The rust and paint, especially on vertical surfaces, could cause
injury to the sugar gliders as the animals spend time with their feet on these surfaces. Animals may accidentally
ingest the material through grooming or flakes getting into food. This can contribute to illness or injury to the
animals. Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
