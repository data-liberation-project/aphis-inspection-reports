Facilities, outdoor.
Since the last inspection this facility has acquired a North American porcupine. They are currently housing this animal in
an enclosure amongst their bird collection. However, this area is not enclosed by a 6' perimeter fence. Due to the fact that
the porcupine is housed out in that area 24/7, a perimeter fence will need to be erected around this enclosure or a
perimeter fence variance is granted. If a perimeter fence variance is requested all the pertinent information will need to be
submitted to the following email address - animalcare@usda.gov.
