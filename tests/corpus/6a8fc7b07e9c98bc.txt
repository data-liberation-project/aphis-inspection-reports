RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available during this inspection. Records were kept for deaths and
weanlings, but not for the number of adults or newborns. Records are required to adequately verify the total number
of guinea pigs housed at the facility and for evaluating the facility animal care program. Correct by ensuring there
are current records of animal totals, including the number of adults, weanlings, and newborns are maintained and
available for review for guinea pigs housed at the facility. Correct by August 29, 2017.
