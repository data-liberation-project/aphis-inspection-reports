2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Mac is a 515 lb California Sea Lion who is also arthritic. This pinniped comes out of his enclosure pool for a meet &
greet with the public as well as for training interactions with the keepers. When Mac was observed today to be
coming out of the pool, he slipped/tripped and fell down hard onto the door threshold which is several inches above
the present water line. This pinniped has to lift himself & climb out of the pool, over the threshold, and onto a ramp
located on the outside of the pool to leave the enclosure.
A better method shall be implemented so that he does not injure himself or exacerbate his arthritis when leaving his
pool for the interactions & meet & greets. This may be accomplished by (but not limited to) possibly raising the
current water level, installing a ramp in the water, or moving this animal to a more suitable pool to ensure that he will
not be injured when leaving his enclosure.
Correct immediately.
The inspection was conducted with the attending veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted with the
veterinarian, co-owner, & facility manager.
