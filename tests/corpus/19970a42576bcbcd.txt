3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Along the rear wall of the shelter building, the lower edge of the structure is rusted in multiple areas. The material
has flaked away to form holes and rough edges all along the wall. These areas are below the indoor/outdoor
access doors and along the adjoining walls. Material that has rusted to this degree cannot be adequately cleaned,
and flaking of the rusted metal may result in sharp points and edges which are a potential source of injury to the
enclosed animals. These rusted areas need to be repaired or replaced, and properly maintained in the future.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an enclosure housing corgis, the interior run contained a large web which had trapped several dead insects.
Though not in direct contact with the enclosed animals, this is a potential source of contamination to any animals
beneath the webbing and is also an indication that the interior run is not being cleaned adequately. The webbing
must be removed, and all dog housing areas must be cleaned as often as necessary to protect the health and well
being of the enclosed animals.
