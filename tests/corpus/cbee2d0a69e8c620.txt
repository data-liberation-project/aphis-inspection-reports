Primary enclosures.
During the inspection it was noted that the wooden / rope bridge apparatus in the bengal cat enclosure was in need of
repair. There are two ropes that are strung between wood slats. However, the rope was broken on the left side. This now
allowed the bridge to fall sideways. This apparatus needs to be addressed.
