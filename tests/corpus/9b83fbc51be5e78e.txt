2.40(a)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***On May 23, 2017 during a previous inspection conducted by other APHIS inspectors, a female Ibex, Pixie, was
observed to have a patchy, dull haircoat. She appeared to be underweight, as evidenced by protruding hip bones
and a prominent spine. The facility representative stated that she had always been like that. At that time Pixie had
not been examined by a veterinarian. On the current inspection conducted on August 17, 2017, we saw paperwork
by the current veterinarian that Pixie was seen on May 27, 2017. In the veterinarian's report it was recorded that
Pixie had a low body condition score and was thin and not thriving, it was the veterinarian's recommendation to cull
the animal. The licensee did not cull the animal and the animal was found dead in her pen 2 weeks later.
The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by
the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care
shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries and
provide a method for humane euthanasia. The licensee is required to follow the guidance of their attending
veterinarian.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure that housed a female Dromedary camel and her baby was lined with broken fencing that had sharp
points that were poking straight up and some points were poking straight into the pen. All enclosures must be kept
in good repair and free of sharp points and protruding edges in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of
timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure housing the eland did not have adequate shade to protect the animal from direct sunlight during
certain times of the day. The areas of shade provided was not large enough to allow the animal within the enclosure
to be protected from direct sunlight throughout the entire day. During the time of inspection a majority of the shade
provided by the structure was on the outside of the pen and not benefiting the eland in providing an adequateamount of shade. Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Near the eland enclosure, a large portion of the perimeter fence was in disrepair. One of the metal poles
stabilizing the chain link was leaning outward, away from the property at approximately a 30 degree slant. Another
metal stabilizing pole was leaning inward. Along one section of the fence, the metal bar at the top of the fence was
broken into two pieces.
*** Near the camel and sheep enclosure, an approximately 100 foot long segment of the perimeter fence was less
than 6 feet tall due to the amount of dirt and land that was leaning against it.
***Near the enclosures containing the coati, a tree was leaning on the perimeter fence causing the fence to lean
downward.
All of the issues cited above decrease the efficacy of the perimeter fence to function as a secondary containment
system for the regulated animals and to protect them from outside animals entering the premises.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment
system. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
