ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white male alpaca was observed to have a wound on his right front leg. The wound is approximately 6-8 inches
long and 3 inches wide. Most of the wound was scabbed over however, there were a few areas that appeared to be
flesh that were bright red in color. The alpaca was not limping on the injured leg, he was observed to be using his
hind leg to itch the wound. The owner stated that the wound was an injury from the clippers when the alpaca was
sheared approximately 2 weeks ago. The owner also indicated that he has not contacted his attending veterinarian
for the injury. He informed me that for the first 3-4 days that he applied scarlet oil to the wound and that is what the
red coloring is on the injury. After the owner ran out of scarlet oil he used a horse wound spray that was purchased
at a local farm supply store, he was applying that every 2-3 days. The bottle of spray was not able to be located
during the inspection. Lack of veterinary care for an injury can cause the animal more pain and discomfort. The
alpaca must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was contacted during the
inspection. The veterinarian told the owner to apply scarlet oil to the wound and an appointment was made for
tomorrow to examine the animal.

This was a focused inspection on the lions, tigers, hyena, and the white male alpaca.
