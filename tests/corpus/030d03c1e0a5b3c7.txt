2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
At the time of this inspection, no IACUC meeting minutes since April 23, 2014 were available to the APHIS official
for review. IACUC evaluations of the animal care program and facility semi-annual reviews must be conducted
every six months and be made available for review during regular business hours. This is required so that USDA
personnel can confirm that the IACUC members are evaluating the research facility's animal program, facilities, and
procedures.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with Jeanne Kjos, VMO, Cindy Digesualdo, VMO, and facility
representatives.
