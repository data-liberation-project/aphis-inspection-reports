2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A majority of the Records of Acquisition and Cats on Hand forms did not document the sex of the cat, the date of
acquisition or the birthdate. Several of the cat disposition records also did not contain the sex of the animal sold.
Failure to document the sex, date of acquisition, and birth can make it difficult to properly track regulated animals.
Dealers shall make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose information regarding all animals
owned, held or otherwise in his or her possession. Correct by 15 April 2022 by ensuring that the records fully disclose the
sex of the animals and the date of birth or acquisition.
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
There is an accumulation of cat hair on the upper portion of the walls and air conditioning units within the cat rooms found
in the two buildings behind the house. Within the second and third wire dog runs, there was an accumulation of old chair
stuffing material and debris on the ground.
Failure to clean animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the animals and can potentially attract pests.
Correct by 15 April 2022 by cleaning the walls and air conditioning units in the cat rooms, and removing the debris in the
dog enclosures.


3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Two of the outdoor dog enclosures have sharp metal points accessible to the dogs. In one of the middle pens with mesh
wire fencing, the door had a broken wooden board which had been replaced with an additional piece of wood. The screws
used to anchor the new piece of wood extend into the enclosure at head level. The left fence also has two nails that have
been partially bent down but still have exposed sharp ends approximately 4 feet off the ground. In the other middle pen
with mesh wire fencing, several areas of exposed wire ends are protruding into the enclosure. These sharp points vary in
height from dog level to higher up. There is also the sharp tip of a screw coming through a green support post half-way up
the wall of the enclosure.
Sharp points and edges inside primary enclosures can lead to potential injury, harm, and discomfort.
Correct by 15 April 2022 by ensuring all primary enclosures are free of sharp points and edges that could injure the dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
Two cat enclosures in the back building had chewed surface areas that prevent adequate cleaning and sanitation. The
front enclosure has a windowsill with chewed surfaces and torn off vinyl covering. The back enclosure has a chewed
windowsill with missing vinyl covering and chewed molding to the right of the door.
Surfaces that have been chewed or are missing impermeable coverings are unable to be adequately cleaned and
sanitized to prevent disease hazards, transmission, and build up of debris and dirt.
Correct by 15 April 2022 by enabling all surfaces in contact with the cats to be readily cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with 3.11(b) or be replaceable when worn or soiled.
3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


There is an accumulation of building materials, discarded metal wires, old travel crates, and other discarded matter on the
ground adjacent to the outdoor dog runs. When the dogs are released from their runs, they can easily come into contact
with these materials on the ground.
Accumulations of trash, excess building materials, and sharp objects in the area surrounding the dog kennels could cause
injury to the animals, make it difficult to conduct husbandry practices, and allow for the harborage of pests.
Premises, including the surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to
facilitate husbandry practices, and to eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests or vermin. Correct
by 22 April 2022 by removing the accumulation of building materials, metal wire, and other discarded matter around the
dog kennels.
