Requirements and procedures.
The company, acting as an intermediate handler for air carriers at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport, was found to
be operating and transporting regulated animals without a valid USDA certificate/registration. On July 5, 2021, the
company transported and received a dog at the cargo facility. Conducting regulated activities without a valid registration
does not allow for compliance inspections, assuring the company is compliant with the regulations and standards of the
Act. The intermediate handler must obtain a registration by completing and filing a properly executed registration form. A
link to the online registration form was provided to the facility representative.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the faciltiy representative.
