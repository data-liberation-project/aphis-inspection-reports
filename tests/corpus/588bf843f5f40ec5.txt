3.3(e)(1)(iii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
In the sheltered building housing 9 adult dogs and 2 puppies are primary enclosures made of wood that are not
impervious to moisture. In one enclosure there is moisture of some sort soaked into the walls. When asked the licensee
stated he had not treated any of the material to be impervious to moisture in probably over a year. Enclosures that are not
impervious to moisture allows urine, feces, and such moisture to be soaked into the porous material harboring bacteria
and diseases. All walls, boxes, houses, dens and other surfaces in contact with the animals must be impervious to
moisture. The licensee must ensure that these surfaces are impervious to moisture.
