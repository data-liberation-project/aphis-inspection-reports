Facilities, outdoor.
No 6-foot perimeter fence surrounds the primary enclosures holding the bison, the zebra, and the zebu. A missing
perimeter fence can’t prevent the escape of the animals contained therein if the primary enclosure fails by serving as a
secondary barrier. The perimeter fence provides protection to the animals and public. All outdoor housing facilities must
be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Perimeter
fencing 6’ high for the bison, zebra and zebu are required per this regulation. The 6’ perimeter fence is not required for
the traditional domestic farm animals. Correct by or before July 31, 2021.
