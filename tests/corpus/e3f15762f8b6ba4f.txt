FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An alpaca escaped from its enclosure and was never recovered. The incident occurred when the facility was
exhibiting the animal last fall. The facility staff noticed the animal was missing. It was discovered that a
gate/entrance door to the animal enclosure was not securely closed by the staff as per the facility manager. Lost
and escaped animals can become injured or die without proper care.
Assure that all animal enclosures are secured to prevent escapes.
To be corrected: From this day forward.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility manager.
