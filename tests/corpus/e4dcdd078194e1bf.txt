3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** In the past year the facility has acquired arctic foxes and kangaroos. The fox enclosure does not have a
secondary containment and there is no perimeter fence around the exotic animals at the facility. This needs to be
addressed and a perimeter fence that is 6 feet high needs to be constructed so that it protects the animals in the
facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
The licensee may also apply for a variance if they feel they are exempt from this requirement which would need to
be approved in writing by the administrator.
