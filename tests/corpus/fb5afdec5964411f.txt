2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific
guidance for the care of animals. There is no specific guidance for the parasite control of various species, only a list
of drugs. Species specific dosing and route is not included for any species or drug. Specific guidance from the
attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee. Additional specific guidance is required for the
PVC. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current
practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate care to the
animals. Correct this by developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all
species housed at the facility. Correct by November 1, 2015.
2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(4) Veterinary care: The licensee is removing the scent glands from young skunks without written
guidance from the attending veterinarian. Each exhibitor must establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include adequate guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding anesthesia and surgical
procedures. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all medical/surgical procedures
performed by the licensee or other facility personnel. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure
the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has
accurate guidance to provide adequate care to the animals. Correct this by developing with the attending
veterinarian a complete, accurate, written description of the method used to remove the scent glands to include the
procedure, facilities, equipment, anesthetics, and care of the animals. Correct by November 1, 2015.
