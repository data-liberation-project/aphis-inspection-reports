2.32(a) Critical Repeat

Personnel qualifications.
On January 21, 2022, 5 hamsters were found deceased in their enclosure. An investigation determined a caretaker had
not properly slid an enclosure completely into the rack system which caused a flap at the back of the enclosure to
improperly engage the lixit waterer, causing it to run and fill the enclosure below which contained the 5 hamsters.
Corrective actions taken have included retraining the staff, replacing the enclosures with a newer model, adding
enrichment which provides an elevated space for the hamsters, and redesigning the rack system to ensure enclosures
are always properly engaged.
It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians,
and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties. This responsibility
shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel.
3.25(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On February 7, 2022, two hamsters were found deceased in their enclosure. It was determined that the hamsters died of
dehydration. An investigation found that a rusty quick-connect fitting between the main water line and the rack system
had caused a decrease in water pressure to the rack and resulted in no water reaching the enclosure containing the two


hamsters. Further investigation by the facility found that these fittings were not designed for water systems and that there
were several of these fittings in use throughout the facility. All the fittings in the facility were changed to new ones
designed for use in watering systems and no further issues have been reported.
Hamsters housed in enclosures in rack systems rely on the structural integrity of that system to ensure the proper delivery
of water. Facilities for hamsters need to be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect them from injury.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
