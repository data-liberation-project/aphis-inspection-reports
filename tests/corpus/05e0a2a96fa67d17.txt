3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the den area for the hybrid cat named "Mystery" the linoleum floor was lifting and peeling, with some pieces of the
flooring missing. Surfaces in cat enclosures should be constructed and maintained so that they can be readily
cleaned and sanitized. A peeling floor surface could allow animal and food waste to accumulate, and does not allow
proper cleaning and sanitation, and this puts the health of the animals at risk.
All den boxes, and all surfaces in the animal enclosures, should be maintained and or replaced when worn, so that
proper cleaning and sanitation can occur.
To be corrected by November 9, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
