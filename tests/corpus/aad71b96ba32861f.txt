FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the goat and sheep enclosure some hazards were identified:
1.) A wire panel in the fence had come loose from the wood support, and there was an opening measuring two
feet wide, and one to two inches in height that had sharp wire ends protruding. This opening was located about two
to three feet off the ground, and was accessible to the animals, which poses a risk of injury.
2.) The back wall of the enclosure is made of plywood, and the surface is delaminating, with strips of material
peeling from the surface and collecting on the ground in the enclosure. This material could be harmful to the
animals if ingested.
The enclosure should be structurally sound and free of hazards. The facility should be institute a system of regular
review and maintenance of all animal enclosures to ensure that they are safe and secure. Hazards should be
minimized immediately, pending more permanent repairs.
To be corrected by 4/24/17.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
