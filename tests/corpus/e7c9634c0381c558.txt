At the time of this inspection it was noted that the records were not complete. Records need to be kept current and
accurate at all times. While reviewing the records it was noted that the goat kids that were born this year were not in
the records. All deaths and births will need to be documented.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. During this inspection it was noted that the door of the micro pig enclosure was in need of attention. The door is
constructed of a wood frame, with a wire mesh attached to the wood planks. However, at the bottom of the door the
2nd wood slat is detaching from the frame. This board is now loose and jagged edges of the wire mesh are
exposed. To ensure that the animals are not injured on this plank or mesh, and other animals are not able to gain
access, this door will need to be addressed.

2. This same pig enclosure also has a side panel that needs additional support. The entire pen is constructed of a
wood plank framework and wire mesh. There are two side panels and one panel at each end. However, the 2
panels on the right side have begun to loosen up and are now leaning into the pen. To ensure the integrity of this
fencing, these panels will need to be addressed.
