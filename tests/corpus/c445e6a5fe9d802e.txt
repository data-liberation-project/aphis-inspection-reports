3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
There is a buildup of grime, staining, and debris on the walls and wire surfaces of the brown capuchin enclosure and the
spider monkey enclosure. Hard surfaces in which non-human primates have contact must be spot cleaned daily and
sanitized to prevent accumulations of dirt, grime, and organic debris. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the
animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned
and sanitized when necessary to prevent a buildup of grime, staining, and organic debris. Correct by March 19, 2022.
3.78(d) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
Perimeter fence. A section of the perimeter fence approximately 10 feet in length has not been repaired since a large tree
fell on top and crushed the fence in the fall of 2020. The damaged fence is behind the row of outdoor non-human primate
enclosures. The 5 non-human primates are currently housed indoors during this time of year. The damaged section of the
perimeter fence must be repaired to keep unwanted species such as dogs, skunks, foxes, cats, and raccoons from
coming in contact with the non-human primates. Remains uncorrected.
3.81(b)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.

The indoor enclosure for the spider monkey does not have any swings or bars for the animal to brachiate. The physical
environment must provide enrichment to allow for species-typical activities such as swings, perches, bars, and other cage
complexities. Failure to follow the environment enhancement plan can result in psychological distress and abnormal
behaviors in non-human primates. Correct by ensuring the spider monkey has swings or bars to allow him to brachiate.
