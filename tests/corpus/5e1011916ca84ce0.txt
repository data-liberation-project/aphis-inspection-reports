2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
On July 1, 2016 nineteen Big Brown Bats were transferred between two rolling flight cages with opaque nest boxes
so that the primary enclosure could be cleaned. At that time the animals were counted and their health was
assessed. The enclosure in which the animals originated was cleaned first by being hosed down then by passing
through a cage-washing system. Based on IACUC investigation results, one 3 year old female Big Brown Bat was
left in the opaque nest box and was found dead on August 4, 2016. This bat was missed by the animal care staff
and the cage wash staff and was sent through the cage wash. At the time the animal was found the carcass was
desiccated and a necropsy would not have provided a time or cause of death. Since the time of this incident, the
IACUC has conducted a full and thorough investigation. The USDA inspector was notified of this incident soon after
the Attending veterinarian was notified. The investigator and animal care staff have responded by creating a new
identification system for the animals as well as implementing multiple Standard Operating Procedures to prevent
re-occurrence.
Inappropriate handling of animals can lead to unnecessary pain or distress. Handling of all animals shall be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection was conducted January 10-11th the exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on
January 11, 2017.
