Facilities, general.
One stall in the rhino barn has damage to the bottom panel of the wall, exposing sharp metal edges and insulation from
the wall. The rhino barn has several stalls on either side of a main wall divider. The walls are covered in metal sheeting
and guard rails. The third stall from the right has a damaged lower panel along the floor. There is one larger hole in the
metal approximately 4” in size with sharp metal edges exposed and bent outwards into the stall. There is evidence of
white granular insulation covering the area immediately adjacent to the hole. Additionally, there are several smaller lines
of torn metal extending an additional 3-4’ towards the front barrier of the enclosure. Damaged facilities can create sharp
edges and potentially injure the animals in the enclosure or lead to a loss of structural integrity.

Correct by January 12, 2022 by ensuring all facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
3.129(b)

Feeding.
Self-feeders located in the kangaroo enclosure have excessive amounts of dirt and grime built up on the top rim and
extending down the back wall of feeder. The enclosure contains two self-feeders which have approximately a 4” opening


that allows the kangaroos to feed from. On the back wall of the feeder opening there is an angled panel that prevents feed
from falling on the animals as they eat. Both feeders had a dark brown substance built up on the angled panel. There was
a line of brown debris extending the length of the opening along with some areas of thick accumulation that could be
scraped off with a finger. According to the facility, the feeders undergo a “deep cleaning” once a week along with being
checked daily. Self-feeders that are dirty and contain layers of grime and debris can expose the animals to potential
disease risks and lead to the contamination or deterioration of food.

Correct by January 6, 2022 by ensuring all self-feeders are kept clean and sanitary at all times. The facility immediately
took action to clean the feeders.

Separation.
At the time of the inspection, all 8 rhinos were housed inside due to inclement weather. Three intact 2-year-old males
were housed in one stall together. The apparent dominant male was behaving in an aggressive manner towards the other
two males and all three had visible scrapes and cuts around their horns, mouths and the back sides of legs from
altercations. The subordinate male had his back to a corner with his head down and had an averted gaze while remaining
alert. At one point two males were pushing each other in an aggressive manner and at another point all three males were
in a standoff for over an extended period of time with the subordinate male averting his gaze away from the other two
males. This animal came up to the inspectors for contact and quickly had to swing around to be aware of the proximity of
the other two males in the stall. Having these three males in the same stall does not provide enough space while housed
indoors to be able to get away from each other physically or visually. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must
be compatible and this current housing dynamic is causing stress and discomfort to the animals as they cannot get away
from each other.
