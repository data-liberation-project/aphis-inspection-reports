3.8(c)(3)(ii)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The facility's written canine exercise plan states that the dogs individually housed dogs will be housed in enclosures
that provide at least 200% of the minimum floor space. However, 3 dogs in the UBA did not have the required
minimum floor space needed within their enclosure to ensure adequate exercise space.
Room 2A
There was a reddish colored, Female hound (#B1055), measured 29 inches long from the tip of the nose to base of
tail housed in a primary enclosure measuring 48 inches by 48 inches totaling 2304 square inches (16 sq. ft). A dog
29 inches long is required to have at least 2405 sq. inches (17 sq. ft) to provide adequate opportunity for exercise.
There was a tan and white colored, female hound (#B1114), which measured 33 inches long from tip of the nose to
the base of the tail. She was housed in a primary enclosure measured 48 inches (4ft) by 48 inches (4ft) totaling
2304 square inches (16 sq. ft). However, a dog 33 inches is required to have a minimum of 3042 sq. inches (21.2
sq. ft) to provide adequate opportunity for exercise.
Room 3A
There was a white and brown spotted female hound (#B1274), which measured 37 inches long from tip of the nose
to base of tail. She was housed in a primary enclosure that measured 52 inches by 48 inches totaling 2436 square
inches (16.9 sq. ft.). A dog 37 inches long is required to have a minimum of 3698 sq. inches (25.7 sq. ft) to provide
adequate opportunity for exercise.
As per 9 CFR 3.8 (c) (3) (ii), facilities must maintain individually housed dogs in cages, pens, or runs that provide at
least twice the minimum floor space required.
At the time of inspection, each of these dogs were transferred into more appropriate sized enclosures. In addition,
the facility needs to implement a mechanism to ensure that dogs are measured regularly so they are housed in the
appropriate sized enclosure.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 30 April 2016
