FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural strength,
The fence on the southeast side of the enclosure housing 2 Mule Deer has a 2 inch gap that runs horizontally
between the two support poles. The gap in the fence is about nose level of the deer and the animals could
potentially push the fence apart and become trapped or injured. This area of the fence is not structurally sound.
Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair to contain and protect the
animals from injuries.

cause injuries to the animals. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good
repair to protect the animals from injuries.
