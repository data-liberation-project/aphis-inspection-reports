ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no written program of veterinary care available for review at the time of the inspection. The written
program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending
veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written
program of veterinary care is completed by the attending veterinarian and is available for review during USDA
inspections.
