ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A one week old Sichuan takin was observed by the APHIS Inspectors to be limping on its right foreleg. The animal
was seen running and bearing weight on the leg prior to observing the limp. This condition had not been previously
noticed by the facility staff. The animal's condition could indicate an injury, or other veterinary medical condition
which could be painful.
The animal needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to properly diagnose and provide a plan for treating and/or
monitoring the condition.
