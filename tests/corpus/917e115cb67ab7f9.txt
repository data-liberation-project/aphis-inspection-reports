2.50(c)

Time and method of identification.
There was a cat being exhibited that did not have any means of identification on the animal or the enclosure such as a
collar and tag, tattoo, or microchip.
Lack of appropriate identification can result in a failure of animals to be tracked, maintained, and treated on an individual
basis and an inability to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, and healthcare documentation.
Exhibitors shall identify all live cats on the premises with an official tag, tattoo, or microchip.
