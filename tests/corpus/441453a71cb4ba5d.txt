HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***On January 28, 2014 there was a fire in the petting zoo stables that resulted in two goats' death. The fire report
determined that the fire was started by heating lamps that were too close to combustible materials inside the stable.
Handling of all animals shall be done in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort. Precautions should be taken to safely provide heat when needed for the animals to ensure the safety of
these animals. Correct immediately.
This was a focused inspection on the goat exhibit.
