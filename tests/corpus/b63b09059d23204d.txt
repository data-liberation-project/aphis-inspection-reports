ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female (tan and white) smooth haired guinea pig housed in row 6, top enclosure was observed with hair
loss around the nose. The hair loss was approximately 2 cm in diameter surrounding the nose and above the
mouth. The were several scabs on the bridge of the nose. There were 8 adults and 4 young in this enclosure. There

animals are identified as needing care the facility must either initiate care as outlined by the PVC or obtained care
by a veterinarian. This animal requires examination by a veterinarian to prevent a worsening of the condition and to
prevent health risks to other guinea pigs housed in the same enclosure. Additionally, the licensee must provide
documentation of such examination and treatment to APHIS officials upon request. Correct by September 14, 2017.
