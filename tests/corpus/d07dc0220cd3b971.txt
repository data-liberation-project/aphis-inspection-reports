2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1200 on
11/06/2014.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door. I also honked my horn and called the contact number. I then
waited for 30 minutes.
End of report.
