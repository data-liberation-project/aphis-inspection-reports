*** The facility could not provide a consultant written agreement with the AV and the AV confirmed he had not been
to the facility in several years. This does not constitute regularly scheduled visits to the facility. This needs to be
addressed and the facility needs to have a written program of veterinary care to assure the health care needs of the
animals are being met.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The lynx seemed to have difficulty focusing visually on the inspector and appeared to have an issue with the
eyes and eyelids. The third eyelid was elevated in the left eye and moving up and down with no ability to focus. This
animal should be assessed by the attending veterinarian to determine any vision issues or concerns with the eyes.
*** In addition, the black bear was reluctant to get up and was moving along the ground on its forearms. This could
be a sign of arthritis or another underlying condition. This animal also has hair loss on her nose and the skin
appears dry and flaky. The condition of the bear needs to be communicated to the attending vet for assessment and
possible treatment options.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The platform for the bear is in disrepair with broken boards and nails exposed. This platform needs to be
removed and replaced to keep structures in good condition for the safety of the animal.
3.131SANITATION.
*** Currently the bear enclosure is being hosed out, but the feces and fur are left just outside the enclosure and are
not fully removed to reduce odors. The cleaning of the area needs to be addressed to reduce disease hazards and
odor and for the health of the animal.
