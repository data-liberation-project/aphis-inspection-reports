Ninja the black leopard has an old tail injury that has healed but periodically becomes red, inflamed, and swollen
due to Ninja licking and sucking on his tail. About 1 to 2 inches of the tip of the tail is hairless, red, and swollen to
approximately the size of a quarter. It appears that there could possibly be a distal caudal vertebra dislocation as
well. Ninja was observed licking the tip of the tail during the inspection. This condition needs to be addressed by
the attending veterinarian.

The grey and white alpaca housed with two other alpaca in the enclosure in back of the facility has elongated incisor
teeth. The teeth are protruding from the lower jaw and growing upward towards the base of the nose. This animal
was observed eating normally and had good body conformation indicating the elongated teeth may not yet have
caused problems with normal chewing. However, this condition needs to be addressed by the attending
veterinarian and measures taken to reduce the length of the teeth before they hinder normal chewing and eating.
Routine observation of hoof stock teeth needs to be started and maintained to ensure the health and well being of
the animals.
