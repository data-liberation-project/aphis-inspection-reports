ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- A geriatric Cow, (cid:28)Twister(cid:29), had an approximate 7cm X 7cm, raised lesion on the right hip area of the upper rump.
This appears to be a chronic lesion which is partially crusted over, contains a thick, reddened area of mixed
granulation and keratinized tissue. During observation, this cow did not actively attempt to rub or bother this area,
and there was no evidence of pain, infection, or parasites. At time of inspection the cow was living on an off-site
pasture. This cow should be evaluated by a veterinarian to assess her health and to provide an appropriate
treatment plan.
Corrected at time of inspection
- An improved system of checking and monitoring the cows on a regular basis must be in place to identify any
health problems in a timely manner. Continued care and rechecks as indicated on the veterinary records must be
followed and documented.
