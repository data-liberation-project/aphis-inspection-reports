the 7006 forms that are not next to the corresponding puppy on the puppy records. . The licensee has the number
of puppies per litter and sex, however no ID numbers that can be traced from that litter record to the 7006
Disposition form of sale. Several of the disposition forms(7006) are missing signatures and dates on the bottom of
the forms.
It is important to keep updated and complete records for proper management and care of the regulated animals.
All regulated animals Acquired by the licensee must be accounted for on the On Hand records (7005), keeping all
sales, deaths and transfers updated and followed by the corresponding Disposition forms (7006). All information

going from the facility. Proper puppy records must be kept, which includes providing all puppies ID numbers that
can be traced back to the female they were born to, and the females and males must be identified (include tag
number) so they can be found on the 7005 (Acquisition forms) if they are located at the facility.
