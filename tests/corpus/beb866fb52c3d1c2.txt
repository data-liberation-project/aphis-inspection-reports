2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several dogs (a Bichon #078377827, a small Yorki # 072034855 and a Poodle # 069122300) were observed
continuously circling/spinning in their enclosures during the inspection process. This occurred when the inspector
was in front of the enclosure and continued as the inspector walked down the aisle and looked back to see if the
behavior stopped. A few of these dogs were co-housed and would continue the behavior around the other animals.
This is an abnormal behavior pattern for these animals and could be indicative of stress or another health issue.
The licensee has observed these behaviors and stated that they will stop when the dogs are allowed outside but
begin again when in the enclosure. The licensee has not communicated these abnormal behaviors with the vet to
address the issue. Daily observation of the animals should focus on their health and well- being which would include
their psychological well- being. The attending vet needs to evaluate these animals for diagnosis of the cause of
these behaviors and develop an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. Written documentation of the
Attending Veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding alterations to cage space, provisions of enrichment and any
other steps necessary to address this abnormality shall be maintained by the licensee for review by APHIS
Officials.Additionally, the licensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of these recommendations
for review.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** The licensee did not have any id numbers on puppies that have recently whelped. In a few whelping boxes there
were puppies fostered by other dams. These puppies need to be identified as they have been separated from their
initial litter and dam. In addition the facility is not keeping records of puppies that have died prior to being identified
by microchip. The facility may maintain these numbers on cage cards for the whelping boxes as long as the cage
cards are maintained for inspection. This needs to be corrected to ensure dogs are identified in a timely manner forrecord keeping purposes.

3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***The main kennel is pressure washed daily. The dogs are not removed from the enclosures during cleaning and
many of the dogs on the bottom tier of the enclosures were very wet. Some of the dogs appear to have skin and
hair issues potentially due to being wet and then in a humid environment. A yorki # 078093019 has ears where the
skin is irritated and ragged around the edges possibly to being consistently damp. The facility needs to come up
with a plan to ensure dogs are not getting wet during daily cleaning. This needs to be addressed for their health and
well being.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
