3.4(b) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
There was one adult, female, chocolate Labrador Retriever in an outdoor enclosure that did not have adequate
shelter. At 2pm on 5/9/14 the licensee had moved the dogs from a shared enclsure with one dog house, back into
two separate enclosures. The dog in the enclosure to the right did not have a shelter. It rained the previous day and
the National Weather Service provides a local forecast with rain and thunderstorms for the next 4 days. Adequate
shelter is necessary to protect the animals from the elements. The licensee shall provide one or more shelter
structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each
animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to the
shelter structures, one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large enough to contain all the
animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs or cats
must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor.
This focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee on May 9, 2014. The non-compliant item
was discussed with the licensee during the inspection. This inspection was limited to the direct item 3.4b found
during a routine inspection on May 7,2014. The report was delivered to a facility representative.
