ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection the dental health of random dogs was assessed.
*Animal #4697-F, a beagle, had dark brown to tan hard material attached to most of the cheek teeth and upper
canines. The gums were inflammed and swollen above the upper premolars and molars. Green material was noted
at the gumline adjacent to the upper canines. The gums were swollen and pulled away above the upper canines.
Records indicated this animal was acquired in 2010, and has not had a dental cleaning performed while at the
facility.
*Animal #4489-F, a beagle, had brown to tan hard material covering the surface of all visible cheek teeth and the
upper canines. The gums above the affected teeth were red and swollen. A review of medical records indicated this
animal had a dental cleaning 13 months ago.
The above described signs are consistent with dental disease which can be painful and cause systemic health
problems.The veterinarian should be consulted for the identification, diagnosis and treatment of any dogs affected
with these symptoms.
Although the facility has performed 40 dental cleanings since the last inspection some dogs are still in need of
veterinary care and treatment. The facility should assess the adequacy of the current treatment plan to ensure
appropriate dental health is maintained for the dogs at the facility.
