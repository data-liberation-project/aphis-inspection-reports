FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The night houses for two giraffes were recently constructed. They are made of corrugated metal and wood. There
are several areas within the two enclosures that contain sharp edges or points including: Siding, air conditioning
vents, door frame corners, and nails protruding from the ceiling. These areas pose a potential safety hazard for the
animals and can cause punctures, scratches, or lacerations. The licensee must ensure that enclosures are made in
such a way as to protect the animals inside from injury. Repair or replace hazardous areas inside the night houses.
