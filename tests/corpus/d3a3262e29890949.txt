* An adult female English Bulldog named "Lady" with the microchip ID # 052376076 had yellow hardened discharge
surrounding her left eye. All of the tissue surrounding the eye was a deep red color and there was a raised redden
area of tissue in the inside corner of the eye. The licensee was aware of the raised tissue in the corner of the eye
but had not observed the severity of the redden tissue encompassing the eye or the discharge and had not provided
treatment. Eye conditions can be irritating and painful to the animal and if left untreated can lead to serious medical
conditions. The licensee shall have the dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and obtain a written diagnosis and
treatment plan which should be made available upon the next inspection. Veterinary care should be provided as
prescribed and a record of treatment should be added to the animal's health records. TO BE CORRECTED BY:

treating the area. Open lesions can be irritating and painful and if left untreated can become infected. The licensee
shall consult their attending veterinarian to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan for the animal. Veterinary care
should be provided as prescribed and a record of treatment should be added to the animal's health records. TO BE

*** A white, adult female Poodle with the microchip #4BE24F6208 had matted hair on her face, buttocks and back
legs. Unkempt and matted facial hair can obstruct the dog's vision and cause eye issues. Matted hair on the body
can be irritating, cause tugging sensations and can lead to skin conditions. The licensee shall incorporate a
proactive approach to hair coat maintenance by grooming animals before mats are formed. TO BE CORRECTED
