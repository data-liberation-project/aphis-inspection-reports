2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Eleven containers of outdated medications (including antibiotics and a sedative) were noted in the drug storage
area. Additionally other containers were inadequately labeled - not specifying which dog was to receive the
medication or the expiration date, or being very difficult to read due to fading of the label. There had been significant
improvements made in the cleanliness and organization of the drug storage area since the last inspection.
Use of outdated medications can contribute to illness or cause harm in animals, as compounds can become
ineffective or deteriorate with time. Appropriate methods, including administration of clearly labeled, in-date
medications, must be used to prevent, control, and treat diseases and injuries of regulated animals.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All dog shelters, being on pallets, are raised above ground level. However, not all of the surface area of some
pallets is covered by the shelters. The result is that an animal could injure itself if it were to catch a leg or paw
between the exposed slats of the pallet when entering or exiting the shelter. To protect the animals from injury, this
situation must be addressed.
3.1(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The freezer where meat is stored is iced over and should be defrosted and cleaned. It also appears quite old and its
future reliability is questionable. There was also a lack of clear organization of the old and newer meat packs in the
freezer. To prevent the risk of food deterioration and/or contamination, which can cause illness in animals, this
situation should be addressed.
The knives used to cut meat fed to the hybrids had bits of meat on them and the cutting board had juices and blood
from meat on its surface. Feeding of the animals had been completed some time ago. Materials used to prepare
food for the animals should be kept clean after use so as to not attract pests, and to prevent contamination of the
food which can cause illness in animals.3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At this time, none of the wooden shelters have a wind/rain break at the entrances to protect the dogs from the
elements. This is particularly important because the winter climate in the area can be severe. Shelters in outdoor
facilities for dogs or cats must be provided with a wind and rain break at the entrance for the health and comfort of
the animals.
3.11 REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a large amount of debris from meat packs strewn across the ground near the food preparation area
outside. It was explained that birds had likely gotten into the trash. Failure to contain food waste securely can lead
to disease transmission to the animals, either from food debris getting into enclosures, or spread from pests
consuming the waste. Premises where housing facilities are located, including surrounding grounds, must be kept
clean to facilitate husbandry practices and eliminate living and/or feeding areas for pests.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Caretaker on 12/3/2014.
