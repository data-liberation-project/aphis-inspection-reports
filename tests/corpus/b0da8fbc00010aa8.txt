HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Most of the plastic shelters being used for the dogs housed in the outdoor facility are chewed and worn on the
edges and at the entryways. These shelters are not in good repair and require maintenance or replacement.
Chewed and worn shelters can eventually affect the structural strength of the shelters which can become an injury
hazard to the dogs. Correct this by repairing or replacing these shelters.

3.1(f)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The drainage system for the outside washdowns of the sheltered kennel and the outdoor kennel is not functioning
properly. This drainage system is a comprised of half circle pieces of pipe that collect the runoff to an open drain.
There is excessive splash over of this runoff lying on the ground next to the pipes and areas where the washdowns
do not connect to the pipes properly allowing the runoff to fall to the ground. This area has an excessive odor and is
a breeding ground for pests. The licensee must repair this drainage system to ensure it is functional and carries the
waste and runoff to the drain without allowing it to spill onto the ground and become a disease hazard.

3.9(b)
FEEDING.
*** Many of the self-feeders being used at this facility are worn and chewed. These feeders require repair or
replacement to ensure they can be cleaned and sanitized. Excessively chewed cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized as required and can lead to food contamination. One self-feeder was found in the first outdoor enclosure
housing an adult female and 6 puppies with caked feed in the bottom. This feed is not safe for the dogs to eat and
the feeding of caked feed can lead to health problems or digestive upset. All feeders must be kept in good repair
and maintained clean and sanitary.
Correct by: 01 AUG 2014 for replacement of chewed feeders, 04 JULY 2014 for cleaning feeder with caked feed.
***Inspection conducted with the licensee's wife. Exit interview conducted by phone with the licensee.
