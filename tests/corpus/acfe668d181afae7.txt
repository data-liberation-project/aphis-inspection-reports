HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The divider fence between two enclosures on the south side of the "blue kennel" building is rusted that has resulted
in a hole approximately 4"X4" as well as some wire points. This hole could allow dogs to pass through it and the
wire points could cause injury to the dogs. All housing facilities must be constructed in a manner so dogs are
securely contained and protected from injury. Correct by 4 Sept. 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the indoor portion of one dog enclosure of the "blue trailer" there are areas where the paint has been scratched
off the walls, there is a gap between the flooring material and the wall and a portion of the material on the wall is
pulled away from the wall. All of these areas allow for the accumulation of dirt, debris and disease causing
organisms. All surfaces must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
