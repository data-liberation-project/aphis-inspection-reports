ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two adult hamsters were identified as being unable to open their eyes during this inspection. A hamster identified
as a "tortoise shell" in an enclosure with two other hamsters was unable to open the left eye and 3/4 of the right eye
appeared sealed. A cream colored hamster housed with nineteen other hamsters was unable to open either eye
and the periocular hair around the eyes appeared moist.
The facility manager was unable to manually open the eyes of the hamsters and sealed eyes could possibly indicate
infection is present or that trauma to the eyes may have occurred. Ocular infection or injury can indicate
compromised heath and/or cause discomfort to the animals. According to the manager the hamsters were delivered
to the facility the day before and appeared physically normal at that time. These animals should be examined by a
veterinarian and an appropriate treatment plan implemented.
