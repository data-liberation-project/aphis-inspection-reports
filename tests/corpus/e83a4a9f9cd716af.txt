2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Availability of records.
1. At the time of the inspection, the zookeeper was off and the authorized person on the premises did not know
where the documents and records that are required under the AWA Regulations (i.e. the written Program of
Veterinary Care and records for the animals) are kept. As a result, these required documents and records were not
available for review at the time of the inspection.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all documents and records that are required to be kept under the AWA should
be available at the time of an inspection so the required records can be reviewed to determine the facility's
compliance with the provisions of the AWA. All authorized personnel at a facility should know where the required
records are kept so that the documents can be made available for review at the time of an inspection.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - Exit briefing held 10/6/16 both on-site and by phone with facility representatives and APHIS VMOs Paula
