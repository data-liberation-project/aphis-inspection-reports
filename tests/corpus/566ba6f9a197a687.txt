SANITATION.
Nine enclosures were noted to have an accumulation of soiled bedding material. The bedding was wet, malodorous,
brown in color, and compacted to the solid floors of the enclosures. Several animals were noted to have yellow to
brown staining of their flank fur. The current cage cleaning schedule is insufficient to prevent accumulation of soiled
bedding and other debris. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta
or debris.
