3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on the plastic wall panels of an enclosure that two five month old
Newfoundland dogs can come in contact with. The affected enclosure is located on the south side of the outdoor
facility and is the fifth one from the west end. The licensee stated that it’s been about a month since the walls were
cleaned.
Cleaning and sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease
hazards. It indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if
needed.
