Medical treatment
One adult retriever #194 was noted as having a silver dollar sized protrusion coming out of its back side. This
protrusion appeared to have a crusty surface and was discovered because the animal seemed to be uncomfortable
when it walked. The animal had neither been assessed by a veterinarian, nor had there been any treatment for the
anomaly. Without proper treatment of wounds or infection, animals are at risk of serious infection, injury, and
worse. The animal listed above must be assessed by a veterinarian and any treatment plan given must be followed.
#194 was assessed by a veterinarian before the report was delivered.

Daily Observation
One adult retriever #194 was noted as having a silver dollar sized protrusion coming out of its back side. This
protrusion appeared to have a crusty surface and was discovered because the animal seemed to be uncomfortable
when it walked. The licensee had no proof that the anomaly had been observed prior to this. Without adequate
daily observation of all animals and timely communication with the attending veterinarian, animals are at risk of
infection, injury, and worse. The animal listed above must be assessed by a veterinarian and proper daily
observation of animals must be conducted. Correct by
#194 was assessed by a veterinarian before the report was delivered.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
RustIn at least two of the indoor/outdoor enclosures on the north side of the small dog outdoor runs have rust on the
bottom of the cyclone fencing that has eaten completely through exposing jagged edges. At least one of the metal
springs used to connect the food receptacles to the wall of the enclosures are rusted to an extent that it cannot be
properly sanitized. Many areas on the metal walls throughout the facility have chipped or scratched paint and the
metal has begun to rust. Surfaces that are excessively rusted cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized because the
surfaces become rough and corroded which traps dirt and dust, and the structural strength of the enclosures may
be compromised which poses a serious hazard to the animals housed within. The licensee must ensure that
surfaces and equipment are in good repair, and are free of excessive rust at all times.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning
There are excessive amounts of animal feces in the outdoor portions of the enclosures. Some of the waste material
was noted as having mold covering the surface. On the inside portion of the southward building, between the
enclosures closest to the heating system and the wall, there is an abundance of animal hair and debris built up.
Insects, vermin, disease and odors can accumulate and cause harm to the animals if waste is not removed from
enclosures on a daily basis. Licensee must thoroughly clean primary enclosures and ensure that adequate daily
cleaning is preformed.
