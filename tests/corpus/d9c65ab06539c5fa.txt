ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 14 year old male cynomologus, number 1824, is not using his rear legs at all. He is exhibiting contracted stiff
legs, and moves around with his forelegs. No lesions were observable from cage side. There are no notations in his
medical record about this condition as to when did it start, is it getting worse, or have any treatments been tried.
The new Attending Veterinarian needs to examine this animal and make suggestions for his care.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are four groundhogs in individual cages housed outside. Since the last inspection, they were moved under a
roofed shelter. The property where the shelter is located only has a 4 - 5 foot livestock fence around it. A separate
6 foot perimeter fence located at least 3 feet away from the animal enclosures is required for all wild animals unless
a variance is obtained. To be corrected by 4-7-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted withTSS President and Facilities Manager.
