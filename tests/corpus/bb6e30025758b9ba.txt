2.31(d)(1)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol #46372 and Protocol #47056 both received annual reviews in April 2016 but neither one had an adequate
search for alternatives to painful procedures. Protocol #46372 had a search which yielded five results as indicated
by the Principle Investigator (Pl). None of the results were found to have alternatives. Protocol #47056 stated that
"(cid:28)No items were found for either key word search".(cid:29) A search yielding low numbers of articles indicates a strong
likelihood that the terms used were to restrictive. In both Protocols the Pl used qualifiers that would limit the
usefulness of the search. The principal investigator must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more
than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and provide a written narrative description of the methods
and sources, used to determine that alternatives were not available. Alternatives that would: Reduce, Refine, and/or
Replace the procedures performed on animals will lessen the overall pain and distress.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility Attending Veterinarian.
