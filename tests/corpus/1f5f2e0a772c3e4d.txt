ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30PM on
19-Sep-17.
A facility representative informed me that the manager was away for the remainder of the day for an appointment
and that employees at the facility could not step away from their tasks to complete an inspection.
