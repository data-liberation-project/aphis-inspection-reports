Current food storage is now in an adjacent room to the goat barn, and is now being opened and eaten by rodents.
The food supplies for the animals must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies against deterioration,
molding, or contamination by vermin. This needs to be addressed to protect the food supplies and the health of the
animals.
