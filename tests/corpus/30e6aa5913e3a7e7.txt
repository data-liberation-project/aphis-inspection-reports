3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are some areas on the floors in the primary enclosures for the gorilla - trailers X and Y - where there is
chipping and missing paint, especially around the toilets. Plans to make repairs have been appropriately delayed,
since the last remaining gorilla on site will be leaving the facility within the next two months, and the priority at this
time is training him to facilitate the transport. Repairing floors in his enclosure at this time would be disruptive and
delay training efforts.
This regulation requires that surfaces in non-human primate enclosures be maintained and/or replaced on a regular
basis in order to facilitate adequate cleaning. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces can impede cleaning,
which may create unsanitary conditions.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
