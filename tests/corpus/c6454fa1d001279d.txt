Facilities, indoor.
On Dec. 8, 2021, the temperature in a room housing naked mole rats rose to temperatures incompatible with the health of
that species. The room is set by the facility to maintain a temperature of 87-91 degrees for the health and comfort of this


species. Animals were exposed to ambient temperatures above this range between 11:10am and 1:50pm. When the
issue was identified by facility staff, immediate measures were taken to reduce the room temperature and provide
veterinary and supportive care. 16 animals died as a result of acute heat stress.

The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities shall not be allowed to rise above temperatures compatible with the
health of the animal.

Corrective measures had been implemented at the time of inspection. To remain corrected from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director and Assistant Director of the Office of Research
Compliance.
