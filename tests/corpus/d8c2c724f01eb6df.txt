2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The marmoset appears thin and unthrifty. The hair coat is matted and there is a
clump of hair hanging from its back. There is some hair loss on the ventral aspect of the base of its tail and the hair
appears sticky and unclean on the tail and rear end. The marmoset is not grooming itself and this may be a sign
that the animal is unwell or feeling poorly. Marmosets are small animals that can easily become dehydrated and
weak. The marmoset has not been seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for its current condition. Once the
APHIS Official identified the condition of the marmoset, an employee called the attending veterinarian for the small
animals to arrange for an appointment today.

Each exhibitor must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by having the marmoset
seen by the attending veterinarian and following the recommendations of the veterinarian.
Note: The female black alpaca with hair loss on its nose cited on the November 2, 2016 inspection report was seen
by the attending veterinarian for the large animals.
3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.75(c)(2) Maintenance and replacement of surfaces: The first enclosure housing two capuchin monkeys
has a rope in the outdoor portion of the enclosure that is covered with feces on the lower end with the knots. The
feces contaminated rope may be a source of bacteria that could be a disease hazard for the animals. Surfaces of
housing facilities, including objects within the facility, that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced
when worn or soiled. Correct by cleaning or removing the rope contaminated with feces. Correct by February 16,
2017.
This inspection was conducted with an animal caretaker and the exit interview was conducted with the co-owner.
