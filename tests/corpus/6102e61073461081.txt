PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Currently there are two kennels that have 2 dogs in each one that have an indoor temperature controlled area that
is too small for both dogs to lie down in a normal comfortable manner. One enclosure has 2 adult German
Shepard's(38-44") with an indoor area of only 12 sq. ft, which does not allow them enough room for both animals to
lie down on their sides to extend their legs, they are in a crowded position. The other enclosure with an adult
German Shepard and a beagle are in another12 sq. ft enclosure, where when the Shepard jumps or turns around it
lands on top of the beagle.
The lack of proper spacing for dogs can cause unnecessary stress or injuries in cramped conditions. While the dogs
can go outside in the run area for more space, the indoor portion is the only temperature controlled area and both
dogs need to be able to comfortably lie down inside to take advantage of the warmer or cooler environment
provided in order to get away from the elements outside when needed. There can be an increase in stress and
compatibility issues with dogs housed together if there is not enough room to separate.
The licensee must provide housing of appropriate size to allow the dogs to lie down, stand and turn around without
being hindered by other dogs or the facility itself. There are larger enclosures that the doubled up dogs could go
into, while moving the single dogs into the smaller ones.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently there are several primary enclosure areas that have an accumulation of excreta that has piled up in the
outdoor run area that is more than 2 days old. There is an accumulation of hair, old food and debris that is located
along the sides of some of the enclosures in the indoor portion and along the edges of the matts. The wooden
support beams that hold up the flooring has an accumulation of debris, hair, old food and feces in both the indoor
and outdoor areas under the wire flooring that is only an 1-2 inches from coming into contact with the animals.The catchments under the flooring in building #2 have an excessive amount of old food, hair and debris that
completely covers the catchment below with wire flooring with the puppies. There is a layer of white mold that
covers the old food that is within 6 inches of the wire flooring. The cleaning schedule must be increased to keep up
with the amount of food, debris, hair and excreta that is being produced. There is a strong odor of old food and
excreta under the catchment area and coming from the buildup outside under the elevated runs area. There was a
large amount of white eggs that were laid by insects in the piles of excreta under the flooring outside that will
become a problem with pests as the weather warms.
The licensee must remove excreta and food waste from primary enclosures daily. The pans under primary
enclosures with grill-type floors and the ground areas under raised runs with mesh or slatted floors as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats
contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
