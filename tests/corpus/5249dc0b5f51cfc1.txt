2.33(b)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The method of euthanasia at this facility, per the guidance of the attending veterinarian, includes the use of a
tranquilizing medication prior to euthanasia in a carbon dioxide chamber. During the course of the inspection, it was
revealed that the facility had run out of the tranquilizing medication. Without consulting the attending veterinarian for
guidance, approximately 18 rabbits had been euthanized without tranquilization according to a facility
representative. Failure to provide the tranquilizing medication to personnel performing euthanasia resulted in a
change from the veterinarian-approved method of euthanasia. Based on discussion with the person performing the
procedure, this change likely resulted in distress of the animals prior to unconsciousness. The appropriate facilities
and equipment shall be provided so veterinary guidance regarding euthanasia can be followed.
Since this was noted, the facility has implemented corrective measures. The tranquilizing medication was made
available to personnel on May 31st, 2018. A record keeping and ordering system has been put in place to ensure
the medication is available from this point forward.
This inspection and an initial exit interview were conducted with animal facility personnel on site on May 30th, 2018.
A supplementary exit interview was performed on site with facility representatives on June 6th, 2018.
