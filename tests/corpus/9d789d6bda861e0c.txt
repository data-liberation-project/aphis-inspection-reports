2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Changes were made to an IACUC approved protocol without prior approval from the IACUC.
According to the IACUC approved protocol, sheep were to be treated with phenylbutazone for five days post-op for
pain management. According to facility’s perioperative medications records, the animals received phenylbutazone
for three days post-surgery; this length of treatment was not approved by the IACUC.
Unapproved significant changes in the care and use of animals in ongoing activities may adversely affect animal
well-being. The IACUC should review proposed significant changes to activities involving animals prior to the
implementation of the activities.
A similar issue was cited on August 10, 2015 and February 24, 2015.
3.28(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Eight guinea pigs of comparable size were double housed in primary enclosures that contained approximately 172.5
square inches of usable space. Facility staff weighed one of the guinea pigs and it was over 350 grams.
The available floor space provided in eight enclosures housing two guinea pigs each did not meet our minimum
space requirements. Each guinea pig must be provided a minimum amount of floor space to make normal postural
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure that this
requirement is met.
*This item was corrected at the time of inspection.
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosure of two research horses, there were several wires holding the chain-link to the metal poles
that contained sharp points facing into the enclosure.
There were two insulated wires coming out of the ground in the primary enclosure of two research horses. The
wires were stiff, with a sharp point at the end.
A segment of the chain-link fence surrounding the enclosure of four research horses was not secure, as the
chain-link was not tethered to the support beam.
A portion of the metal siding on the side of the barn in a sheep enclosure at the veterinary teaching hospital had
turned upward, creating a sharp edge.
A wooden beam in the sheep enclosure has come loose from the bottom edge of the barn, resulting in the point of a
screw to stick out of the wood.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and
maintenance must be in place.
3.130
WATERING.
There was a buildup of green debris on the interior surfaces of the water receptacle in an enclosure that contains
goats.
A system should be in place to ensure that all water receptacles are maintained in a manner that allows them to be
kept clean and sanitary.

Inspection was conducted December 13, 2016 through December 16, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted by Veterinary Medical Officers, Dr. Dominique Engel and Dr. Jeffrey Lee, with CSU
facility representatives.
