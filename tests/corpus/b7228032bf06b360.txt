3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least two enclosures inside the far west housing facility are in disrepair. The affected enclosures are currently
housing an adult blonde colored female Chihuahua identified by tag number 59, an adult blue/fawn colored female
Chihuahua identified by tag number 17 and an adult red colored female Chihuahua identified by tag number 03.
Painted sheet metal panels that are attached to three sides of each enclosure have rusted, pitted and flaking
surfaces the dogs can come in contact with. The affected areas are located along the bottom edge next to the
flooring.
The licensee stated she has plastic material available that she can use to replace the rusted areas with.
A red plastic food receptacle being used by an adult black female Poodle identified by tag number 79, is severely
chewed and worn. The affected areas have a rough and jagged surface that has collected dust, dirt and grime.
Surfaces that are rusted, severely chewed and or worn, cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of
housing facilities are maintained in good repair at all times.
To be corrected by: April 26, 2016.
*The white adult female Chihuahua (tag number 38) that was listed under 2.40 (b) (2) on the inspection report dated
