2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:56 p.m. on
11/17/2014. I contacted the licensee by phone when I arrived at this facility but he was out of the country. The
licensee stated his animals are currently at the facility but there was no one to accompany me on an inspection. Mr.
Zerbini stated he sent an itinerary to the eastern regional office, however it was not on file. On 9/8/14, I attempted
an inspection at this facility and no one was available to conduct an animal welfare inspection.
A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process. You must
send updated itineraries to the eastern regional office for inspectors to conduct animal welfare inspections to ensure
the health and welfare of animals regulated by USDA.
