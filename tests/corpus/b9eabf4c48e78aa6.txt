Facilities, outdoor.
The facility moves their herd of six Giraffe out to the pasture from May to mid-September. While out on pasture for
approximately four months, the animals do not have access to their barn. The pasture they are housed within has tall
shade structures which consists only of a tall central pole and umbrella-like top. There are no sides on this structure and
there are no additional shelter structures in the pasture that provide protection from the elements and would allow giraffe
the ability to get out of strong winds, rain or hail if they wanted. Cumberland OH has had at several severe storms since
May 2022 including several days/nights with thunderstorms, winds in excess of 40-60 mph, heavy rain, and hail. Failure to
provide adequate shelter may result in animal illness and unnecessary discomfort.

Adequate shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions which affords protection from the elements must be provided
for to all animals. The shelter must be large enough for all individuals to access the shelter or multiple shelters must be
provided.
Correct by September 30, 2022.

Separation.

The facility received a male Indian rhino (ID# 121021) last fall. The rhino was housed all winter in the rhino barn adjacent
to the females. He was then introduced to the females in a smaller pasture prior to the group moving to the large pasture
on May 11, 2022 where the herd of one male and two females Bactrian camels lived. The male rhino lived in the pasture
without incident as reported by the facility for two weeks, when they came in to find the male Bactrian camel (ID# 109040)
dead on May 25, 2022. Pathology report indicated a 4 cm laceration on ventral right neck at thoracic inlet, tearing of
multiple large veins, and death due to suspected exsanguination from this laceration.

Indian male rhinos become aggressive during a premating phase of breeding.
While another male rhino may understand the social cues and have methods to submit, avoid or evade a dominant male
in breeding, a male from another species (such as the male Bactrian camel) may not. Male Bactrian camels can also be
highly aggressive and dominant when they are in rut which is documented March-April. Male Bactrian camels rely on
social cues to deter competitors. In the wild, the home ranges of these two species do not overlap, therefore, they may be
unlikely to understand normal species specific social cues which have evolved to prevent conflict. Additionally, this rhino
had previously not lived with a camel, again, making it unlikely they would understand social cues. As these are two very
different species of ungulates, their social and behavioral cues do not coincide, and the camel did not have an effective
manner to evade the male rhino and so the injury was likely caused by the rhino.

*** Records indicated that during 2021 and 2022, at least 5 male deer approximately 6-8 years of age were found dead
from causes resulting from traumatic injuries as indicated in pathology reports. These deaths included:

- Male Bactrian deer ID# 114090: This 7-year-old male was found dead in the water of a pond on 9/18/2021 and had no
prior medical concerns. Necropsy showed 30-50 liters of blood in the pleural cavity (around the lungs), clotted blood within

the lungs, rhabdomyolysis and edema of the muscles, and hemorrhage and swelling within the spinal cord. The cause of
death was attributed to exertional myopathy and trauma.

- Male Bactrian deer ID# 114050: This 7-year-old male was euthanized on 10/11/2021 after being found severely injured.
Necropsy findings showed that there was a deep puncture wound to the right lateral chest which penetrated the chest
cavity, a partial rupture of the attachment of the triceps including a torn muscle, hemorrhage into the chest cavity and
pericardia! sac (around the heart). These findings are consistent with severe traumatic injury.

- Male Pere David's deer ID# 114016: This 7-year-old male was found dead in the pasture on 6/23/2021. The prior day he
was in rut and observed chasing other males in the same enclosure. Necropsy showed swelling, bruising, and necrotic
tissue in the neck and hemorrhage in the lungs and heart.

Male Pere David's deer ID# 113030: This 8-year-old male was found dead 7/6/2021. The prior day he was noted to have
appeared bright, alert, and reactive. It was noted that this was during the breeding season when males are in rut.
Necropsy results showed a puncture wound to the right lower neck with significant areas of bruising, hemorrhage, and
subcutaneous emphysema (accumulation of air under the skin) in the shoulder, neck, face, and large areas in the right
chest. The jugular vein had been lacerated and there were areas of hemorrhage in the lungs. Death was attributed to
trauma.

-Male Pere David's deer ID# 116008: This 6-year-old male was found in a lake in the pasture on 6/29/2022. Necropsy
results showed extensive bruising and hemorrhage over the left face, neck, shoulder, and chest, hemorrhage into the
chest cavity, 500-800 ml of hemorrhagic pericardia! effusion (around the heart), broken incisors and lacerations to the

lower lip, and little to no food in the gastrointestinal system. The cause of death was not definitive though findings showed
both trauma and anorexia, insufficient food consumption.

Male Sichuan takin ID# 115006: This 7-year-old male was found dead in the pasture on 6/23/22. Necropsy results
showed a large wound to the lower abdomen with a penetrating puncture into the abdominal cavity. There was severe
cellulitis and hemorrhage around the puncture site and approximately a foot of intestine entrapped.

Currently the facility maintains herds of Bactrian deer (30 males and 38 females), a bachelor herd of 16 Bactrian deer,
Pere David's Deer {21 males and 51 females) and Takin (23 males to 26 females). These groups of animals are housed
in similar large open pastures with varying topographic features. Both deer species are known to enter a breeding period
seasonally known as "rut" in which males often fight for dominance and the ability to breed with females.

While establishing dominance during rut, both species are known to fight and left unchecked these fights can lead to
traumatic injuries and death. Fighting can also occur at other times of the year as dominant males fight to guard feeding
areas or other preferred areas of pastures. The facility states that the area is large enough for the animals to avoid or
escape from each other and there is variable terrain with the hills, however there are limited visual barriers within most
pastures.

Additionally, there may be no easy access to alternate pastures for subordinate males to retreat to after dominance is
established which would allow them to evade or avoid now dominant established males who are actively breeding
females. Access to different pastures is managed by the facility at their discretion.


The facility confirmed that the deaths of hoof stock in the 2021 and 2022 were typical and consistent with observations
from prior years. Facility staff must ensure that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and
intervene to ensure adequate separation when incompatibility arises. The inclusion of visual barriers and/or safe retreat
areas for subordinate males may help increase compatibility during times of the year when breeding behaviors are
expected to increase competition between adult males, however, close observation of animals and intervention is
necessary to ensure that animals are not housed with or near other animals that interfere with their health or cause them
discomfort and/or death.

Failure to ensure adequate separation of incompatible animals can result in behavioral stress, injuries, unnecessary
suffering, and death. Correct no later than 9/20/22 by ensuring that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are
compatible and that they do not interfere with the heath of other animals and/or cause discomfort.
