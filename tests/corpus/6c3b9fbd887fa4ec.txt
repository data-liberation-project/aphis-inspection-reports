This was a focused inspection to look at the hedgehog, Conifer, who required immediate veterinary care during the
previous inspection conducted on November 3, 2016.
The licensee took the hedgehog, Conifer (microchip #981010001769740) to the attending veterinarian (AV) on
November 4, 2016. The AV diagnosed the hedgehog with a cataract in the right eye and performed an aspirate of
the swelling on the right side of the muzzle. An injection of antibiotics was administered by the AV and the licensee
was sent home with an antibiotic to be given by mouth once a day for five days. The licensee provided veterinary
records during the inspection, as well as documentation showing her daily administration of the prescribed
treatment to the hedgehog. The licensee informed the inspector that Conifer has an appointment with a specialist on
November 30, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and VMO Dominique Engel.
