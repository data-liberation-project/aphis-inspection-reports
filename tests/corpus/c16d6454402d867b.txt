ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The single ferret housed in the gift shop is in need of grooming services. The nails on both front paws are overly
long and are starting to curve/splay as the ferret puts weight on the paws. Overly long nails can lead to discomfort
and to abnormal standing/walking positions that over time can lead to joint problems. The ferret needs to have its
nails trimmed regularly.
*The veterinary drug cabinet contained a large number of expired drugs. None of the drugs were labeled or marked
as expired. All of the sterile bags of Lactated Ringers Solution expired November 2015. Almost all of the bottles of
eye and ear medications were expired to include GentaOtic Otic solution (expired 6/12), Neomycin & Polymyxin B
Opthalmic Solution (expired 2/15), and NeoPolycin Opthalmic (expired 12/14). Other expired drugs included
medications for inflammation and pain: Pributazon Boluses (expired 3/13), Metacam Oral Solution (expired 2/12)
and Meloximed injectable (expired 11/15). Expired drugs may no longer be effective. In addition, one vial of
capsules was unidentified and unlabeled-no drug name or dosage/directions. Unidentified drugs given to the wrong
individual could lead to toxicity issues or other unwanted reactions. All medications shall be labeled properly and
in-date to ensure proper use of the medications.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Four rabbits are housed in a hutch outdoors. The floor of the entire hutch is made of wire mesh and the entire top is
solid. One third of the enclosure has four wooden sides to provide some protection from the weather elements. The
floor in this sheltered area is however made of the open wire mesh. One dirty dry towel was noted bunched up in
one corner of the sheltered area. No straw or hay was noted in the structure. The low temperature the night before
the inspection was 22 degrees F. The open wire mesh floor is not sufficient to keep the cold air out of the sheltered
area. Adequate shelter and protection from the cold must be supplied for outdoor rabbits when the temperature is
below 40 degrees F. Correct from this day forward. 3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One wallaby was observed running loose in the kitchen commissary as we entered the room during the inspection.
Excreta was noted on the kitchen floor along with spilled water from a knocked over water receptacle. A functioning
space heater was noted placed on the floor on one side of the room. An open cabinet containing cleaning and other
chemicals and supplies was present in the room with shelves at a height reachable by the wallaby. Serious
consequences including fire (if heater were to be knocked over) and injury (chemicals, loose objects, electrical
cords etc.) to the wallaby may occur when it is running around the room unsupervised. In addition, if someone
opened the door unknowingly, the wallaby could escape the room to the outside. The facility housing facilities for
the wallaby must be structurally sound and in good repair to protect the wallaby from injury and to contain the
wallaby. The wallaby was removed from the area during the inspection.

WATERING.
Nine zebra and twenty guanaco are housed in a pasture with a large pond. No fresh water receptacles are present
in the pasture. The facility representative states the animals drink from the pond. The water in the pond has not
been tested. The land surrounding the pond and draining down toward the pond is all agricultural in nature. Runoff
and animal waste collection in the pond can lead to issues with the potability and safety of the water. Potable water
must be accessible to the animals at all times-supply fresh potable water or test the pond water regularly to ensure
the water is potable. Correct by 1/18/16.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Two small enclosures housing non-human primates (tamarins) were present in the area directly adjacent to and
open with the commissary. Towels and blanket type materials were draped over the backs and part of the sides of
these enclosures. Several of them reached the floor. When a corner of the fabric reaching the ground was stepped,
a large number of bugs and beetle like insects were noted running away from the fabric. An employee removed the
fabric and another large group of insects were noted running across the floor. Insect pests can carry/transmit
disease organisms. The facility shall design and carry out a pest control plan for the commissary and adjacent
areas. Correct by 1/30/16.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
