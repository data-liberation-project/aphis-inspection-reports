2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC Functions.
***The IACUC has not updated their reports to the Institutional Official (IO) at least once every six months as
required. The last Semi-annual IACUC Report submitted to the IO was dated 1/31/17 and pertained to the IACUC's
December 2016 semi-annual reviews of the program for animal care and animal facility inspection. Although the
IACUC did conduct semi-annual reviews in Spring 2017, almost 8 1/2 months have elapsed since the IACUC
prepared and updated their semi-annual report to the IO.
Per this Section of the Regulations, reports of the IACUC semi-annual evaluations of the program for animal care
and animal facility inspection should be updated at least once every 6 months upon completion of the required
semiannual evaluations and the report should be submitted to the Institutional Official.
Compliance with the requirements outlined in this Section is important to ensure the IO is updated regarding the
status of the animal use program and the condition of the animal facilities to ensure that the research facility is
adhering to the standards and regulations specified under the Act.
2.35(a)(1)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
IACUC Records.
***There was no copy of the minutes for the Spring 2017 convened IACUC meeting available for review at the time
of the inspection.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a research facility shall maintain copies of the minutes of IACUC meetings and
have them available for review at the time of an inspection. Compliance with this Section is important so the
inspector can review records of attendance, activities of the Committee, and Committee deliberations to determine
compliance with the provisions of the AWA. Correct by 10/20/17.
NOTE - Exit briefing held 10/3/17 on-site with facility representatives. Report delivered by e-mail 10/6/17.
