In pen #16, a female orange and white guinea pig was observed squinting both eyes and behaving in a lethargic
manner. Closer inspection of the animal revealed a brown crust like material surrounding both eyes. A clear
drainage was present around both eyes.
In pen #37, A juvenile black/orange/white guinea pig was observed to be behaving in a lethargic manner. Closer
inspection revealed two large open wounds along the right side of the animal's back The wounds are red in color
and the edges of the wounds are thickened and dried and bedding material was located within the wound.
In pen #66, an orange colored female guinea pig is observed by the inspector to have an abnormal gait when it ran.
The guinea pig appears stiff in the hind legs and is occasionally dragging the left hind leg while moving. The back
side of the left hind leg is hairless and the majority of the skin in this affected area is covered in a light colored
crust-like material.
Abnormal eye and leg conditions and open wounds could cause pain and discomfort as well as lead to further
health issues.
The above mentioned guinea pigs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.The inspector observed a guinea pig jump over the divider between pen #27 and pen #22. The guinea pig jumped
back and forth over the divider multiple times while the inspector was watching. The height of the divider was 8
inches tall and 7.5 inches tall with bedding. Failure of the enclosure to contain the guinea pig could cause injury to
the guinea pig.
Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals and restrict the
entrance of other animals. The licensee must alter the enclosures is a manner that eliminates the ability of the
guinea pigs to jump over the dividers into other pens. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures contain the
guinea pigs at all times.
