OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are six outdoor runs for six Basset Hounds that do not have an alternate shade source except for the
insulated dog houses. Currently, the dog houses do not have wind/weather breaks on the doors. They have been
ordered, however they are still not available and the weather is becoming colder in the nights and daytime, and it is
time for a wind break on the doors.
It is important for the dogs to be able to have access to other shade option other than the dog houses to protect
them from the direct rays of the sun, which can cause heat stress or health issues if in excess. The lack of
wind/weather breaks on the doors can cause drafts and decrease the ability for the dogs to regulate their body
temperatures during the cold/wet season. This can be a source of possible health issues and discomfort if left
unmanaged.
The licensee needs to provide alternative shade source within the run area that is large enough for the dogs to sit,
stand and turn around in to protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Proper wind/weather breaks must be added
to all dog houses for the dogs housed outside.
