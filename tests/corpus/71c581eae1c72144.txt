CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
One enclosure, containing one adult female Shih tzu and at least two puppies, has an excessive buildup of feces in
the outdoor portion of the enclosure. The feces are hard and dried and are concentrated along the back wall of the
enclosure and under the access door, but are also found sporadically throughout the enclosure. There is a very
limited amount of space in the outdoor portion of the enclosure in which the dog will not come into contact with the
feces. A buildup of feces could increase the risk of disease towards the dog and could cause the dog to become
soiled.
Excreta must be removed from the enclosures daily and as often as necessary to prevent the excessive
accumulation of feces and to prevent the soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, pests and odors. The
licensee must remove the feces from the enclosures every day and as often as necessary to prevent the excessive
buildup of feces in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
