3.1(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One enclosure containing two adult German Shepherds has a break in the metal wall which is creating sharp edges
at the level of the dogs. Sharp edges could increase the risk of injury to the dogs. All surfaces of housing facilities
must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must remove the sharp edges or alter them in a
manner that eliminates the injury risk towards the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the surfaces of the animal
enclosures remain free of sharp points and jagged edges at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The facility representative stated that the feces are not removed from the enclosures daily and one enclosure,
containing one adult male mastiff, has a buildup of feces in the outdoor section. A buildup of feces could increase
the risk of disease as well as the potential soiling of the dog.
Excreta must be removed from the enclosures daily and as often as necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of feces, to prevent soiling of the dogs, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. The
licensee must remove the feces from each enclosure at least once every day, or more often if necessary in order to
eliminate the buildup of feces in the enclosures.
To be corrected by: At the time of the inspection, the inspector advised the facility representative that from this day
forward the feces must be removed daily.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The facility representatives stated they are having problems with mice inside the dog kennel and had been taking
actions to control them. At the time of the inspection no mouse control was in place and the inspector saw one live
mouse run from under the wooden ramp beneath the entrance door and along the wall behind a plastic trash can. Alarge amount of mouse feces is located on the floor along the interior walls of the building and along the walls of the
dog enclosures and around at least one dog's water bucket. Infestations of mice could increase the risk of disease
towards the dogs.
An effective program for the control of mammals that are pests must be established and maintained in order to
reduce contamination by pests. The licensee must establish an effective pest control program for mice in order to
reduce the disease risk and to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.
