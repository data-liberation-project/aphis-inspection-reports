FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the first kinkajou enclosure containing one kinkajou there were several areas of the caging that the wiring had
come undone and its pointy ends were exposed. These areas need to be repaired and secured to ensure the safety
and containment of the animals.
**The fennec foxes on the right side has a beam of wood for the structure on the outside of the enclosure and a
perch made of wood that has degraded and needs to be replaced.
** In the fennec foxes outdoor enclosure on the left there is a wood beam that is falling on the mesh covering of the
enclosure that needs to be removed and repaired. This beam could possibly fall in and injure an animal or possibly
create a means to escape. The indoor enclosure had pointy ends of wire along the wall that were exposed. This
needs to be repaired.
**In the kinkajous enclosure on the left there is a den box made of wood that has been chewed and soiled. The box
is in disrepair and needs to be repaired or replaced.
**In the caracal and serval enclosures there were wood beams on the ground that need to be removed to keep the
animals from injuring themselves.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

SANITATION.
** In the serval enclosure that contained one male there was an abundance of feces and a foul odor. The feces and
soiled materials should be removed to minimize odors and pest.** The kinkajou enclosure with one female has soiled wood that is odoriferous and it needs to be replaced to
prevent disease hazards for the animals.
** In the caracal enclosure there were old wet and potentially soiled cardboard lying around the floor. This needs to
be removed to prevent disease hazards.
Feces shall be removed and waste removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. When
enclosures are cleaned by hosing or flushing, adequate measures shall be taken to protect the animals confined in
such enclosures from being directly sprayed with the stream of water or wetted involuntarily.
