ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Coton (No ID) was observed walking around his enclosure but holding his left front foot off the floor every time
he stood still. Closer inspection of the foot revealed a small red lesion on the top of the paw. The lesion was round,
raised and slightly firm. This dog also has a thick buildup of brown tartar covering the surface of the cheek teeth
and the majority of the upper canine teeth. The gums are slightly reddened.
Female Coton (No ID) has a hairless area on the right side of her rump near the tail. The area is slightly reddened
with smaller sections within it that are a darker red and are developing a crust across them. The licensee stated
that she had been using Neosporin on the area but had not consulted a licensed veterinarian about treatment for
the dog.
Poor dental health and abnormal skin conditions could cause pain or discomfort to the dog and could lead to further
health complications. The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis
of their conditions and to establish an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be
documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three dogs housed in three enclosures in the outdoor housing area. In the enclosure housing one cocker
spaniel there are at least three sharp points created by wire holding the dog house together. In the enclosure
housing one golden retriever there are at least four sharp points created by damaged fencing or twisted wire used to
attach the fencing to the frame. In the enclosure housing one cavalier spaniel there is at least one sharp point
created by the twisted wire that is holding the fencing together. Within the basement there is one enclosure housing one adult golden retriever and five puppies that has two sharp
points created by wire attached to the fencing and located at the level of the puppies. Sharp points could cause
injury to the dogs and puppies.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are kept in good repair and protect the
dogs from injury. The licensee must remove the sharp points from the enclosures. The licensee must ensure that
all used dog enclosures are free of sharp points at all times in order to eliminate the risk of injury to the animals.
