SANITATION.
Excessive feces and urine are present in the indoor stall that houses the goats, sheep, and llama. The animals
have access into a large outdoor pasture, however; they do not have a clean, dry place to lay down while inside of
the barn. Feces and urine can serve as a reservoir for disease hazards.
