2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***An adult female pig (#10-1) had a horizontal crack on the lateral claw of the left rear hoof. The crack appeared
deep and extended from the lateral edge across the top of the hoof. Although the pig would bear full weight on the
limb with the affected foot, the animal was also observed occasionally toe-touching with the same limb. The animal
care staff was not aware of the condition and, therefore, veterinary staff had not been alerted about the pig’s hoof
and no treatment plan had been initiated prior to the inspector pointing out the animal’s condition. This condition
can be painful. This animal was examined by a veterinarian and an appropriate treatment plan was developed
during the inspection. The facility must ensure that the treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
The inspection was conducted May 15-18, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on May 18, 2017 with facility
representatives.
