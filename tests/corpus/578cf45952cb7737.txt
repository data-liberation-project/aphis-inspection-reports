2.78(a)
HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
Section 2.78(a) Health certification: The owner transported her marmoset from New York to Pennsylvania on
December 1, 2014 without a health certificate. Health certificates are required before transporting nonhuman
primates across state lines to ensure that the animals appear to the licensed veterinarian to be free of any infectious
disease or physical abnormality which would endanger the nonhuman primate(s) or other animals or endanger
public health. An exhibitor must not transport any nonhuman primate in commerce unless accompanied by a health
certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian no more than 10 days prior to the transport.
Correct from this day forward.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.53(a)(1) Primary enclosures: Two rabbits are housed in an outdoor enclosure with a large tarp covering
the back portion of the enclosure and their igloo shelter. The owner informed the APHIS official that the tarp was
being used as a windbreak. The rabbits are using the tarp to climb up onto an elevated platform inside the
enclosure. The rabbits may fall and be injured climbing on the tarp, especially during wet/icy conditions. Also the
rabbits may chew and ingest portions of the tarp and become ill. During the inspection the owner removed the tarp
from the enclosure. Rabbit enclosures must not contain items that may be harmful for the rabbits, must be
structurally sound and must be maintain in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Correct from this day forward.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The following enclosures must be repaired.1) The enclosure housing 2 Patagonian cavies (in the brown barn to the left of the door) has two holes in the wood
walls in the lower back left corner. The cavies may get wood splinters and/or injured, especially if they try to chew
or scratch at the holes. The wood walls must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury.

2) The enclosure housing 3 raccoons in the brown barn has a back metal panel with areas of excessive rust. The
lower edge of the metal panel has rusted through creating a hole and sharp edges above the floor. The raccoons
may get cut on the sharp rusted edges, especially if they try to put their nose or paw through the hole. The rusted
metal panel must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury and to allow adequate cleaning.
Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
Correct both items by January 20, 2015.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: Wood, old enclosures and miscellaneous items are still stored around the animal
enclosures and buildings. The clutter around the animal areas provides good hiding places for mammalian pests
and prevents vegetation from being cut/trimmed around enclosure fencing. Animals may be injured when walking
through these areas to move to other enclosures or into the transport trailer. Animal areas must be free of clutter
and debris to deter pests and for the safety of the animals.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
