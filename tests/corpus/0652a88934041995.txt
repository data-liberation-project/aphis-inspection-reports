ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There was one 100 ml bottle of Oxytocin with
an expiration date of 09/2014. There was one - 100 ml bottle of Combi-Pen-48 with an expiration date of 03/2014.
These medications were intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are
therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an
acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage
level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as
anticipated. The licensee must ensure that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date.
Correct by 3/16/15.
* Facility inspection and verbal exit briefing conducted on 3/2/15 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
