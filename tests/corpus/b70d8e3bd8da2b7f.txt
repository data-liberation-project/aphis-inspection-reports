3.75(a) CRITICAL
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 11-18-2019, a female baboon pulled a door cable through an opening at top of a holding cage in a working
chute and strangled. This incident was promptly reported to the IACUC and to the USDA. Corrective action was
taken and the cable was modified with clip so an animal can not access the door cable. Employees have received
training on the placement of clips and the importance and what to do if one is missing. The facility must protect the
non human primates from injury .

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One juvenile baboon is receiving veterinary care for a fractured arm which occurred on 10/10/19 when he was able
to stick his arm through the holes in the primary enclosure fence. The holes are smaller than standard chain link
fencing. The animal was found with his arm stuck in a small opening in enclosure fence and received immediate
veterinary care. This was a new enclosure for baboons (previous chimp housing) and had been inspected prior to
the placement of these juvenile baboons. The attending veterinarian promptly notified the IACUC about this
incident. Video and personnel observations have been conducted to see if this is a re-occurring activity by the
juvenile baboons . Primary enclosures must protect the animals from injury .
Corrected at time of the inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with facility employees.
