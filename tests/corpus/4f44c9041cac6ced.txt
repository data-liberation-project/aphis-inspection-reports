3.133 Critical Repeat

Separation.
Since September 2022 two adult male Sichuan Takin have died as a result of injuries consistent with traumatic wounds
consistent with fighting. This includes:

* Takin male (10 years old) ID # 112003 was on exhibit Sept 5, 2022 in pasture D when staff observed he was 3-legged
lame. This animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the Attending Veterinarian. Upon exam he was in
good body condition but had a RF comminuted fracture of humerus. Due to extent of injuries, he was humanely
euthanized. Pathology reports confirmed the fracture of the distal humerus and cubital joint as well as extensive bruising
of the surrounding area. Medical records indicated that this Takin also had swelling of the left eye on Aug 4, 2022 which
was suspected to be due to trauma (though a primary ocular cause was not able to be ruled out). Although this individual
was described by the facility staff as the primary breeding male Takin for many years. Records indicate that as of August
2022 another male Takin was showing dominant behavior.

* Takin male (8 years old) ID # 114007 was on exhibit Nov 7, 2022 in pasture D when staff reported the animal appeared
lethargic and had lost body condition. Animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the Attending
Veterinarian who found a deep puncture wound on left caudal abdomen and suspected septicemia. This Takin was

euthanized due to guarded prognosis and on necropsy the wound was further explored. On necropsy it was determined
that this wound extended 20 cm in several directions and while it did not connect with the body cavity adhesions and scar
tissue indicated that it likely did previously. This same animal had an abscess of the left shoulder in November of 2020
that is also consistent with prior fighting. This Takin was appropriately treated and recovered at that time.

Currently the facility maintains a large herd of Takin which is composed of approximately 20 males to 25 females. This
group of animals is housed in an open pasture that is approximately 100 acres, is shared with other species, and has
varying topographic features. Wild Takin originate from Asia where they inhabit rocky terrain, dense forest, and alpine
areas. They usually are found in large social groups with females and offspring making up 98% of the herd. Both males
and females have their own dominance hierarchy structure. Mature males enter a breeding period seasonally known as
"rut" in which males often fight for dominance and the ability to breed with females. Non-dominant adult males are
typically not found living with breeding groups and tend to be more solitary. During rut, young mature males may
challenge the dominant male fighting for access to breeding females but typically the loosing male will not remain with the
herd after such a challenge.

During the inspection facility staff described that they typically have one primary breeding male and a small number of
other males which may breed with fewer females. The facility currently maintains too many male Takin in the breeding
enclosure/pasture and continues to have animals injured as a result of the lack of separation. As of December 2022,
there is no separate area (or bachelor group) of non-dominant male Takin. The number and concentration of mature male
animals is likely leads to an increased number of challenges to the dominant breeding male(s) by other mature
subordinate males that are housed within the same area. Additionally, this concentration of males also likely leads to
increased sparring and conflict between subordinate males as well. Although sparring and fighting or access to breeding

females is a normal behavioral pattern in wild Takin, the traumatic injuries which lead to the deaths of these animals
indicate that the co-housed animals are causing injury and discomfort. Given the number of co-housed males, the
dominant male and his females also cannot easily move away from challengers and are left in a position to have to
constantly fight challenging males during breeding season while also actively breeding females which can leave the
dominant male exhausted, causing discomfort and interfering with his health. Having this many intact breeding males in
one group with the breeding females is currently interfering with the compatibility of the herd. The facility still does not
have a plan in place to be able to separate the established dominant male Takin and females from subordinate males to
reduce these conflicts which are causing traumatic injuries to various animals.

Failure to ensure adequate separation of incompatible animals can result in behavioral stress, injuries, unnecessary
suffering, and death. Correct by ensuring that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and
ensuring through daily observation that staff intervenes to ensure adequate separation when incompatibility arises.

This inspection was conducted with the Director of Animal Management and Vice President. The exit briefing was
conducted with the Vice President, Director of Animal Management, Attending Veterinarian, and additional facility staff.
The facility currently has time remaining for correction of the noncompliance cited under section 3.127(b) on the previous
inspection.
