3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Various marine mammal enclosures had surfaces within them that had one or more of the following problems:
corrosion, rust stains, paint that was coming off, or surfaces that had deteriorated.
Specifically, the following were observed:
-(cid:9)In the Open Theater enclosure for dolphins many of the metal structural supports holding the panes of glass have
extensive areas of rust that threaten their structural strength.
-(cid:9)In the monk seal enclosure there are some small patches of missing / peeling paint.
-(cid:9)In Dolphin Cove there are areas where the paint is missing and the surface is discolored or appears to be
deteriorating.
-(cid:9)In the Sea Lion Feeding Pool there are areas where the paint has come off of the surfaces, there is some rust, and
the dry resting area has a concrete surface that is crumbling, cracked, and deteriorating.
-(cid:9)In the Aloha Discovery dolphin pool there is some exposed rebar that is rusting.
-(cid:9)In the Sea Lion Show holding area there is rust on the chain-link fencing that comprises part of the enclosures,
there is paint missing from many surfaces, and the above ground pool has a deteriorating surface.
Exposure to contaminants could affect water quality, present an ingestion risk, which could be harmful to the
animals. Extensive corrosion could cause catastrophic damage to enclosures holding marine mammals. All
surfaces in primary enclosures for marine mammals must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that
facilitate cleaning, and disinfection as appropriate, sufficient to maintain optimal water quality, and keep the animals
safe. All surfaces in all marine mammal enclosures should be maintained in good repair as part of a regular,
ongoing maintenance program.
An extension has been granted until September 30, 2016
3.103(b) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Whereas the facility has done an excellent job of providing additional shade for the most of the marine mammal
housing areas, there were still two areas of concern noted on this inspection:
- At Dolphin Cove the entire pool complex is divided into four sections. The largest section, where the interactions
with the public occur, does not have adequate shade at times when there is little shade from the "pirate ship(cid:29)",
dock/walkways and nearby mountains and vegetation. The Dolphin Cove pool is at least 20 feet deep. Although the
dolphins are rotated through the sections during the day, an animal in the large pool may not have access to shade
when it desires to seek shade.
- In the Aloha Discovery pool, where interactions with the public occur, there is not adequate shade at times when
there is little shade from nearby mountains and vegetation. The Aloha Discovery pool was repainted a darker blue in
Spring 2015. Although a shade structure has been installed along the east side of this pool, the interactions occur in
the north end, where steps and benches are installed for guests to be situated during interactions.
Direct sunlight can be uncomfortable for the animals and can adversely affect their health, especially eye health.
Additional steps should be taken to provide even more shade for marine mammals when they choose to seek
shade, and when they are being asked to interact with the trainers / public, which involves holding their heads out of
the water, and looking up toward the sky. The facility should re-review shade for all marine mammal enclosures and
ensure that adequate shade is provided.
This issue was cited previously, with a past due correction date. An extension has been granted until September 30,
2016.
3.103(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility does not have a perimeter fence sufficient to keep unauthorized persons and animals out of the facility.
Whereas there is a fence encircling the majority of the facility, there are many places where the fence fails to meet
the requirements.
Specifically, the following were observed:
-(cid:9)Many sections of the fence had large gaps underneath the fence, of four to eight inches, that could allow animals
to enter the facility.
-(cid:9)There were several openings / gaps / missing sections in the fence-line.
-(cid:9)There were many sections of fence-line that did not meet the six foot height requirement.-(cid:9)Some parts of the fence had horizontal metal support poles that were rusted through, or otherwise broken.
-(cid:9)Some areas, such as turnstiles and decorative bamboo pole fencing at the entrances, provided no impediment to
people or animals wishing to pass through.
Inadequate fencing puts the animals at risk from unauthorized persons, and also from animals which could enter the
facility and come into contact with the marine mammals, posing a risk of injury or disease. Steps should be taken to
ensure that the fencing meets the requirements under 3.103 (c). Fencing should be at least six feet in height in
order to deter trespassers, and the fence should be maintained so as to keep animals and unauthorized people
from passing under or through the fence.
To be corrected by 10/1/16.
The inspection was completed on 9/22 and 9/23/15.
An exit interview was conducted with the curator and the attending veterinarian.
