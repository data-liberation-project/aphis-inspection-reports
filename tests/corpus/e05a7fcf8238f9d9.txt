upright position in her enclosure the dog could not maintain her balance. She did not stand and was unresponsive
to the licensee. When the licensee removed her from the enclosure the dog had a haunched posture and walked in
circles. She remained unresponsive to the actions and voice of the licensee. The dog was previously housed with a
male for breeding. Two days ago the licensee noticed the dog having unusual behavior and moved her to an
isolated enclosure. The licensee administered 3 baby aspirin to the dog throughout the day on 4/2/14 and one on
the morning of 4/3/14. The bottle of baby aspirin was labeled for use in humans. The licensee could not provided
