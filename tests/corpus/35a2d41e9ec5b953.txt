that do not have any cage cards or Identification on them that identifies the female with her litter, or the 4 weaned

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are cobwebs built up along all of the feeders inside the kennel, and a layer of dust and debris on the tops of
them. There is a buildup of brown grime along the rims of the feeders where the dogs eat that has not been
cleaned, and has been built up for at least 2 weeks or longer.
The buildup of dirt and grime and cobwebs around the food bowls can be a source of possible health issues due to
bacteria and disease that can live in those conditions.
All feeders and water sources must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary
to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime.

3.11(a) REPEATCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
While the outdoor kennels were cleaned and in better condition, the majority of the indoor kennels have a large
buildup of brown grime and dirt on the walls, on the inside of the doggy doors and door inserts. The kennels are
washed down daily, however the surfaces need to be scrubbed free of the dirt and grime buildup which has
accumulated at least 2 weeks without any sanitization or deep cleaning.
The buildup of dirt and grime can be a source of bacteria or parasites that could be a potential health hazard for the
regulated animals.
The enclosures must be cleaned thoroughly and scrubbed often enough to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime on
all surfaces in contact with the animals, including walls, feeders and floors. Without proper cleaning, the surfaces
can not be sanitized.
