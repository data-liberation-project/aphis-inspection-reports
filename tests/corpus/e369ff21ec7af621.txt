2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) is incomplete. Rabbits are currently part of the animal inventory at this
facility and are not listed on the program. The licensee stated that routine dewormings are administered to the
rabbits however no information is included on the PVC to reflect the product name, dose, route or frequency of
administration. The PVC should accurately reflect any routine veterinary care and related husbandry including but
not limited to: internal and external parasite treatment and control, restraint techniques and complete euthanasia
description.
The licensee should consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a complete and accurate written program of
veterinary care that reflects the care provided to the rabbits. A completed PVC will ensure the practices at this
facility are done with the knowledge and direction of the veterinarian.
