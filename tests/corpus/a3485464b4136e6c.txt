2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Four IACUC approved protocols (2016-06, 2016-07 (renewal), 2016-11, and 2016-05) have the proposed number of
animals to be used for each study, but there is no rationale given for requesting to use that number of animals. A
rationale for the number of animals to be used must be included in the protocol in order to ensure that the
appropriate number of animals are used for the study. All proposals to conduct activities involving animals must
contain a rationale for the number of animals to be used.
To be corrected from this day forward.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
