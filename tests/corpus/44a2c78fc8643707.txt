2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition/disposition records and a system of accurate, individual identification of a covered species are missing
or incomplete. The licensee currently has one hedgehog at the facility; however the origin of this hedgehog cannot
be accurately determine by records provided by licensee. Record of animals on hand indicates that two hedgehogs
were acquired on June 16, 2011. No information was given for means of individual identification or disposition of
these hedgehogs. Additionally, the licensee stated that a hedgehog was also acquired as a donation/rescue a few
years ago in approximately 2013; however there is no documentation on acquisition/disposition records available for
this animal. Licensee stated one of the hedgehogs is deceased and one has been donated. Due to the lack of an
accurate system of individual identification and documentation of hedgehogs at this facility, there is no method to
determine the exact origin or identification of the current hedgehog.
Complete and accurate animal records must be kept in order to facilitate identification and tracking of animals as
well as ensure their health and well-being. Records must be maintained that fully and correctly disclose information
concerning all animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, transported, sold, euthanized or
otherwise disposed of and shall include any offspring born while in the licensee's possession.
