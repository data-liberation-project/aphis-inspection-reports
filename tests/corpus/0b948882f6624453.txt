2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Each dealer/breeder must maintain accurate records. The USDA form 7005 is being used to maintain these
records. The identification number is missing from at least 4 dogs on the form 7005 and the age or date of birth is
missing from at least 6 dogs. This information is very necessary to help track dogs identification, breed, age,
description, etc. The dealer/owner must correct the 7005 and keep it up to date. Correct by 08-12-2015.
2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Each dealer/owner must use a Record of Disposition. The USDA form 7006 is being used to keep, and maintain
this required information. Broker records show that a litter of Lab puppies was sold 01-20-2015 from this facility, the
owner admits they were his puppies. Dealer/owner has no record of this transaction. The dealer/owner must
ensure that all live dogs that leave this facility have a disposition with all the correct information. This record of
disposition must be kept for a least one year and available during the inspection process. Correct from this day
forward.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces must be maintained and replaced when worn. At least three enclosures with concrete floors have cracks.
These cracks in the concrete flooring cannot be cleaned and adequately sanitized properly. Cracks in concrete
flooring can trap waste material and lead to disease, odors, and pests. The breeder must repair or replace these
cracks. The breeder/owner needs to also put into place a maintenance program that closely monitors the floors of
all enclosures that house dogs, and repair before they become an issue. This will help in the health and good
cleaning of these areas of the enclosures. Repair by 09-15-20153.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures must be maintained and have no sharp points that could injure dogs. One of the outdoor
sheltered concrete runs has an end pipe with a sharp point that could injure dogs. In that same area, a bottom steel
rod of a partition panel also has sharp points that dogs have access too. The owner/breeder needs to remove or
repair these areas to help ensure that dogs are in a safe and healthy environment. Correct by 08-12-2015.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Primary enclosures that house dogs must be cleaned daily of excreta and more often if needed to help ensure the
good health and care of dogs. The owner did state he had cleaned the day before. At the time of this inspection the
enclosures have not been cleaned in a 24 hr. period. Excessive feces are in and around the bottom of dog shelters
and throughout the concrete runs. Cleaning of dog feces in a timelier manner will help in the control of odors,
insects, diseases and help maintain a clean environment for dogs. The owner must clean more often. Correct by
close of business day today.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every two weeks and more often if needed to prevent an
accumulation of debris and organic material. The water trough that goes through all enclosures used to water all
dogs needs to be cleaned of the green mossy debris. Cleaning more often of the water receptacles will help
prevent disease hazards. Clean water helps dogs digest better and helps them to stay healthier. The owner must
clean the water receptacles and monitor them more often to ensure dogs have access to clean water. Correct by
08-06-2015.
