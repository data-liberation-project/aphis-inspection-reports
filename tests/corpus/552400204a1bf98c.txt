ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four goats, one alpaca, and one pig had overgrown hooves due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to
appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the
facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof
care in a timely manner.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In the goats and sheep's enclosure, there was an 8 inch gap in the top part of a section of fence. This gap was
large enough that the animal's horns or head could get stuck and therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the
enclosure.
*** In the alpaca's enclosure some of the metal fencing along the bottom of the enclosure's door was in disrepair.
Portions of the fencing were creating several sharp points that were pointing inward into the enclosure toward the
animals and could cause injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points and protruding edges in order to protect the
animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to ensure all animal
facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.
