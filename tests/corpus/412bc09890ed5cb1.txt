***A female river otter (ID #0A01542478) was noted on 9/28/2013 as having a poor coat condition and ocular
abnormalities (runny, mucous discharge from right eye, eyes not clear). On 10/24/2013 she was noted as having
lameness (trouble rising and moving around the enclosure). On both occasions, an employee from the facility
contacted the attending veterinarian (AV) via telephone to obtain an assessment and treatment recommendations.
Records obtained from the facility indicate the otter was started on 1-1200 mg Fish oil tablet daily on 9/28/2013 for
the poor hair coat condition. On 10/24/2013 she was started on Meloxicam and 1 glucosamine daily for presumed
arthritic condition. Currently, Meloxicam is labeled for use only in dogs. At the time of inspection, the facility could
not supply any prescriptions or directions on medication usage from the AV nor was the usage detailed in the
program of veterinary care. Additionally, the facility has not documented medication administration since 10/26/14.
Directions from the AV on medication usage should be documented and maintained by the facility to ensure proper
administration of the medication. Currently accepted veterinary standards for the extra-label drug usage (using
Meloxicam in the river otter), states the veterinarian has recently seen and is personally acquainted with the keeping
and care of the animal by virtue of examination of the animal, and/or by medically appropriate and timely visits to
the premises where the animal is kept.
To date, the AV has not done a physical examination of the river otter or completed any diagnostic testing for any of
the noted conditions. Eye discharge can be signs of ocular, infectious or systemic disease. Depending on the
cause, these conditions can be both progressive and painful. Lameness is an indicator of disease and often pain. It
can result from numerous causes including both infectious and non-infectious. Diagnostic testing, including physical
examination from a veterinarian, is necessary to properly determine the cause and best course of treatment to
alleviate discomfort.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on July 11, 2014, to obtain accurate
diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be
provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic
tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along withthe dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the
medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care

***On 10/19/13, a female river otter (ID # 0A01542478) was anesthetized by an employee of the facility without the
supervision of the attending veterinarian (AV). The employee is neither a veterinarian or a certified veterinary
technician. Both the employee and the AV stated to the APHIS VMO that the employee did not receive training from
the AV prior to anesthetizing the otter. The employee did state she had received training during a wildlife safe
capture and immobilization certification class. The program of veterinary care did not outline any guidance on
anesthesia in any regulated animal.
Adequate guidance and training, from the facility's AV, is needed to ensure the proper usage of anesthetic
medications, proper monitoring during anesthesia and what to do in an emergency situation (i.e. adverse reactions
to anesthesia or while under anesthesia). Without proper training, the facility can not ensure the safety and well
being of the animal while under anesthesia. The licensee should receive proper training, with documentation of
training, from the AV before anesthetizing any other regulated animals.
To be corrected from this date forward.

SANITATION.
***The pool in the enclosure housing 3 river otters was dirty. The walls and surface of the pool had an accumulation
of green algae, dirt and debris. Dirty pools and water in the enclosure posse a health risk to the animals. Primary
enclosures shall be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
To be corrected by 7/11/14.
A focused inspection of the river otters and their enclosure was conducted with a facility representative.
Exit interview was conducted on-site with a facility representative.
