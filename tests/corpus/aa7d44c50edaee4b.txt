HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The approximately 4x4 inch openings in the primary enclosure fencing containing 3 rhesus macaques are too large,
allowing the 7 month old to go in and out of the primary enclosure at will. This presents a hazard to both the
macaque and the public who may encounter it. Licensee needs to ensure that the young monkey is properly
contained and unable to leave its enclosure. Correct by October 2, 2015.
