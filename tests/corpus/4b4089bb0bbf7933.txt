2.33(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
**There were two small (approximately 0.5-1 inch long) tears in the cover of the pad covering the surgical table for
animals undergoing aseptic surgical procedures. As the foam padding below the torn cover cannot be completely
sanitized, this does not constitute appropriate equipment for aseptic surgery.
Items that cannot be completely cleaned and sanitized may harbor pathogens which can cause illness in animals or
prolong recovery, particularly those that may have undergone a surgical procedure. Appropriate facilities and
equipment must be available for adequate veterinary care of these animals.
Correct by next surgical procedure.
2.38(b)(1)(2)
MISCELLANEOUS.
**Surgical and anesthetic records were not available for review or animals that had undergone such procedures. It
was stated that the companies that contract with the registrant keep these records at their own facility, but they are
not kept at this registrant(cid:25)s site.
Each research facility shall allow examination of records necessary for enforcement of Animal Welfare Act
regulations. Review of these records is necessary to ensure appropriate care is provided for the animals undergoing
surgical or anesthetic procedures.

3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
**There were two shelters in the outdoor sheep pen. The shelters were comprised of a roof, support posts and awall on half of one side of the shelter. As three quarters of the shelter remain open on the sides, the animals may
not be appropriately protected from inclement weather such as heavy rain, wind, or snow.
Prolonged exposure to inclement weather may cause discomfort and stress to the animals, which can predispose to
development of illness. Animals kept outdoors must be provided shelter from inclement weather appropriate to local
climatic conditions for the species.
