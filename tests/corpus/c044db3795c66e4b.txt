SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Upon entry to the sheltered portion of the kennel an excessive odor of fecal waste and urine was encountered. The
kennel has two exhaust fans and an air conditioner. The air conditioner was operating and maintaining an
acceptable level of temperature and humidity but the exhaust fans were not functioning properly to eliminate
excessive odors from the interior of the building. Inadequate ventilation not only contributes to odor issues but can
also lead to excessive ammonia levels that would pose respiratory health risks to the exposed dogs and puppies.
The exhaust fans must be made functional and operated to adequately eliminate odors from this building. To be
corrected by: 07/05/17
