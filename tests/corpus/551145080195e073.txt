A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:56pm on May 19,
2021.

Upon arrival to the facility, the inspector contacted the licensee via phone. The licensee was not at the facility, stating they
were no longer exhibiting animals, requesting to cancel their license. The inspector informed the licensee the cancellation
needed to be received in writing, and provided them with contact information for submission. Additional reminder calls
were made to the licensee thereafter regarding cancellation. After waiting four (4) business days, no cancellation of
licensure has been received.
