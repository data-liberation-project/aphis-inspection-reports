2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
A USDA covered mouse was reported missing to the IACUC office on 14 March 2022. The animal had been accounted
for in the animal count on Friday the 11th by the manager, observed daily over the weekend by a pair of students doing
daily health checks/counts and was discovered missing on Monday the 14th. Live traps were set in the area and the
animal was not recovered. The lab manager checked the enclosure for damage or debris and could not find any. The
IACUC has scheduled process improvement and required procedural retraining for all husbandry and lab staff.

Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar problems from
occurring in the future.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC staff and Attending Veterinarian.
