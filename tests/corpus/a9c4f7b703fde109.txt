2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male red and white Shih Tzu named Red Man with the number 446 has matted hair around both eyes. He
has a large amount of a brownish green discharge in the hair around the inside of both eyes near the muzzle. Upon
closer inspection, both of his eyes appear normal. The licensee was advised to communicate with the veterinarian
if the eyes started to look reddened or continued to produce an excessive amount of discharge once the hair around
the eyes was groomed.
Matted hair around the eyes can be uncomfortable or painful, keep the dog from seeing normally, can irritate the
eyes and possibly cause an eye injury.
This dog must have the hair trimmed around the eyes and the area cleaned. As part of the facility's program of
veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance to ensure that animals
are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a regular basis.
