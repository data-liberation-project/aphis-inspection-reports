ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were two dogs found with excessively long hair. The first, a maltese identified with USDA tag number 14,
had mats hanging along each side of the body and additional mats hanging off the face. The second, a yorkie
identified with USDA tag number 12, had hair so long the entire face and eyes were covered. Long hair and mats
can be painful to the dogs. Proper care for all dogs includes routine hair trims to prevent painful mats.
By close of business tomorrow May 13, 2015 have the two dogs trimmed and remove all mats.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The two dogs found with long and matted fur are an indication that currently the daily observations being conducted
to assess the health and well-being of all dogs is inadequate. Failure to provide adequate daily assessments result
in prolonged states of ill-health.
Proper daily observations should include an assessment of all aspects of the dogs' well-being including a
determination of the need for grooming.
By close of business May 12, 2015, conduct daily observations of all dogs to determine health and well-being.
Schedule grooming and veterinary care as appropriate in response to assessments conducted.

Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
