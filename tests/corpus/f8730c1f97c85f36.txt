FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.125 Facilities, general.
(a) Structural strength.
--The outdoor housing facility is not being maintained in good repair. In the pen containing 7 hoofstock, there is a
board on the ground with several exposed nails with the sharp points extending upward, the floor of a food
receptacle is rusted and not adequately sanitizable, one of the sheds has many areas where the wood has been
eaten away leaving large open areas in the sides of the shed, there are 2 boards on the West fence where only
pieces of the boards remain and one piece has a sharp point, and there are several sharp wire ends protruding into
the pens. The areas of disrepair such as the exposed sharp nails, the pointed board piece, and the protruding
sharp wire ends could potentially injure the animals. The facility must use construction materials appropriate for the
animals involved and that are structurally sound and must maintain the outdoor housing facilities in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
The facility corrected the issues, with the exception of the chewed sides of the shed and the rusty food receptacle,
on site during the inspection. The shed is to be repaired with materials appropriate for the animals by 5-12-14. The
rusty food receptacle should be repaired so that it is not rusty and becomes readily sanitizable or be replaced by
5-12-14.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Sec. 3.129 Feeding.
(b) Food, and food receptacles
--The food receptacles are not being kept clean as 2 of the feed mangers for the 7 hoofstock contained fecal
material. Food receptacles contaminated with fecal material contaminates the feed and may lead to increased
internal parasite issues and other health issues that could endanger the animals. The facility shall keep all food
receptacles clean and sanitary at all times. The facility corrected the issue by cleaning the food receptacles during the inspection. A program should be
instituted to maintain the receptacles in a sanitary condition. This might include redesign and relocation of the feed
receptacles so as to minimize contamination.
3.131
SANITATION.
Sec. 3.131 Sanitation.
(a) Cleaning of enclosures
--The animals are being contaminated with excreta as it is not removed from the enclosure adequately. The fecal
material had not been removed from the enclosure for 5 days. The Watusi and the Zebu are observed reclining on
the shed floor that is covered with fecal material. Fecal contamination of the skin of the animals may lead to health
issues and pest control issues with flies. The facility shall remove excreta from the primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamintaion of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odors.
The animal caretaker corrected this by cleaning the enclosure containing the 7 hoofstock during the inspection. A
program should be established and maintained to ensure adequate sanitation.
The records inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The facility inspection and exit interview were
conducted with the animal caretaker.
A followup exit interview was conducted with the owner on 4-18-14 by telephone.
