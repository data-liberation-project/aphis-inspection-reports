***The larger brown nosed coatimundi cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for lethargic behavior, slightly
labored breathing, and poorly responsive to stimuli has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. While the animal
appeared alert and responsive during this inspection, the hairless tip of the tail now appears very red and scabby.
This brown nosed coatimundi must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with the species and the
recommendations followed as soon as possible.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The larger arctic fox cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for being thinner than its cage mate, fecal
staining on the fur of its hind quarters, and not having grown in its new winter coat has still not been evaluated by a
veterinarian. While the animal appeared to have a normal body condition and its new winter coat with no fecal
staining during this inspection, slower winter coat development and problems maintaining a normal weight as
described above may be indicative of disease. This arctic fox must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with
the species and the recommendations followed as soon as possible.
***The bobcat cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for abnormal pacing in its enclosure and for spending
the majority of its time in the rafters has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. The bobcat came down from the
rafters to stand near the licensee during this inspection. No pacing was observed today. The bobcat still spends
most of its time in the rafters according to the licensee. Abnormal behavior patterns may be indicative of physical or
psychological issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modifications, and must be evaluated
by the attending veterinarian as soon as possible to receive appropriate treatment and management.
***The smaller of the brown nosed coatimundi cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for abnormal pacing
behavior in its enclosure has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. While this coatimundi was not observed
pacing during this inspection, episodes of abnormal behavior patterns may be indicative of physical or psychological
issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modifications, and must be evaluated by the
attending veterinarian as soon as possible to receive appropriate treatment and management.NOTE: The pot bellied pig overgrown hooves have been trimmed.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A deer was cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for not providing veterinary care for
the animal following a serious injury. The owner euthanized the deer by gunshot without consulting the attending
veterinarian for guidance regarding veterinary care. The animal needed veterinary care and should have been
examined by the attending veterinarian to determine the appropriate treatment or the need euthnasia. Gunshot is
not an acceptable method of euthanasia, except under certain circumstances, such as an emergency or in a field
situation when other methods more acceptable methods are not feasible. Gunshot must not be used as a method
for routine euthanasia in situations in which an animal needs veterinary care, except as recommended by the
attending veterinarian. Correct from this day forward by consulting the attending veterinarian regarding the need for
euthanasia and the appropriate method of euthanasia to be performed. NOTE: The current Program of Veterinary
Care does not list gunshot as a method for euthanasia. Correct by January 19, 2017

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
***The boards used to partially block the 1 inch by 1 inch floor openings in the rabbit cages appear to be treated
wood and particle board. The particle board has irregular edges that appear chewed. The boards could pose an
ingestion or injury hazard to the animals. Outdoor housing facilities for rabbits must be structurally sound,
maintained in good repair, and protect the rabbits from injury.
3.50(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal
***The enclosures housing three rabbits had an accumulation of fecal and a dark yellow material under the raised
cages. There was an excessive amount of feces in the corners of each of the cages. Accumulations of manure can
lead to strong odors, attract pests, and may pose a disease hazard for the animals. The accumulation of fecal
material must be removed for the health and well-being of the animals and to maintain an effective pest control
program.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The licensee could not produce a written plan for environmental enhancement. Such plans are necessary to
ensure that non-human primates receive enrichment that is effective and address their species specific andindividual needs. A written environmental enrichment plan helps ensure that the psychological needs of the lemurs
are met. The facility must develop a comprehensive written enrichment plan with the attending veterinarian for the
two lemurs.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
***The prairie dog enclosure has a mesh floor with approximately 1 inch by 1 inch diamond shaped openings. While
there is straw bedding on part of the flooring. Some areas are bare and the animals’ feet could become entrapped in
the openings. Modifications must be employed to prevent entrapment hazards and foot injuries to the prairie dogs.
***The gate for the goat enclosure is loosely attached with twine and metal clips. The gate must be secured and
repaired for the safety and containment of the animals.
***The squirrel cage has sharp points and gaps between the mesh sides and top. The licensee stated that on
occasion he has found wild squirrels sharing the enclosure with the regulated animals. These issues may result in
escape, injury or disease transmission. The squirrel cage must be repaired to prevent escape or access by wild
animals.
***The zebu and highland cow enclosure post securing the gate is leaning outward. The open end of the gate is
secured only with twine. The gate post must be repaired and the gate properly secured for the containment and the
safety of the animals.
***A Jacob’s sheep enclosure containing seven sheep has loose fencing held together by twine. This may
predispose to entanglement, injury or escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.
***The bobcat enclosure has two areas of wood that attach to the rafters. The wood has sharp jagged edges. The
bobcat at the time of this inspection was resting on a ledge near one of the jagged pieces of wood. There was also
a piece of wood hanging downward from the rafters that may fall into the enclosure and injure the bobcat. The
pieces of wood must be removed to prevent injury to the animal.
***The brown nosed coatimundi enclosure floor was constructed of multiple pieces of wood placed in a manner that
left an uneven surface and created spaces for food and debris to collect. The wire floor of the enclosure under the
wood has rusted through in numerous areas and is sagging. On the side of the enclosure facing the public barrier
the attached diamond fencing was bent into the enclosure exposing the animals to sharp ends of the metal. The
back edge of the resting platform had rusted through in areas, leaving sharp jagged edges. The animals must be
moved to another enclosure or the enclosure must be repaired in a manner that ensures structural strength,
prevents injury, and facilitates husbandry practices.3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage
***One open bag of corn was stored on the ground by the outdoor lemur enclosure. Improper storage can result in
unwholesome food being fed to the animals which can lead to dietary deficiencies and food borne illnesses. Bagged
food for the animals must be appropriately stored to protect against deterioration, molding, and contamination by
vermin to ensure that the food is wholesome.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste Disposal
***The squirrel cage still has an excessive amount of sunflower seed and peanut hulls, and other food wastes in the
bottom of the cage. The amount of waste has decrease from the previous inspection but the food waste is still being
left to accumulate in the bottom of the cage.
Excess waste can become an attractant to pests and must be cleaned on a frequent basis. Animal and food wastes
must be removed from cages and disposed of away from animal enclosures. Wastes should be removed and
disposed of in a designated area immediately and in accordance with county and state laws.
3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from Inclement Weather
**The alpaca enclosure has a covered shelter with only one solid wall and a partial wind block on the side opposing
the solid wall. Shelters should be constructed in a manner that provides protection from at least three sides for the
weather condition in this locale. Failure to protect animals from detrimental weather conditions can negatively
impact their health and ability to fight disease. The shelter needs to be modified to provide additional protection from
the wind.
NOTE: The cavy, raccoon, arctic fox, fallow deer, and potbelly pig now have adequate shelter.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of Enclosures
***The Patagonian cavy enclosure housing 5 cavies still contained numerous fecal pellets.
***The bobcat enclosure contained a large accumulation of old feces and other debris in a pile near the front of the
enclosure.
***An excessive amount of old feces was present under the shelter of the white-nosed coatimundi enclosure.Exposure to excessive amounts of feces, urine, and soiled bedding may pose a disease hazard to the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals with excreta, minimize
disease hazards and reduce odors.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Pest Control
Numerous rat holes were still observed around the lemur, prairie dog, cavy, cape porcupine, and pheasant
enclosures. Additionally, rat feces were seen in the building for food storage. Rats are known to carry various
disease hazards and a safe and effective pest control program is required for animal health. Additional measures to
prevent harborage and recolonization must be implemented to ensure there is an effective means of controlling the
rodent population.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 50 animals and numerous non-regulated species. Based upon the number of
animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal, maintenance, and veterinary care
there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry responsibilities of the facility
on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out the day to day husbandry
duties and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to ensure that cleaning,
animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at professionally acceptable level
for the number of animals housed at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
