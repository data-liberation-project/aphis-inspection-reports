2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not address all species at the facility. Licensees' with part time
attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC) that addresses the
preventive care for all regulated species. This is required so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is
working with a veterinarian and is following the recommendations from that veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed for this facility by the attending veterinarian that includes
recommendations for all regulated species at the facility. Examples of topics to be covered in the PVC are:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program if appropriate for the species.
*Vaccination recommendations if appropriate for the species.
*Routine medical testing if appropriate for the species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Hoof trims for animals with chronic hoof problems.
*Any other medical/husbandry recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
The PVC must be signed and dated by the attending veterinarian. This document must indicate to USDA
representatives that the licensee and the veterinarian have an active working relationship.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several hoofed stock appear thin with prominent hip bones and ribs. The thin hoof stock include multiple white
tailed deer, several hog deer, and one oryx. The licensee is responsible for ensuring all animals receive adequate
veterinary care in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. These animals must be
evaluated by a veterinarian to assess their body conditions and develop an appropriate treatment plan.One zebu has long hooves on the front feet which can adversely affect the gait when the animal walks. The
licensee is responsible for ensuring that all animals receive adequate veterinary care in order to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This animal must be seen by a veterinarian and appropriate hoof care
performed.
3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two ringtail lemurs were housed in an outdoor enclosure with only one heat lamp available. The temperature at the
time of this inspection was 44 degrees at 10:30 am with an overnight low the previous evening (at midnight ) of 37
degrees. The single heat lamp did not provide enough heat to both lemurs in this enclosure to prevent the ambient
temperature from falling below 45 degrees. Outdoor housing facilities must provide adequate shelter from the
elements at all times. It must provide protection from the rain, snow, wind, and cold, and prevent the ambient
temperature from falling below 45 degrees. The two ringtail lemurs were moved to an indoor housing facility during
this inspection.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of this inspection the licensee did not have a plan for environmental enrichment for the primates. An
enrichment plan approved by the attending veterinarian needs to be developed that includes specific provisions
such as appropriate social grouping and providing means of expressing species typical behaviors (such as swings
and perches).
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather. One female camel and her baby, together with 21 goats, are housed together in
one outdoor enclosure. The single shelter in this enclosure is not tall enough or wide enough to comfortably house
both of the camels and all of the goats during inclement weather. An additional taller shelter must be added to this
outdoor enclosure to provide adequate shelter for both camels and additional shelter is needed for all 21 goats in
this enclosure.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
The twenty one goats in one enclosure were being feed corn on a 4 foot by 4 foot piece of plywood from outside of
the animal enclosure. Goats were climbing on top of each other and were reaching their heads and necks under
the fence in order to reach the food on the plywood. Food receptacles must be in sufficient quantity and located soas to be accessible to all the animals in the enclosure. To be corrected by: January 7, 2016.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
At the time of this inspection, the outdoor serval yard had a large accumulation of dried, white fecal material. Feces
must be removed from animal enclosures as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
Routine cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures must be done frequently to protect the health and well-being
of the one serval housed in this enclosure.
