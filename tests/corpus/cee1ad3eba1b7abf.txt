ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male Pug (USDA # 245) was found initially squinting its left eye with a greenish/grey thick discharge on the
inner corner of the eye and on the eyelids. Upon closer examination, the left eye was observed to have a fluid-filled
opaque ulcer-like mass covering at least one-third of the cornea. Both lower and upper conjunctiva were also
swollen, red, and inflamed. The licensee stated that he was not aware of nor was he currently treating this problem.
Failure to provide appropriate methods to prevent, control, and treat injures such this eye injury can result in pain
and suffering in the animals and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. This dog requires veterinary
attention. Correct this by having this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian and following all treatment
recommendations.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outdoor areas of two enclosures have broken metal attachment clips that connect the upper wall and floors
together. This has resulted in a one foot area where the wall and floor are not secured together which is both an
escape hazard and an area which could injure the dogs. Correct this by repairing or replacing these broken areas.
