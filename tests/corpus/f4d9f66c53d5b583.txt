2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The disposition information of ten hedgehogs sold since September 2021 was incomplete or missing. Six of the ten
hedgehog sales records included the buyer’s name, phone number, and an email address but did not include sales date,
address, or USDA number for the individual (or driver’s license number/state and vehicle number/state if not licensed).
The other four hedgehog sales have no information or documentation regarding the sale.

Without records which fully disclose the animal’s disposition information, legal and medical information traceback is not
possible. The facility shall make, keep, and maintain records that fully and correctly include all the required acquisition
and disposition information. The disposition information must include the name and address of the person to whom the
animals were sold or given, the USDA license number of the person (if licensed) or the vehicle license number/state and
driver's license number/state (if not licensed), the date of disposition or sale, the species of animal, and the number of
animals involved.
