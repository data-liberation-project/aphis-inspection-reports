ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30pm on
21-Jun-18.
I arrived at the facility at around 12:30pm June 21, 2018. The facility had a closed sign on the door so I contacted
the licensee on the phone. They stated they were not available for an inspection today. I thanked them for their time
and left.
