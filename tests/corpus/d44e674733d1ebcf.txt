Facilities, general.
1. During this inspection it was noted that the shelter in the zebra enclosure is in need of repair. The right side had a
section of chain link fence that was attached to the wood wall. The zebra has chewed the wood and now there is a gap
between the chain link fence and the edge of the wood wall. To ensure that the zebra is not injured on this gap it will need
to be addressed.

2. The shelter in the fallow deer enclosure was also in need of repair. The wall on the right side of the shelter is bowing
outward. There are missing shingles along the edge of the roof. There was also a roof over the hay feeder that is in
disrepair. The edges are jagged and nails are exposed. These areas need to be addressed to ensure that the deer are
not injured.
