FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing material attached to the metal rods surrounding the steer's enclosure was in disrepair. The metal rod
enclosure was lined with broken fencing that had sharp points that were poking straight up and some points were
poking straight into the pen. All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points and protruding
edges in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance
must be in place.
