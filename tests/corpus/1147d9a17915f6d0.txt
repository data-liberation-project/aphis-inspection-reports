3.90(a) CRITICAL
CARE IN TRANSIT.
On 10/9/18 the transporter accepted 73 rhesus macaque primates for transport. The shipment originated in Oregon,
and 44 animals were to be delivered to Maryland, with 29 going on to New Jersey. Upon arrival in New Jersey on
10/11/18 (around 8:30 PM local time, according to receiving staff), one animal, ID number 34597, was found to be
down and unresponsive in the shipping crate, and subsequently died following treatment efforts overnight. The
veterinarian who treated the animal documented the primary diagnosis as dehydration.
Upon reviewing the “Animal Health Observation Log” that the drivers complete during the trip the following notation
was observed on 10/11/18 at 7:48 AM to 8:11 AM Pacific Time: “Feed, Water by JKL – All Alert, Active”. The next
notation for the 29 animals continuing to NJ was made upon their arrival there, at 6:30 PM Pacific Time, and states:
“Delivered Cargo”. During the lapse of approximately 10.5 hours there is no record of an observation of the animals,
and it was during this time period that the animal with ID # 34597, collapsed and became unresponsive.
The transporter must observe the nonhuman primates while in transit at least once every four hours. They must be
able to determine whether any of the animals are in obvious physical distress, and obtain appropriate veterinary
care. Failure to adequately observe and assess animals while in transit can result in unnecessary suffering and
death. The transporter must ensure that nonhuman primates are adequately observed at least once every four
hours while in transit, from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the company representative for JKL Secure Freight.
