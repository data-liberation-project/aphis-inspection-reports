FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure for the otters has a latex/rubber like coating which is coming loose in several places
throughout the enclosure. There is a hole about the size of a softball next to the pool and it appears to be loose
underneath the area surrounding the hole. There a places next to the wall which are loose as well. This provides
the potential for the otters to enlarge these loose areas by pulling and tearing at them. This could damage the
integrity of the enclosure and pool area as well as possible ingestion of loose pieces by the otters. This loose
coating needs to be replaced or repaired in order to correct this problem. A regular program of maintenance needs
to be in place and followed to keep all surfaces intact and in good repair.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The enclosure housing two northern flying squirrels is too small to allow the squirrels the natural ability to glide. The
enclosure is large enough for normal ground movement and behavior, but not for gliding. Having the space to
perform natural behaviors and movements is essential and limiting an animal's ability for normal behavioral
movements can lead to stress and health problems. The squirrels need to be moved to a larger enclosure or their
present enclosure enlarged to allow for at least limited gliding ability.
