2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On April 13, 2017, this inspector visited the facility for a second time, and was able to confirm unlicensed activity by
the operation of a petting farm on the premises. At the time of the inspection, a third application package was
hand-delivered to the site manager for their action. Once again, the basics of the application process and aspects
of USDA regulations on petting farms/zoos were explained in detail to the site manager.
Any person operating or intending to operate as an exhibitor, except persons who are exempted from the licensing
requirements under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must have a valid license. The owner of the facility must apply
for a license by submitting the required information/documentation to the USDA-APHIS-AC Regional Director in
Raleigh, North Carolina. In the license application form, the establishment must provide the information requested,
including a valid mailing address through which the owner could be reached at all times, and a valid premises
address where animals, animal facilities, equipment, and records may be inspected for compliance. Also, on
February 16, 2017, the USDA-APHIS-AC Regional Office mailed via USPS a second packet with all license
application materials.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT OBTAINING A VALID USDA LICENSE.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility's general manager.
