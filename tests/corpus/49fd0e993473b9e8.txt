2.31(d)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 12-U-XXX involving 2 pigs was being given Bupivacaine as a preoperative anaesthetic without approval
from the IACUC. According to the Principal Investigator, she decided to use Bupivacaine instead of the IACUC
approved 2% Lidocaine as the preoperative anaesthetic because of the longer-acting duration. The PI did consult
with the Attending Veterinarian before implementing the drug change. While it is applaudable that the PI is seeking
better pain management, all significant changes must be approved by the IACUC unless the IACUC has a written
policy that gives the AV authority in making these decisions. Currently, there is no policy that grants significant
changes can be made without IACUC approval. It is necessary for an IACUC to review and approve the proposed
activities and significant changes for the care and use of animals and to provide the proper oversight of the use of
animals by the research facility. Lack of supervision by an IACUC often leads to non-compliances with the Animal
Welfare Act and this decreases animal welfare. Correct by ensuring all animal use activities and proposed
significant changes have been approved by the IACUC before any animal procedures or changes are begun.
Correct this day forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director of Research Compliance.
