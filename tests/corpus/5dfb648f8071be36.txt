PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
Section 3.137(a)(2) Primary enclosures used to transport live animals: Farm animals are transported in the
compartments of the red livestock trailer. The metal sides of the red trailer are rusted through in areas along the
bottom edge where the sides meet the floor of the trailer; leaving small holes/gaps and jagged metal above the floor
which could cause injury to the animals being transported. The sides of the red trailer must be repaired to prevent
injury to the animals. Correct by June 11, 2016.
