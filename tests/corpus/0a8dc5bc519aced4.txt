2.40(a)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two female guinea pigs in pen 8 had hair loss that extended the length of their flanks making them bare in this area.
The underlying skin was normal in color and the animals were not seen scratching at the time of inspection. The
owner had noted the hair loss but had not contacted the veterinarian. A bottle for ivermectin spray was present at
the facility as ordered by the PVC but the owner stated that that was not the mixture it contained. Failure to include
the veterinarian by notifying them of abnormal conditions or by following prescribed procedures does not ensure
that the animals are being treated promptly and appropriately and may lead to spread of disease within the colony.
Correct by having the veterinarian examine these animals and assuring that the attending veterinarian has
appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other
aspects of animal care and use. This includes prompt notification of problems, treatment as directed by the
veterinarian, and records of the observations, treatments, and outcomes which are to be maintained for review by
USDA personnel upon request. Correct By: 25 March 2016
An exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
