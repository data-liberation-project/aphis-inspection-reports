Separation.
USDA inspectors observed two foxes with healing wounds on the left side of their necks. One fox was in an enclosure
that houses foxes and bears and another fox was housed in an enclosure that houses only foxes. According to a facility
representative and the Attending Veterinarian (AV), the wounds occurred due to fights associated with mating season.
The licensee had notified the AV prior to this inspection and has followed the AV’s treatment plan for the foxes. Animals
housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere with
their health or cause them discomfort.
