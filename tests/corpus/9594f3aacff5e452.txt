2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care available for APHIS inspection. The lack of a written
Program of Veterinary Care does not ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time
attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor. The facility must create a written Program of
Veterinary Care with their Attending Veterinarian.

2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There are at least 3 female goats with overgrown rear hooves. The hooves are folded in appearance and one goat's
hooves are curving to the side. The facility representative stated the person from whom the goats are acquired from
usually trims the goat's hooves before bringing them to the facility but they must have missed these goats. The
representative states they were aware of the overgrown hooves but did not have a plan in place to trim the hooves.
Overgrown hooves may lead to lameness, affect the gait of the animal, or cause pain and discomfort to the animal. The
facility must use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The facility must

trim the affected goat's hooves and maintain a healthy hoof care plan in the future.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have a Record of Animals on Hand or any written list of the animals currently at the facility and the
required information of whom those animals have been acquired from. Acquisition information is necessary for APHIS
officials to make positive identification of animals during inspection and to properly trace their movements.
Each exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information
concerning animals, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under
his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The
records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. These
records shall include the name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired from, the USDA license
or registration number of the person if they are licensed under the Act, the vehicle license number and state and the
driver's license number and state of the person if they are not licensed under the Act, the name and address of the person
to whom an animal was sold or given to, the date of the purchase, acquisition, sale or disposal of the animal, the species
of the animal, and the number of animals in the shipment.
The facility must create and maintain a record of acquisition information for the animals. The facility must ensure all
required information is properly and accurately documented at all times.

3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.

There is a twisted piece of chicken wire creating an approximately 1 inch in length sharp point in an enclosure housing 4
kittens. The sharp point is at leg height of the kittens. This sharp point may cause injury to the animals.
Housing facilities for cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in
good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. The facility must remove the sharp point and ensure the
enclosure protects the animals from injury at all times.

3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
The inspector observed 2 kittens approximately 10 weeks of age have their feet pass through wire flooring. A portion of
the enclosure wire flooring was 2 inches by 1 inch and the kittens had to make intentional walking movements to not allow
their feet to pass through the flooring, but their feet did eventually pass through the flooring.

Flooring that allows cats’ feet to pass through may lead to injury and cause discomfort, pain, or mobility issues. Primary
enclosure floors must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the cats’ feet and legs from injury from this day
forward.

To be corrected by: This was corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.50(a)

Facilities, general.
There were three staples sticking straight out into the rabbit hutch enclosure from the wooden frame. The points were
approximately 1/2" in length and were at neck height of the three rabbits enclosed. The wooden frame trim within the
enclosure has also been heavily chewed on leaving rough edges and is not kept in good repair. Sharp points may cause

injury to the rabbits.
Housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from
injury. The facility must remove the sharp points and ensure the wooden hutch is kept in good repair and protects the
animals from injury at all times.
