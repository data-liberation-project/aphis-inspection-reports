2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The Laboratory study notes for Rabbit Study A show insufficient documentation of daily observations following tumor
implantation on 8/18/22. According to the protocol animals will be observed for signs of distress such as lethargy, lack or
response to stimuli, food and water intake, feces and urine output, respiratory distress, guarding incision, hiding in the
corner, aggression, and physical examination at the incision site. The records provided at the time of inspection showed
little documentation of fecal output, feed consumption and the other parameters for signs of distress. Weights were only
recorded on 8/18/22, 8/23/22, and 8/31/22. On 8/31/2022, there were observation notes that indicated the rabbit did not
accept treats, had decreased fecal output, and decreased energy. The rabbit's symptoms were not reported to the
veterinary staff as indicated in the protocol.
The Animal Caretaker contacted the RAR Veterinary Staff on 9/1/22 after noting the rabbit was lethargic and the
fecal/urine output was decreased. RAR Veterinary Staff examined the rabbit. The rabbit was euthanized and the body
condition score at necropsy was 1 of 5.
Monitoring parameters stated in the protocol were not appropriately followed and documented by the research staff. The
research staff did not notify the RAR veterinary staff on 8/31/22 that the rabbit's weight had decreased and the health of
the animal had declined. As a result, the examination of the rabbit by a facility veterinarian was delayed.


Animals must be observed daily to assess their physical and psychological well-being. Any abnormalities noted must be
reported to the veterinarian. Should the daily observations be done by someone other than the attending veterinarian, a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication must be employed to ensure that problems of animal health are
conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner.
At the time of inspection the IACUC was developing a corrective action plan that had not been implemented.
