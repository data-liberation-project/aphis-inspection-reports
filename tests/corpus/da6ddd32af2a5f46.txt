2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care needs to be updated. The Parasite Control Sections for Ectoparasites, Blood
parasites, and Intestinal parasites all contained the instructions of "monthly, Ivomectin". The licensee did not have
the proper dosage instructions, route of administration for this medication, and did not have the proper instructions
for the use of this medication on puppies. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a
complete and accurate written program of veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility. The written
program of veterinary care will ensure that there is accurate and clear communication between the licensee and the
attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animals by the licensee
are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee has cages that are stacked three high and secured to each other with wires. These stacked cages
were observed to wobble and sway when the dogs were active and moving around in them. These stacked cages
are not structurally sound and at a risk of toppling over which could cause injury to the dogs contained in them.
There are at least twenty adult dogs housed in these cages. The licensee must secure the stacked cages so that
they are structurally sound and do not pose a risk of toppling over.
Inside of three enclosures, containing at least three adult dogs and nine puppies, the licensee has heat lamps
provided for the dogs at a level that they could come into contact with the light bulb. The light bulb produces enough
heat that it could cause a burn injury to the dogs. These light bulbs could also break leaving shards of broken glass
that could injure the dogs and puppies. The licensee must move the heat lamps to a location that the dogs cannot
be injured by the heat or broken glass.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound andmust protect the animals from injury at all times.

3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee has secured the stacked cages with twisted wires. At least three of these enclosures, containing at
least four dogs, have the sharp ends of the twisted wires protruding into the enclosures. These sharp points could
injure the dogs. The licensee fixed some of these at the time of inspection. The licensee must remove all sharp
points from the enclosures and ensure that all enclosures are free of jagged edges or points that could injure the
dogs at all times.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an accumulation of hair, dirt and organic material on several of the enclosures walls, floors, and the pans
underneath of the enclosures inside of the facility. There is an accumulation of hair, dust and dirt adhered to and
hanging from the ceiling of the facility. This accumulation of hair, dirt, and other organic materials on the enclosures
does not allow for proper sanitization to occur. There are at least twenty adult dogs housed in these enclosures.
The hair, dust, dirt and other organic material can become a disease hazard to the animals. The licensee must
thoroughly clean the enclosures and remove the hair, dust and dirt from the ceiling. The licensee must ensure that
all hard surfaces with which the dogs come into contact with are spot cleaned daily, and sanitized at least once
every two weeks, or more often if necessary. All other surfaces within the housing facility must be cleaned and
sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The ammonia level inside of the indoor facility was very strong and prominent. There was a ceiling fan and another
larger fan running, and the windows were all closed. As the inspectors entered the facility it was noted that their
eyes, nose and throats developed a burning sensation. The licensee cracked some of the windows and opened the
screen on the screen door which helped to dissipate some of the ammonia odor. There are at least eighty-sevenadult dogs and thirteen puppies housed in this building. The ammonia odor can cause irritation to the dog(cid:25)'s eyes
and airway passages. The licensee needs to provide more ventilation in the facility to reduce the ammonia levels.
The owner must develop and maintain a program that will ensure sufficient ventilation is provided at all times when
dogs are present to provide for their health and well-being, and to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and
moisture condensation.

3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The cement floor of the indoor facility is no longer impervious to moisture. There are several areas on the floor
where water or other liquid material had soaked into the concrete. This does not allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization to occur. The licensee must make the floor of the facility impervious to moisture. The licensee must
ensure that the floors, walls, and ceiling are impervious to moisture at all times.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
All of the enclosures inside of the facility are wire cages with a plastic tray underneath to catch the urine, fecal and
food wastes. The pans were lined with newspaper that were mostly saturated with urine and/or other liquids.
Some of the pans had puddles of standing urine and/or other liquids along with fecal material and food waste.
When the inspectors asked the licensee how often she is removing and cleaning the trays she replied "weekly".
There are at least thirty adult dogs housed in these affected wire cages. The saturated paper and standing puddles
of urine could be contributing to the high ammonia levels inside of the facility. The licensee must remove the pans
from under the primary enclosures and clean them. The licensee must remove and clean these pans underneath
the enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, and to reduce
disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
