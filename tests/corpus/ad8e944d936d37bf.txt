FEEDING.
One of the chest freezers in the food storage area is in disrepair. The inside top of the freezer is no longer attached
to the lid. The plastic molding, along with multiple layers of material between the molding and the lid, lay on top of
the stored food after the lid is raised. The seal between the lid and the freezer is no longer effective. An inadequate
seal does not provide for proper refrigeration of the food.
Repair or replace the affected freezer.
