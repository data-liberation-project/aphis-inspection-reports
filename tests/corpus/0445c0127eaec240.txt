ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This was a focused inspection checking on the condition of the reindeer Clarice (F) that was on the inspection report
from December 18, 2017.
The reindeer Clarice, has not significantly changed in body condition since the previous inspection on December 18,
2017, and she is still suffering from the original issue. The attending veterinarian did not examine Clarice until
January 31, 2018, even though a correction date of December 29, 2017 had been given in the previous report. It is
extremely important that correction dates be met for the health, welfare and comfort of the regulated animal. This
animal has a significant medical issue that could have been resolved sooner, resulting in less suffering of the animal
due to the lack of veterinary input in a timely manner, as was required in the first inspection report.
During this focused inspection, there was another reindeer ' Christmas' (M) that was being housed separately due
to his severe weight loss. Christmas is very underweight with his hips, spine and ribs protruding through his winter
coat. It was also observed that there are 3 other reindeer in the pasture that are at varying degrees of underweight
condition. While there, the veterinarian observed a reindeer with a swollen left lower jaw in addition to the low
weight condition.
All medical conditions must be evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent
continued suffering/discomfort of the regulated animals.
Direct and frequent communication must be held between the licensee and attending veterinarian. Timely
communication is required so that accurate information on health problems is conveyed to the veterinarian, in order
for proper treatments to be applied. Veterinary treatment plans must be followed to care for these animals.

FEEDING.
The diet for the reindeer had been changed late fall 2017 without any discussion with the attending veterinarian.Theattending veterinarian (AV) asked the licensee to show him what type and how much food was being fed to the
reindeer. When the licensee showed the AV, the AV read the label directions and told the licensee that he had been
(for months) and still was, severely underfeeding the animals. The labeled directions required that corn and hay be
fed to the animals in addition to the pelleted feed, but only a very small amount of hay was being given and no corn.
The AV told the licensee that he must follow the directions on the feed label (in quantity and type) in order to provide
a wholesome diet with enough nutritive value to sustain the animals. The additional corn and hay rations were not
being provided in the quantities necessary to keep all of the animals in the herd at a healthy weight.
There were 5 reindeer of the 8 observed that were underweight with hips, spine and ribs showing through their
winter coats.
The lack of wholesome food fed at a sufficient quantity and nutritive value to keep the animals in good bodily
condition, can result in weight loss and illness due to improper diet. This can cause animals to suffer and possibly
die due to malnutrition or other health issues.
The licensee must follow the recommendations for proper diet by their attending veterinarian, and read all
requirements on the feed they provide to make sure they are feeding a complete diet and ration for the regulated
animals they have.
To be corrected by: From this day forward
The inspection was conducted with the licensee. The exit interview was conducted by phone until the licensee hung
up in the middle of the exit interview, as he refused to continue with the discussion.
