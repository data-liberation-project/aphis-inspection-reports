ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
WELCOME CENTER/FARM HOUSE
Hedgehog
Both hedgehogs housed inside the welcome center have excessively long nails that have curled into their paw
pads.
Guinea Pig
Two guinea pigs, one short haired and one long haired, have excessively long nails.
Excessive long nails can interfere with the animal(cid:25)'s normal gait or conformation thus affecting the animals' health
and overall well-being. The licensee in conjunction with the attending veterinarian must ensure that animals' nails
are trimmed and are following an appropriate nail trimming program.
BARN YARD
"Hannah", the pot-bellied pig, had excessively long and curled hooves on all four limbs. At the time of inspection,
this animal was laying on her abdomen with limbs outstretched. It took a couple minutes for the caretaker to get the
animal to rise into a standing position and she was reluctant to walk. An animal(cid:25)'s reluctance to stand and walk is
indicative of discomfort or pain in one or more limbs. The attending veterinarian diagnosed her with arthritis and is
currently on a treatment plan. The licensee must have this animal re-examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to
obtain an accurate diagnosis and a more effective treatment plan is developed and followed.DAIRY BARN
At the time of inspection, two of the four alpacas have excessively overgrown incisors. The attending veterinarian
documented these animals as having (cid:28)moderate overgrown incisors(cid:29) on the last site visit, July 7, 2016, but was
unable to trim teeth due to extreme heat. Overgrown teeth are less efficient for collecting food than correctly aligned
teeth and are more prone to breaking off as they lengthen. These conditions could be painful, may decrease the
alpaca's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal. An appropriate dental
treatment plan needs to developed and followed. The licensee in conjunction with attending veterinarian must
develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for all
animals in the facility.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility has a singly housed Bush Baby. The environment has been enriched and the animal is receiving human
interaction. However, a written program for environmental enhancement has not been documented and reviewed
by the attending veterinarian. The facility must document and follow a plan for environmental enhancement to
ensure that the Bush Baby is receiving appropriate enrichment for his health and well-being.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE IN NEED OF REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR:
STEER ENCLOSURE
1. The split rail fence, in front of the steer enclosure, is still leaning and not adequately secured.
2. A wooden fence post, within the split rail fence, is rotted and not secured into the ground.
The unsecured fencing, as well as the fence post, must be replaced and appropriately secured.3. The enclosure fence is composed of wooden stockade panels and wire panels on the inside of the fence. The
wire panels only cover the upper 2/3rds of the fence. Several areas of this stockade enclosure fence have broken
and/or missing slats. There are at least three areas where there are 2 foot by 2 foot gaps underneath the wire
panels that cover the interior portion of the stockade fence. These gaps are large enough to allow access of
unwanted animals. Additionally, the wooden support posts are rotted. Broken and missing slats, as well as rotted
posts, leave this primary enclosure fence in serious disrepair.
The broken and damaged panels of stockade, as well as the rotted support posts, must still be replaced to ensure
structural strength and to eliminate the open gaps under the wire panels.
4. The entire wooden floor of the shelter building is covered in large, steer sized hoof holes. Additionally, rotted
sheets of plywood, that were used to cover these holes, are loose and not secured. The loose, rotted sheets of
plywood, as well as the numerous holes, are creating harborage areas for vermin and unwanted pests. Broken
pieces of wood, from the damaged floor, are still present on the ground in front of the building entrance.
ALPACA/DONKEY/MINI HORSE ENCLOSURE
1. Curling wire mesh on all of the enclosure fences.
2. Detached center rail on the split rail fence.
3. Rotted bottom split rail.
4. Rotted wooden top rail on the fence that divides the alpaca and empty steer enclosures.
5. Exposed metal screws in the center of fence post where the center rail has detached.
6. Broken stockade fence panel in rear enclosure. (across from pot bellied pig)

SANITATION.
Cleaning.
STEER
The damaged wooden floor, inside of the steer's shelter building, is still covered with feces. This large accumulation
is now at least six months old. This shelter building has still not been cleaned out. Despite the fact that the steer is
no longer present, excreta must still be removed. Additionally, the gaping holes in the floor, along with the excreta
are harborage areas for unwanted vermin, flies and other pests.

SANITATION.
Pest control.There are at least 50 Cicada Killer tunnels present throughout the grounds of the entire enclosure for the 4 alpacas,
ponies and donkeys. These stinging wasps are at least two inches in length and pose a hazard to both the animals
as well as the employees. Additionally, there two wasps nests under the eave of the singly housed pot bellied pig's
shelter building. A safe and effective program for the control of insects shall be established and maintained.

EMPLOYEES.
Due to the number of repeat non-compliant items, it is clear that there are not enough adequately trained
employees to maintain this facility. Only two animal keepers are currently caring for the animals. A sufficient
number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices shall be under a supervisor who has a background in
animal care.

NOTE: The facility should have an on going maintenance program in place to ensure that structural issues are
addressed in a timely manner.

A thorough walk-through of the facility and exit briefing was conducted with Karla Wills, ACI, Dr. Ashley McIntosh,
VMO, the Director of Municipal Services, the Attending Veterinarian, and the Acting Township Manager.
