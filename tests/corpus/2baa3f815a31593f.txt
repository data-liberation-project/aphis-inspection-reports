3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There are several areas of fencing throughout the facility that are in a state of disrepair and/or are unable to contain the
animals.
Within the large goat enclosure on the Nature Trail, the corner of the fence closest to the feed storage area is bowing
outward which has created a large gap, approximately 4 inches by 8 feet in size, between the top bar and the chain link
fence. This bowing is caused by a large accumulation of hay that is approximately 2 to 3 feet high and allows for the
animals to easily reach over the fencing.
In the petting zoo area, the fencing does not contain the young goat kids. The panel fencing that adjoins the alpaca, goat,
and sheep enclosure and the petting zoo area has openings that are approximately 6 by 8 inches in size. This spacing is
large enough for the goat kids to jump through the fence panels, escape the enclosure, and enter the open public space.
There are also several areas of down fences within the alpaca, sheep, and goat enclosure. The fence between the two
main shelters has an area of metal paneling that has become partially trampled down into the ground. Several fence
posts between this enclosure and the adjacent horse pasture have fallen to the ground and have caused the fence lines
to also lie on the ground or partially suspended . Along the far left edge of the enclosure, there is also an area of electric
fencing that has become detached from the posts and is hanging freely. These areas of down fences have allowed the


sheep and goats to enter the adjacent horse barn and pasture areas.

Failure to maintain enclosure fencing can allow for gaps, unstable structures, or loose fencing wires which can result in
injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals. Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain them.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
In the alpaca, sheep, and goat enclosure, there is a large accumulation of bedding and feces within the large shelter area.
The accumulation is approximately 1-2 feet tall and has caused the wall panels of the shelter area to bow out and
separate from the posts. Due to several down fences, the alpaca, sheep, and goats also have access to an adjacent
horse barn. Within this barn, there is a stall with an accumulation of feces and standing water that has started to attract
flies. There is also an open stall with an accumulation of feces, various building materials, and trash. Failure to remove
accumulations of excreta from primary enclosures can allow for the spread of disease hazards, create unpleasant odors,
and attract pests. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of
the animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.
