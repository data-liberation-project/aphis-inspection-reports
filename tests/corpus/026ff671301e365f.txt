species of nonhuman primates contained in them. They must be kept in good repair and contain the nonhuman primates
securely.
All primary enclosures for non-human primates must designed, constructed and maintained to contain the non-human
primates securely to prevent injury or death to the animals.

Space requirements.
The female coati, acquired November 23rd, is housed in a wire kennel approximately 30" X 36". This enclosure is kept
right next to a larger coati enclosure housing 6 coati all together. The newly acquired female coati is displaying abnormal
behavior. She rapidly weaves back in forth behind one of the short enclosure sides. The bedding and hay has been
pushed aside in this area due to her weaving. Her repeated movement has created a bare area of enclosure floor that is
also wet. This repetitive, invariant behavior pattern with no obvious goal or function is often indicative of insufficient space
and/or environment. The coati’s display of stereotypy can also be evidence of stress. Enclosures shall be constructed and
maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with
adequate freedom of movement. Inadequate space may be indicated by evidence of malnutrition, poor condition, debility,

stress, or abnormal behavior patterns.
