2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care is incomplete. There is no written guidance from the attending veterinarian
on the name of drug, concentration, instructions for use, dose, frequency, and route of administration for ivermectin,
marbenflaxen, and fish mox. The licensee should ensure that he has written guidance from the attending
veterinarian on the name of medication, dosage, concentration, instructions for use, and route of administration on
all medications. This is to ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of all treatments taking place so that animals
are given appropriate care. Correct by March 15, 2017.
