HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a 'TV room' that the primates have access to through the floor of their next boxes, that when opened up
allows them to climb into an enclosure inside of a room in the house. During the inspection the primates were
outside in their outdoor enclosures which were cleaned according to AWA standards and regulations. The 'TV' room
was inspected and found to be full of clutter including open bedding and debris that provides many areas for
rodents, pests and possible disease hazards to exist.
The accumulation of clutter and debris can be a health hazard to the regulated animals by providing areas for them
to nest or provide methods of contact with the primates.
The licensee must keep the regulated animals out of the 'TV room' until is it properly cleaned and the clutter and
debris removed from the room. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter,
including equipment, furniture, or stored material, but may contain materials actually used and necessary for
cleaning the area, and fixtures and equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The 'TV room' where the primates have access to has a large accumulation of grime and debris throughout the
fenced enclosures. There is a large amount of hair buildup and grime on the diamond mesh fencing and dirt/grime
built up on the wooden shelf and other surfaces inside of the holding cages. The flooring of the fenced enclosures
has a buildup of dirt and grime, with old mouse feces and dead flies on the floor outside of the enclosures that the
primates can reach out and have contact with. There has not been any sanitization of these indoor facilities for a
long period of time. There is rust on several areas of the fencing that needs to be addressed. All of the clutter and
debris in the room has a buildup of grime and dirt. While there are multiple flystrips in the room, there are still a
large number of flies, there needs to be more cleaning up of the old pest strips and replacement with new ones.The lack of proper cleaning and sanitization can pose a disease and health risk to the regulated animals.
All surfaces and rooms that the regulated primates come in contact with must be properly cleaned and sanitized on
a regular basis, with daily spot cleaning and removal of waste and being conducted. The regulated animals are not
to be in these enclosures until they meet the cleaning and sanitization level of the AWA regulations and standards.
