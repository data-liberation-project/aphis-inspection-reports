2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the main kennel building, a female Weimaraner identified as "Izzy" (USDA Tag J-!7, DOB 11-22-2014) was
found to be significantly underweight. Ribs and the outline of the dorsal portions of the backbone were evident
under the skin, as were areas of the hip bones.In the neck area, there were sunken areas along the jugular furrows
on both the right and left sides. Overall, the dog appeared alert and active. The licensee stated that the dog had
trouble keeping weight on and had last littered over 12 months ago. When asked when a veterinarian had last
evaluated the dog, the licensee stated that the dog had not been evaluated by a veterinarian for the weight loss
issue.
Significant weight loss with visible bony prominences such as backbone, points of the hips and ribs, may indicate
inadequate caloric intake, parasitism, or a possible underlying disease issue.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases.
Izzy needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian within 48 hours to determine the cause of the weight loss and to
establish a treatment or nutritional plan to correct the loss of body condition.
3.6(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the main kennel building, four kennels were found to have worn and exposed wood surfaces on walls and dog
doorways.
Exposed and unprotected wood surfaces absorb moisture and can make it more difficult to adequately clean and
sanitize those surfaces. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner that enables all
surfaces in contact with dogs to be readily sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) or replaceable when worn or soiled.Correct by June 24 2019.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
On the floor of the main corridor of the whelping building there was an accumulation of old cardboard material,
bedding material, bird droppings and several beer cans. There were also several portable dog kennels being stored
in this area along with several food and water receptacles.
Accumulations of trash and debris in and around animal areas may attract rodents and insect pests which can
introduce diseases into the housing environment. Accumulations of trash and debris also makes it difficult to
adequately clean and sanitize equipment being kept in these areas.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and
free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste material and discarded matter.
