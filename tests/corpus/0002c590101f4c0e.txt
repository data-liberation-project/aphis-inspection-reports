2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, the facility did not have a written Program of Veterinary Care. Since the departure of their
two full-time veterinarians in August/September of 2018, veterinary care has been provided through part-time
contract veterinarians. Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the
case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a
written program of veterinary care.

2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
“Nigida," a 26 year old male chimpanzee, was injured on 12-09-18. A review of medical records indicated that he
had an open fracture of the toe with bone exposure, pain, clear signs of infection, and he was observed chewing at
the bone. The medical records indicated the “toe was dangling” and a veterinarian did not see the animal until
12-11-18. On 12-11-18, the veterinarian stated that the toe would likely “come off on its own.” Intermittent antibiotics
and pain meds were given, but no further treatments were administered. The medical records indicated that as late
as 1-4-19 the wound “reopened” and had still not healed. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care for wounds
can lead to unnecessary pain, infection, and/or prolonged healing of wounds.
Review of medical records, meeting records, and other communications demonstrate a lack of adequate veterinary
care for a 13 year old female chimpanzee named "Tiffany." Tiffany arrived at the facility on April 18th, 2018. The
medical records repeatedly documented anorexia (lack of interest in food, not eating enough chow, and/or not
eating enough calories) for over three months from 4/18/2018-7/28/2018. No diagnostics were done during that time
period, and no treatments were given prior to 6/26/18 except for one dose of an anti-anxiety medication on 4/23/18.
Tiffany was sedated for diagnostics on 7/28/19 when the veterinarian documented a concern regarding Tiffany’s
condition. The animal was euthanized on 8/19/2018 after continued anorexia and intermittent vomiting and diarrhea.Limited veterinary involvement and failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
Tiffany’s condition demonstrates a failure to maintain a program of adequate veterinary care.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency care.
Correct from this day forward.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection, the facility did not have a documented Environment Enhancement Plan. Exhibitors must
develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The written Environment Enhancement Plan must be made
availble for inspection.

3.82(a)
FEEDING.
A 22 year old male chimpanzee named "Tuffy" has visual evidence of body weight loss, lean body condition, and
muscle mass loss. Food logs from May 2018 through October 2018 indicate Tuffy’s main diet was “human food”
which consisted of items such as pancakes and syrup, donuts, pie, other sugared bread items, soda, pizza,
Funions, and coffee. Food items with high nutritive value, such as the protein shakes, were restricted to training
use only. From April through August 2018, Tuffy’s body weight dropped from 154 pounds to 137.5 pounds. He has
not been weighed since August 2018. During this inspection, staff indicated that he looked like he had been losing
weight for approximately 4 weeks. He has an undernourished appearance and has had intermittent episodes of
withdrawn behavior. The facility has not provided a diet of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain Tuffy in
a healthful condition and weight range.
The diet for nonhuman primates must be appropriate for the species, size, age, and condition of the animal, and for
the conditions in which the nonhuman primate is maintained, according to generally accepted professional and
husbandry practices and nutritional standards. It must be of sufficient quantity and have sufficient nutritive value to
maintain a healthful condition and weight range of the animal and to meet its normal daily nutritional requirements. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
