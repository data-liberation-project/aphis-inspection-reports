3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There is an accumulation of equipment, trash, and other items around the entrance to the barn and inside the barn
kitchen. The items outside the barn are collecting water and making it difficult to control weeds along the enclosure for


four pigs. The accumulation of trash, chemicals, and bins inside the barn kitchen makes it difficult to keep the area clean
which is attracting flies.
Accumulations of trash and other unnecessary items can negatively impact maintenance and cleaning of the facility and
contribute to pest issues. The premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in
designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.

Sanitation.
A large number of flies are inside the barn kitchen which is used to store and prepare food for the animals. These flies are
inside an open box of apples, inside the trash, and on feed that has been spilled on the ground.
There are numerous flies on the adult cows out in the pasture. The cows are repeatedly flicking their tails, swinging their
heads, and stamping their feet to remove flies.
Flies can contaminate food and cause discomfort to animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects,
ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.
