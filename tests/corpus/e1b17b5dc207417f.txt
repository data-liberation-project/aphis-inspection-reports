3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* A dog house used to house three young dogs had an hole in the side of the dog house. There was indication this
opening was from the dogs chewing and scratching on the side. This prevents required cleaning and sanitation of
the surface, thus increasing the disease potential.
For required cleaning and sanitation and the prevention of disease hazards, all surfaces must be maintained on a
regular basis.
To be corrected by, 30-November-2018.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
* Three metal self-feeders, used to feed a total of 16 adult dogs, in three enclosures had an accumulation of brown
debris. This buildup was located in the part of the metal feeder where the dogs eat from. This indicates the feeders
are not being cleaned and sanitized often enough and can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
For the prevention of an accumulation of debris, caked on feed and disease hazards, all feeders must be cleaned
and sanitized more often in accordance with Section 3.11(b) (3) of the regulation.
