3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The two rack pens with a total of 10 enclosures have rusty wire on the front side by the automatic water receptacles.
Primary enclosures must be kept in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury, contain them securely, and
constructed of smooth material which is impervious to liquids and moisture. The rusty wire by the water valves must
be repaired or replaced so that the wire can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected, will not retain odors, or expose
the animals to disease hazards. Correct by February 1, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner(cid:25)'s son.
