2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****
DIRECT: There was a female Golden Retriever (tag# 083 ) that was squinting her left eye and the eye appeared
discolored. On closer observation, most of the surface of the left eye had an uneven appearance which was also
opaque and whitish-blue in color. There was a small irregular-shaped circular lesion with a white outline present on
the upper surface of the eye closest to the nose. Viewing from the side of the animal, closest to the left ear, it
appeared that there was a reddish-brown discoloration inside the left eye. This eye condition could be the result of
injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could be painful or may cause blindness. The licensee
must have this animal seen by a licensed veterinarian no later than October 15, 2014 in order for an accurate
diagnosis to be made and an appropriate treatment plan to be developed and followed. The licensee must ensure
that all animals receive timely and adequate veterinary care at all times.
There were two bottles of expired medication found inside of the whelping building that were recently used or ready
for use on dogs and/or puppies. A bottle of Sterile Water expired on Oct 12, and when questioned by the inspectors
the licensee stated that he "had last used this product about 1 month ago" and a bottle of Pyrantel Pamoate
Suspension expired on 05/14, and when questioned by the inspectors the licensee stated that he "switched to
Panacur about 3 weeks ago". Expired medications may be contaminated, may not work as expected, and could
harm the animals. All medications used on the animals must not be expired in order to protect the health of the
animals. Licensee must ensure that all medications maintained for and used on the animals are not expired at all
times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Wet and dirty dogs
****
In three outdoor enclosures, housing 8 adult dogs, there are large puddles of water with the majority of theenclosure being wet and muddy. The dogs in these enclosures were observed with varying degrees of wet and
dirty hair coats, especially on the dogs' paws, legs, chest & abdominal areas. When the dogs' hair coats become
wet and dirty it can decrease the comfort and well-being of the animals as well as increase the risk of disease
hazards. The licensee must facilitate the drainage issue in these enclosures and ensure that all primary enclosures
are constructed and maintained so that all the dogs remain clean and dry.
To be corrected by: 15 Oct 14
