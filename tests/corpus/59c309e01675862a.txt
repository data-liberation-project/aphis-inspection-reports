INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The two capuchins live in a camper truck with only one window and no working air conditioning. During this
inspection, the box fan in the window was off and was not plugged in. A wall thermometer in the camper indicated
90 degrees Fahrenheit. This inspection was conducted in the evening as the sun was setting. Although the
capuchin who was in the camper at the time of the inspection did not appear to be affected adversely by the heat,
ventilation is required when ambient temperatures are over 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The fan was plugged in and
turned on during this inspection. To be corrected from this day on.
Inspection conducted at the Interstate Fair in Spartanburg, South Carolina.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
