Handling.
The registrant self-reported an animal incident. On October 13, 2022, a shipment of 360 animals, including 10 cotton rats,
were in transit to PA from the Vanguard location in Frederick, MD. Upon arrival the boxes were noted to be scattered all
over the transport vehicle floor. No cotton rats sustained injuries.
The driver did not use the load bars to secure the boxes per the Vanguard Standard Operating Procedure and Work
Instruction document. Primary enclosures used to transport any live animal shall not be stacked in a manner which may
reasonably be expected to result in their falling. In transit, primary enclosures must be secured in a manner that prevents
primary enclosures from being tossed or needlessly tilted.

An appropriate correction plan was implemented that included training of all company drivers on the procedures for
securing boxes with live animals and the termination of the driver.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
