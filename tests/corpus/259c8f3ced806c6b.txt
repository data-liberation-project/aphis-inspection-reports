2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On July 27, 2021 during a public exhibition in an encounter, for the public to pet a red kangaroo, a public participant was
allegedly bitten. The guest described to the Health Department that the animal was a young, small and greyish looking
kangaroo of the two on display that day named Maria. The incident was not reported to the facility by the guest but later
that evening they went to the urgent care to receive a tetanus toxoid vaccine which prompted the notification of the Health
Dept. The Health Dept. was notified on July 28, 2021 in which they immediately contacted the facility regarding the
incident requesting further information. The Health Dept. further contacted the family and received the description of the
animal to notify the facility. Since the facility has been made aware the kangaroo has been removed from the encounter
and placed in quarantine/isolation for 2 weeks. Any animal on public exhibition must be handled so there is minimal risk of
harm to the animal and the public. Proper measures shall be put in place to assure the safety of the animals and the
public. Correct immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
