HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two outdoor runs with dog houses attached that house a male and female German Shepherd that has a
buildup of dirt and grime on the side wall by the male and back walls of both dogs in the run area around the dog
doors. The inside of the dog house portions have a thick buildup of dirt/grime and hair that is in the corners and
along the front of the door entrance. This buildup is dark brown and 'gooey' in texture. Some of the dog doors in the
kennel with the boxers have a dark brown/black dirt and grime buildup located on the surfaces of both sides of the
door.
It is important that all surfaces that the regulated animals come in contact with are spot cleaned daily and able to be
sanitized. A buildup of dirt and grime can harbor bacteria and disease that can affect the health and welfare of the
animals.
The licensee must make sure all surfaces are cleaned properly to prevent a buildup of dirt and grime.
