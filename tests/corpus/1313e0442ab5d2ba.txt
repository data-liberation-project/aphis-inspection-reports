2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The written program of veterinary care had incomplete information under Section III: No animals were listed
along with diseases for which vaccines are performed. (Or N/A if not applicable) The licensee, in coordination with
the attending veterinarian, must provide more specific information on the type of products used at the facility and the
frequency of use. Ivermectin is listed as a parasite control in the Blood and Intestinal parasite program. There is no
dosage or how the Ivermecin is administrated. This is not considered to be adequate veterinary care. The licensee
must ensure that the program of veterinary care is updated with current preventive practices to ensure that all
animals are provided adequate veterinary care. The breeder must insure that the Program of Veterinarian Care is
completely filled out. USDA regulations require that the program of vet care must be completely filled out. Correct
