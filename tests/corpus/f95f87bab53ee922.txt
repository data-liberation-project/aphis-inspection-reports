NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
It was discovered that Qantas is doing business as an animal transporter at San Francisco International Airport
(SFO). Although Qantas is registered with USDA / APHIS / Animal Care as a carrier, they did not inform Animal
Care that SFO should be included as an active site. Employees stated that Qantas has been transporting animals at
SFO for more than one month. Failure to notify Animal Care means that routine inspections cannot be conducted,
which could put animal welfare at risk.
Registrants shall notify Animal Care in writing of any such changes, within ten days after making such a change.
To be corrected from this time forward.

CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, two cats had recently arrived at the Qantas cargo office on Qantas Waybill #
081-82439696 from Australia on flights QF418 and QF073. Although there was a statement on top of each of the
two carriers saying "PLEASE ENSURE I HAVE PLENTY OF FRESH WATER", there was no documentation on the
carrier regarding the time the cats had last been offered food and water prior to shipment, and no instructions for
feeding and watering during travel, beyond the aforementioned statement.
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed
on the carrier, during transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order
to help ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
To be corrected from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.At the time of inspection, two cats had recently arrived at the Qantas cargo office on Qantas Waybill #
081-82439696 from Australia on flights QF418 and QF073. Their carriers each had a label on the top, with an
illustration depicting a dog, fish, some chicks, and a turtle, and "LIVE ANIMALS" in small print.The word "Cat" was
written onto the label.
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, all enclosures for dogs and cats in transit
must be clearly labeled with the words "LIVE ANIMAL" in letters at least one inch high, on the top, and on one or
more sides. Failure to ensure proper labeling of animal enclosures could result in improper handling, which could
put the animals at risk.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with a cargo office representative.
