ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*An adult, white, female Bichon (ID #082-600-008) and a white, female, Bichon approximately four years old (ID
#16) both have an accumulation of dark brown and tan colored material coating the surface of the upper cheek
teeth. The gum line is red and swollen and has receded away from the upper cheek teeth. The buildup of abnormal
material on the teeth can be painful and lead to a decrease in appetite. It can impact the ability of the dogs to eat,
affecting the health and well being of the dog. The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian
and appropriate treatment plan administered. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided
to the inspector upon request.
An adult, female, Beagle with no identification, has excessively long toe nails on all four paws. Some of the toes
nails were curving around and underneath the dog's foot pads. Long toe nails can get stuck in the holes of the
flooring and break off causing injury. This can be very painful for the dog and affect the normal gait. All dogs must
have regular toe nail maintenance. From regular toe nail maintenance, the prevention of abnormal gait, injury from
long toe nails breaking off and growing is minimized.
A bottle of medication labeled as Ivermectin pour-on, is expired and intermingled with other medications deemed
ready for use. The expiration date listed on the bottle is 5/13. The licensee stated that the bottle has been reused
and filled with a different medication from another bottle.
Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents of the
container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications are not used
past their expiration dates. Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could
harm the animals. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled
properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations.
There are four bottles of medications being stored with syringes inserted in the top of them. One of the bottles has a
buildup of dried, crusty and white colored material where the syringe has been inserted. This can contaminate the
medication affecting the health of the dogs the medication is used for. All medications must be stored in an area thatis kept clean and in a manner that prevents an accumulation of dust and debris on the bottles.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*An adult, female Pomeranian and an adult, female Beagle do not have an official form of identification.
Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
record keeping requirements. The licensee must ensure all live dogs held on the premises are properly identified.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The east enclosure of the north side of the Main Kennel had plastic missing on the back wall along the dog door.
This was exposing bare wood.
Counting from the north, enclosure one on the east side of the Main Kennel had excessively chewed and scratched
plastic around the dog door insert. There was an accumulation of brown grime in the chewed area. The plastic was
chewed off in areas along the insert exposing bare wood. This bare wood is scratched and chewed. There are
gaps between the plastic and the wall around the dog doorway.
Counting from the north, enclosure two on the east of the Main Kennel had a plastic door that was excessively
chewed along the edge of the door. There is grey grime in the chewed area. The plastic insert for this doorway has
pieces of plastic missing exposing bare wood. There is a gap between the plastic of this insert.
Counting from the north, enclosure four on the east of the Main Kennel had large gaps between the plastic of thewall and the plastic dog door insert. The plastic along the edge of this insert was excessively chewed or scratched.
There was black grime in the chewed area. Along the bottom of this insert, where the insert and plastic wall meet,
there was plastic missing from the wall exposing bare wood.
Two inserts inside the Main Kennel were excessively chewed along the edge. These inserts do not totally cover the
wood boards inside the dog doorway. There is gaps between these wood boards. One dog doorway does not have
a plastic insert just exposed wood boards. There was gaps between these boards.
* Two enclosures in the Whelping Building had plastic dividers. These dividers had a door opening cut out in them.
These door openings were excessively chewed and scratched. There was dark grime in these chewed areas.
The above mentioned surfaces that are not being maintained cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. This can
increase the disease potential for 23 adult dogs and nine puppies.
All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization for the
prevention of disease hazards.
To be corrected by, 30-August-2016.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Fourteen dog doors and the areas around the doors and some of the plastic back walls had an accumulation of
brown grime or excreta on their surface. The hog and plastic flooring for four enclosures on the west side of the
Garage Kennel and the vinyl wire flooring for three enclosures on the east side of the Garage Kennel had an
accumulation of fecal waste. This indicates these hard surfaces are not being spot-cleaned daily. Without daily
spot-cleaning and necessary sanitization the disease potential for the 51 adult dogs increases.
All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized when necessary. This will prevent an accumulation of
grime and excreta. Also, this will reduce the disease hazards to the dogs.
3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The wash-down drainage system on the east side of the whelping building had standing fluid waste. The fluidwaste was colored brown. The fluid waste cannot rapidly drain out of the wash-down drainage system. Without
rapid elimination of the waste and fluid waste, this can cause orders, attracts insects, pests and vermin. Also, the
risks for potential for disease increases.
All drainage systems must be constructed so they rapidly eliminate waste and fluid waste. This will prevent odors,
insects, pests and vermin infestations. Additionally, the potential for disease risks for the two adult dogs and nine
puppies will be minimized.
3.6(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The eastern most enclosure on the north side and southern most enclosure on the east side of the Main Kennel
had wire protruding into the enclosures. These protruding points were at eye level of the dogs in these enclosures.
This could cause injury to the five adult dogs.
All enclosures must be free of sharp protruding points that could injure the animals.
To be corrected by, 12-August-2016.
3.6(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Counting from the north, enclosure one on the top row east side of the Garage Kennel housed two puppies. The
feet and legs of these puppies were observed passing through the holes of the vinyl wire flooring in the enclosure.
This can affect the puppies gait as they grow or cause injury from the feet getting stuck in the holes of the flooring.
This was corrected at the time of the inspection as the puppies were moved.
The southern most enclosure on the east side of the Main Kennel had dogs whose feet passed through the flooring
when walking. The three dogs housed in this enclosure gait can be affected or possible injury from the feet getting
stuck in the holes of the flooring
All grid type flooring must not allow the feet and legs of the dogs to pass through any openings for the prevention of
injury to the animals.To be corrected by, 15-August-2016.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The underneath area, for the four north enclosures of the Main Kennel, had an accumulation of fecal waste and
hair. There was a slight ammonia order present around this area. This accumulation of fecal waste can cause
orders, attract insects and pests and increase the disease hazards for the 16 adult dogs.
All areas underneath the enclosures must be cleaned more frequently. This will prevent an accumulation of fecal,
fluid and food waste, and reduce orders, insects, pests and disease hazards for the dogs.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Two large feed receptacles used to feed 16 adult dogs in the north enclosures of the Main Kennel and one red self
feeder used to feed two adult dogs in the Garage Kennel had a buildup of brown grime and debris inside the
feeders. There was white fecal waste from birds inside the two large self feeders. The part of the feed receptacle
where the dogs eat, for the red plastic feed receptacle,, had a buildup of brown grime and debris. This accumulation
of food waste, grime and debris indicates the feed receptacles are not being cleaned and sanitized often enough.
This can increase the disease hazards for the dogs.
All feeding receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized more often to prevent an accumulation of grime, debris, food
waste and feed cake on the feeder. Feed receptacles cleaned and sanitized more often will minimize the disease
hazards to the dogs.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The area around the dog food stored on pallets had an accumulation of hair, dirt, debris, discarded matter and
pieces of paper. There were empty dog food bags stored on top of the stored bags of feed. This can provide
breeding and living areas for rodents and other pest and vermin. As a result, the health of the 112 adult dogs and
48 puppies could be affected.
All buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept free of accumulations of trash, dog hair, discarded matter and
debris. This will reduce the breeding and living areas for rodents and other pest and vermin. Therefore, the healthof the dogs would not be affected.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative, Corbin Ranslem (ACI) and Randall
Wagner (ACI).
This inspection will be sent by both regular and certified mail.
