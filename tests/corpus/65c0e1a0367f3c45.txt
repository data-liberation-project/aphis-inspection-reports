FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
There was a bag of animal food material (sunflower seeds) on the counter in the 'mud room' that had evidence that
rodents have access to it. There were pencil sized holes in the bag with chew marks and seed hulls around the
bag. Facility representatives report that they have seen mice in the building. Vermin access to food materials can
contaminate the food and cause disease in study animals. To protect animal health, food materials and bedding
supplies must be stored in a manner that protects them against contamination by vermin.
