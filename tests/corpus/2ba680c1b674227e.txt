ensuring that the animals are maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. There have been no itineraries
submitted to the Regional Director or ACWest@aphis.usda.gov in 2015 or 2016. tineraries must be submitted to the
Regional Director with the required information no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel or move.
Inspector attempted to contact the licensee by phone on March 28th, 2016 via the 800 number and the personal cell
numbers listed on the website and in the file. First phone call was answered, then licensee put the call on hold and
did not pick up for five minutes. Voicemail messages were left on both numbers to call back regarding location for
attempted inspection, and no phone calls have been returned in 72 hrs. Called both numbers again on March 31st,
left additional voicemails with no response by April 5th.
