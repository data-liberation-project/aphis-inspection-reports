ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for review at the time of inspection. A written PVC
must be established and appropriately documented to ensure that adequate veterinary and animal care are
provided by the facility. It is the facility’s responsibility to have this document readily available for the inspector to
review at the time of inspection.

SANITATION.
Within the Degu Enclosure:
The metal interior walls of the waste pan at the bottom of the degu enclosure had patches of rust in the corners and
along the length of the pan. The potential ingestion of the rust could have an adverse impact on the animals’ health.
It is the facility’s responsibility to ensure that surfaces are maintained in good repair or replaced.
Degu Enclosure and Chinchilla Enclosure:
The metal water bottle holders attached to enclosures were severely rusted with sharp edges. These exposed
sharp edges could injure the animals and should not be inside the enclosures. It is the facility’s responsibility to
ensure that the furnishings (i.e. water bottle holders, enrichment, feeders) used for the animals is being repaired
and/or replaced regularly.
