FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several structural items need repair on the goat enclosures on the roof. The enclosures are all interconnected with
the ground enclosure. On the enclosure above the store, the goats have pushed the 2" X 4" wire totally loose in the
front left corner leaving a gap the goats could fall through. This area needs to be closed off until this is repaired. In
this same area, four protruding nail heads in a pallet ladder need to be removed.
The bottom of the fence wire in the walkways between the enclosures is not connected to the bottom board and is
curling up posing a tripping hazard. All bottom fencing needs to be secured so it does not curl up and so it will not
be pushed outside the board.
The ground wire on the secondary elevated enclosure with slopes is uncovered and multiple broken wires are
protruding. This wire needs to be removed or covered with dirt or sufficient substrate to keep the wires from
potentially tripping or injuring the goats.
Two support posts for the secondary elevated enclosure are loose; one is entirely disconnected from the base.
These support posts need to be repaired or replaced so that the fencing does not become pushed out or loose.
Above items to be corrected by 7-31-15.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
