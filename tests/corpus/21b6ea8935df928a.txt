RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
During today's inspection eleven rabbits were counted. During the Oct. 11, 2014 inspection the inventory was
twenty rabbits. Disposition records are documented for two rabbits sold since Oct. 11, 2014. There is no
documentation available to document the disposition of the other seven rabbits. In addition, the rabbits born during
2015 were not documented on acquisition records or disposition records. In order to allow the identification and
tracking of the rabbits, all acquisitions including births of rabbits and all disposition of rabbits must be noted in
written records. The following information must be documented for all animals acquired and all sold or otherwise
disposed off including offspring born of any animal in the facility's possession: name and address of person from
whom animals were acquired, USDA license or if not licensed the drivers license number/state and vehicle plate
number/state of person, name and address of person to whom an animal was sold or given, the date of acquisition
or disposition, the species of animal and the number of animals. Correct from this day forward.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The entryway to and front portion of the shelter structure for the pot belly pig is extremely wet and muddy. There is a
small roof over this part of the shelter structure but daylight is visible in a couple of areas and there is notgutter or
other mechanism at the edge to divert rain water from coming down off the roof into the shelter area. The pig's
lower legs and feet are covered in fresh mud. The pig has to go through the mud to get outside to exercise and get
water and food. Standing in mud can be uncomfortable to the pig and can lead to hoof problems/infections. A
suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by Jan 21, 2016.
