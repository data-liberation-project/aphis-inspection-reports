2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
On December 6, 2021 a member of the public was bitten by a black and white juvenile goat on their right thumb in the
petting zoo park. Animals that are not handled properly could result in injury of the animal and/or public. During public
exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient
distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the
public. Corrective actions were already in place at the time of the inspection..

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
