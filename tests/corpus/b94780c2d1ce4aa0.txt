WATERING.
The enclosure housing the yak and the long horn steer has an area of muddy soil in which the animals have to walk
through and stand in to access their automatic water station. Lack of an accessible water source without having to
walk through and stand in muddy soil to drink can lead to health problems related to poor water consumption and
hoof problems. Develop a method to rapidly eliminate the mud in the area of the water station or develop a method
to provide an alternative source of water for the animals. Correct by July 24, 2017.
