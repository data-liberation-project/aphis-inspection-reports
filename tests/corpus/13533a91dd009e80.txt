HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The camel is being exhibited with the potential for public contact with no employee or attendant present. The camel
is housed in a barn with access to an outdoor fenced enclosure. The public can potentially make contact with the
camel in both of these areas. The barn has a Dutch door that allows camel to come into contact with the public.
The public are allowed on the outside of the fence of the outdoor fenced area. The potential for unsupervised
contact could allow the public and/or camel to be injured.
Assure that a knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee is present during all periods of public contact with
the camel.
To be corrected: From this day forward.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility doesn't have an appropriate perimeter fence in place for the camel. The facility has been housing a
camel on the premises since last fall. The camel is/has been on exhibit at periods since that time. A perimeter
fence, at least six feet tall and at least three feet away from the camel's enclosure, is required to prevent
unauthorized persons and wild animals from contacting the camel.
Assure that a proper perimeter fence surrounds the camel's enclosure.
