ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate Methods of Treatment
At least 17 Chinchillas have a crusty yellow discharge around one or both eyes. Some of these Chinchilla's cannot
see because their eyes cannot open on their own. This has been an ongoing problem which has been assessed in
the past. However, the problem persists and the licensee is currently treating it with Ciprofloxacin. The licensee
states that the Ciprofloxacin was prescribed by a Veterinarian, but there are no instructions on how to administer the
drug, what dosages to give, or how long to treat the animals. Medication given without proper diagnosis, or without
the authorization a veterinarian can have harmful side affects, and may cause further health problems. The 17
Chinchillas displaying eye irritation must be seen by a veterinarian and a treatment plan must be created and
followed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
Enclosures housing approximately 50 chinchillas contained a tray on the floor in the past which the animals had
direct contact with. These trays have since been removed, exposing 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring
underneath. The floor no longer protects the animals from injury, as the gaps between the wire are much larger
than the feet of the chinchillas. Materials that come in contact with the animals must protect the animals from injury.

3.126(c)FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Lighting
2 sections inside the facility have inadequate lighting. The licensee stated that there are electrical problems that
have caused sections of the florescent tube lighting that runs throughout the ceiling of the facility to fail. It was
difficult to see some of the animals. There are no other sources of light available in the facility. Without adequate
lighting, there is no way to conduct daily observations of the animals and enclosures. Adequate lighting must be
available in areas where animals are present.

3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Water Receptacles
There are many sections of the watering line that has an excessive buildup of hair, cobwebs, and excreta built up on
them. Unclean watering lines can contaminate the water supply which can affect the animals in a negative way. All
watering lines must be cleaned or replaced in order to assure a clean supply of water to the animals.
3.131(a) DIRECT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
There was an excessive accumulation of excreta and food waste in many of the primary enclosures. Some animals
currently cannot find adequate areas in their enclosure where they can stand or walk without being in waste. There
were multiple primary enclosures and enclosure runs throughout the facility that had an excessive accumulation of
wood shaving waste, cobwebs, fur, and dust. The facility failed to maintain the primary caging of these animals in a
sanitary condition. Unsanitary conditions can lead to biological disease hazards and can affect the comfort of the
animals as well as their health and well-being. Eliminate the buildup of waste material from the primary enclosures
and maintain in a clean and sanitary condition.

3.132 DIRECTEMPLOYEES.
Employees
There were numerous repeat and/or direct noncompliances identified on the inspection. The licensee stated that in
order to properly clean some areas, other areas must be neglected. Without an adequate number of trained
employees, both the animals and the facility itself do not receive the proper amount of care that is required for good
husbandry practices. The licensee must attain enough employees to adequately and properly care for the animals
and preform all husbandry requirements.
