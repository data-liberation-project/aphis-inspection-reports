INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of IACUC records show that during 2014, the Committee met one time in a 12 month period. As a result, the
facility was not able to meet the following requirements:
(1) Review, at least once every six months, the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals,
using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A--Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation.
(2) Inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research facility's animal facilities, including animal study
areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A-Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation; Provided, however, That
animal areas containing free-living wild animals in their natural habitat need not be included in such inspection.
(3) Prepare reports of its evaluations conducted as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and
submit the reports to the Institutional Official of the research facility.
A system should be in place and maintained to ensure all IACUC activities are completed as required.
To be corrected for all future inspections.
2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The method of humane euthanasia for the rabbits at this facility consists of the inhalation of carbon dioxide gas
without prior sedation. In addition there is nothing written in the protocols which justifies this method. The 2013
AVMA Guidelines for Humane Euthanasia for this species state that "while CO2 is an effective method of
euthanasia, its use as the sole agent in rabbits results in apparent distress to the rabbit. Premedication with
sedative agents will allow for the administration of CO2 for euthanasia". Therefore, the use of CO2 alone as the sole
method of euthanasia is not consistent with generally accepted methods of euthanasia for rabbits. A system that
follows the currently accepted standards of humane euthanasia must be in place.
To be corrected from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
