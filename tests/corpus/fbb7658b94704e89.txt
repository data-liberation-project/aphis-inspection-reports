FEEDING.
Carrots are being sliced to sell to the public for feeding. The metal carrot slicer is bolted onto a table which is dirty
and the surface of the metal push plate for the carrot slicer is grimy. Grease could also be felt on the slicer which is
WD 40. This is not a food grade lubricant and should not be used to oil this device. Some of the sliced carrots are
in a white bucket and old carrot shreds are at the bottom of the bucket as they were not dumped before refilling.
All utensils, receptacles, and preparation surfaces used to prepare food need to be kept clean and sanitary.
To be corrected by 5-18-16.
Exit interview conducted with employee representative.
Inspection conducted at Heritage Park at Simpsonville, SC park.
