***In the outdoor facility there was an adult female Maltese identified as #189 that had wads of matted hair on her
feet and around the anal area. The matted hair around the rear of the dog had feces within the matted hair.
The licensee understands that the matted hair on this dog's rear end must be removed today. February 22, 2016.
There was also an adult female Poodle identified as #16 that had wadded and ropey matted hair on the back legs,
hip areas and wads of matted hair around the nose and eyes. Matted hair can cause pain or discomfort to the
animal. In addition, matting can create or worsen skin infections and can hinder the animal's ability to move or
defecate normally. Matted hair does not provide appropriate insulation for the animals. The owner must remove the
matted hair on these dogs and assure that all regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
To be corrected by February 23, 2016.
This inspection began at 1257.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative and Bev Hicks, ACI.
