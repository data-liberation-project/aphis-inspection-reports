Sanitation.
The hedgehog enclosure located in the reptile house had many small cockroaches crawling throughout, on the floor, on
the nest box and on the food in the feeding bowl. The cockroaches appeared to be entering from a small gap at the rear
of the enclosure. The presence of pests, such as cockroaches, can lead to health hazards for the animals. The pests can
also contaminate food, water, and living areas. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites,
avian and mammalian pests must be established and maintained.
