Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The outdoor housing facilities for 12 adult dogs had no dry floor available except the plastic dog shelter with straw
bedding present that is approximately 3 feet by 3 feet in size. According to the Weather Channel, the temperature on this
day had a high of 19 degrees F and a low of 11 degrees F. The inspector's kestrel read 20.5 degrees F. Three Golden
Retrievers in one enclosure had wet feet and at least one female had wet fur up her front legs, belly and neck. In a
neighboring enclosure, a female chocolate lab was intermittently shivering in her plastic shelter. The facility representative
stated that this dog is timid and is shaking due to the inspector's presence. The inspector took steps back from the shelter
and the dog left the shelter, walked to the water bowl and back into the shelter. She immediately laid back down with her
feet tucked into the straw. All of the adult dogs have to walk across a wet floor to drink water and eat their food. There are
shallow pools of water and organic material in several enclosures. The facility representative stated at the time of
inspection, they had cleaned and sanitized two weeks ago but the floors don't dry.
The facility's veterinarian stated in a phone call that they approve the short haired dogs living outside as long as extra
bedding and extra food is provided. The vet also suggested the facility take the female lab's temperature to make sure
she was healthy enough to be outdoors. Wet flooring mixed with organic materials may cause disease hazards and cause
the dogs to become wet or soiled and hinder their ability to stay warm in cold weather.
Standing water must be removed from the primary enclosure and animals in other primary enclosures must be protected

from being contaminated with water and other wastes. The facility must provide the dogs with additional dry flooring space
so they can move about their enclosure and to their water and food bowls without becoming wet or soiled.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The outdoor housing facilities for 12 adult dogs have self feeders and plastic dog shelters that need to be cleaned and
sanitized. There are areas on the inside of the plastic dog shelters where a layer of brown organic material is present. In
the back of self feeder where food is stored, there is a layer of brown organic material. The facility representative stated
they were sanitized two weeks ago and needs to be done today. The buildup is thick enough that the inspector used her
fingernail to scrape the material off the inside of the dog shelter. A buildup of organic material within the self-feeders and
shelters could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dog.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The
facility must clean and sanitize the self-feeders and dog shelters and ensure that all aspects of the enclosure are
maintained in a clean and sanitized condition in order to support the health of the dogs.

Veterinary care for dogs.
All 13 adult dogs have not been vaccinated against Parvovirus and Distemper according to the schedule on the facilities’
Program of Veterinary Care. The licensee stated they haven't vaccinated them this year yet. The Program of Veterinary
Care states dogs will be vaccinated annually for Parvovirus and Distemper. 7 adults (Demi, Bambi, Brandi, Bank, Rosie,
Macy Jo, Rover) have record of being vaccinated with a 5-way vaccine on 1-June-2021 and 15-June-2021. 6 adults (Elsa,

Benny, Rory, Bunny, Pepper, Rip) have no record of a 5-way vaccine being given.
Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must follow the schedule for Distemper and Parvovirus vaccines written
in the Program of Veterinary Care to protect the dogs from these contagious and/or deadly diseases. The facility must
vaccinate all dogs in need of the vaccines listed above, keep a written vaccine record and maintain the vaccine schedule
in all dogs from this day forward.
