Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was an excessive amount of live cockroaches in the indoor portion of the M2-A and M2-B compounds housing
rhesus macaques. The walls were lined with a white glossy panel, leaving approximately the top foot of wall connected to
the ceiling exposed. The cockroaches were mainly in clusters of varying sizes in corners and nooks throughout the
exposed section. Numerous cockroaches were also seen walking along the top of the panels. Insect pests can lead to the
spread of disease and can contaminate food as well as water supplies. A safe and effective program for the control of
insects, ectoparasites, avian and mammalian pests must be established and maintained. Correct by September 23, 2022.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “B" license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
