2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 on
07-DEC-16.There was no answer at any doors to the house or the phone number listed. The inspector waited 30
minutes with no contact from the licensee.
Lack of availability prevents inspections from being conducted. The licensee must ensure a responsible,
knowledgeable adult is available to accompany APHIS Inspectors during regular business hours.
Correct from this time forward.
