Facilities, general.
The floor in the loft of the barn is constructed of wire attached to support beams. One section of the floor has separated
from the support beam creating an opening in the floor that a goat leg could slip through. The associated support beam
has significant deterioration and the strength of that beam is compromised.. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound
and be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury. The beam must be replaced. The opening in the floor
must be repaired to restore the strength of the floor and prevent potential collapse and injury to the animals. Correct by
