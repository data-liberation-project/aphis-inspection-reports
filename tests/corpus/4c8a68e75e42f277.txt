3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- A metal pasture gate was broken, and the gate was flat on the ground in a pasture housing three camels. Animals
passing through this broken gate are at an increased risk of injury.
- A shelter accessible by two adult camels has a damaged metal wall. The wall is buckled on the inside, and the
outer metal edges are curling upward. This renders the shelter less effective, and is also a potential source of injury
to the animals.
Facilities must be kept in good repair and maintained properly to protect the health and welfare of the enclosed
animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
