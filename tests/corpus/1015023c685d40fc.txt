Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Two cat transport enclosures, scheduled on LH 431 (AWB 020-90306996), were accepted without securely attached,
easily readable certifications that food and water were offered to the animals 4 hours prior to their delivery. The absence
of these certifications does not assure that the animals will be offered food and water at required frequencies when the
animals are in transport for 12 or more hours. Assure certifications that animals are offered food and water during the 4
hours prior to delivery are securely attached to their enclosures in a manner that makes them easily noticed and read.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Two cat transport enclosures, scheduled on LH 431 (AWB 020-90306996), were accepted without suitable absorbent
material inside. Both cats had only a blanket present on the bottom of their respective enclosures. The absence of
suitable absorbent materials in these enclosures could potentially allow the animals to become soiled in excreta.
Assure all cat transport enclosures contain a suitable absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
Two cat transport enclosures, scheduled on LH 431 (AWB 020-90306996), were accepted without securely attached food
receptacles inside. One enclosure contained an unattached plastic food container while the other enclosure contained an

unattached, bent/damaged aluminum foil baking pan for use as the food receptable. Additionally, both water receptacles
were made of aluminum foil baking pans that were zip tied to the enclosure door. All the receptacles had food or water in
them during the inspection. One dog transport enclosure (AWB 020-90295575) did not have a food receptacle securely
attached to the inside. The animal did have a water bowl securely attached to the door of the enclosure. The foil baking
pans could be damaged during transport and spill their contents into the enclosure. The unattached food receptacles
could shift around the enclosure, inhibiting the ability to fill them without opening the door. Assure appropriate food and
water receptacles are securely attached to the inside of dog and cat enclosures.

The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
