3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
One adult male Wallaby named “Surprise” escaped from its primary enclosure after closing on May 31, 2020. The
morning of June 1, 2020 the Sanctuary manager noticed the gate to the outside area of the enclosure was open and the
wallaby was missing. At about 6:45 am two employees had spotted the wallaby on the northside of the property, near the
wedding venue. Manager went to that location but was unable to locate the animal. The facility has been unable to
recover the animal. Inspector was informed the keeper who closed the evening of 5/31/2020 had not secured the gate
with the padlock to the outside area of the enclosure. Due to a windstorm that evening, and the gate not secured with the
padlock it had opened. The facility has since implemented a new color-code double locking system and conducted re-
training with the keepers. Animals escaping from primary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm from surrounding
predatory animals and further injury when they are not safely contained. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to contain the animals.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Sanctuary Manager.
