Facilities, general.
The refrigerator which contains the serval diet was found in an unsanitary condition. There was debris and grime
observed on the surfaces and shelves and miscellaneous items were found adjacent to the food items. This could lead to
contamination of food and affect the health of the animals. Food storage areas need to be sanitized and cleaned as often
as necessary and all food items needs to be properly stored so to prevent contamination. The facility must address this
issue.
