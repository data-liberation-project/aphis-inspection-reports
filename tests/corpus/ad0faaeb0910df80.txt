INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Six teaching protocols were examined in which the investigators failed to conduct an appropriate literature search
for alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the swine used in
the protocol. Principle investigators must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary
or slight pain or distress in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals. The principle investigator must
provide a written narrative describing the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not
available. The written narrative should include adequate information for the IACUC to assess that a reasonable and
good faith effort was made to determine the availability of alternatives or alternative methods. If a database search
or other source identifies a bona fide alternative method (one that could be used to accomplish the goals of the
animal use proposal), the written narrative should justify why this alternative was not used.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Six swine teaching protocols were reviewed, which do not contain a written assurance from the principal investigator
that the activities involving animals do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments. Assurances that activities
involving animals do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments are required in order to prevent the
unnecessary use of animals. The IACUC must ensure that all principal investigators provide written assurances that
the activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments.
