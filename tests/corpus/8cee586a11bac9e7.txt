(3) Cleaning.
The wire fronts of the cat enclosures have a large amount of hair and some debris over at least 50% of the surface.
The cat litter has spilled over onto the floor in several enclosures. and there are several piles of feces and a urine
puddle outside the litter box. There is a build-up of grime on the floor where the floor and the wall meet. The
surfaces of the resting boards and tubs have a build-up of grime. Clean surfaces are important to maintain healthy
cats. Hard surfaces with which the cats come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance
with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(3) Litter.
****In the adult cat house, the litter boxes were very full of feces and in each of the enclosures there was either
urine or feces on the floor. If the litter boxes are so full that the cats cannot use them, it may cause the cats to
urinate and defecate on the floor and then they may be in contact with it as they move about Some cats may also
refuse to urinate or defecate. This may cause discomfort and possible health problems for the cats. In all primary
enclosures, a receptacle containing sufficient clean litter must be provided to contain excreta and body wastes. The
owner stated that she cleans the boxes every day. For the health and well being of the cats, the litter boxes should
be cleaned more frequently or another box added to allow the cats better access to litter.
