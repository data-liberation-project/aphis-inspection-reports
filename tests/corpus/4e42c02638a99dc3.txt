2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* Two red colored adult female Vizsla's ( microchip numbers 146324528 A and 146223762 A ) and one red colored
adult male Vizsla ( microchip number 010-789-768 ) are thin in appearance. When viewed from the back and side,
the ribs and backbone were visible from a lack of fat cover on all three dogs. At time of inspection, the attending
veterinarian had not been consulted. When the body condition shows a loss in weight to the point that the
backbone or ribs are visible, this is a sign of potential health problems. Poor body conditions could be an indication
the dogs are not receiving adequate nutrition or it could be internal problems. This can affect the ability of the dogs
to gain or maintain an adequate body weight. These dogs must be examined by a licensed vet and appropriate
diagnosis and treatment. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments.
All medical records must be made available to the inspector upon request.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Excessive rust with sharp, jagged edges were observed along the bottom of one sheet of tin that was attached to
the north exterior wall of one enclosure. Multiple holes were observed in the sheet of tin ranging from an estimated
two to six inches in length. Two dogs are in contact with the affected area which is located in outdoor housing.
Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily
cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust affects the structural integrity of all metal surfaces. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces are free of excessive rust and be of good structural strength. Correct by 1/20/16.

injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosure wires are free of jagged edges or sharp points that
might injure the animals. Correct by 1/20/16.
