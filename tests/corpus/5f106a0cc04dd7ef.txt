2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the pig barn, there were at least seven pigs that had patches of hair loss across their shoulders, backs and hip
areas. The facility representative stated that a small round bale of Sudan hay had been brought in ten days ago for
bedding and that was when the hair loss began. According to the attending veterinarian's instructions on the
program of veterinary care, hair loss for pigs is to be treated by replacing the bedding and deworming with
Ivermectin.
The pig barn is divided into sections with a gate between each section. The gate to the section where the Sudan
was placed for bedding purposes was open to where the pigs were still able to come in contact with this hay. The
facility representative stated that a Safe Guard deworming block had been given to the pigs since the hair loss had
been observed. The attending veterinarian was contacted and reiterated the instructions written on the program of
veterinary care. Veterinarian recommended treatments that are not followed can lead to worsening of the illness,
condition or injury of the animal.
***In the sheep and goat barn, there was a cow that was being used to nurse three calves. This cow was thin.
Shoulder, rib and hip bones were protruding. The facility representative stated that a veterinarian had not been
contacted concerning this cow. The attending veterinarian was contacted and instructions for treatment were given
via phone. Thin animals with bone protrusion that is left unattended by veterinary intervention may worsen and lead
to a serious condition in the animal.
The licensee must follow the veterinarian's instruction for treatments and assure that all of the animals receive
adequate veterinary care as required.

***Upon arrival at the facility, two goats were outside of the facility, next to the roadway eating discarded food off of
the ground and out of trash barrels. The facility is located at a dead end street. The main gate into the animal area
was open as the attendants were in the area feeding. Animals that are not contained can become injured or ill if left
unattended. The licensee must take measures to assure that all of the regulated animals stay contained to the
facility grounds at all times. This was corrected during the inspection.
This inspection began at 1122.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
