ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian has written in the Program of Veterinary Care that deworming of all species of animals at
the facility should be done twice per year or as indicated by fecal checks. The last fecal checks done on any
species were done in late October or early November, 2016. All species of animals at the facility are now overdue
for twice yearly deworming or fecal checks as dictated by the attending veterinarian. It is essential that the facility
follow the direction of the attending veterinarian in order to ensure the health of animals at the facility. This is of
special concern this inspection as diarrhea was noted in Syrian Brown bear and grizzly bear enclosures. Also the
Japanese macaque cross monkey at the facility appeared thin with a sparse hair coat and prominent backbone.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male-neutered Japanese macaque at the facility is noticeably thinner than at the time of the last inspection. The
hair coat also appears to be sparse and its backbone is prominent. The attending veterinarian has not examined
this animal or assessed the diet. No weights have ever been obtained on this animal. Weight loss can be due to a
variety of health reasons, including malnutrition, parasitism, and various disease conditions. Examination and
evaluation of this macaque by the attending veterinarian is necessary to ensure that the right diagnostic and
treatment plans are in place to protect against the continuing deterioration of this animals condition leading to pain
and suffering.
A female tiger known as Pandora walks with a slight left rear leg lameness. The CEO of the facility stated that it is
and off and on condition. He also stated that no evaluation of this condition has ever been done by the attending
veterinarian as the cat has been symptom free whenever the veterinarian has been visiting the facility. Examination
and evaluation of this tiger by the attending veterinarian is necessary to ensure that the right diagnostic and
treatment plans are in place to protect against the continuing deterioration of this tiger's condition leading to pain
and suffering.The black bear known as Buffy has a lesion on the left side of her nose. A grayish green discharge is present. This
discharge was first noticed by APHIS inspectors on the inspection of May 16, 2017. At this time the facility CEO
reached through the fence and wiped it away. He stated that it was left over ground bacon which had been fed to
the bears the night before. About two weeks after the May 16 inspection, the attending veterinarian was consulted
for an abscess on the left side of the bears nose. This was in the same location that the CEO had stated was
bacon. The bear was not examined by the attending veterinarian at the time of the consultation. After consultation
with the attending veterinarian, the bear was placed on antibiotics for this condition. Treatment records reviewed
showed that from 5/31/17 to 6/7/17 the bear was on 2500 mg of amoxicillin twice per day. The bear has now been
of the antibiotics for 20 days and the discharge is still present from the same area on the left side of the bear's
muzzle. Examination and evaluation of this bear by the attending veterinarian is necessary to ensure that the right
diagnostic and treatment plans are in place to protect against the continuing deterioration of this animals condition
leading to potential pain and suffering.
All of these animals must be examined by the attending veterinarian by 7-6-17. Records of veterinary
recommendations and treatment records must be available for APHIS inspectors.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee was asked to show APHIS inspectors the record of animals on hand. The licensee was unable to
produce the required records at time of inspection. These records are used to trace and track animals and to
estimate age of the animals for health concerns. Of particular concern on this inspection was a Japanese macaque
cross monkey. This monkey appeared thin with a sparse hair coat and prominent backbone. The CEO of the
facility stated he had no idea of the age of the monkey. APHIS inspectors wanted to see an acquisition record or
information regarding the date of acquisition on the animals on hand record. This information was not able to be
located by the facility CEO.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure containing the crab-eating macaque contains a pool filled with greenish tinged water. Mosquitolarvae can be seen swimming in the water. This pool needs to be cleaned. Clean this pool as often as necessary
to prevent vermin from infesting the pool. Mosquito's can spread several diseases harmful to the animals housed at
this facility.

FEEDING.
A male-neutered Japanese macaque at the facility is noticeably thinner than at the time of the last inspection. The
CEO stated that he is feeding about 12 Mazuri brand monkey biscuits per day along with produce. The produce fed
last night was about two pounds of green beans and carrots according to the CEO. The AV has not assessed this
diet, however, information provided to the facility last fall by APHIS inspectors states that monkeys of this type
should be given 12 to 16 biscuits twice per day along with produce. The only bag of monkey biscuits at the facility
only contained about 20 biscuits, which is used to feed the two NHP housed at the facility. The facility is feeding
this monkey about half of the ration that it requires. This monkey requires more monkey biscuits. Review materials
provided by APHIS inspectors on caloric requirements for this monkey. Begin to document amounts of biscuits and
other items fed to this monkey on a daily basis. Also record the times of feeding and amount of biscuits and
produce left uneaten if applicable. This information is essential for the facility veterinarian in order to determine if
the monkey is receiving adequate amounts of nutritionally adequate food. Keep receipts for all monkey biscuit
purchases. These items should all be available for review by APHIS inspectors.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are tree branches growing into the electric fence for the North American black bear enclosure and the grizzly
bear enclosure. These branches could interfere with the ability of the fence to function properly. Housing facilities
must be maintained in good repair to contain the bears in these enclosures. These bears are dangerous animals
and any escape could have lethal consequences to a facility volunteer, a member of the public or the bears.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The storage can used to hold the mineral supplement fed to the large cats is rusting on its interior. This can can no
longer be cleaned and sanitized. This can must be replaced to ensure that this supplement stays contamination
free.3.129(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
There are two approximately 2 year old Syrian brown bears at the facility. These two bears have rough, dull looking
hair coats, are thin and appear undersized for their age. The CEO described the meal fed to the bears on Monday
night as consisting of: approximately 4 gallons of apples, corn, Brussels sprouts and carrots, ten pounds of bacon
and four gallons of cake trimmings. Based on our discussions with the CEO of the facility, APHIS inspectors think
that a diet poor in nutritional content may be responsible for the appearance of these bears. These bears are still
young and growing. Inadequate diet at this point in their life will lead to lifelong complications. This can result in a
lifetime of unnecessary suffering for these bears. A diet plan must be developed for these bears. It should be
written plan and it must be approved by the attending veterinarian. All items to be fed to the bears must be
specified in the plan. Amounts and combinations of food items must be specified in enough detail so it is possible to
determine if the meal is nutritionally adequate. Frequency of daily feedings and approximate feeding times must be
documented in the feeding plan. Meals should be documented with time of day and all items and amounts fed
noted. This documentation must be available for review by APHIS officials. Special consideration must be given to
calcium level in the diet as these bears are not fully grown and require more calcium in their diet than an adult bear.
Inadequate calcium levels could lead to conditions such as metabolic bone disease which would cause pain and
suffering for these bears.
The CEO of the facility also stated to APHIS inspectors that he has now reconsidered his plan to have a diet
formulated for the bears as it is too expensive relative to a 26% protein dog food he plans to feed to the bears
instead. It has now been 42 days that the CEO has been working on this issue. The CEO states that he made this
decision a couple of days ago. There is still none of this dog food onsite and available to be fed to these bears. No
time frame was given to inspectors for when this will be accomplished.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the Syrian brown bear and North American black bear enclosures need to be
cleaned. These bear food receptacle boxes have walls and sides which are very dirty. Rotting food material is
present in the North American black bear food box. These food receptacles are not sanitary. Any food fed in this
receptacles is going to be contaminated by the rotting material present. These feeders need to be cleaned and
made sanitary to ensure that the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation
which could result in health issues for the bears. Diarrhea was noted inside the enclosure for the Syrian brown
bears.
3.130 REPEATWATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the coyote had a large amount of green algae coating its interior.
The Syrian brown bear water receptacle contained green water. The Asian black bear pen contained a layer of
greenish algae slime and greenish debris. These water receptacles are not being cleaned and sanitized on a
regular basis. Water receptacles should be kept clean and sanitary to promote adequate water consumption which
is essential for animal health. Clean and sanitize water receptacles more frequently.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive food waste in the Syrian brown bear enclosure. There is excessive feces in the Asian black
bear enclosure. Some of this feces has turned white in color indicating that it has been in the enclosure for a long
period of time. There was rotting material present in the Asian black bear den. There was excessive food waste
present in the North American black bear enclosure. There was a piece of rotting hide in the coyote enclosure. The
pools in the North American black bear pen, grizzly bear pen and Asian black bear pen were filled with very bright
green algae tinted water. There was excessive food waste and rotting material present in the cougar den box.
There was excessive feces in the cougar enclosure. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent
basis. This rotting material and feces can lead to pest control issues. The rotting material present in these animal
enclosures can contaminate them as they lie in their enclosures. These animals can ingest this material when they
groom. Not removing old food waste promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material
can lead to potential health problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of food and
fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems for the animals housed in them.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The entire premises is filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash old animal enclosures and fence.
Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and trash. Tall weed were
present in many area of the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and
numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
The cabinet under the butcher counter is rotting away do to a prior water leak. The band saw used for butchering
meat has a coating of blood, hair and grease on it and needs to be cleaned. This cabinet must be repaired or
replaced to allow cleaning and sanitation of this area. The band saw needs to be cleaned to prevent bacterial or
pest infestation of future food items processed using this saw.3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. A rodent hole was located in the tiger known as Lilly's
enclosure. Rodent holes were located around the Syrian brown bear enclosure. Rodent holes were located around
the Asian black bear enclosure. Rodent holes were noted going under the shelter for the cougar enclosure. A
rodent hole was located inside the cougar den area. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to
the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of rodent control must be established for the facility.
3.132 CRITICAL REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that despite the reduction in animal numbers that there is a lack of adequately trained employees. The
persistence of multiple animal welfare act violations related to basic animal husbandry issues illustrates this point.
The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility and animal
conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained
workers need to be added.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility CEO at the conclusion of the facility inspection. All non-compliant
items were discussed. A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility CEO on 6-29-17.
