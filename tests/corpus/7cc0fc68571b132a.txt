2.126(a) CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An inspection of one of the TRA sites for All Things Wild was attempted on Oct 12, 2016 at approximately 11:00 am.
The location was 1781 River Oak, Kaufman, TX. We were met at the facility gate by Marcus Cook. He offered to
allow 2 of the 3 inspector’s entry to the property with his lawyer’s approval. Licensees, or in this case an employee
of a licensee, cannot choose which APHIS officials they allow to inspect nor can they delay an inspection if a
competent adult is available to do that inspection. Mr. Cook's statement was considered a refusal to allow APHIS
officials to do an inspection.
During business hours licensees must allow APHIS officials to enter its pace of business, examine records required
to be kept by the Act and the regulations, to inspect and photograph the facilities, property and animals as the
APHIS officials consider necessary.
