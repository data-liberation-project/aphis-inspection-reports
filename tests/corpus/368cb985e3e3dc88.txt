ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:07 AM on
01-Mar-17.
Knocked on the door and received no answer. Left a business card on the door. Called the licensee and left a
message. While I was still in the driveway the licensee returned my call. The licensee has a new job and was at
work. The licensee gave me her new days of availability.
