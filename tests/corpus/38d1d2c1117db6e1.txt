FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The rabbit enclosure fence was constructed of two types of wire, neither of which was structurally sound. The
rabbits could become entangled in the jumbled fence or could become injured from a sharp broken wire. The fence
needs to be repaired or replaced and maintained in good repair in order to protect the rabbits from injury and
escape.

WATERING.
The rabbit water bottles had a very large amount of algae growth. Water receptacles should be cleaned as often as
necessary to be free from dirt and debris. These bottles need to be cleaned or replaced and sanitized on a routine
basis.
To be corrected immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain link fence dividing the pig and sheep yard from the yard to their left is not structurally sound. The chain
link is very loose and curling slightly at the bottom. This could allow one of the animals to get a foot stuck in thefence or allow the pigs to escape into the adjoining pen. The chain link needs to be removed or repaired and
maintained in good repair.
