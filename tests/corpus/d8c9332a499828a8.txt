2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
DIRECT: There were multiple dogs with very bad teeth that need to be seen and treated by a veterinarian. There
was a male Yorkie (#315) blk/bro that was drooling excessively on the left side of his mouth that had molars that
were encased in hard brown material. Inside the mouth the gums were red and swollen with what appeared to be
pus-like material around the remaining teeth in the back, and a very foul odor coming from the mouth. In addition, 6
other dogs of the 12 examined were in serious need of dental care; a Red Poodle F (#289), M (#267), Blk/wht
Poodle F (#273), wht/bro Poodle M (#269), Yorkie bro/blk M (#344) and white Poodle F (#330). All 6 reported dogs
have varying numbers of molars encased in a hard brown material with very red and inflamed gums with pus-like
material between the gum line and teeth. The male Poodle (#269) had both sides with all of the back teeth encased
in a solid row of a hard brown material making it impossible to discern individual teeth.
All of these dogs' had been recently purchased within the past 1.5 months by this licensee, and the veterinarian has
not been contacted to begin a dental program or begin treating the dogs' with bad teeth.
It is imperative that there is communication with the attending veterinarian to treat and maintain healthy teeth and
mouths of the regulated animals'. Bad teeth and gums can cause pain and discomfort to the animals as well as lead
to other health issues if left untreated.
INDIRECT: There were 5 dogs' that had numerous matts on their faces covering their eyes and some with matts on
their faces and legs. A red Poodle M (#267) had face and body matts, Shih tzu, wht/blk ears F (#288) had multiple
matts covering her eyes, Poodle bro/wht M (#269) with facial and body matts, white Poodle F (#330) with matts
covering the eyes, and a black Poodle M (#232) with matts covering his eyes.
Matted hair needs to be removed in order to prevent any pain or discomfort from the matted hair pulling at the
animals' skin. The matted hair covering the eyes can cause eye irritation issues and hide infections that can occur
which can cause a serious health issue if left un-noticed and untreated. The eyes being covered by long hair and
matts can also prevent the animal from being able to see properly and cause stress and/or discomfort.
The licensee must consult the veterinarian to diagnose and treat regulated animals with teeth issues. Once the dogsare identified that need dental care, the licensee must show an effort to get the animals treated in a timely manner
and continue working on getting the animals with bad teeth treated as needed.
All hair coats should be trimmed and maintained in order to prevent matt development. All matts should be removed
to prevent any pain or discomfort to the animal from hair pulling on the skin, and to prevent any sores or infections
that can occur to the eyes or body when covered by matted hair. The matted covered eyes should be trimmed to
allow the animal to see properly.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There were two 5 month old Miniature Pinchers, blk/bro (#228 and #229) that did not have any identification as
described in section 2.51 affixed to the animals. The dogs are over 16 weeks of age and do not have proper
identification at this time.
It is important that all regulated animals' are provided with proper identification for accurate record keeping and
traceability of the animals.
The licensee must properly identify the regulated animals at the facility when they are over 16 weeks of age
according to sec. 2.51 of the regulations.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There was no alternative light source in the three buildings that housed the regulated animals. The inspection inside
the buildings required a flash light and head lamp in order to check the condition of the animals' and the cleanliness
of the facility. There was not enough light to properly see the regulated animals to check their conditions or to see
the facility in any detail.
A proper light source must be provided inside kennel facilities in order to monitor the regulated animals, properly
clean the facility and complete a routine inspection. Limited light sources from a flash light or headlamp can hide
unclean surfaces and health issues of the animals which can cause serious problems for the facility with unseenmaintenance problems or animals that are left with health issues unidentified and untreated due to not being seen.
The kennels must be provided with a light source that is uniformly diffused throughout the facility and provide
sufficient illumination to aid in maintaining good housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, adequate inspection of
animals', and for the well being of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently the facility, food and water containers are only being sanitized once every 1.5 months, not according to
AWA regulations and standards.
It is important that all surfaces in the primary enclosures including food and water containers are properly sanitized
in order to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards that can live in
the grime left behind without proper sanitization.
The licensee must properly sanitize primary enclosures, food and water receptacles at least once every 2 weeks
using one of the methods prescribed in 3.11(b)(3) of the regulations, and more often if necessary to prevent buildup
of dirt and grime and to prevent disease hazards.
