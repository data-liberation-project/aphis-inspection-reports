A female black and white Japanese Chin, "Natalie" (ID# 026127353) has a left eye that has an abonormal
appearance. The eye is enlarged and has a conical shape to it. The center of the eye is cloudy and discolored. The
eye did not appear to have any discharge. The abnormal appearance could be an indication of injury, infection or
other medical issues. Enlarged eyes can be painful and cause discomfort to the animal.
A tan colored female Pekingese, "Dena" (ID# 042278812) has a wound under her chin that is about the size of a
quarter. The wound is red in color and has some areas that are scabbed over. The licensee stated that he noticed
the wound the day before but the dog had not been seen by a veterinarian. Wounds can be painful and may be an
indication of other health problems.
These two dogs need to be seen by a veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of
diagnosis and treatment must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis, and treatments and available for
inspection.
