2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. The information for ectoparasites and internal parasites is
missing information. In addition, the Attending Veterinarian has not visited the licensee's premise since 2015. An
incomplete Program of Veterinary Care and the Attending Veterinarian not conducting regularly scheduled visits
doesn't ensure that the animals are receiving optimal care. The Program of Veterinary Care must be filled out
completely and the Attending Veterinarian must visit the site and inspect all regulated animals and facilities. Correct
by 6/25/17.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence line surrounding two enclosures containing a total of six goats was mangled in areas with sharp points
sticking inwards towards the goats. Sharp points can cause injury to the goats that come into contact with it. The
fence line must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury.

WATERING.
Watering receptacles for six of the goats and one pig was yellowish in color. The licensee informed me he has not
changed out the water in two days. Unsanitary water can lead to the spread of disease. The watering receptacles
needs to be changed out on a more regular basis prior to the water changing to a yellowish color. Correct
immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
