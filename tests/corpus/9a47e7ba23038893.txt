Primary enclosures.
The second enclosure from the bottom on the 5th rack on the left side of the building has a hole approximately 2 inches
wide by 5 inches in length on the side wall. There is protruding wire with sharp points where the wire is broken. This
enclosure is housing 11 adult guinea pigs and their offspring. Holes and protruding wire with sharp points can cause
injury to the guinea pigs.

appropriately cleaned and sanitized, and may injure guinea pig attempting to feed. Food receptacles must be kept clean
and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. The above self-feeders must be repaired or replaced.

Sanitation.

Housekeeping. Sulfametholzole tablets and two containers of lime sulfur dip were on top of the rack of brown enclosures.
Invermectin, sevin dust, insect dust and clorox were housed on a shelf on the right side of the building above the white
plastic enclosures. Housing chemicals and veterinary products on top or above animal enclosures could result in harm to
the guinea pigs if spillage of the products occurred. Premises housing guinea pigs must be kept clean and in good repair
to protect the animals from injury. The above veterinary products and chemicals must be stored away from animal
enclosures in a safe manner to prevent injury or harm to the guinea pigs. Correct by October 17, 2020.
