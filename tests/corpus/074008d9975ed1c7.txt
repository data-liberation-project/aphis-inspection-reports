3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
While inspecting animals inside the barn, one rabbit was seen outside its primary enclosure. When asked about the loose
rabbit, the caretaker said that he had escaped from his enclosure a few days ago and had not yet been caught. The rabbit
has access to food and water; however, the space inside the barn is not suitable as a primary enclosure.
Failure to provide a primary enclosure that adequately contains animals can result in the animal having access to items or
chemicals that could cause injury or illness. It could also result in the facility being unable to recover an animal from the
outdoors. All primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from
injury, to contain them, and to keep predators out. The escaped rabbit must be caught and placed in a suitable primary
enclosure.

Watering.
In an enclosure for two yak, the only water receptacle available contains dark green water and has fish swimming in it.
The sides and bottom of the receptacle cannot be seen through the discolored water.
Failure to maintain a clean water receptacle can lead to water that becomes contaminated and an animal that is reluctant


to drink as often as it normally would. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
