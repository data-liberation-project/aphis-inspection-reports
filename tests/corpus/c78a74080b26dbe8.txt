INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol involving cranial implants in non-human primates does not contain a description of routine care and
maintenance of the implants. In November 2015, a monkey was diagnosed with a deep infection under a cranial
implant. The infection possibly could have been prevented had the animal's implant been maintained under the
direction of an IACUC approved plan for the routine care and maintenance of cranial implants. The IACUC must
ensure that all proposals to conduct activity involving animals contain a complete description of the use of the
animals.
