2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has acquired a bison and has not contacted the attending veterinarian (AV) prior to its acquisition. A call to
the veterinarian confirmed that the licensee had not consulted the AV about acquiring a bison. It is important to
communicate with the AV prior to acquiring new species and give the AV the authority to determine if appropriate
provisions are in place and available for the new species acquired. The facility must contact the attending veterinarian
and ensure that the bison is part of the written program of veterinary care and that the attending veterinarian has been
given the appropriate authority to ensure adequate veterinary care of the bison's care. Correct by 6/1/2022

The licensee said a whitetail fawn that was born last night will be bottle-fed store-bought whole milk, the same way that
lambs are fed at the facility. The attending veterinarian expressed that a more appropriate milk replacer needs to be fed
to the fawn. Feeding an inappropriate milk diet to the fawn can cause health problems. Ensure that the attending
veterinarian is contacted and given the appropriate authority to guide what diet is fed to the young ruminants (lambs and
deer fawn). Correct by 5/18/2022
2.75(a)(2)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.

One sheep dog has not been added to APHIS Form 7005. Not updating the dog's information on APHIS Form 7005
doesn't allow for proper tracking of the animals by APHIS officials. APHIS Form 7005 must be updated to include all
regulated dogs on site. Correct by 5/24/22.
2.75(b)(1)(i)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The acquisition information was missing for 10 of the sheep (lambs). Not recording the acquisition information for all
animals doesn't allow for proper tracking of the animals by APHIS officials. The acquisition information must be recorded
for all regulated animals on site. Correct by 5/24/22.
2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
When asked the licensee stated a video was made at the facility of one of the hybrid dogs pulling the sheep dog by the
leash. Allowing dogs to pull another dog on a leash could cause behavioral stress to the dog on the leash. The licensee
must immediately discontinue the practice of allowing any of the dogs to pull any of the dogs while leashed and ensure
handling of dogs doesn't cause behavioral stress. Correct from this day forward.
2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
Public contact without distance or barriers in place is allowed with an approximately 1y old female bison (estimated to
weigh over 500 lbs). In an area where visitors sit, it can eat feed from containers on peoples' laps and the licensee said
sometimes people go out in its pen with it if it has a halter and lead rope on it. It is a few inches short of being chest high
to inspectors at its tallest point (withers). As a large wild animal species, there must be sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the bison and general viewing public to protect the public and bison. Lack of distance and/or barriers could allow

an accident to take place before the licensee could gain control of it. Ensure that the bison does not have public contact
without adequate barriers or distance in place to protect the public. Correct from this day forward.
3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
The dog enclosure had a couple of spots of wire panels on the ground to keep dogs from digging that have areas sticking
up into the enclosure. This allowed some pointed ends to stick into the enclosure which created a potential hazard for the
dogs. The ends of the wire panels could potentially injure the dogs if they stepped on it or rubbed up against it. The ends
of the wire panels needs to be either replaced or repaired so they are no longer sticking up into the enclosure. Correct by
5/24/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
