ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:00 p.m. on
10-Jan-18.
After arriving at the property, the inspector knocked on the front door of the residence. The inspector then called the
licensee. The licensee stated he was not in the area but would try to contact someone who could be present for an
inspection. The inspector waited at the property for 30 minutes and left after the licensee stated he was unable to
make contact with an authorized person.
