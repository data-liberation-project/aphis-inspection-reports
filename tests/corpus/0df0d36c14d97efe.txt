HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Rooms 11, 13 and 14 in Building 1 were in use for animal housing during this inspection. The concrete floors in
these rooms have been covered/sealed with several layers of acrylic paint. In multiple areas in all three rooms bare
concrete was exposed in places where the paint had peeled away. Water was pooling in the damaged areas and
collecting in between separating layers of paint.
Standing or pooling water can serve as reservoirs for microbial growth, contribute to excessive humidity levels and
inhibit the benefits of cleaning and husbandry procedures. Facility personnel stated that the floors had been
repaired approximately one month ago. Alternative repair solutions may need to be reviewed.
* Large gaps were noted at the horizontal junction of the walls and floor in the lab in Building 1. The gaps were
visible in multiple places especially near the front of the room. A vertical wall seam near the front of the room was
also noted to be separating.
* The metal unistrut tracking used to support suspension of primary enclosures in Room C11 in Building 2 was
noted to have areas of excessive rust. The rusted metal was flaking and deteriorating when touched. Rusted, flaking
metal may compromise structural integrity and eventually jeopardize proper suspension of the enclosures and result
in injury to the animals.
All animal housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to prevent injury to the animals and
facilitate required husbandry procedures. The above identified non-compliances should be repaired or replaced.
