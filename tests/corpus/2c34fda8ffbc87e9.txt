FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A new location housing 5 reindeer did not have a perimeter fence that completely encloses the outdoor primary
enclosure on the east side. There are fence posts in place but the licensee had not completed the fencing on this
side at the time of this inspection.
The other location for this licensee has 2 young camels which were used in Christmas exhibitions last December
adjacent to 6 adult camels that are used in an agricultural only operation. The 2 juvenile camels do not have a
perimeter fence that surrounds their outdoor primary enclosure.
Camels and reindeer housed outdoors are required to have a perimeter fence that is at least 3 feet from the primary
enclosure and at least 6 feet in height to adequately protect them from unwanted persons or animals contacting
them and to act as a secondary containment should the camels or reindeer escape from the primary enclosure.
To be corrected by 8/11/2014.
NOTE: The licensee intends to request a variance from the AC Western Office to this standard for the camel
housing.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
