MISCELLANEOUS.
A facility representative was not available to allow access at 1100 on 03/16/2016. The inspector knocked at offices
for Veterinary Program Staff and the Lab/Lecture room. A call was made to the number on file and a message left
for the POC. The inspector then waited outside the staff offices for half an hour. If there are additional methods of
contact please convey them to the inspector at the number provided in the phone message.
