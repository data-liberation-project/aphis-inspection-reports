Sec. 2.40 Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
(b) Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include:
(2) The use of appropriate methods.
***In the outdoor facility there was an adult female West Highland Terrier unidentified (no microchip could be found),
that was observed repeatedly shaking her head and excessively scratching her ears and eyes. There was hairloss
above and below the corner of the right eye that extended toward the right ear approximately an inch. The skin was
reddened and moist and had an area that appeared to be forming a scab. There was a reddened, raised area below
the corner of the right eye. The left ear flap was dry and scaly with at least one scab-like lesion. The inner ear
appears to have ridges of thickened tissue with a build up of darkened substance. The facility representative stated
that the dog had been given two doses of ear mite medicine and the last dose was about a week ago. There was
also an adult female Maltipoo identified as #0A02142477 that had hairloss that extended from the base of the tail,
up toward the spine, across the right hip area, down to the back of the right leg and back up to the right side of the
anal area. The exposed skin had several small red raised areas and several small closed wounds. There was an
area close to the center that that had thickened ridges of tissue, was darkened, dry and appeared to be forming a
scab. The entire surface was rough, reddened and some areas of moisture. The facility representative stated that
this situation was found last night (8/3/14). Hair loss, repeated shaking of the head and excessive scratching are
abnormal signs and symptoms that could indicate a serious medical condition. The licensee must have these animal
evaluated for appropriate diagnosis and a treatment plan. The treatment plan must be followed.
***In the outdoor facility there were two enclosures, one housing an adult female German Shepherd unidentified (no
microchip found) and a young female German Shepherd (approximately 7 months old) unidentified (no ID had been
given to this animal). The second enclosure housed an adult male German Shepherd identified as #4B6440066A.
The ribs and hip bones of each of these animals could be seen. The flank areas were sunken in so that the
lengthwise appearance showed spine protrusion at the top of the flank area. The adult male had an abnormal gait
with his back legs slightly tucked under at the flank area. The facility representative stated that the animals have
been dewormed on a regular basis and are fed daily. There was also an adult male Maltese identified as
0A02142534 that had an area approximately 3 cm in diameter of hairloss underneath his tail. There was a smallscabbed area on the exposed skin and small patches of hair had begun to grow back in. This dog also had an area
of hairloss behind his left ear approximately 3 cm long by 2 cm wide. There was a small scabbed area on the
exposed skin and hair had begun to grow back in over half of the area. These areas were dry. The facility
representative stated that this animal presented with hairloss and began to heal in two days without treatment.
Signs of bone protrusion and abnormal gaits left unattended by veterinary intervention may worsen and lead to a
serious condition in the animal. Hair loss is an abnormal condition that could indicate a serious medical situation.
The licensee understands that the West Highland Terrier and the Maltipoo must be seen by a licensed veterinarian
by August 7, 2014. The licensee also understand that a licensed veterinarian must be consulted concerning the
three German Shepherds and the Maltese by August 7, 2014. The licensee must assure that all regulated animals
are provided adequate veterinary care as required.
2.50(a)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Sec. 2.50 Time and method of identification.
(a) A class ``A'' dealer (breeder) shall identify all live dogs and cats on the premises.
***Only three out of six dogs that presented with veterinary care issues had microchips that could be found. Two
dogs could not be matched up to the paperwork because no microchip could be found. While checking the
paperwork, the facility representative was not sure which number went with each dog. The seven month old
German Shepherd did not have any form of identification. Unidentified animals cannot be traced back or forward.
Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
record keeping requirements. The licensee must adequately identify all live regulated animals and assure that
records are kept as required.
To be corrected by September 4, 2014.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Sec. 2.75 Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
(a)(1) Each dealer, other than operators of auction sales and brokers to whom animals are consigned, and each
exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records.
******There were at least twenty dogs listed on the APHIS 7005 forms that did not include identification numbersand at least ten that did not have the acquisition information. Appropriate identification and acquisition
documentation of animals is essential for proper identification of each animal and each animal must be able to be
traced forward and backward. The licensee must complete the information required on the APHIS form 7005 and
assure all records are maintained as required.
To be corrected by September 4, 2014.
