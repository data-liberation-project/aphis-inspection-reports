ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****** A current written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is not available for review, although the attending
veterinarian has conducted a site visit. The PVC ensures that a standard system of veterinary care is in place and
acts as the facility guide for the husbandry and care of the animals. The program should be developed and/or
reviewed, signed, and dated at least once a year by the veterinarian and facility representative. A written PVC must
be developed by the attending veterinarian and reflect the current care the animals receive to ensure the overall
health and well-being of the animals. Correct by August 30, 2014

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***Several species of animals have been acquired or born in the past year - artic fox, pigs, kulan, zebras, lemurs,
goats, sheeps, and alpacas. The licensee was unable to provide documentation of animals on hand, and adequate
records of animal births, and deaths; and animals purchased, donated, or sold. Records of acquisitions,
dispositions, and animals on hand must be kept and maintained. These records must also be available for review at
the time of inspection by a USDA inspector to assist with the enforcement of the regulations and standards of the
Animal Welfare Act and to ensure the well-being of all animals at the facility. Correct by August 30, 2014

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***Kulan, bison, and zebra enclosures: The barrier fence is constructed with a single rope connected to multiple
poles in front of the primary enclosure. The bison enclosure does not have a barrier fence. The barrier fences are
inadequate to prevent the public from coming into direct contact with the animals. During public exhibition, animals
must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public. The barrier fences must be
constructed in a manner that would ensure the safety of the public and prevent harm to the animals contained within
the enclosure. Correct by August 22, 2014
3.81(c)(4)ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The spider monkey is single-housed in an adequately enriched environment. He is unable to see other
non-human primates but is in close enough proximity to hear lemurs. An environmental enrichment plan should
address the needs of individual non-primates housed alone that do not have visual and auditory cues from other
non-human primates. Special consideration must be given to non-human primates that are singly housed. A plan to
ensure the psychological health of the spider monkey must be developed with the attending veterinarian,
implemented accordingly; and included in the written environmental enrichment plan. Correct by August 30, 2014

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The lemurs and cotton-top tamin are in appropriate social groupings and have an adequately enriched
environments.
***The spider monkey is single-housed in an adequately enriched environment.
However, there is no current written environmental enrichment plan available nor is there documentation of
enrichment provided.The environmental enrichment plan must be developed, and reviewed by the attending
veterinarian to ensure the non-human primates have their psychological needs appropriated addressed. A written
environmental enrichment plan must be developed with the attending veterinarian and implemented accordingly for
the psychological health of the animals. Additonally, the environmental enrichment plan must be available for review
by an APHIS inspector to ensure compliance with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by August 30,

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved.
*******Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or electric wire. The
enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel poles, 4 inches in
diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest upon, is located
approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep roots - no lower
branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is approximately 4 feet
from the enclosure fence. The enclosure currently houses a ~2 year old male lion. Primary enclosures must be
constructed in a manner that will ensure containment of the animal. Based upon known physical and behavioral
characteristics of exotic cats, additional containment measures must be made to the lion enclosure to prevent
escape. 3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The goat/alpaca/donkey enclosure has ~10 animals. There is one 8x8 shelter.
***The sheep/goat enclosure has ~25 animals. There is 8x8 shelter with a 3 feet overhang.
The shelter in each of the enclosures is inadequate to provide shelter from rain, snow, and wind for all the animals
at one time. Shelter must be provided to all animals as protection from inclement weather to afford them protection
and to prevent discomfort. Additional shelter must be added to the enclosures to provide enough shelter for all
animals in the enclosure at one time during periods of inclement weather. Correct by August 22, 2014
