3.127(d) Critical Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
At the time of inspection it was discovered that the facility has experienced additional animal deaths in 2020 attributable to
predation. In the “Hill” enclosure, which encompasses approximately 40 acres of terrain and is encircled by an eight foot
tall perimeter fence as well as an eight foot tall enclosure fence, three adult Grant’s gazelles were found dead from
predation, one on each of the following dates: November 10th, 15th, and 26th. This brings the total of probable predation
deaths for Grant’s gazelles to eight for 2020, with only three animals remaining at the time of inspection. The facility
attributes these most recent deaths to coyotes, whereas earlier in the year there was evidence of mountain lion predation.
Although the facility has installed two sonar deterrent devices, and three motion activated light deterrent devices along the
fencing for the “Hill” enclosure, as well as three game cameras and one trap, the current efforts have not prevented these
additional deaths.

The California Fish and Wildlife warden, to whom the facility referred me, stated that coyotes must get under or through
the fence in order to prey upon the animals inside, and that the facility should regularly walk the fence to ensure its
integrity. The facility has been encouraged by Animal Care to work with state, county, and federal wildlife control officials
to further explore methods to prevent predation. The current devices deployed seem inadequate considering the size of


the perimeter, and the on-going occurrence of predation incidents.

Failure to exclude predators puts the animals at risk. The facility should continue to pursue methods to exclude and deter
predators in order to protect the animals within.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
