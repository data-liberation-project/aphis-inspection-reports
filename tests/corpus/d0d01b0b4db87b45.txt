The rabbits are being housed with the guinea pigs, although the Business Manager stated that it was a temporary

required for scientific reasons.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a portion of 1/2 inch wire mesh on the door to the kangaroo enclosure with sharp points of wire protruding.
The sharp points pose a risk of injury to the kangaroo and must be removed.
The wire mesh fencing making up the enclosure for the goats, sheep and pigs is in disrepair. The inspector
witnessed a small goat stuck between the chicken wire and outer wire mesh, it's head was caught in one of the
openings and had to have assistance extricating it's head. There was no outward indication that it was injured. It
appears to have entered between the 2 fences because the chicken wire mesh was rusted and broken with a large
hole where it was bent and pulled away from the supports. The mesh fencing also has sharp ends of wires exposed.
The fencing is not structurally sound and may not be secure enough to contain the animals housed there. There
are several broken or loose boards on the outer pasture fence containing the cow, goat and llama. The materials
used for the enclosures must be of the appropriate material and strong enough for the types of animals housed
there. The damaged fence poses a hazard to the health, safety and well-being of the animals and must be replaced
and or repaired.
