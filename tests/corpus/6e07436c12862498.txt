3.101(a)(1)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large chunk of the concrete floor, near the drain of the main pool adjacent to the lower viewing window, is missing
thus leaving the bottom of the pool in disrepair.
Damaged concrete leaves the pool structurally unsound for the sea lions housed therein.
Housing facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair for the health and
well-being of the animals.
3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Rusty drain covers are present on the "beach" side of the main pool. Rusted materials cannot be sanitized and
pose a potential hazard to the sea lions housed therein.
All surfaces in a primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning, and
disinfection as appropriate. All facilities must implement a written protocol on cleaning so surfaces do not constitute
a health hazard to animals.
3.106(d)
WATER QUALITY.
During this inspection the main pool for the two sea lions appeared to be extremely cloudy and green. Other animalpools throughout the zoo are clear. The facility utilizes a sand filtration system as well as ozone to maintain water
quality and clarity for the sea lions. Due to the cloudy, green water of the main pool, it is apparent that the filtration
system is not effectively maintaining clear water. An adequate filtration system must be provided that can
effectively clear the pool from materials that are causing the water to be cloudy and green. Good water quality is
necessary for the health and well-being of the sea lions housed therein.
ALL OF THE ABOVE ITEMS ARE TO BE CORRECTED BY: MAY 5, 2018
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representatives.
