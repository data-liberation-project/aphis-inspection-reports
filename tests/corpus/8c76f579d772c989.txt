2.31(d)(4)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On August 24, 2020, laboratory investigators performed two procedures, chest drain placement and metal plate removal
that were not approved in writing by the IACUC. The Principal Investigator submitted an amendment to the IACUC to add
these procedures to the IACUC approved protocol. The Principal Investigator had not received approval in writing from
the IACUC prior to performing the procedures. The amendment was approved for the two procedures by the IACUC on
August 25, 2020.

Under the same protocol, two laboratory personnel participated in animal procedures that were not approved to do so by
the IACUC. They were approved by the IACUC to perform animal procedures under different protocols managed by the
laboratory. The Principal Investigator submitted an amendment to add the two laboratory personnel on October 4, 2020.
The IACUC approved the amendment on October 5, 2020.
The IACUC shall notify principal investigators and the research facility in writing of its decision to approve or withhold
approval of activities related to the care and use of animals.



This was corrected by the facility through a corrective action plan and the approval amendments to the protocol by the
IACUC.
3.83 Critical

Watering.
On December 30, 2019 a macaque was found by an animal caretaker recumbent on the floor of its enclosure. The animal
caretaker immediately notified the veterinary care staff, who evaluated the macaque and determined it was dehydrated
and started treatment. The macaque died while under veterinary care on January 1, 2020. This incident was not reported
to the IACUC until September 18, 2020 through anonymous reporting system. The IACUC conducted an investigation
and determined that the animal caretaker did not check the lixit for at least two daysThe results of the IACUC investigation
revealed that the lixit was malfunctioning and the animal did not have water available for two days. The facility must
ensure that potable water is provided in sufficient quantity to every non-human primate housed for their health and well-
being.

This was corrected by the facility by retraining all animal care staff, re-assignment of animal care responsibilities,
inspection of the watering systems, and adding water bottles on cages.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conduct on 08/04/2021 to 08/05/2021.
