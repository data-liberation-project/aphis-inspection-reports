Sanitation.
The watering area in about 10 enclosures had an excessive amount of wet soiled material on the area that the guinea
pigs have to stand to get a drink. Excessive wet soiled material can cause animal discomfort and cause health problems


for the guinea pigs. Ensure areas around under the watering valve is routinely cleaned on enclosures so that guinea pigs
don't have to stand in wet material to get a drink.
