Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, the program of veterinary care provided by the facility stated that regularly scheduled visits by
the attending veterinarian (AV) will occur weekly or more as needed. The current AV stated that she conducts site visits
approximately once a month if her schedule allows. In fact, the documentation tracking the veterinarian’s visits indicated
that the time between visits for 2022 has spanned between 10 and 21 days. The frequency of visits documented in the
written Program of Veterinary Care represents the formal agreement between the licensee and the AV as to what is
necessary to maintain adequate animal welfare. It is the licensee’s responsibility to make sure regularly scheduled visits
as prescribed in the Program of Veterinary Care are occurring. Failure to do so can compromise the AV’s ability to provide
adequate care to animals exhibited by the facility. The facility, in accord with the AV, must establish and adhere to a
frequency of site visits.

2.40(a)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In many aspects, the attending veterinarian (AV) has not been given appropriate authority to ensure provision of adequate
veterinary care. Both the former and current attending veterinarians stated to USDA inspectors that they did not have the


final say over animal care decisions. They explained their role as to provide recommendations which the facility could
choose to uphold or disregard. Events demonstrating this are listed as follows:
• The attending veterinarian recommended all female animals be spayed to prevent future complications such as
pyometras. This proposal was not consistently upheld as Runty, an 11yr old female tiger, remained intact and died of a
pyometra the evening of April 19th, 2022.
• Ms. Shalope, an estimated 16yr old intact female bobcat, was sedated on October 3rd, 2021, and diagnosed with a
severe pathologic fracture of the right ulna due to suspected neoplastic processes. The attending veterinarian strongly
recommended immediate euthanasia while under sedation. The facility refused and requested the animal be reversed
from sedation. The following day, acknowledging the severe deterioration of the animal’s condition, the facility allowed
euthanasia.
• Reynard, an estimated 10yr old intact male canine/fox hybrid, was evaluated on July 18th, 2021, by the attending
veterinarian. After taking into consideration his chronic kidney disease, liver disease, neoplasia, lethargy, lack of urine
output and overall decline in health, she recommended humane euthanasia. The facility disagreed with the veterinarian’s
recommendation and did not authorize Reynard’s euthanasia. Reynard’s health continued to decline for 10 more days,
and he was subsequently found deceased in his cage on July 28th, 2021.
• Dolly, a 5yr old intact female mountain lion, sustained an injury to her right eye due to a snake bite on July 30th, 2020.
Since the condition of the eye was not improving with treatment, the attending veterinarian suggested enucleation might
be necessary. The facility opted to consult an ophthalmologist. The findings of this consultation were not communicated
with the attending veterinarian, and she was not given the authority to decide if enucleation was the best course. Dolly’s
eye condition worsened per the attending veterinarian, at times protruding and exuding purulent discharge until the facility
allowed enucleation about 1.5 years later in February 2022.


• The current attending veterinarian started as the official veterinarian on record 3 months ago in January of 2022. She
had been this facility’s veterinarian in the past but took a leave of absence for 2 years during which time another attending
veterinarian was contracted. During that 2-year period, the previous veterinarian diagnosed several animals with chronic
conditions and instituted new treatment plans. The current veterinarian was not asked to review all the ongoing treatments
that were instituted by the previous veterinarian. The current AV has stated she has not reviewed the fluid treatment plan
that is currently ongoing for several foxes. Since the treatments continue to be given as previously prescribed, without
approval or oversight from the current AV, authority has not been transferred. More specifically, the current AV is not
afforded the opportunity to establish that the treatments continue to be adequate. Additionally, some of the information
regarding diagnoses established by the previous AV have not been transferred to the current AV. Without that, the
current AV cannot make an educated decision about the best way to proceed for these animals.
When the Attending Veterinarian is not given the appropriate authority, the provision of veterinary care may be inadequate
or inappropriate. Refusing to proceed with treatments or procedures recommended by the AV can lead to unnecessary
pain, discomfort, and suffering. The licensee must assure that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility did not timely communicate information to their attending veterinarian regarding the medical care for two
animals, Colby and Runty.
o Runty, an 11yr old intact female tiger, was identified by facility staff on July 26th, 2021, as being lethargic, having
excessive vaginal bleeding, and being anorexic. Per the medical records, she remained in poor health for a period of 6
days. Facility staff stated that Runty’s sickness was tied to her heat cycle. The attending veterinarian was not consulted;


rather, the facility’s medical director attempted to provide Runty treatment prescribed by a consulting veterinarian but was
unable to complete the entire course of medication. Eventually, Runty improved but her condition from July 26th through
August 1st was not communicated with the Attending Veterinarian and a consultation never took place. A year later, the
evening of April 19th, 2022, Runty died and a necropsy conducted by the attending veterinarian noted the cause of death
as pyometra.
o Colby, an 11yr old intact male tiger, sustained a deep wound on his tail base on August 3rd, 2021. The facility’s medical
director worked with facility staff to sedate Colby and repair the wound without the attending veterinarian’s knowledge.
After the procedure had been completed, the attending veterinarian was notified, but was not given the opportunity to
assign and approve the treatment plan. The sutures subsequently dehisced two days later.
Failure to promptly communicate findings with the attending veterinarian delays proper treatment and may cause undue
pain and distress in animals with such conditions. The facility must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian in order to timely convey accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being. This communication is essential for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention.

3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
The facility has had two animals injured from interactions with wild snakes. Dolly, a 5yr old intact female mountain lion,
sustained an injury to her right eye due to a snake bite on July 30th, 2020. After almost 1.5 years of worsening conditions
and continued treatments, Dolly had the eye enucleated in February 2022. On June 12th, 2021, Rascal, a 6yr old intact
male bobcat, sustained a bite from a water moccasin on his right from paw. At the time, he was seen slightly limping on
his swollen paw and required a course of antibiotics to resolve the issue. Furthermore, on the day of inspection, USDA
inspectors observed a facility staff member attempt to remove a snake from an inground pool in an enclosure housing a


female tiger. Failure to maintain the enclosures free of snakes has allowed for snake bites and resulted in animals
experiencing significant pain and distress. The facility must establish an effective plan to mitigate entry of wild snakes into
the exhibited animals’ enclosures. The outdoor housing facilities must protect the animals from injury.

3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
The labels for the MSM and glucosamine supplements both indicated the products needed to be stored in a cool, dry
place. The MSM label further indicated that the product should not be stored at temperatures above 86 degrees
Fahrenheit. The liquid fish oil dispenser did not have a label, but common guidelines also require storage in a cool, dry
place. The supplements fed daily to the animals, are not being stored appropriately since they are maintained year-round
in an open shaded structure subject to outdoor weather conditions. The structure cannot provide a dry place on rainy days
as evidenced by the wet floor and puddles of water leftover from a rainstorm that passed during the previous night. The
storage structure does not have temperature control measures and therefore cannot provide for a cool place on the many
hot days in Florida when the temperature rises to or above 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, the fish oil dispenser was
dirty, largely covered in brown-yellow sticky material, mainly on the pump head and the handle. Inappropriately stored
supplements may lose functionality or could become detrimental to the health of the animals. The licensee must store
these supplies in a facility that adequately protects them against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
Refrigeration shall be provided for supplies of perishable items.
