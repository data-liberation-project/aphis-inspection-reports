ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:45p on
06-Jul-17.
ACI Bartels arrived at the facility, honked the horn of the government owned vehicle, and called the number
provided by the licensee. ACI Bartels later spoke with the licensee by phone. They stated they had phone issues
and did not receive my call. They located the business card I left at the facility, and gave me a call.
