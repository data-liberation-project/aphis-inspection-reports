ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female takin, Qiji, began showing signs of labor during the afternoon of 4/29/2014. According to zoo personnel,
this animal had a recent history of lethargy, lameness, and swollen legs. A plan to have the night keeper do periodic
checks on the animal throughout the night was made
Documentation provided states that the on-call veterinarian could not be reached earlier in the evening by a senior
animal keeper to discuss concerns involving the progression of the labor. When the senior animal keeper did speak
with the on-call veterinarian later that night to inform him of concerns that the takin was having problems with
delivery, she was told that getting a team together in the middle of the night to immediately deal with the situation
was doubtful and that it would be dealt with first thing in the morning. According to medical records, the takin
received veterinary care the following morning and was euthanized due to findings encountered during a C-section
to remove her fetus, which had died.
Additional documentation provided by the facility states that three animal keepers involved in Qiji(cid:25)'s care are
concerned that there is no clear plan for how to handle after-hours medical emergencies. It states that in the past,
night keepers have had difficulties in being able to reach the on-call veterinarian when there have been after-hours
medical concerns. In looking into these concerns, the Zoo(cid:25)s Animal Management Committee found that the
after-hours Vet call list was out of date and has since been updated and re-distributed.
Although the zoo has a veterinarian and veterinary technician on call each night, and emergency procedures can
and have been conducted during off hours, it appears in this case, there was a failure in communication between
the senior animal keeper and the on-call veterinarian and an uncertainty for how to handle after-hours medical
emergencies.
To be corrected from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
