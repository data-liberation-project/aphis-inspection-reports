FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Excessive rust and paint chipping were observed at multiple areas on four (4) of the seven (7) sugar glider's primary
enclosures/cages. Indoor housing facilities for regulated species must be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from ingesting contaminants, physical injury and potential health problems. All surfaces in a primary
enclosure must be maintained in good repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program. The affected
areas observed should be immediately repaired/replaced/maintained to ensure the best welfare of the animals at
the facility.
