Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the indoor guinea pig housing facility was 87 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. Current ambient
temperature in the area at the time of inspection (1130am) was 83 degrees F with a forecasted high temperature of 91
degrees F. There were several windows, vents, and a garage door open but it was not sufficient ventilation to lower the
temperature below 85 degrees F.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too high may be subject to heat stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature must not rise above 85 degrees F in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs.
Correct by providing a ventilation or cooling system that will prevent the ambient temperature from rising above 85
degrees F.

Sanitation.
There were numerous flies and small gnats in the indoor guinea pig facility. There were 3 windows open with no screens
and a garage door was open with only the lower approximately 3 feet screened. There were no methods of fly or insect


control being utilized.
Excessive pests such as flies and gnats can cause discomfort to the animals and result in increased disease spread.
An effective program for the control of flies and other insects must be established and maintained.
