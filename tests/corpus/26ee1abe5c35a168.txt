2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Direct - There was a female Cocker Spaniel (#0A01607813) with a heavy amount of green discharge from a
cloudy right eye and a right ear with a condition. On initial observation, the surface of the eye was difficult to see
due to the amount of green discharge covering the right eye. The licensee wiped out the majority of the discharge
with his hand and the surface of the right eye was observed to be cloudy. Some thick green mucoid like discharge
remained in the corner of the eye. The entire right eye was cloudy with a dark brown to grey appearance. A
pinpoint sized black lesion was located centrally on the eye. The surface of the eye also appeared slightly concave
around this lesion. Some thin brownish red lines were observed radiating from the pinpoint black lesion to the edge
of the eye. Also the sclera was red with vessels present. There was some hair loss surrounding the right eye
mostly in the corner near the dog's nose. There was a dried, crusty-like dark brown to black material matted in the
hair that was present around the eye. The licensee said that he had noted some discharge from the eye last
Thursday or Friday but acknowledged that the dog was not currently receiving treatment for the condition. The
dog's left eye also had a small amount of thick green mucoid-like discharge present in the corner of the eye. Also,
at the time of inspection, the dog's right ear had a large amount of dark brown to black debris present on the inside
flap of the ear and near the canal. On closer observation, most of the the dog's right ear flap near the canal
appeared reddened and moist with regions of whitish yellow discoloration. According to the licensee, he was
unaware of the dog's ear condition and was not giving any treatment for the ear condition. The ear condition may
be an indication of an allergy, infection or other veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable for the
animal.
***There was a male Yorkshire Terrier (#082*612*126) with right eye discharge. The discharge appeared to be
green to clear, thick and mucoid-like. Some thick, moist, brownish material was matted in the fur surrounding the
eye. There was hair loss immediately surrounding the entire eye. Also, a pinkish irregular shaped lesion was
present on the central portion of the eye.
These dogs were included on the report for the inspection conducted on November 14, 2013 for eye conditions.
The licensee had written documentation dated 11/18/13 from a veterinarian regarding examinations of the dogs'
conditions at that time. However, the dogs were not currently receiving any treatment for the eyes and a
veterinarian had not been contacted about the dogs' current eye conditions. Cloudy eyes and/or dishcarge from theeyes could be the result of injury, infection, or other veterinary medical condition which could be painful and/or lead
to blindness. The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than May 30,
2014 in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and
followed.
**** There was a bottle of Safeguard (fenbendazole) with a labeled expiration date of 03-2014 stored in the whelping
building. This medication is being stored with other medications currently in use at the facility and is therefore
ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable
veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and
expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be changed or may not work as anticipated. The
licensee must estblish and maintain a program to ensure that all used medications have not gone past the labeled
expiration date.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
***The male Cocker Spaniel (#051*813*882), the female Cocker Spaniel (0A01610140) and the male Maltese
(092*879*061) which were previously identified with veterinary care concerns during the inspection conducted on
November 14, 2013 have been addressed.

the required amount of space for the height of each the dogs. Enclosures that do not provide the required amount of
