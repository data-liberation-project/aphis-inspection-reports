TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are 4 litters of puppies (10 total) that do not have any ID on them or on a cage card identifying the female, ID
number, sex, DOB or breed.
Complete records are necessary for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
All puppies less than 16 weeks of age shall be identified by a plastic-type collar, tag, chip/tattoo or cage card with all
of the required information according to AWA regulations and standards.

2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are several puppy records that are missing puppy ID numbers for puppies that have been sold, or the
numbers on the Disposition forms to not match the puppy number on the Puppy Record. There is not any
consistency in the numbering system between these documents that prevents the traceability of the animals
accurately. The dates of sale and death have not been recorded on the puppy records available. There were 9
Disposition forms missing the method of transportation via an airline, and 13 of 22 missing the ID#'s of animals sold.
Complete and accurate records are important for proper animal management, accountability and traceability of all
animals at the facility.
The licensee must keep all puppy records completely, including their ID #, and dates of sale and/or death. All
Disposition forms shall be filled out completely including the method of transportation (name/address) and animal
ID#/name. To be corrected by: September 30, 2016
