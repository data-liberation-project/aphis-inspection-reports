ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Attending Veterinarian and Adequate Veterinary Care*** Within the puppy room attached to the owner's
residence two containers of veterinary products were found that were past the labeled expiration date. Both
containers were located in a caddy apparently ready for use. A container of Panacur dewormer was found with an
expiration of 10/13 as well as a container of Spectinomycin with an expiration of 03/12. The owner stated she had
not used the Spectinomycin for a long period but had failed to dispose of it. Labeled directions of use for these two
products contained dosages for hoofstock and swine but not canines. Written directions for canines were not
available. Products with expirations dates must not be considered as a part of an appropriate program of veterinary
care when expired. Expected efficacy rates may be affected on expired products. Also all products used within this
program of veterinary care must have written directions of use for canines as approved by the attending veterinarian
to ensure correct and appropriate care. To be corrected by: 04/18/14
This inspection was conducted with the designated person with the exit briefing conducted with the owner. The
inspection report is to be delivered via email.
