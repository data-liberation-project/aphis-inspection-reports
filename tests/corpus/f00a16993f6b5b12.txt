3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Four metal self-feeders used to feed five adult dogs are excessively rusty and pitting for the bottom portion of the
feed receptacles.
Six metal dog doors, used by eight adult dogs, are excessively rusty and pitting.
The end enclosures for the Outside Runs, all housing six adult dogs, had two metal panel dividers and two metal
bars that are excessively rusty and pitting. These metal bars are along the bottom of the dividers and had corroded
away in areas. These rusty and pitting metal surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. The structural
strength of the metal surfaces can be jeopardized. This can increase the disease hazards for the dogs. Also,
affecting the structural strength of the panels and metal bar dividers allowing the dogs to escape or get injured
escaping.
All metal surfaces must be free of rust. This will allow the metal surfaces to be readily cleaned and sanitized
decrease the disease potential. Also, this will maintain the structural integrity of the metal surfaces.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two enclosures in the Weaning Area have plastic vertical PVC track sliders that are excessively chewed and
scratched. These two enclosures have square PVC pipe “puppy bumpers” that the surfaces were excessively
chewed or scratched. There was an accumulation of grayish debris in some of these chewed areas.
In the whelping Room, there was a plastic whelping box with square PVC pipe “puppy bumpers”. These surfaces
were excessively chewed and had grayish debris in some of the chewed areas.In the Boston Kennel area, there were two enclosures with fiber board panel dividers. These dividers had large
holes that were chewed and exposing fiber around the edges. These chewed areas had light brown debris. One
hole, located near a metal self-feeder, was exposing bare wood framing.
The Lean-to Kennel had three dog doorways lined with plastic. The plastic was excessively chewed and scratched
on the edges of the doorways. There was brownish grime in these chewed areas.
The southernmost outdoor shelter of the Eastside Runs had a wood wall and board along the bottom of the dog
door. These wood surfaces were excessively chewed and scratched. The wood surface was not impervious to
moisture.
These mentioned surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. As a result, this can increase the disease
potential for the 13 adult dogs.
All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. This will allow for the surfaces to be readily cleaned and
sanitized in the prevention of diseases.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Eight dog doors and the dog door inserts, used by nine adult dogs, had an accumulation of dark brown to brown
grime on their surfaces. Two enclosures in the Lean-to area had an accumulation of light brown grime or waste on
the area around the dog door or back wall.
The back wall for four enclosures, all housing four adult dogs, in the Outside Runs had an accumulation of brown
grime or waste on the surfaces. This indicates the surfaces are not being spot-cleaned daily and sanitized
frequently. This can increase the disease hazards for the dogs.
For the prevention of diseases and accumulation of waste on the hard surfaces, all surfaces must be spot-cleaned
daily and sanitized frequently.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
* There was 10 metal self-feeders used to feed 13 adult dogs and two puppies. These self-feeders had anaccumulation of brown grime or debris and hair around the part of the feeders where the dogs eat. This indicates
the feed receptacles are not being kept clean and sanitized. This can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
All self-feeders must be kept clean and sanitized for the prevention of disease hazards and accumulation of debris.
To be corrected by, 27-September-2016.
3.10
WATERING.
* Seven Water receptacles or bowls had an accumulation or dark green algae. This indicates the bowls are being
kept and clean and sanitized. This can increase the disease potential for eight adult dogs. These watering
receptacles were located in the Outside Runs and Eastside runs.
All watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized. This will reduce the disease potential for the animals.
