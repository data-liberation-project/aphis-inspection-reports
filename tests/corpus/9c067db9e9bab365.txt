2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
In January 2015 a rhesus macaque underwent a procedure to apply a tattoo for identification and was released to
its social group. Within two weeks the animal was observed to have abnormal movement. It was then removed
from the social group for veterinary examination. Although the cause of illness could not be determined at that time,
supportive care was provided.
While receiving supportive care the macaque developed neurological signs and respiratory distress. The animal
was euthanized and a necropsy performed. It was determined at necropsy that the staff had failed to remove a
rubber band that was applied during the tattooing procedure before returning the macaque to the social group.
All animals shall be handled in a manner that will minimize distress and protect them from injury. Appropriate
preventive and corrective actions were put in place and additional training provided for the staff.
Corrected.
