ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a gorilla breeding colony and there is a young juvenile, approximately 1 year old, among the group.
The scale for weighing these animals is not functioning and according to the weight logs, and a facility
representative, the scale has been inoperative since November of 2014. A scale is necessary to monitor the
condition of these animals on a regular basis.
A system should be in place to ensure appropriate equipment is available, and/or is repaired in a timely manner, to
maintain the health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an animal enclosure in the nursery currently housing meerkats, there are two light fixtures which do not have bulb
covers. In the event the bulbs in these fixtures break and/or shatter, there are no protective structures in place to
prevent glass from falling into the enclosure and injuring an animal. A system should be in place to ensure animal
housing facilities, including its furniture, light fixtures, etc., are maintained in a manner that protects the animals from
injury.
