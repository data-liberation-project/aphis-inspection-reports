2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection there was no written program of veterinary care available to review. The licensees are
following vaccination and medication protocols but did not have the documentation from their attending veterinarian.
A formal relationship with a veterinarian is very important for the health and well being of the facility animals. The
veterinarian should be involved in all aspects of animal care including decisions on the frequency of routine health
visits, preventative health protocols, animal husbandry, and other simple medical procedures such as tail docking
and dew claw removal. A document generated by the attending veterinarian outlining their plan to accomplish these
functions needs to be available for review during USDA inspections.
