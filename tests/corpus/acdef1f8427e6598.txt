ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** There is not enough guidance on the consultant agreement forms with the attending veterinarian. The current
agreement just lists that the vet is willing to consult and care for the animals and come out quarterly. There is no
mention of current methods of parasite control, vaccines or method of euthanasia. The agreement should provide
adequate guidance to assure the vet has adequate authority over animal health care issues.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Currently one geriatric bobcat is both blind and deaf according to the facility caretaker. While being observed the
bobcat would jump/flinch when gunshots would go off at the facility. The caretaker stated this behavior did not start
occurring until the animal lost vision and hearing. This flinching behavior can indicate stress for the animal. Since
this is a facility with an adjacent gun range, and shots are fired frequently throughout the day every day, the facility
should consult with the attending vet and determine an appropriate method to alleviate the stressful impact on this
animal.
*** The Asiatic black bear has a broken left front canine that is black in the middle of the tooth. Broken canines can
be painful and lead to possible infections. This bear should be evaluated by the attending vet to assess the
condition of the tooth and determine a possible course of treatment.
*** The bears are geriatric and obese with their front claws removed. These bears are under treatment for arthritis,
but are currently housed in a concrete slab enclosure with no soft resting surfaces. Additionally the diet of these
animals is not of nutritive value to maintain them in a healthy body condition. In addition to dog food, the bears are
given left over food from the club restaurant (pasta, breads, fries, and cooked meat products) which contributes to
their weight. Additionally according to the caretaker the bears are not fed more food during fall which is a period of
hyperplasia for them and therefore do not go down into a period of winter lethargy. Dietary issues in bears cancontribute to multiple health care problems and this diet should be evaluated by the attending vet to assure their
dietary needs are being met and maintained in a manner that prevents injury and health issues.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The chicken wire above at the top of the raccoon enclosure is broken and the raccoons are climbing through the
mesh and walking and defecating on the top section of the wire. The mesh needs to be removed or maintained in
good repair for the safety of the animals.
*** One of the wooden bobcat shelter boxes has a broken board at the base of the box. This is leaving a nail
exposed which can pose a potential injury to the animals. This board should be replaced and the box maintained in
good repair for the safety of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The fridge storing meat products for the animals needs to be cleaned. Currently some meat is directly on the
wire racks and fluids are pooled on the floor of the fridge. The manner of storing food does not prevent
contamination and meat should be placed in leak proof bins or trays. This fridge needs to be addressed for the
health of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Currently when the bear enclosures are cleaned, the bear feces are moved out and piled next to the enclosure
dens which are located in the deer pens. Some type of appropriate trash container with a lid should be provided so
the enclosures can be cleaned appropriately and feces not placed in other animal area. This needs to be addressed
for the health of the deer at the facility. Correct by: July 20, 2017

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** Currently both bears which are declawed and obese are housed in a concrete slab enclosure with no soft resting
surfaces. As these are declawed bears, there is a lot more pressure put on their front paws and these animals
should be given resting surfaces off the ground, or bedding in the den areas. In addition, the Asiatic black bear was
sitting down by the front side of the enclosure and was moving in a repetitive rocking motion for extended periods of
time. This is an abnormal behavior pattern and can be due to the limited functionality of his enclosure. Normal
postural adjustment for these animals would be to create day beds with soft bedding which is not currently provided
and have climbing surfaces. This enclosure needs to be addressed to promote normal postural and social
adjustments for the health of the animals.

FEEDING.
*** The deer feeder to the right of the bear enclosure is in disrepair with the wood roof rotted out. The feeder no
longer adequately protects the food supply from deterioration. The current daily grain was on top of older grain that
had essentially turned to fine dust. Additionally based on the feeder position, it is difficult to clean around and
underneath the feeder. This feeder needs to replaced, to adequately protect the food supplies from contamination
and deterioration.

SANITATION.
The bobcat enclosure cannot be effectively cleaned because there is no way to safely enter the enclosure and
scrub out dens and furniture items. The current den boxes are dirty and have an accumulation of old bedding and
food items. There is no shift area to lock the animals out of the enclosure so cleaning can occur in a safe and
effective manner. This enclosure needs to be addressed to facilitate adequate cleaning of the enclosure.

EMPLOYEES.
*** The inspector tried to inspect the facility on July 12 at 2:00 in the afternoon. Although there was multiple
employees of the facility available, no one knew how to care for the animals or could accompany the inspector at
that time. The current facility caretaker is considered part time and works 7 days a week. There is no back up
animal care employee who is able to feed or care for the animals if an emergency came up and the part time
caretaker could not come to the facility. This needs to be addressed as a sufficient number of adequately trained
employees must be utilized to maintain a professional level of husbandry and care.
