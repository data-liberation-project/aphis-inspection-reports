2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility did not perform adequate daily observations of a female black Miniature Pig and did not identify
abnormalities of the animal's gait. The Mini Pig was observed to be slightly limping on her left front leg and the outer
toe of her left front hoof was enlarged. The facility representative stated the Min Pig did not have gait abnormalities
on 10-5-19 when taken to a private exhibiting event. Lameness can be caused by a variety of problems including
infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the health and well-being
of the animal.
This particular condition had not been documented by facility.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and
the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
