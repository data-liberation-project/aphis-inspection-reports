inspection and review of the program of humane care and use was conducted by the IACUC on May 8th and May

Inspection of the animal facilities by the IACUC is required at least every six months to ensure that any activities
involving animals at these facilities are being conducted in a manner to reduce pain and/or distress and that they
meet the current standards for all species.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research
facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a
basis for evaluation.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***On 6/1/14, an artic ground squirrel (ID # 12-16) was observed by a research staff student as being abnormal. The
student did not notify the laboratory manager or the attending veterinarian on 6/1/14 about the animal's condition.
On 6/2/14, the student notified the laboratory manager about the animal's condition. Upon examination of the
animal, the manager noted the following: a swollen tongue, lethargic, not eating, very dehydrated, emitting a foul
odor, and no fresh urine or fecal material in the tray. The manager elected to euthanize the animal, with consultation
of the attending veterinarian, due to poor prognosis.
On 6/1/14, there was no communication to the veterinarian about the animal's condition when it was noted as being
abnormal. When observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must be conveyed to the attending
veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. Failure to properly observe
and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and the increase risk of developmentof serious medical conditions. Correct by ensuring that all injuries or disease are found and are appropriately
communicated with the attending veterinarian in a timely manner.
To be corrected by 10/30/14.
Inspection conducted with facility manager and IACUC members.
Exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
