***The licensee has animals housed in outdoor only housing. This is fully appropriate for the full blooded servals.
However, the licensee stated that one older male was actually an (cid:28)F1(cid:29) hybrid. This is considered to be a domestic
cat and not an exotic animal. As such, the licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and receive specific
approval to house this older cat in outdoor only housing. The licensee shall document this approval in writing. The
licensee must ensure that this older, domestic (hybrid) cat is housed appropriately and with the approval of her
attending veterinarian.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***The licensee stated that one of the servals in an enclosure was actually an (cid:28)F1(cid:29) hybrid. This animal is considered
to be a domestic cat. The enclosure that this animal is housed in has concrete paver flooring with grout in between
the seams. Water was seen soaking into the surface of these concrete pavers and they did not appear to be fully
impervious to moisture. There was also a wood resting shelf in this enclosure. This surface was rough and worn and
did not appear to be impervious to moisture. Hard surfaces in outdoor housing in direct contact with the animals
must be impervious to moisture or if made of surfaces that cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized (cid:19) replaced when
worn and soiled.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The food preparation area for the Servals is located inside of a domestic cattery. One domestic cat was
observed loose and resting on a shelf directly above the food prep area. The licensee stated that the domestic cats
are let out of their enclosures for rodent control within the building. There was an accumulation of dirt and grime on
the food preparation table and the sink area used during food preparation. The freezer storing the Serval food was dirty. The shelving was soiled with leaked blood. The food stored in the dirty
freezer has the potential to become contaminated and pose a health risk to the animals once ingested. Supplies of
food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding,
or contamination by vermin.
All food preparation areas used for food being fed to the regulated animals must be kept clean to ensure
uncontaminated food for the animals. The food must be stored appropriately and the food preparation area cleaned
more frequently.
