FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal fence panels or gates that are temporarily placed in the halls and rooms in ADS to guide the pigs to
different locations are not stable. The panels are not attached to the walls and are free standing which allows them
to easily be knocked down upon contact. Should pigs be present when they fall they may become injured. The
structures shall be secured to protect the pigs from injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The light over the "maze" in ADS is disconnected. There are three lamp stands used in the area. The light
provided by the lamp stands is not sufficient to allow routine inspection and cleaning. Adequate light must be
provided.

FEEDING.
In the pig housing area in ADS there are large metal automatic feeders. The first feeder to the left upon entering the
room has caked, discolored feed on upper inside surfaces. Improper cleaning and sanitization of the feeders may
result in food contamination and illness. All feeders shall be cleaned and sanitized using appropriate procedures to
prevent contamination and protect the well-being of the pigs.
There are large plastic/fiberglass feeders in the dairy side of ADS. The lids on the feeders and the front edges have
been repaired with plywood. Plywood is porous and will allow material to become embedded in it. Porous material
cannot be completely cleaned and sanitized which may allow the growth of bacteria, mold, etc. causing
contamination of the feed. The feeders shall be removed, replaced, or properly repaired to prevent contamination of
the feed and protect the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by October 22, 2016.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The rubber mats placed in the "maze" in Rm 156 are not joined leaving gaps that will allow waste material and
water to run through. The mats are covering a slatted concrete floor for drainage but any material passing through
these gaps can potentially accumulate on the slats.The mats are hosed down regularly but no chemicals or
detergents are used for organic material. The mats shall be moved, cleaned and sanitized to prevent buildup of
material under them.
