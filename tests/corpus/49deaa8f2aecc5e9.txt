Facilities, general.
Several of the facility’s older enclosures are in need of maintenance and repair.
*The floor in the Bactrian camel barn is made up of dirt and contains several large holes approximately 10-15” in width
with some holes holding water and urine that is not draining in the barn area. The floor in the barn needs to be maintained
in good condition for the safety and health of the camels.
*In the Zebra yard, there is a section of wire under the bridge that is in disrepair with wires protruding in the yard. This
section of wire should be removed or replaced to keep the area in good repair and safe for the animals.
*There is some fencing down in one of the antelope enclosures that could be a safety hazard to animals as they could
inadvertently run into the downed fencing and injure themselves. This fencing should be removed to keep the area in
good repair and for the safety of the animals.
*The windbreak flaps hanging in the bongo stalls leading to the outside runs are in disrepair with the rubber coating
flaking and peeling off. These flaps should be replaced or maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals and to
reduce flaking of materials into the stall area and inadvertently become an ingestion hazard to the animals.
*The shift doors in the bear and tiger indoor housing are rusted and are beginning to degrade at the base of the door.
Rusting of metal can affect the structural integrity of the enclosure and must be maintained in good repair.


Correct by 21 January 2022 by maintaining all facilities in good repair to protect the animals from injury ensure the
structural integrity of the enclosures.

Facilities, general.
Thawing fish in the facility’s cooler are not being protected from contamination. Frozen fish are thawed in large plastic
tubs stored on a rack in the cooler. The racks holding the tubs have a lot of debris caked on the wires. Additionally, some
of the tubs have open bags of fish with no cover to protect them from the debris on the rack above falling into the tub
when the bins are moved around. Food that is not protected during storage can lead to contamination or deterioration of
the diet and cause potential disease hazards or other illnesses to the animals being fed. Correct by 12 January 2022 by
ensuring all food supplies are stored in facilities that protect them again deterioration, molding, or contamination.
3.129(b)

Feeding.
Tube feeders used by guests to feed the camels are not being kept clean and sanitary at all times. There are two tube
feeders at the camel enclosures that allow the public to feed alfalfa treats. The tubes are several feet long and angled
from the walkway down into a small trough within the enclosure. Both feeders contained a large amount of food dust,
some loose and some wet and caked on the sides of the tube. One feeder had a blockage of treats visualized from the
top of the feeder. Caked and deteriorated food in feeders can become unwholesome, unpalatable, and contaminated,
leading to potential disease hazards or other illnesses. Correct by 14 January 2022 by ensuring all food receptacles are
kept clean and sanitary at all times and measures are taking to prevent deterioration or caking of food.
