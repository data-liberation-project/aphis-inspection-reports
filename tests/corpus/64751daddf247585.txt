2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific guidance for animal procedures. There
is no guidance for anesthesia, monitoring, recovery or other pre or post procedural care where specific guidance is
required. The method of euthanasia listed is not in accordance with the AVMA guidelines for euthanasia as required
and needs to have complete directions if it is to be carried out by facility personnel. Specific guidance from the
attending veterinarian is required for all drugs and procedures used on animals by the licensee.

Additional specific guidance is required for the Programs of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not
ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.
To be corrected by 22 January 2016 or before any medications or procedures are used on animals whichever is
first.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
