ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On the morning of 9/11/15 the inspector identified three animals that were in need of veterinary care that had not
been thusly identified by facility staff.
1) A capybara (#1132) had red material resembling thickened blood on its nose.
2) A red banteng female (#6164) was noted squinting its left eye with a large amount of active tearing and tear
staining down the entire length of the right side of her face underneath the eye. She appeared agitated and tried to
turn her neck to rub the eye on her side.
3) A member of the public addressed me thinking I worked for the auction as she saw a newborn alpaca cria that
was having difficulty breathing and appeared very weak and the female alpaca (#2542) did not seem to be taking
care of it.
Review of consignment records did not document any health issues regarding these animals. The inspector notified
one of the principals of the auction who stated he would contact his veterinarian (on site). One of the vet techs later
notified me that the animals were being "monitored".
Followup of the three animals on 9/12/15 was conducted. The capybara had been sold. The banteng's eye
appeared much improved. She was no longer squinting and drainage was minimal. The alpaca cria had died.
The facility is responsible for identifying veterinary issues and ensuring adequate veterinary care to include
diagnosis and treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the auction. Correct from this day
forward.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*On 9/11/15 the USDA inspector was asked a couple of times by members of the public about animals as the
person assumed the inspector was an employee of the auction. One person who was extremely upset about thenewborn alpaca crea was desperately trying to find a staff member to notify. The inspector also could not identify
who the auction staff were as none were readily identiable. No one was wearing identifying clothing or identification
tags.
*On 9/11/15 the inspector noticed a man entering a stall with a large camel to interact with the camel. When asked if
he owned the camel, the man replied no and left the area. On 9/12/15 several members of the public were noted
crowding around a pen housing two baby zebra. The zebras became agitated and started bucking/trying to get
away from the people trying to touch them. No facility personnel were noted in the area monitoring the activity.
The licensee must provide readily identifiable, responsible and knowledgeable attendants during all periods of
public contact to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals. The public must be able to identify whom to
contact with concerns/questions. Failure to provide this oversight during public contact may lead to injury to the
animals or the public.
2.132(d) REPEAT
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
During the auction, an unlicensed individual attempted to consign multiple hedgehogs that they had bred. The
individual stated they had sent in a USDA Animal Welfare Act license application and were in the process of
obtaining their license but had not yet completed the process. They were informed that a valid license had to be
issued before they could conduct regulated activity. A few hours later another unlicensed person brought in the
same hedgehogs in the same exact enclosures. When questioned, she stated that she had not bred the
hedgehogs-she stated she had gotten them from someone else. When informed that the brokering of exotic animals
requires a USDA license, she told the USDA inspector that that was not the case because she specifically asked
one of the auction principals if it was legal for her to sell the hedgehogs and he told her that it was. Once learning
this information, she said she would give the hedgehogs back to the person who gave them to her. No dealer shall
knowingly obtain any animal from any person who is required to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid
and unsuspended license.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two dead animals were noted in an enclosure pen in the auction building section housing sheep and goats on the
morning of 9/11/15: one 2 horn Jacobs (#76) and one tan & black billy (#120). A strong unpleasant odor was noted
while standing in front of the pen. In the adjacent pen were live sheep and goats. Consignment forms were reviewed
for the animals and no notations of any health issues were noted. Multiple staff members were asked about what
had happened to the animals and why they were in the pen-most had no idea. One staff person stated that theystressed and died during the auction process the previous day. Another staff person stated that they were still in the
pen as they still needed to have their ear tags removed prior to disposal. Disposal of dead animals needs to be
done in a timely manner to prevent distress to any nearby live animals and to prevent odors/attraction of pests.
Corrected the afternoon of 9/11/15.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in back of the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with no sides
or overhead protection from inclement weather. On 9/11/15 the day started out bright and sunny and warmed up
fairly quickly. Animals housed in the outdoor enclosures include watusi, bison, cattle and water buffalo. The animals
had no shade provided to protect them from the direct rays of the sun.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in back off the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with no sides
or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 9/11/15 started out dry, bright and sunny. A
thunderstorm with lots of rain appeared in the late afternoon/early evening. The animals outside (including water
buffalo, watusi, bison, cattle) had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain dry during the rain. The dirt in their
enclosures quickly became wet sloppy mud and standing water. One young water buffalo was noted bawling during
the storm. The rain stopped overnight. The following morning on 9/12/15 the standing water and mud in the
enclosures was over ankle deep on the bison. The animals' feet made sucking sounds when they lifted them to
move about in their enclosure. This may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. Fresh hay was
thrown on top of the wet mud which may lead to contamination of the hay being eaten by the animals. Live animals
shall be provided protection to allow them to remain dry during rain. Correct from this day forward.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Several pens in the arena barn and in the newer smaller barn next door were noted containing so many sheep and
goats that the animals could not turn around freely or lie down without being trampled by the other animals on
9/11/15. The animals were of multiple sizes and some of the smaller animals were noted standing underneath the
larger/taller ones as they had nowhere else to go. One pen measuring 5ft by 8ft contained 19 sheep and goats. A
second pen measuring 6ft by 9 ft contained 27 sheep and goats. Two animals in one of the pens were noted trying
to fight--the surrounding animals tried to push their way away from the fighting ones but had no place to go.
Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort, injury and overheating. Enclosures/pens used to house animals shallbe large enough to ensure that each animal contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make
normal postural adjustments (stand, sit and lie down).
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*The outside locked area holding the cages for the exotic and pet species to include ferrets, prairie dogs, capybara,
cavy and wallabies needs cleaning. Spilled feed and discarded portions of bananas/banana skins were lying on the
shelves next to the cages attracting a large number of flies. Flies can lead to spread of disease and may bother the
animals. Empty soda/drink bottles were piled up behind a couple of the prairie dog enclosures.
*Twine and string pieces were noted on the ground and tied to enclosure stall boards in several of the stalls housing
the exotic hoofstock. A couple of fallow deer were noted chewing and eating the twine. Twine ingestion can lead to
intestinal tract issues.
The facility premises and grounds shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals and facilitate prescribed
husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary.
Inspection conducted over two days 9/11/15-9/12/15. Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
