INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On 11/18/16 a bat (ID # 59832) that was on a study was found dead in its enclosure. The student working with this
animal on this study, under the principle investigator, disposed of the bat. According to the protocol (attachment on
bat husbandry) any dead animals are to be bagged, labeled, placed in a designated refrigerator, and reported to the
veterinary staff immediately.
The student did not follow the protocol, which constitutes an unapproved significant change to the protocol. Such a
change can have a negative impact on the well-being of the animals. In this instance, the fact that the veterinary
staff was not able to examine this animal meant that there were unanswered questions about the cause of death;
Could the death have been preventable? Could the animal have been affected by something that could be a risk to
the others in the colony?
Steps should be taken to ensure that all personnel follow the approved protocol, in order to safeguard the well-being
of the animals under study.
To be corrected from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
