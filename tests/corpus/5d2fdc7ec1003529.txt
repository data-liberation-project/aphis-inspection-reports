ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1 pm on
05-SEP-19.
At the facility, I spoke to Mrs. Hunter via telephone who said she didn't think anyone would be home until evening.
Left a message for Mr. Hunter on his cell phone, waited 1/2 hour.
