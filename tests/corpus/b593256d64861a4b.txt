Feeding.
Many of the self feeders contained ground up, deteriorated, caked feed in the trough of the feeder with very little pelleted
feed accessible to the guinea pigs.
Failure to provide access to feed that is not ground up and deteriorated can result in decreased feed consumption which
can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Measures to prevent deterioration or caking of feed must be taken if self-feeders are used for feeding pelleted food.

Watering.
Approximately 13 out of 21 water bottles contained a buildup of green or greenish black material coating the inside of the
bottle. The PVC wastewater piping around the nipples of the water bottles contained a large amount of wet brown debris
under the nipples in the interior of the piping.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.


3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
Approximately 11 out of 18 guinea pig pens had an accumulation of soiled, wet bedding with excess fecal material and
debris. The pens were last cleaned 6 days ago and were due to be cleaned the following day.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.
