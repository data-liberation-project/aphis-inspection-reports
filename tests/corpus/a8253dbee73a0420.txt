3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 5 labs housed in an enclosure with two shelter structures that do not have wind/rain breaks at the
entrance of the structure. Without having wind/rain breaks at the entrance of the shelter structure, these animals do
not have adequate protection from the weather extremes; wind, rain and snow. All outdoor enclosures must have
shelter structures with wind/rain breaks at the entrance to the structure.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 5 adult labs that have two shelter structures within their enclosure. These enclosures were found to have
no bedding provided within these structures at the time of inspection. The temperature at the facility at the time of
inspection (1:30 PM) was 34.8 degrees fahrenheit in a sunny area and 25 degrees fahrenheit with the wind chill
factor in the same area. Bedding is critical to these animals to maintain normal body temperatures. Clean, dry
bedding material must be provided if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees fahrenheit. Additional clean, dry
bedding is required when he temperature is 35 degrees fahrenheit or lower.
The Licensee's wife provided each of the shelter structures with adequate bedding at the time of inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee's Wife.
