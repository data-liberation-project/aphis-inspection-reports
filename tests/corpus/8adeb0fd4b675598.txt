FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The licensee has a variance dated December 9, 1994 allowing the guinea pigs to be housed outside as long as
four criteria are met. At the time of the inspection 2 of the 4 criteria were not met.
The variance states "Your request to house guinea pigs outside is approved, provided the following criteria are
met.:
1. The permissible temperature range for guinea pigs is 45 degree F to 85 degree F.
2. The animals must be acclimatized to whatever temperatures they will be encountering.
3. The facility must have a means to monitor and record the temperatures in the animals area.
4. Written procedures must delineate what shelter or care is available when the ambient temperature exceeds the
permissible range; for example, ventilation and/or shade in hot weather, or shelter and/or bedding in cold weather."
The guinea pigs are housed outside in concrete rabbit hutch type enclosures under a metal carport type structure.
The nest box area is divided in half and hay bedding was present in the nest box. All 3 guinea pigs were present in
the same half of the nest box and the temperature in that side of the nest box was above 45 degree F. There was
no thermometer or means of measuring and recording temperatures in the animals area nor was there any written
procedures present to mitigate temperatures on either side of the allowable temperature range.
The licensee must meet all four requirements of the variance to be in compliance with the AWA.
