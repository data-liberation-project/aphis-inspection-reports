3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The resinous flooring in the facility was redone last summer; however, the top coat of the flooring is already lifting,
especially in high traffic areas. The flooring surface has chips and pitting present to include areas inside the
kennels for the dogs. The rough and pitted areas of the flooring cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, and could
play a significant role in disease transmission. The flooring must be repaired and maintained to facilitate proper
cleaning and sanitation of the facility.
