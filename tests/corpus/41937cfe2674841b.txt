WATERING.
** In the young capybara's primary enclosure there was a pool that the animal was swimming and defecating in. He
did not have a separate water source for consumption. Even though it was intended for the animal to drink the water
in its pool it was not appropriate for consumption due to the feces floating in it. The animal should be provided
potable water that it can access as often as needed for its health and well-being. All water receptacles shall be kept
clean and sanitary. Correct by October 27, 2017
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
