***In the whelping house there was a female Chihuahua identified as #12 that was nursing puppies. According to
the hands on veterinary check that was performed in December 2013, this Chihuahua was determined to be
unsound for breeding and according to the facility representative it was due to a diagnosed health issue by the
veterinarian. Dogs that are deemed to be unsound for breeding can worsen the existing health issues in the animal
if they are bred. The licensee must follow the veterinarian's instructions for breeding and assure that all dogs
receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
***In the outdoor facility, there were two Bernese Mountain Dogs that were taller and longer than the housing units
in their primary enclosures. There were at least nine adult dogs that had no access to a shelter with four sides and a
floor. There were at least nine adult dogs that were provided with morning shade, yet not enough to protect them in
the high noon or afternoons. There were ten adult dogs that were provided with evening shade, yet not enough to
protect them in the mornings. No access to shelters, shelters that are not of adequate size and lack of shade
exposes the animals to the elements and increase the risks of illness. The licensee must provide adequate shelter
and shade to these animals and assure that all animals are provided with shelter from the elements as required.
The dogs with no access or small housing is to be corrected by April 27, 2014.
The shade is to be corrected by May 6, 2014.
