SANITATION.
This facility is not sanitizing primary enclosures every 2 weeks as required. The licensee stated that bedding is
being changed weekly and enclosures are being cleaned but a formal sanitization every 2 week is not currently
occurring. Failure to sanitize surfaces in contact with the animals in a manner provided in Section 3.31(a)(4) may
expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards. Correct this ensure all surfaces in contact with the animals are
sanitized at least every 2 weeks.
