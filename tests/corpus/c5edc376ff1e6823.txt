HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At the time of this inspection a summer camp was being held for approximately 20 children. The children were
divided into 2 groups with a counselor responsible for each group. The counselor for one group was observed
sitting on the ground as the children chased animals around the enclosure. The other group was handling baby
pigs with no counselor anywhere to be seen.

During periods of public contact an identifiable employee or attendant must be present and actively ensuring the
public is handling the animals in a responsible manner.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rabbit cages hanging on the wall had an excessive amount of rusty wire. Some of the pans had areas that
were rusted through.
Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
Rusty wire cannot be adequately cleaned which could lead to illness in the animals. Pans that are rusted through
cannot adequately perform their function of containing waste materials.
The cages need to be repaired or replaced or another method for housing the rabbits needs to be implemented.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. One of the fences in the pig yard was constructed of 2x2 inch wire. The pigs had ripped holes in several parts of
the fence. There were a lot of sharp wire points accessible to pigs and children. The pig house had an approximate
1’x2’ hole in the side where the pigs had pushed through the wall and the front door was broken. The broken front
door had sharp screw points accessible to the pigs.
Facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The pig fence and house need to be repaired and maintained so that they are structurally sound and do not pose a
hazard to animals or people.
