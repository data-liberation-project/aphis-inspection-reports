3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the field cages in the South Campus of the facility, there was a accumulation of grime present on the surface of
several PVC cage furnishings. The majority of the furnishings throughout the facility were soiled. The facility
representative stated that the furnishings are cleaned when the animals are rotated from different enclosures, with a
time frame that can take several weeks to months. Hard surfaces that non human primates come in contact with
must be sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. The excessive waste could be a cause of
disease and other health issues with the animals. The facility should implement a program of scheduled cleaning
and sanitizing of the cage furnishings to prevent an accumulation of dirt and debris.
