INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Section 2.31(d)(1)(ii) IACUC: The principal investigators for ongoing animal activity proposals (protocols)
0436DK19.004 (42 dogs) and 0472DB51.001 (44 dogs) did not provide a written description of the methods and
sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to the potentially painful or distressful effects of the
test articles described in these protocols. To avoid or minimize discomfort, distress and pain to the animals the
principal investigator must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain
or distress to the animals and provide a written description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available. Correct by having the principal investigators for the two protocols amend their
protocols to provide a written description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not
available. Correct by December 30, 2016.
2.36(b)
ANNUAL REPORT.
Section 2.36(b) Annual report: One nonhuman primate on animal activity proposal (protocol) 0437SP52.001 was
reported in Column E and the other five nonhuman primates on this protocol were reported in Column C on the
2015 Annual Report for the facility. A review of the records for the six animals on this protocol documented that four
additional animals also had documented signs of distress and/or pain that were not treated for at least a day and
one animal with documented signs received immediate treatment. The 2015 Annual Report should have reported
five nonhuman primates in Column E and one nonhuman primate in column D for this protocol. Research facilities
must submit accurate annual reports to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations and to provide the correct
information to USDA, APHIS, Animal Care. Correct by amending the 2015 Annual Report and submitting it to the
Animal Care Raleigh, NC Office to report the correct number of animals in Columns C, D and E.
