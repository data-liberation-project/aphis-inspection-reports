2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Male Saint Bernard has an approximately 2 inch long, 1/2 inch wide wound on the outside of his left hind leg just above
the paw. The wound is mostly scabbed over with a red, moist area in the center. There is an inch wide area around the
wound where the hair is rubbed off and the hair outside of that area is a rusty color. The nails on both hind declaws are
over grown, circling back to the pads. The licensee was unaware of these conditions.

Daily observation of all animals to asses the health and wellbeing is necessary to identify and address veterinary care
issues in a timely manner.

This dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian for proper treatment and care of the leg wound. Nails need to trimmed
and maintained at a healthy length. All animals need to be observed daily for health or behavioral problems.

3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


Two enclosures housing two dogs have a build up of dirt and organic material on the metal doors leading outside. Six
enclosures housing 6 dogs have a thick accumulation of hair and organic material along the bottom corners of the door
frames and between the frame and the floor. The licensee states that the enclosures were last power washed at the end
of January

Enclosures, including food and water receptacles, must be sanitized at least every two weeks, and more often if
necessary to prevent the accumulation dirt, hair, debris, and excreta, and other disease hazards.

The enclosures must be sanitized, and a plan for routine sanitization every two weeks or as necessary to prevent the
accumulation of dirt and debris must be followed.
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
At approximately 10 am, the inspectors entered the whelping building and were immediately aware of the nearly
overwhelming odor of excreta and urine. The building is housing 11 puppies and one dam. The enclosure housing 4
Saint Bernard puppies has an excess of fecal material that the puppies have walked in and spread around the floor of the
enclosure. Several layers of newspaper shreds had been placed on the floor, but were completely saturated and soiled.
The licensee states that the enclosure is cleaned each evening.

Floors must be cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all dogs have the freedom to avoid contact with excreta.
Contaminated material , such as the newspaper, must be replaced whenever necessary to prevent soiling the puppies
and to eliminate odors. Animals exposed to an excess of fecal material, soiled bedding and the associated strong odors
are at a increased risk to contact bacteria, spread parasites, and develop disease.



The puppy enclosures must be kept sufficiently clean and dry to minimize contact with excreta and control odors.

Correction date: By 8 pm tonight (03/25/2021).
