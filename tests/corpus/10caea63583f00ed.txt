3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
SERVALS:
The exterior shift enclosure has a detached and hanging top rail. The ends of this top rail are no longer attached to
their corner support structures.
This damage leaves the fence fabric sagging and not adequately secured. Should the servals ever need to be in
this space, the fencing would not be of the appropriate strength to contain the two servals.
The top rail must be properly secured and the fence fabric attached to the rail to maintain structural strength.
