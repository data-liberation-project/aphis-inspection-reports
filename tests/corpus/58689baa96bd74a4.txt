ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
All five wolves were diagnosed with heartworm disease. None of these animals have received heartworm
prevention. Three of these animals either died or were euthanized as a result of the treatment.
The remaining two are currently not receiving any type of treatment because the staff cannot separate them to feed
the veterinary recommended treatment in the feed. The enclosure design does not allow for any separation and the
keepers cannot get up close to administer any treatments.
These wolves must receive veterinary approved treatment for heartworm disease to alleviate pain & distress and to
minimize transmission to other susceptible animals by the many mosquitoes that are in the area.
A baboon "Ilean" was diagnosed with whipworms and received a deworming on 8/23/13, followed by another
deworming on 4/4/14. The PVC indicates that deworming shall occur quarterly.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On the morning of February 11, 2014, a guenon & a patas monkey were let out of their night houses to eat by a
keeper. The ambient temperature at that time was around 20 degrees, and the concrete floor of the enclosures
were covered with ice.
Subsequently these primate's tails got frostbitten and had to be amputated two days later.
Handling of animals must be done carefully and in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm.
Adequate heating must be supplied at all times during cold weather to protect the primates from injury.Correct immediately.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The wolf enclosure does not have a barrier fence around 3 sides. This area is not constantly monitored by a zoo
employee, and the public can easily get to the enclosure fence and put their hands or other objects through the
enclosure.
All enclosures must have a barrier fence that is at least 3 feet from the enclosure on all sides to protect the animals
and the public from injury
