ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There were three four fluid oz. bottles of
Vetericyn wound and skin care spray with an expiration dates of 03/2014 and 09/2014. These medications were
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The
usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice
and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when
expired drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must
ensure that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 4/24/15.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 4/10/15 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
