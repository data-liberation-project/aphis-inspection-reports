Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
An inspection was attempted at the licensee's approved site at 10:40 A.M. on 02/28/2022. An adult at that location stated
the licensee was out of town exhibiting the animals. A facility representative was then contacted by phone and stated that
they were exhibiting the animals in the Kentucky area with additional plans to exhibit in another nearby state. At time of
this inspection, no current itinerary had been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care that accounts for this travel.
In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail and received at
least two days prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information including the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site.

To be corrected by submission of an itinerary for all future travel in which regulated activities will be conducted.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
