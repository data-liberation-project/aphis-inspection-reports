HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are approximately 7 metal dog doors among the 6 dog kennel buildings that have an accumulation of dog oil,
dirt, and grime. This material covers up to approximately 40-50% of the outdoor surface of some of these doors.
Surfaces that are not sanitized on a regular basis can lead to an increase in disease transmission. All hard surfaces
in contact with dogs must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to reduce disease hazards. Correct by 7 August
2014.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
