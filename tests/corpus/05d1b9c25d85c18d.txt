ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:24pm on
26-Jul-17.
Arrived at the facility at 12:24pm and knocked on the front door. I received no answer at the door or when I called
out repeatedly to see if anyone was at the kennel. I called the phone number provided and left a message. I waited
for 30 more minutes and then left.
