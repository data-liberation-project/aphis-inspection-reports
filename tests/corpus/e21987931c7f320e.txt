PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Training of personnel.
1. It was noted when GP #98 was examined during the inspection, that all of the animal(cid:25)'s toe nails were
excessively long when compared to the length of the toe nails of the other 3 GPs housed in the same room. The
animal moved normally and none of the toe nails were damaged. The GPs are regularly handled by facility
personnel whenever the primary enclosures are changed and according to the room log, the enclosure of GP #98
has been changed 3 times per week for at least the past month.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all personnel involved in animal care should be appropriately trained in the
proper handling and care for the species of animals that they care for. The excessive length of the toe nails of GP
#98 should have been recognized by facility personnel at the time of direct handling of the GP during routine cage
changes and the toe nails trimmed accordingly. Excessively long nails can be associated with discomfort and can
be prone to injury.
Although this item was corrected by facility personnel during the inspection by trimming the long toe nails of GP
#98, the Registrant needs to ensure that all personnel involved in animal care are familiar with the proper care and
handling of the species of animals that they care for and are familiar with the normal physical and behavioral
characteristics of those species so that any deviations from normal are promptly recognized and appropriately
addressed.
Correct by 5/22/15.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Availability of appropriate equipment.1. On 9/3/14 a rabbit died while under general anesthesia for an IACUC approved research activity when the
ventilator abruptly malfunctioned. The rabbit experienced serious respiratory effects and died despite the
immediate efforts of the AV to resuscitate the animal.
The unexpected death of the rabbit during general anesthesia was reported to the IACUC by the investigator the
following day. As a result of being informed of the rabbit's unexpected death, the IACUC conducted an investigation
and concluded that the failure of the ventilator was the result of: (1) the failure of veterinary staff to perform any
routine maintenance of the ventilator as recommended by the manufacturer since the unit was purchased in
October 2008; and (2) a 24 volt power supply cord was used with the unit during the general anesthesia of the
rabbit instead of the 12 volt power supply cord supplied by the manufacturer and the subsequent overvoltage likely
damaged components of the ventilator contributing to failure of the unit.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the program of veterinary care at research facilities should include the
availability of appropriate facilities and equipment to comply with the provision of adequate veterinary care to the
animals. The availability of appropriate equipment includes ensuring that any equipment required for the care and
use of the animals that are used in approved research activities is functioning properly, personnel are familiar with
the proper use and maintenance of the equipment, and the equipment is maintained and serviced according to the
manufacturer's recommendations to ensure that the equipment operates reliably and as expected.
The IACUC acted to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and USDA,
and implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions included but
were not limited to requiring the performance of and documentation of all routine preventative maintenance of
equipment as per manufacturer'(cid:25)s recommendations as well as the review of that documentation by the IACUC
during every semi-annual facility inspection, tethering the power supply cord that comes with all equipment to each
piece of equipment, and providing all veterinary technical staff with additional training on the proper use and
maintenance of the new ventilator unit.
This item has been corrected.
3.31(a)(2)
SANITATION.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
1. It was noted during the inspection that most of the corn cob bedding material inside the solid floor primary
enclosure of GP #98 was very wet and there was a minimal amount of dry bedding material present compared to
the other 3 primary enclosures in the room that each contained one GP. In addition the enclosure for GP #98 had a
strong ammonia odor and an excessive amount of fecal material compared to the 3 other GP primary enclosures. The skin of the caudal aspect of the hock and metatarsal area of both rear legs of GP #98 was a deeper shade of
pink compared to the skin of the other 3 GPs but there were not any clinical problems noted in the animal.
Per this Section of the Regulations, GPs should be transferred to a clean enclosure whenever their primary
enclosure become wet or soiled to a degree that might be uncomfortable or harmful to the health of the animal.
Although this item was immediately corrected by facility personnel during the inspection by transferring GP #98 to a
clean enclosure, the Registrant needs to ensure that facility personnel monitor the conditions of and change GP
enclosures on a schedule that prevents the enclosures from becoming excessively soiled or wet.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 4/22/15 and 4/23/15. Exit interview held 4/23/15 on-site with facility representatives.
