2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Although the facility has records of temperature, humidity, feed and water checks, the records were unclear on
documentation of daily observations of the birds housed at the facility. APHIS Animal Care inspectors observed
health issues during the inspection which were not documented nor conveyed to the Attending Veterinarian (AV).
Additionally, in some instances, heath issues were documented but not conveyed to the AV. Failure to adequately
observe animals on a daily basis and failure to communicate promptly with the attending veterinarian may be
detrimental to the health of the animals and cause unnecessary pain and distress. Daily observation of all the
animals to assess their well-being and direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding
health issues is necessary to ensure that the animals receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A more detailed
system should be in place to ensure that all animals are observed daily and the attending veterinarian is notified
when necessary.
To be corrected from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
