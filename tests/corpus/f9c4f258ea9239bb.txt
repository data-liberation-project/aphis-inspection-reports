Handling of animals.
***On the morning of December 10th, 2020, an adult female reticulated giraffe was found dead in the giraffe enclosure
after experiencing exposure to extremely cold temperatures over the preceding weeks.
A necropsy determined the cause of death was severe parasitism by intestinal parasites, causing blood loss (anemia) and
protein loss (hypoproteinemia). The giraffe was known to have intestinal parasites and was dewormed in accordance with
instructions from the Attending Veterinarian.
From mid-November to mid-December 2020, the giraffe barn was renovated. The giraffes were able to move in and out of
the barn during the day while construction was ongoing, and were let out after the day's construction was finished. During
the last few days of November, outdoor temperatures consisted of lows in the 30F’s and highs in the 50F’s. Temperature
within the barn was not recorded during November, but the animals were observed in the barn huddled in the corner
where the heater was located. During the first week of December, outdoor temperatures consisting of lows in the 20F’s,
30F’s, and 40F's and highs in the 50F’s. Temperature measurements from within the giraffe barn included 42F, 40F and
35F on the morning of December 2nd. Additional readings that week showed temperatures in the 40F’s and 50F’s inside
the barn.
The weather in the weeks leading up to the giraffe death was cold. The giraffe barn did not provide adequate heat for the


local climatic conditions, especially before a barn door was installed. Exposure to cold temperatures is uncomfortable and
may impair a giraffe’s immune system leading to sickness or death. Animals suffering from anemia are particularly
vulnerable to the effects of cold weather exposure. The impact of cold temperatures on animal health may not be
immediately apparent and can have a delayed onset. The attending veterinarian concurs that the cold exposure may have
contributed to the death of the female giraffe.
At the time of this inspection, the giraffe barn had a door that closed and the temperature within the barn was being
maintained in the upper 50F’s and low 60F’s.
Correct by 01/29/2021, by continuing to provide heat and shelter for the giraffes that is adequate for local climatic
conditions and to protect the animals from discomfort, and continuing to monitor temperatures within the barn to ensure
adequate heat.

***On November 17th, 2020, an adult female red river hog (“Stinky”) was found “non-responsive and seizing” in the
outdoor enclosure and was brought inside the feed shed and provided with warmth and medical treatment. After
recovering, she was moved back outside and placed in an enclosure by herself, with a shelter and heat lamp. On
November 25th, 2020, “Stinky” was found to be “non-active, convulsing, cold” in the outdoor enclosure and was brought
inside the feed shed, where she was given medical treatment and warmth. “Stinky” has been kept indoors since that time
and has gained weight and is doing well, and facility management believes that the episodes described above were
caused by exposure to cold weather.
On November 30th, 2020, a second female red river hog who was housed with the male in the outdoor enclosure was
found to be cold and “nonresponse” with “very slight reflex” and was brought inside the feed shed, provided with heat and
shelter, and treated with medications. The hog died 90 minutes after being discovered. Facility management stated that


the cause of death was hypothermia, because the weather the night before had been very cold. A necropsy was not
performed. The Attending Veterinarian confirmed that the cause of death was likely hypothermia.
Facility management indicated that the cold weather seemed to negatively impact the female hogs. The outdoor
temperatures during the end of November included lows in the 30F’s and highs in the 50F’s.
Animals who do not have adequate shelter during cold climatic conditions may suffer from hypothermia, discomfort, and
frostbite. At the time of this inspection, “Stinky” was housed alone in an indoor enclosure with adequate heat and shelter.
The male remained outside, and a heat lamp was added to his shelter when temperatures were expected to be below
40F.
Correct by 01/29/2021, by continuing to provide animals with adequate shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions,
to afford them protection from the elements and to prevent discomfort.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On January 11th, 2021, an adult female zebra was injured in the right shoulder in the main safari park pasture. Facility
management stated that the injury could have been caused by a bison, because both animals have been observed
feeding in the same area. Facility management stated that the injury could also have been caused by something else
such as a stick. The injury was a puncture wound in the muscle approximately 1-2 inches in diameter. The zebra received
prompt medical attention from the attending veterinarian and is recovering.
Animals who are injured may suffer from pain, discomfort, or infection. At the time of this inspection, the zebra was still in
the main pasture with the general population of hoofstock, which includes the bison and natural areas with trees and
sticks.
Correct by 02/01/2021, by handling animals in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and the attending veterinarian.
