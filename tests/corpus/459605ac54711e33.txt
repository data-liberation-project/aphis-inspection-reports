SANITATION.
Wet, compressed, and soiled litter covered 1/3 to 1/2 of the floors of 7 out of 8 enclosures of guinea pigs. Guinea
pigs' abdomens were noted to be stained and feet were reddened. No evidence of skin breaches or infection were
noted. Wet, soiled litter can result in foot and respiratory infections which compromises the health of the animals.
Per this section, primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of
excreta or debris. Correct by September 14, 2016.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Nineteen gerbils were housed in one enclosure measuring 15 x 12 inches. Eight gerbils were housed in one
enclosure measuring 18 x 9 inches. The remaining 13 gerbil enclosures provided adequate space. Overcrowding of
animals prohibits normal postural and social adjustments and can lead to poor health and increased mortality.
