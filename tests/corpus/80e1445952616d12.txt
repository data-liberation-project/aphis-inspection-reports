ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several guinea pigs were identified during inspection which required veterinary attention:
Many of the guinea pigs in pen I(7) had skin lesions of varying degrees. The signs ranged from thinning haircoat, to
patches of alopecia, with or without scaly, crusty skin. One white adult guinea pig has diffuse hairloss with several
circular crusts of skin over her back and sides. Several juvenile guinea pigs have patchy hairloss with heavy
plaques of crusting skin over their hindquarters.
One red/brown and white adult guinea pig has a large mass under her chin in the neck region. The mass is the size
of a large egg, is asymmetrically shaped, and drags the ground between her front legs.
One reddish brown and white adult guinea pig has moist right eye. An opaque discharge is accumulated in and
around the right eye. The lids appear slightly swollen and moderately drooped.
One red/brown and white guinea pig has discharge accumulated around its nostrils and left eye. There is a ring of
brownish material encircling each nostril. The left eye has an opaque, light green fluid accumulated in the corner of
the left eye. The lids appear swollen and droopy.
A red with white adult guinea pig has a mild left head tilt and material crusted in and around its left eye. The lids of
the left eye appear thick and bumpy with material accumulated in the corner.
A white and black adult guinea pig is thin and breathing heavy. The guinea pigs sides move forcefully and abruptly
with each breath. Though the guinea pig initially appeared reluctant to move, with observation it seemed the guinea
pig became restless: scratching, licking, or repeatedly drinking., unable to settle.
A red with white adult guinea pig has a left rear leg lameness. The left rear leg is bent out behind the guinea pig at
an odd angle. When walking, the guinea pig can move this leg, but never brings it up under its body.
A white, red, and black adolescent guinea pig has fresh blood on its face. The left ear is torn and ragged. There isboth dried, crusted blood and fresh blood present on the left ear.
These guinea pigs require medical attention for their health and well being. Licensee must use appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. These animals must be examined by a
licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and
plan shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In addition to the more than 10 animals cited above, two guinea pigs have smooth masses under their chin on their
necks. One brown and white adult, and one red, brown, and white adult. Both masses are the size of a small
walnut. The written program of veterinary care states animals with this condition may be observed, but no record of
observation for these guinea pigs is available. Nor are treatment or observation records available for the guinea
pigs previously listed. The conditions were not observed or reported to a veterinarian prior to inspection. When
health problems go unnoticed, animals may suffer needlessly, especially if their condition worsens. Each dealer or
exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observation of all
animals to assess their health and well-being. Timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,
behavior, and well-being shall be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so appropriate treatment may be initiated.
Licensee shall establish a method for accurate identification and documentation of health concerns in all animals on
a daily basis.

SANITATION.
There is a strong smell of ammonia in the guinea pig housing area. Though the enclosures are cleaned weekly and
due to be cleaned today, many of the guinea pig enclosures are too dirty. Wet, soiled bedding and excreta have
accumulated on the floors such that the animals cannot avoid these areas. Commonly, the heavily soiled floor
areas are in corners where the guinea pigs like to congregate, and/or are near the food and water receptacles.
Along the back wall under the wire mesh of some enclosures is a heavy build up of brown material. It may also be
present on the sides near the water receptacles, both inside and outside. Accumulated organic material harbors
disease hazards that pose a health risk to the animals. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris. Licensee shall develop and implement a
cleaning/sanitization schedule such that the guinea pig enclosures remain clean and dry.Correct by: April 7, 2016
