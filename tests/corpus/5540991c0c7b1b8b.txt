ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 7:50 a.m.-8:30
a.m. on 07/13/2016.
The facility cannot be accessed because of a locked gate. Upon arrival to the facility a message was left on the
licensee's phone number of record. A second attempt at phone communication was made while waiting at the
facility gate, no message could be left because the mailbox was full. Contact was made in person with an unknown
individual on the other side of the gate who stated they could not notify the licensee of the requested inspection.
The licensee has declined to provide optimal hours for inspection but sent an email to this inspector stating they
could be available on this day until 11 a.m.
