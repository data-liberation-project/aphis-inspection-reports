3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some metal cages had rusted bolts and the frame square tubes that came in contact with the floor also had rust
which stain the floor.
The surfaces of housing facilities must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization.
In order to properly clean and sanitize the housing facilities surfaces must be free of rust.
The facility started to correct this issue by painting the floors and procuring new housing cages and it should be
corrected by August 31, 2016.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
