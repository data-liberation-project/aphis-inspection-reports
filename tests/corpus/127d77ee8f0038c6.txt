3.6(b)(1)(2)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* There were three cats (Chowder, Schmidt, and Dinah) housed in enclosures that only provided 3.7 square feet of
floor space, excluding the space taken up by their food and water bowls. The enclosures were 22x28 square inches
and the food/water bowls took up 13x6 square inches. According to records of weekly weigh-ins, each of those
three cats weighed over 9 pounds. Although the cats are able to exercise outside of their enclosures at least twice
daily, they still need to have the minimum required floor space in their enclosures for their health and well-being.
** The registrant must ensure that all cats weighing over 8.8 pounds are provided with at least 4.0 square feet of
floor space, exclusive of any food or water pans.
*** This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
