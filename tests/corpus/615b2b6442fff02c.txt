2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A gray and white female cat named "Angel" in the feline ward was noted frequently scratching at her face and ears.
Upon examination, the cat had a mild to moderate amount of black debris in the ear canals, mostly concentrated in
the right ear. There was no sign of infection or skin irritation. When questioned about this cat, facility
representatives had not noticed the scratching or any other problems. The facility veterinarian makes monthly
rounds, and there has not been any problem with this cat noted on the last several veterinary visits.
Scratching, pawing, and rubbing at the face and ears is an indication of some type of underlying problem. The
facility must observe each animal on a daily basis, and must be able to distinguish routine grooming behaviors
versus "abnormal" behaviors. When problems are identified by the faciity, there must be rapid and direct
communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment of the affected animal. The
facility must maintain documentation of veterinary consultation, and must be able to provide that documentation to
inspectors as requested.
The attending veterinarian must be consulted about "Angel" and appropriate diagnostics/treatment initiated within 7
days of this inspection.
Correct: From this point forward
Inspection and exit interview conducted by Michael Tygart (VMO) and Debbie Cunningham (VMO) with facility
representatives.
