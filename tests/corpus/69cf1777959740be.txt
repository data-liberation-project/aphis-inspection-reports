2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** The facility needs to complete the records of animals on hand to account for the dogs currently held at the
facility. These records also need to identify dates of when adult dogs leave the facility.
*** The current records of disposition for the puppies being sold do not include the puppy identification number. In
addition, a few disposition records do not have the dates of sale listed. These forms need to be completely filled out
to track the movement of dogs sold
Both these items are an important part of the license requirement and assures good record keeping practices.

FEEDING.
*** A ten week old pug puppy was very thin with pronounced hips and ribs visible. The puppy was being fed adult
dog food with a larger size kibble. Although the food was wet to assist the puppy, the puppy seemed to have
difficulty eating the food. Puppy's should be given a food formulated for puppies so that it is appropriate for their age
and meets the nutritional requirements of their growing bodies. This needs to be corrected for the health of the
puppies.

FEEDING.
*** A few of the food and water receptacles for the puppies were small white enamel pots. The white enamel has
come off in several areas of the pots exposing metal areas that are now rusting from water. These pots can nolonger be effectively cleaned and sanitized and need to be replaced. This needs to be addressed for the health of
the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The area just outside the back wall of the kennel needs to be addressed. There are excess pieces of wood and
metal siding from facility repair discarded on the ground. The area around the building needs to be kept clean to
reduce living areas for pests in spring and summer months and to promote good housekeeping practices.
