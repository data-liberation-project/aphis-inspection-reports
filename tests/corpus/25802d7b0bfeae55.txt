3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the indoor portion of one sheltered facility, there was a gate to an enclosure that had a lock missing a screw
which made the lock loose. This enclosure contained a male and female English Bulldog. Puppies were being
housed in the next enclosure behind a fence that was short enough that adult dogs could enter the enclosure.
Faulty locking mechanisms to gates can lead to escape and possible injury to other animals. The licensee must
repair this locking mechanism and assure that all enclosures are constructed to contain the animals as required.
To be corrected by January 20, 2017.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There were two plastic type self feeders that had areas that had been chewed by the dogs enough to prevent
proper cleaning. In the indoor portion of one of the sheltered facilities, there was a large piece of carpet that had
been chewed and torn to the point that the strings were shredded. Chew edges and shredded material cannot be
properly sanitized and can create a potential hazard that could injure the animals. The licensee must repair and
clean or replace the feeders and remove the shredded carpet from these enclosures and assure that all surfaces
are maintained or replaced as required.
The carpet removal is to be corrected today, January 19, 2017.
Feeders to be corrected by January 21, 2017.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the sheltered facilities, the hinged doors and trim around the doors had dirt and grime on them. The facility
representative stated that this was due to the recent ice storm which occurred over the past weekend (January
13-14, 2017). In one of the sheltered buildings there was an accumulation of gravel, dust and torn carpet pieces
along the bottom of the chain link gate. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential for a healthy environment and
reduces disease hazards by eliminating harboring places for diseases and pests. The licensee must remove the
dust, torn carpet, dirt and grime from these areas and make sure that all hard surfaces are cleaned and sanitized asrequired.
To be corrected by January 26, 2017.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In a portion of the outdoor facility, there were four enclosures. The two middle enclosures contained four small
breed dogs. These enclosure floors were constructed of gravel. The two enclosures containing the dogs had straw
throughout the enclosure and the enclosures were completely wet and muddy, as were the four dogs. Extensive
periods of being wet can increase the risks of health issues and disease hazards for the dogs during periods of cold
weather. The licensee must remove the dogs from these enclosures until the wet enclosures can be properly
drained and cleaned and assure that enclosures are kept in a manner that allows the dogs to stay dry and clean.
Corrected by: Dogs to be moved to empty enclosures today, January 19, 2017.
***In the outdoor facility in one enclosure containing two adult Boxers there were numerous dead rodents observed
throughout the enclosure. Pests carry diseases which increases the risks of contamination to the dogs, water and
food supply. Although the licensee removed theses rodents during the inspection, measures must be taken to
remove dead animals from the enclosures in a timely manner as required.
To be corrected from January 19, 2017 forward.
3.3(e)(1)(ii)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
***In the outdoor portion of one sheltered facility, on the south side of the building, there were wooden ramps being
used for the dogs to enter and exit the building. One of these ramps was wet approximately 2/3 from recent rains
and ice storm. The facility representative stated that these were sealed at the first of the year. Wet wooden surfaces
cannot be cleaned and sanitized and can harbor disease hazards that increase the health risks for the dogs. The
licensee must assure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs are impervious to moisture.
To be corrected by January 26, 2017.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***In a portion of the outdoor facility, approximately eight adult Boxers and four adult Basset Hounds were being
housed. Plastic type shelters were being used which contained sparse to no bedding. High temperatures for the
past two days have been in the mid 40's and lows have been in the mid 30's according to the National Weather
Service. There was one bale of straw stored in the bedding storage area. Lack of appropriate bedding in cold
environments increases the risks of illness and hypothermic situations to the animals. The licensee must apply
sufficient bedding to these shelters and assure that all outdoor housed dogs are supplied with bedding as required.To be corrected from today, January 19, 2017 forward.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the outdoor housing facility and the outdoor portions of the sheltered facilities, there were at least five
enclosures that contained ten or more piles of feces. Each of these enclosures contained one or two dogs. The
facility representative stated that the enclosures had not been cleaned the previous day. Accumulations of waste
products increase the risk of disease by attracting pests and providing an unhealthy environment for the animals.
The licensee must assure that waste materials are removed from the enclosures daily as required.
To be corrected from January 19, 2017 forward.
