2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The medical record of dog #4386 contained documentation of the administration of injectable anesthetics and an
injectable antibiotic. The entry was not dated and did not include a corresponding diagnosis, procedure or
explanation for the use of these pharmaceuticals.
Missing and incomplete documentation of procedures or treatments does not meet an acceptable standard for
record-keeping or demonstration of an adequate program of veterinary care. Appropriate documentation should
accompany any treatment for the prevention, diagnosis or control of injury or illness.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted on April 15, 2014 with the Vice President.
