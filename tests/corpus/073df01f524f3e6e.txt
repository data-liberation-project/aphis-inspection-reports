ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog #224, a female golden retriever was noticed to have puncture wounds on the left shoulder and face area. The
area appeared to have been shaved and cleaned recently. However, the wounds were not fully healed and there
was an odor present indicating possible infection. The Licensee stated that this dog had recently been in a fight
about two weeks ago. He informed inspectors that he had called the Attending Veterinarian(cid:25)s clinic and was advised
to treat the animal with Amoxicillin. There was no documentation of the injury or written treatment plan at the facility
at the time of inspection. The inspectors were able to make contact with the individual from the clinic that
prescribed the treatment. Inspectors were informed that the treatment advised for this dog was Cephalexin 2 times
a day, as well as a topical treatment at least once a day. This treatment was to be provided to this dog for one
week. If the wounds were not healed or the injury worsened, the Licensee was instructed to have the dog examined
by the clinic. Although the Licensee has been treating this animal with Amoxicillin for over one week, the issue is
not resolved and the Licensee has not had this dog examined by a Licensed Veterinarian. Failure to follow the
guidance by the Attending veterinarian can result in prolonged illness or injury that could be prevented with
appropriate treatment. The attending veterinarian must have the authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinarian care for the facility.
Correct from this day forward.

Dog #105 a female Yorkie was noticed with several areas of hair loss and skin swelling on the back and shoulders,
and an ulcerated and swollen area on the left front foot. The licensee stated that this animal has had ongoing
issues with skin problems that were previously documented by the attending veterinarian; however, the licensee
could not provide any record of this dog having its skin condition diagnosed or any treatment plan documented.
When inspectors contacted the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s office for more information, there was no medical record for
this dog having been diagnosed for skin issues or any treatment advised. This animal must be examined by a
licensed veterinarian and documentation must be kept recording the diagnosis, treatment, and any other ongoing
problems associated with this condition for inspectors to review in the future.Dog #224, a female golden retriever, has continuing need of veterinary care as a result of a dog fight. The licensee
has been providing treatment, but the antibiotic is different from that advised, and treatment has continued longer
than initially recommended before having the dog examined by a veterinarian. This animal appears to have
unresolved infection, given the appearance and odor of the wounds. This dog must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian and documentation must be kept recording the diagnosis, treatment, and any other ongoing problems
associated with this condition for inspectors to review in the future.
Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to ensure provision
of adequate veterinary care.

Licensed veterinarian and treated as directed.

of the dogs' conditions. However; there was no documentation of ongoing treatment and these issues have not
been resolved. There has been a clear lack of communication with the attending veterinarian regarding the duration
and method of treatment for the conditions of these dogs. Correct by ensuring that there is a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on animal health are conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.
