INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A rabbit study conducted under protocol #2 lists a procedure conducted on the study that is not completely
described in the protocol. Also rabbits on this protocol have received refinements to pain relief measures. These
new measures are not described in the protocol. The IACUC is not aware of these changes. The IACUC must
have this information in order to determine that the animals are being used and treated in a humane manner.
Update protocol #2 to reflect the changes.
