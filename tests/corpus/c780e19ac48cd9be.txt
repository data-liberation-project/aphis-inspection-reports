3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
*** The facility acquired a short-tailed opossum on Oct 15, 2021 and housed the animal in an enclosure that it was able to
escape from on Nov 6, 2021. The animal was never recovered. Enclosures housing animals must contain the animals for
their safety and welfare. This needs to be addressed for future acquisitions of this small type of species.

*** The wallaby became lethargic and ill and was seen by an emergency veterinarian on Feb 15, 2022 and subsequently
died that evening. The attending veterinarian conducted a necropsy and found a blue cloth like material impacting the
stomach that had been consumed by the animal. Items that are put into the enclosure for enrichment purposes like
blankets or stuffed animals must be appropriate for the species, kept in good repair and monitored for the safety of the
animal. This needs to be addressed with all enrichment items given to animals at the facility.
