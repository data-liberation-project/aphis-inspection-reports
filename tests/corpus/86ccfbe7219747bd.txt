ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult white male poodle microchip number 054338828 has dental problems. The lower molars on both sides of
the mouth have a brownish hardened material covering the whole outer surface. The lower gum line on both sides
appears reddened and swollen, and has a creamy white discharge at the base of the molars. This dog had a dental
cleaning less than six months ago, and documentation was provided. However, this dog may need to be evaluated
more often due to the condition of his mouth so soon after a recent cleaning.
Dental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, lead to lead to the development of other health problems,
and can affect the well-being of the animal.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and provide the
inspector the documentation of this visit upon request.
To be corrected by December 5, 2014.
The inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
