2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Several animals had medical conditions that needed veterinary care. An adult, male Egyptian Mau named
Jasper (#27) had an area on the left side of his head about 1 inch in diameter that was missing all of its hair and had
reddened skin. A 5-week-old female Egyptian Mau had a thick, gray discharge in both eyes, had a watery
discharge from the nose, and was sneezing. An 8-week-old male Egyptian Mau had a thick, gray discharge in both
eyes and a watery discharge from the nose. A litter of five 10-day-old Russian Blue kittens had a thick, gray
discharge coming from their eyes as well as dried, crusted discharge around their eyes. The licensee had not
noticed any of these conditions and none of the animals were being treated. Untreated veterinary conditions can be
painful, can worsen, and can be contagious to other animals. The licensee must have the 5-week-old and
8-week-old kittens examined and diagnosed by a veterinarian, must follow treatment recommendations, and must
provide written records of treatment upon request by the inspector. The licensee must consult the veterinarian
about whether or not to bring the 10-day-old kittens in for examination.
****A bottle of Pyrantel pamoate had an expiration date of March, 2016. Expired medications or vaccines can lose
their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all
medications and vaccines are within their expiration dates at all times.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 7, 2016.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and with a Student Intern.
