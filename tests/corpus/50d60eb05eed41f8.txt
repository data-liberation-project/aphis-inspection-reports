for the health and well-being of the animals.

ends.
** In the enclosure containing a cow the fences top strand is constructed of barbed wire in which the animals have
direct contact.
** There were several strands of orange hay bale twine on the ground within the front goat enclosure that could
possibly be ingested.
** In the upper pen containing 2 goats and 5 sheep there were several areas of the primary fence that the top two
strands were constructed of barbed wire. To the far left corner of the fencing there was a strand of barbed wire
haphazardly strung around the top the fencing to tie the loose end in which the animals can have direct contact.
All of the enclosures should be constructed to prevent injury of the animals including the materials used for thefencing and keeping it in good repair.
