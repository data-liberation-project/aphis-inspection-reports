Item Veterinary Care 2.33 b 5
At the time of inspection protocol 404982 was reviewed it involves a spinal cord study with sheep. On July 25 2014
a sheep underwent a procedure. The medical records indicate the sheep was not standing yet at 3:30 PM and gave
notice to the vet about the problem. In speaking to the veterinarian he indicated he had been in communication with
the investigator but there is no indication as to what if any course of action the vet mandated during the weekend..
The investigator records showed the animal was looked at, but any communication between the vet and the
Investigator lab was not documented to insure care of the animals.
Communication between the veterinarian and investigators and staff need to be documented so as to insure clear
and correct guidelines are followed for the well being of the animal.
