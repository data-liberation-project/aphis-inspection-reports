3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The enclosure housing bats has an excessive accumulation of food material and excreta splattered on the
Plexiglass wall and door separating the bat room from the anteroom.
An excessive accumulation of food waste and excreta can attract pests, create odors, harbor pathogens and play a
role in disease transmission.
Primary enclosures shall be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained
therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
Facility staff cleaned the Plexiglass door and wall after the APHIS inspector pointed out the problem.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Animal Research Facility Manager.
