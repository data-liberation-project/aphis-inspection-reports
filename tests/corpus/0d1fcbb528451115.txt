2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC conducted facility inspections on February 23, 2018, and a completed semiannual report was sent to
the Institutional Official (IO). However, this report did not contain signatures from a majority of the IACUC members.
Reports submitted to the IO must be reviewed by the IACUC members and their signatures confirm agreement with
the report and it's findings. Failure to include the IACUC members signatures can lead to a minority view being
omitted or inaccuracies in the report itself, which can lead to deficiencies in the facility's program for humane care
and use of animals.
Correct by having the semiannual reports reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
