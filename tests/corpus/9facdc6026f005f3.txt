It was determined that 180 goats were housed in a manner that did not protect them from the cold weather. The
goats were housed in two pastures that were connected to a barn. The stalls inside the barn had no bedding and
did not provide a wind-break for the animals. According to the owner the reason for the lack of bedding was due to
cleaning the night before and that bedding was going to be put in that day. There was a tarp in one of the stalls but
it did not adequately provide a windbreak and was only available to half of the animals. The majority of the goats
were observed huddled together and shivering. Numerous goats had varying degrees of nasal discharge. According
to the temperature gun, it was 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit inside the barn with a light wind. Snow covered the pasture.
Animals need to be housed in a manner to prevent discomfort and stress. Cold stress severely decreases the
immune system of goats and can contribute to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Correct by ensuring the
goats are housed in a manner to prevent discomfort. The owner says there will be an effective wind-break put in
place that all animals will have access to later that day. Bedding was provided to the goats at the time of inspection.
Continue to monitor the goats for cold stress and provide an effective means that prevents the discomfort of the
animals. Corrected at time of exit.
This is a focus inspection of the direct non-compliances.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and multiple representatives of the facility.
