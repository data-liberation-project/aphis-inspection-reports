ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15pm on
23-Aug-18.
On August 23, 2018 at approximately 1:15pm, myself and Dr. Neafsey arrived at the address indicated by the
licensee as their site of operations. When we entered the property we were informed by a truck driver on the
property that the licensee’s residence had been demolished and the licensee had left. The driver was unable to
provide any additional details. A quick survey of the area did not indicate that any animals were present or could
reside at that address (no fencing, barns or other facilities necessary to maintain animals on the property). The
phone number provided by the licensee was disconnected. We then left the property. A conversation with the
facility's assigned inspector indicated that the licensee may have left the country indefinitely but the licensee had not
formally notified either the Regional Office or his inspector of his intent to relocate or discontinue his license.
