***Five hamsters are housed in the pole barn structure in aquarium type enclosures. This structure is not a
temperature controlled structure. Hamsters are not to be housed in outdoor enclosures in which humidity and
temperature can reasonably be expected to be maintained in a range that does not create health risks and
discomfort for this species. These hamsters must be removed from this structure and housed in an indoor
temperature controlled setting for exhibition. To be corrected by: 07/13/16

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two enclosures on the east side of the barn do not have adequate shade in place. One enclosure, housing two
yaks, has had a shade structure in place but the fabric of the shelter has been dismantled due to high winds per the
owner. This shelter is not creating an adequate amount of shade for this enclosure. The other enclosure, housing
two dromedary camels, does not have any shade structures in place. The enclosure housing five zebras on the
north hillside had a shade structure in place but due to high winds the fabric of the shelter is missing. Adequate
shade is also missing from this enclosure. All enclosures must have adequate shade structures, either natural or
artificial, to protect the animals from overheating or discomfort from prolonged exposure to the sunlight.
