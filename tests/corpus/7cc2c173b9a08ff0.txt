PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(c) Additional requirements for dogs--(1) Space. (iii)
***There were three primary enclosures individually housing adult dogs (Burnese Mountain Dog, Labrador Retriever
and a Golden Retriever x Labrador Retriever) that had less than six inches of space above the heads of the dogs
while in a normal standing position. Enclosures that do not provide the appropriate amount of head space can limit
the normal activity of the animals. The registrant must ensure that the interior height of all primary enclosures is at
least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position at all
times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: January 28, 2015.
The inspection was conducted on January 6-7, 2015 with facility representatives. The exit interview was conducted
