FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two metal pipe fence panels around the cottonwood tree in the camel outdoor enclosure. Along the top of
these two fence panels there is an additional layer of metal wire fencing. Several protruding metal wires were noted
on these panels which could injure the camel housed in this enclosure. Outdoor housing facilities must be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by: May 6,
2016.
