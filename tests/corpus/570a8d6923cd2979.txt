***In the French Bulldog housing facility, the corners of the wall had thick cobwebs. The C purlin in the middle of the
wall created a ledge that contained dirt and debris. There were bird droppings on the top railings of the chainlink
gates. In the English Bulldog hoop barn, there were thick cobwebs on the outdoor portion of the sheltered building.
There was also dark oily buildup on the doors, doorways and walls. The outdoor portion of the facility contained
plastic type housing units that were dusty and had areas of oily buildups on them. Accumulations of waste products
such as fecal droppings, dust, dirt and cobwebs attract pests, insects and vermin which increase the risk of disease
to the animals. The licensee must clean these areas housing facility and assure that all surfaces are cleaned as
required.
To be corrected by October 28, 2014.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
