WATERING.
Approximately 6 individually housed rabbits had water dishes and water bottles that were empty. When water was
provided, at least 3 rabbits were observed to immediately begin drinking and drink continuously for an extended
period of time. A grey lop-eared rabbit was observed to drink continuously from a metal dish for 3.5 minutes before
stopping. A grey and tan lop-eared rabbit was observed drinking continuously from a glass bowl for 3 minutes
before stopping. A black lion head rabbit was observed continuously drinking from a water bottle for approximately 1
minute before stopping.
Rabbits without access to potable water may become dehydrated and may develop health problems such as
intestinal obstructions. Rabbits require water for normal digestion and physiologic functioning.
Correct by providing potable water at least daily or more frequently as needed given the age, health status, and
weather conditions facing the rabbits. Correct from this day forth.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is no enrichment plan for non human primates. The facility has 4 ring-tailed lemurs (one singly housed) and a
marmoset (also singly housed).
Nonhuman primates have complex social, behavioral, and environmental needs which must be met in order to
support their psychological well being and overall health. Nonhuman primates who are singly housed require
special attention to meet their social needs and prevent isolation, stress, and the development of stereotypical
behaviors.
A blank copy of an optional environmental enrichment template was previously provided to the licensee. Correct by
creating an environmental enrichment plan in concert with the attending veterinarian. Correct by January 11, 2019.
3.125(a) CRITICALFACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the night of October 12th, 2019 six kangaroos were housed in a stall in the main barn overnight due to inclement
weather. One adult female kangaroo escaped from the stall in the barn, exited the barn and left the premises. The
kangaroo has not been recovered at this time.
The stall in the barn was a standard horse stall with wooden sides, located in the corner of the barn, and the
licensee had placed an additional panel over the stall door to increase the height of the door. The side wall of the
stall was approximately 5 feet tall. The main barn does not have a door, and there is no fence between the barn and
the road, thus the animal was able to escape from the premises after getting out of the stall.
Animals that escape may suffer from lack of food and water, exposure to harsh weather, and injury from cars or wild
animals. Animals that escape may also be a danger to the public.
Correct by housing animals in enclosures that are strong and secure enough to contain the animals within and
prevent animal escape. At the time of this inspection, the remaining kangaroos were being housed in a
species-appropriate enclosure.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Five kangaroos and a wallaby are housed in an outdoor enclosure which is constructed of 7 foot tall chain link
fence. The kangaroo/wallaby enclosure is within a pasture which is enclosed in a farm fence of variable height and
materials (some sections less than 6 feet tall).
A perimeter fence is required to prevent unauthorized persons and animals from entering the exotic animal
enclosure, as unauthorized persons and animals may harm or steal exotic animals. A perimeter fence is also
required to act as a secondary containment system in the event of an animal escape, as animals that escape may
suffer from lack of food and water, exposure to harsh weather, and injury from cars or wild animals. Animals that
escape may also be a danger to the public.
Correct by constructing a perimeter fence of sufficient strength and appropriate materials to contain the animals and
prevent entry of unauthorized people and animals, and that is at least 6 feet tall and set back at least 3 feet from the
primary enclosure housing the kangaroos and wallaby. Correct by June 1, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.Additional Inspectors
