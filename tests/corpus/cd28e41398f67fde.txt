2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection an elderly goat was found to be emaciated and weak. It had difficulty walking, and was
found in a secluded area, on a steep trail. The exhibitor was not aware of the goat's current condition at the time of
inspection, and had not contacted a veterinarian. The goat had been declining for some time, and the exhibitor had
been providing additional feed and care, but the veterinarian had not been specifically consulted regarding the
weight loss.
The exhibitor must ensure that all animals are observed every day, and that any problems or signs of decline are
reported to the attending veterinarian, so that appropriate diagnostics and care can be provided.
This goat must be evaluated by a veterinarian by the end of this day, and daily observation of all animals, with
appropriate follow-up, should be conducted from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
