One male Patagonian cavy was observed to have abraded skin on the bottom of his testicles. This animal was
housed on raised wire; this condition had not been noticed prior to inspection. The abraded area could not be fully
visualized as the animal was not readily handled. Need to capture animal safely, evaluate wound, and provide
veterinary care as needed. Animal should be housed on soft substrate until wound heals. Correct by May 28,
