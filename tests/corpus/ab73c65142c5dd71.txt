2.126(a) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Records were not available for examination at the time of inspection. Specifically:
Program of Veterinary Care, while premise visits by the veterinarian were documented with a recent visit, the written
program of veterinary care was not filled out and signed by the licensee and attending veterinarian.
Acquisition and disposition records are not maintained with all the required information under 2.75 b.
A system of recordkeeping must be in place and maintained to allow the inspectors to examine all the required
records.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 22 August, 2016.
