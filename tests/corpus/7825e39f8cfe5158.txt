2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are 5 Golden Retriever puppies 10 weeks of age that do not have any ID or cage card to identify the animals
in the facility. The licensee has had the dogs for 2 weeks and has not yet entered them on his inventory or identified
the animals according to AWA standards and regulations.
It is important to provide proper identification for all regulated animals as soon as possible in the facility and to have
updated records and inventory of all animals for proper management and health care records.
The licensee must provide either a tag, plastic-type collar, tattoo, microchip or cage card (up to 16wks of age) to
properly identify the regulated animals in the facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of the walls in the outside runs surrounding the flap doors in the primary enclosures have a
black/brown colored grime that has accumulated on the surface of the fiberglass. There is some buildup of brown
grime on the indoor sides of the door flaps and on several of the walls inside the primary enclosure. While the
facility and the enclosures are very clean and spot cleaned daily, there needs to be more scrubbing with a harder
brush done on the walls to remove the grime buildup in the heavy traffic areas around the doors and inner walls.
This buildup of grime prevents the enclosures from being properly sanitized after being cleaned.
A buildup of dirt or grime can hold bacteria and be a possible source of infection for the regulated animals.
The licensee must increase the scrubbing of the walls and doorways to prevent the buildup of oily grime and dirt on
the surfaces inside the enclosures.
