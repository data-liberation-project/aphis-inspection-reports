Facilities, general.
Several primary rabbit enclosures were rusted to the point that it affected the integrity of the wire and it was either warped
or broken. Multiple nest boxes that were in use had entry ways that were worn and chewed leaving sharp edges and
points. These sharp edges and points could cause injury to the animals using them. These cages and nest boxes must
be repaired/replaced to prevent animal injury.

3.56(d)

Sanitation.
There were excessive drain/fruit flies in the animal housing portion of the facility. There was evidence of some fly control
measures but it is not enough to control the amount of flies’ present. Flies can be vectors of diseases which can impact
the overall health of the animals in this barrier facility. A more effective program of pest control must be implemented to
address the flies.
