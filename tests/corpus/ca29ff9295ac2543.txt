Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Over the course of the inspection, approximately 10 deceased sugar gliders were observed in enclosures throughout the
facility grounds that were in varying stages of advanced decomposition ranging from recent, to dried out husks, to
noticeable skeletons. In each case, the employee accompanying the inspector had been previously unaware that the
animal had perished. In some cases, rooms in which were inspected were told to have only been cleaned and sanitized
once every three weeks, the advanced decomposing bodies, along with the buildup of feces, food, hair and other debris
prove that daily observations are not being conducted. Without proper daily observation to assess the animals there is no
effective way to gauge the health and well being of the animals. There is no effective way to treat or assess a sick or
injured animal in a timely manner, and there is no effective way to communicate in a timely manner any issues that may
arise to the attending veterinarian. Beginning immediately, daily observation of all animals throughout the facility and
direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian must begin. By end of business day on 2.11.2022, a
veterinarian must assess and begin treatment of the animals within the facility and provide a statement on the overall
safety, health, and care of the animals.

Sanitation.

During the course of the inspection, an overall and severe lack of sanitation was witnessed. The sugar gliders are
provided food in small bowls. These animals often rake the food out, which collects in a tray under the cage, along with
animal excreta. In most cases, the trays were full to overflowing with food, something that would take days or weeks to
accumulate considering the small amount of food the animals require on a daily basis. Excreta and hair were observed
collected and caught through the wire floors of most cages, and a dried brown mushy substance which had the
appearance of dried fecal material was present on the tops of a majority of the nesting structures inside the cages which
are round capped pieces of pvc pipe, approximately 4-5 inches round. Pests and rodents were present and feeding off of
the excreta and food waste. The overall smell of waste throughout the enclosed facility rooms was very pungent and
overwhelming causing discomfort to the inspector. The odor was still present on the inspector and his clothes even after
several hours after the inspection. The employee accompanying the inspector informed him that due to a lack of
employees, some of the rooms are only cleaned as often as once every three weeks. Inadequate sanitation poses a
direct health and safety hazard not only to the animals, but to employees as well. The atmosphere itself can become
dangerous and can cause serious respiratory problems or death. Animals that are subjected to soiled enclosures, and
food can become destressed, or sick. By close of business on 2.11.2022, all animals at the facility must be provided
access to a clean and sanitary portion of their individual enclosure. By 2.16.2022, all enclosures and rooms must be
adequately cleaned and sanitized and a proper sanitation program must be maintained from this point on.

Sanitation.
Throughout the facility grounds, inside the individual animal rooms, inside the washout trench tubes and inside both
empty and occupied enclosures, there were an insects, small black worms, and mice observed in an amount which was
too numerous to count. Mice were observed inside a hole in the wall in one room. An uncalculatable amount of bugs
appearing to be small roaches were inside the trays underneath the sugar glider cages. In some instances, many insects

were seen inside occupied cages with the gliders. Insects were also observed in many food bowls which can and will
contaminate the animals food source. One cage that contained the carcass of a sugar glider also contained a live mouse
directly under the carcass. Several deceased insects and mice were observed in varying stages of decomposition
indicating that this is a chronic and ongoing problem. The employee stated that boric acid is sprinkled in corners and
against walls and that the buildings are very old and the issue has been ongoing. Without adequate pest control, the
animals within the facility are in severe risk of being exposed to disease, and parasites. Sugar gliders are at risk to being
injured or killed by rodents or large numbers of insects. Food and enclosures are become contaminated. By close of
business on 2.11.2022, a more effective pest and parasite control plan must be established and implemented. A
statement of this plan must be provided to the inspector.

Employees.
During the inspection of the facility several significant noncompliant items directly affecting the health and safety of the
animals housed within were observed. After speaking with the licensees and two employees of the facility it was learned
that the licensee has had difficulty finding employees to work at the facility. In some cases, rooms in which were
inspected were told to have only been cleaned and sanitized once every three weeks. The amount of animals at the
facility cannot be properly and adequately taken care of with the amount of employees available. The facility must have a
sufficient number of adequately trained employees in order to maintain the acceptable levels of husbandry practices set
forth in the animal welfare act regulations. Correct by close of business on 2.11.2022

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with site employee.
