FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some of the wooden surfaces (resting surfaces, & ramps) in Kumari, Sitarra, Seze (tigers), & Cynzer (serval) are
deteriorating and are now either broken &/or splintered in some areas. The present condition of these surfaces now
poses a risk of injury to these cats.
All housing facilities shall be structurally sound and in good repair to prevent injury to the animals.Correct by September 1, 2017

to nest in and around the hay. Immediately adjacent to the bales of hay is an area that is soiled with bird droppings.

FEEDING.
The licensee occasionally traps wild (feral) rodents, kills them, and then feeds them to the servals. The health
status of these rats is unknown and may carry parasites, bacteria or other disease causing agents.
All food that is fed to regulated mammals must be wholesome and free from contamination to maintain the animals
in good health.
Correct immediately.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There were numerous flies on and around Angel, Apollo, Venus (tigers), Aries (liger), & Lola (coatimundi). The flies
were in sufficient number to cause stress to the cats as evidenced by the constant flicking of their ears and the tail
movements in an effort to removed the flies. Lola's food was also covered with flies.
Flies cause stress to the animals, can cause injury to their ears, and may prevent animals from eating their food.
The fly traps that are placed throughout the facility appeared to be used up and are in need of replacements. If this
does not correct the problem institute a more effective fly control system in the areas that are affected.
