FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the petting farm area there are many areas of structural concern.
*Boards and support posts in the barn are rotting from the ground level from excessive moisture. The sump pump
was not working at time of the inspection and stagnant filthy water was seen in the collection area.
*The chicken coop has been removed and a white pvc water pipe is exposed in the goat and sheep enclosure. This
needs to removed or safely covered to avoid the breaking of the water line in the animal's enclosure.
*Throughout the facility there are many areas where the wire has broken from rusting and or pressure by the
animals. *Some of the areas have had the wire removed leaving a gap large enough the animals to stick their
heads through but the horned goats could become trapped when attempting to back out. This could cause serious
injury to the goats.
*The aluminum ties to secure the chain mesh to the support posts are breaking away leaving the mesh unsecured.
These ties are not structurally strong enough to hold the chain mesh to the support posts and need to be replaced.
*Side entry gate to enter barn has rotting wood at the bottom and the gate is not secured to the support post.
*The gate and side fence to the left at the entrance of the pygmy goats stall is unstable and not secured to a proper
support. The plywood board on the right side and back wall of this stall is rotting and giving way under slight
pressure.
*The east fence and gate leading from the sheep and goats enclosure to the cows enclosure is structurally unsound
and broken wire mesh has sharp points protruding in towards the animal area.*The north back fence for the sheep and goats has rotton support posts and the top wooden rail is detached from
the post in the center.
*The large east gate in the sheep and goats outside enclosure has many areas of broken wire with sharp points
exposed.
*In the west pig pen the west fence is giving at the area it is supposed to be secured to the barn wall. The bottom
support post is off the fence and laying on the ground.
*The south fence for the cows has excessively rusting wire mesh over the wood rails and is breaking and coming off
the support posts.
*The wire mesh over the wood rails at the north side of the stalls for the cows is not secured and sharp points exist
all along the bottom section.
*The banyan tree at the northeast corner of the cows area is growing into the fence. The top metal post has popped
out of the support. The tree is growing into the mesh on this same side.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
At time of this inspection the animals being fed coastal hay only. Goats and sheep do not have any pasture and the
two cows have minimal grass in their enclosure. The coastal hay was of very poor quality and appeared to mixed
heavily with straw. No grain or supplements were being given to the animals. One older goat is very thin and she
was housed with three other goats. The four goats were being given one flake of hay to share. The attending
veterinarian needs to review the quality of the feed and the feeding protocol for all the animals in the petting farm.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition,
size, and type of the animal
