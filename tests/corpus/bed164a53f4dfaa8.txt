FEEDING.
There are at least two self-feeders that had a buildup of debris on the interior surface in contact with the food. There
were also areas of caked and deteriorating food in these self feeders. Caked or deteriorating food and dirty food
receptacles can decrease the nutritive value of the food offered to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that If
self-feeders are used, they must be kept clean and must be sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this
subpart (every 2 weeks or as needed). Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration,
and caking of feed. To be corrected by 23 May 2018.
