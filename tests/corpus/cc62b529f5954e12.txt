MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on29-JAN-18 at 1:30 PM.
The inspector arrived on campus at 1:30 PM on 1/29/18 to conduct an inspection but the individual authorized to
accompany the inspector was not in his/her office. The inspector waited for almost 60 minutes and tried to contact
him/her by both phone and e-mail before leaving. An email received after the inspector left the premises confirmed
that the contact had left the campus and was unavailable.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility
representative available to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection. Report delivered by e-mail 1/30/18.
