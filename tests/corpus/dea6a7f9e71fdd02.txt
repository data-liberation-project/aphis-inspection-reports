ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female German Shepherd Dog (0A01567767) had an accumulation of dark discharge-like material in the
fur under her right ear. She would also occasionally shake her head and tilt her head down in the direction of the
affected ear (to the right). According to the licensee, the dog had had a previous injury approximately one year ago
and a portion of the dog’s right ear flap was missing. Also, according to documentation at the facility initialed by a
veterinarian in January 2018, the dog had been examined by the attending veterinarian and no additional abnormal
conditions were noted with the ear at that time. Attempts to make a closer observation of the ear were made during
inspection, however, the dog seemed painful, whined and shifted and/or shook her head making further observation
difficult. Further attempts to examine the dog were not made as she appeared nervous and would run away at
additional attempts. The licensee had not noticed the dog’s current ear condition. This dog’s condition could be due
to an infection, injury or other veterinary medical condition would could be painful. The licensee must consult with a
veterinarian regarding this dog’s condition. This veterinary consultation is in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.
***An adult male Poodle (018366883) had matted fur and a ropey-like appearance to his fur generally over his entire
body. Clumps of matted fur were present mostly along his legs, towards his lower back and under his tail. There
was also fecal material matted in the fur under the tail. Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of
skin sores. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed and establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all
dogs.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by: March

3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***There were several enclosures housing adult dogs with chain-link fencing and wires with sharp ends pointing into
the animals’ enclosures. These sharp wire points were at the level of the dogs where they could easily come incontact with the sharp ends. The sharp wire ends can increase the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that there are no sharp points or edges that
could injure the dog at all times. To be corrected by: March 6, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
