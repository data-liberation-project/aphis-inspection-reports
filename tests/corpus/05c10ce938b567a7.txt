RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records had not been kept regarding the sale of five animals. Five animals had been sold approximately one month
prior to the inspection and no details regarding those sales were available for review. The applicant must record
complete information regarding animal sales, including the name and address the person purchasing an animal and
that person's license or registration number if he or she is licensed or registered under the Animal Welfare Act.
Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A five week old Serval was killed by an adult domestic cat shortly after being purchased in August, 2014. The adult
cat attacked and killed the Serval in an outdoor enclosure before the licensee could intervene. The licensee stated
that he was standing next to the Serval at the time of the attack and did not believe that any other cats had access
to that area.
Animals should be handled in such a manner as to avoid physical harm. The licensee should ensure that juvenile
animals are protected from harmful situations, including contact with other animals.
Correct immediately.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.(cid:9)
