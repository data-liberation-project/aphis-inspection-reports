3.127(b) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
On 12/16/2021 a 1.5 year old giraffe named “Kali” had to be euthanized. In the facility’s daily observation notes, on 12/10
she was observed to have liquid feces, and on 12/11, when the ambient temperatures had dropped to around freezing
overnight, it was noted that she was observed to be “shaking / shivering throughout the day”. On 12/12 diagnostics
revealed that she was carrying a high load of intestinal parasites. The low temperatures rose 10 to 15 degrees for two
days, however the low on the 14th and 15th dropped back down to 34 and 33 degrees F, respectively. She was treated
daily, however on the 14th she was again observed to be shivering, and she was placed in the barn under heaters, but
she was still observed to be shivering two hours later. On 12/15 she was in the barn, and a rectal temperature reading
was 90 degrees F. Attempts to administer IV fluids and antibiotic by facility staff were unsuccessful. She was blanketed,
and an additional heater placed in the stall, but a 4:30 PM rectal temp read only 91.5 degrees F. The next day the animal
was euthanized due to further decline, for humane reasons.

The giraffe barn at this facility is constructed of wood and is not insulated. There are many openings around the top, and
between boards that make it challenging to adequately heat the barn, especially down to the floor level. The heaters are
located up high, and a recently added viewing area above the stalls appears to have made heating the entire barn more


difficult. On 12/14 in the facility’s “Manager Notes” there is a notation that staff is “figuring out giraffe stall heaters”, and on
12/18 a note states that the barn heat is “not so great” and that they are “working on different ideas” because the heat is
“sitting in the viewing area”. At the time of inspection the temperature in the barn was 58.4 degrees F at midday, on a day
with recorded low and high temperatures of 41 and 64 degrees F.

Giraffes are quite susceptible to cold, and especially when confronted with other health challenges it is essential that
adequate heating is provided in colder climates in order to protect their well-being. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate
to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them
protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

To be corrected temporarily by modifying two stalls by March 10, 2022, with a new giraffe barn planned to be constructed
in the future.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
