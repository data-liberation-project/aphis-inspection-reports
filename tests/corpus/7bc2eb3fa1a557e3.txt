Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Goats have not been added to the Program of Veterinary Care by the Attending Veterinarian. This doesn't ensure that the
Attending Veterinarian has been given the appropriate authority to determine if provisions are in place and available for
the new species acquired. The Attending Veterinarian must review the Program of Veterinary Care and ensure all
species being cared for by the licensee are listed on the Program of Veterinary Care.
