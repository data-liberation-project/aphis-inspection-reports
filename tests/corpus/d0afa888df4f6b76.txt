Notification of change of operation.
On the afternoon of Monday, Aug. 1, 2022, I arrived at the address given by the registrant on his application. It appeared
that no one was home so I called the registrant and he informed me that he had moved from that address and is no longer
conducting regulated activity. I then proceeded to acquire new contact information.

The registrant moved and did not provide a new address as required for an inspection to be conducted under the Animal
Welfare Act. Current address and contact information are essential to enforcing the Animal Welfare regulations efficiently
and cost-effectively.

The registrant shall notify the Deputy Administrator of Animal Care by certified mail of any change in the name, address,
or ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler within 10
days after making such change. Send to APHIS Animal Care, 2150 Centre Avenue, Building B, Mailstop 3W11, Fort
Collins, CO 80526.

Correct by August 15, 2022.



This exit interview was conducted with the registrant over the phone.
