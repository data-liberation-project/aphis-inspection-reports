Facilities, outdoor.
A section of the western perimeter fence, approximately 40 feet in length, had intermittent areas of washout. These
washouts created gaps underneath the perimeter fence ranging from a three to twenty inches in depth and one to five feet
in length. Animals and unauthorized people can use these openings to enter and exit the area and gain access to the
animals behind it. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting
animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and
so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. To be corrected by the next re-
license inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 9, 2023, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
