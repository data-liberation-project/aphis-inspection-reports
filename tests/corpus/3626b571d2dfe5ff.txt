INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The one unaffiliated member only attended two of the last nine IACUC meetings. This member did not attend either
of the two meetings where the program review and facility inspections were done. This minimum attendance does
not assure this person has provided representation for the general community interests in the proper care and
treatment of animals. The IACUC needs to assure the community interest is served by regular attendance at
IACUC meetings and that the unaffiliated member participates in program reviews and facility inspections. To be
corrected by 10-29-14.
