ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, the program of veterinary care was not available for review by APHIS personnel. An
updated program of veterinary care should be kept at the facility and available at all times upon request during
inspection. The plan should be current and reflect the agreed upon health of the animals at the facility between
licensee and attending veterinarian.
