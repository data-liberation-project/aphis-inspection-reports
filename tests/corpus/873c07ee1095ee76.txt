ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female cream and tan colored adult Shih Tzu identified with microchip (452E7B3062) and tattoo number (25) has
an open sore on top of its right front paw. The dog was observed in the primary enclosure holding up the right front
leg and not putting any weight on it while it walked. The open sore was bleeding and running down the paw. The
size of the area affected on the skin is approximately 1 inch in diameter with hair loss around the sore. The licensee
removed the dog from the enclosure and took it into another room in the building to clean the wound. A facility
attendant stated that the sore was observed a few days ago. The licensee stated that she had not consulted a
veterinarian regarding the current condition of the dog. Open wounds can be very painful causing discomfort when
the dog has to place weight on the affected foot. Wounds on the foot can affect the mobility and daily activity of the
dog. If left untreated the open wound could lead to an infection forming which affects the health and well being of
the dog. The licensee must have the animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate plan administered. The
outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
*The licensee contacted the attending veterinarian at the time of inspection and stated the veterinarian is going to
come to the facility to examine the dog and provide documentation today.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
