FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The large shelter in the leopard enclosure has rotten wood planks in two spots. The small shelter has a rotten
wood roof plank, and another area of rotten wood on the side. These areas need to be repaired or replaced.
- The lower wooden resting platform in the lioness enclosure is sagging in the middle. This needs to be braced or
replaced to ensure it does not break.
- One porcupine nest box has a broken side panel on the inside of the shelter.
All facility structures must be maintained in good repair.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- Behind the food storage area, the perimeter fence has several fallen trees draped across the top of the fence.
This section of the perimeter fence is not stable and secure. The weight of the fallen trees could cause the fence to
buckle and break. The trees also provide a means for animals and unauthorized personnel to enter and exit the
facility. These trees must be removed, and the fence repaired as needed. This area is also heavily overgrown with
vegetation, preventing easy access to the fence itself. This makes it very difficult for park employees to evaluate
and maintain this corner of the fence. Trees and brush along the perimeter fence need to be maintained to ensure
they do not compromise the fence in any way.
3.130 DIRECT
WATERING.
- At approximately 1030 in the morning of 9 August, there was no drinking water available in the white tiger
enclosure housing three tigers. There was a small amount of water in the tigers play tub, but this water was dirty
and not suitable for drinking. When the automatic waterer was turned on, two tigers pushed each other to try and
reach the water. Both drank continuously for several minutes. Twenty minutes after the water was turned on, onetiger was noted still drinking at the water bowl. Discussion with the facility determined that the water supply had
accidentally been turned off the night before. Ambient temperature in this area the morning of 9 August was in the
mid-80's F. Lack of drinking water in a hot, humid climate puts animals in severe risk of dehydration and
over-heating. The behavior of the enclosed tigers indicates that the lack of water overnight was at the least a
source of stress. All animals must be supplied with clean, fresh drinking water as needed. Hot, humid conditions
increases the frequency at which drinking water must be offered. The facility plans to take steps to ensure this
event is not repeated. They plan to connect a separate water line to the tigers' automatic waterer to prevent the line
from being accidentally closed in the future.
Corrected on the spot.
3.131
SANITATION.
There are widespread pest control issues throughout the facility.
- The llama in the petting zoo had a heavy infestation of flies centered around his face and head.
- Several enclosures, including the petting zoo and the white tiger enclosure, contained ant hills with large, red ants.
Ants in close proximity to the animals could result in injury or irritation to the animals.
- Boards and metal pipes are stored loosely on the ground behind the back row of enclosures. This is potential
harborage for pests, and should be cleared away. Building material must be properly stored and situated well away
from animal feed/enclosures.
A safe and effective pest control program must be instituted to address these concerns.
