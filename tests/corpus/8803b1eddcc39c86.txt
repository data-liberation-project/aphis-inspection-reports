3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain link divider wires between the above ground dog runs are excessively rusted in a few runs at the bottoms
of the fencing. The runs affected are the fencing between 6A and 6B, and 7A and 7B. These areas are covered
over with plastic strips to prevent the dogs from having contact with the rusted through wires. All structures must be
free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, and all wiring must be structurally sound.
The wires on these runs need to be replaced to allow proper cleaning and sanitization.
To be corrected by 9-2-16.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
