ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 PM on
22-Aug-16.
Inspector arrived at the address at 2 PM, called the contact numbers and left a message on voicemail that I was at
the facility to conduct an inspection and can wait for 30 minutes before it becomes an attempted inspection. Prior to
leaving the facility, I left a business card at the gate with the date and time of attempted inspection.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 22 August, 2016.
