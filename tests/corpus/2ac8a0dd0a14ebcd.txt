Sanitation.
The floors of this facility are covered with spent/spilled bedding. There is also a significant build-up of dust on the tops of
enclosures and on all flat surfaces in the main animal area. Various items not currently being used for animal husbandry
are being stored on top of enclosures including construction materials and transport caging. These areas must be kept
neat and clean. Failure to provide proper housekeeping interferes with normal husbandry procedures and does not
satisfy accepted cleanliness standards. This build-up of bedding and dust also makes it difficult to monitor for pests.
Correct this by cleaning and maintaining these areas and surfaces on a more frequent schedule.
