2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During this inspection, the Attending Veterinarian (AV) expressed concerns by phone about the facility staff’s lack of
follow-through and documentation of delivery of medications and/or treatments prescribed for the animals. The AV has
previously provided treatment sheets and guidance, but staff does not use the forms or document medical treatments in
any way that the AV can evaluate to ensure proper delivery.

Upon detailed review of keeper notes from October 21, 2021 to March 8, 2022, five instances of staff initiating antibiotic
and/or medical treatment for animals without prior consultation with the AV were documented.

Not following the directions of the AV and not involving the AV in initiation of medical treatment provide clear indications
that the AV does not have the appropriate authority to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals at this facility. The
regulations require that each exhibitor shall assure that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal use and care. Correct by March 18,
2022.
2.75(b)(1)



Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Multiple acquisition and disposition records for animals were not available for inspection: llama, capybara, 9 ringtail
lemurs, 2 servals, caracal and otter (acquisition) - and – white-nosed coati, llama, howler monkey, black and white lemur,
capybara and wildebeest (disposition). Not maintaining the required records of acquisition and disposition can result in
difficulty conducting trace-back and trace-forward activities to document animal movement and monitor the potential
spread of disease. Per the regulations, every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly
disclose the information contained in this section for animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased or
otherwise in his/her possession or under his/her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed
of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his/her possession or under his/her
control. Correct by March 25, 2022.
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
Multiple patrons were observed during periods of public contact with animals – in the walk-through (12 people) and drive-
through (9 vehicles) areas of the facility. Only 1 attendant was observed during the entire inspection period. This
attendant appeared at the giraffe feeding area after a facility representative notified the attendant of people in the contact
area.

Two patrons were observed walking into the facility through the open perimeter fence gate and walking through the upper
area of the facility. The barriers in the Old Town area of the facility were not secured, providing no effective way to
prevent patrons from opening the gates and approaching the primary enclosure areas housing the animals.
The doors into the encounter area were not locked and the enclosures of the animals contained therein were not locked.
The primary enclosures in the upper barn were not secured and could easily be opened by patrons. IIn the drive-through


area, the large barn containing dangerous hoofstock was not locked/secured to prevent unattended patrons from entering
the barn.

No attendant was noted in any of these areas (other than the one who appeared at the giraffe contact area) during
periods of public contact and feeding of the animals.

Not providing adequate attendants in unsecured areas of the premises provides opportunity for patrons to enter animal
areas and puts the humans and animals at risk of injury. Per the regulations, a responsible, knowledgeable and readily
identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Correct by March 25,
2022.
3.75(a)

Housing facilities, general.
A young howler monkey was observed hugging a live electric cord that was connected to a heating pad inside its
enclosure. Exposure to electricity can cause significant injury and death to an animal if the cord becomes compromised
in proximity to the animal. Per the regulations, housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and
constructed so that they are structurally sound and must be kept in good repair and must protect the animals from injury.

3.78(b) Critical

Outdoor housing facilities.
A black and white ruffed lemur, a De Brazza’s monkey and a capuchin experienced frost bite injuries resulting in medical
care being required by each animal. The lemur’s hand was injured and remains contracted while the De Brazza’s and
capuchin suffered the loss of their tail tips. Each enclosure’s shelter provides an unmonitored level of heating and the


animals were not confined to warmed shelters during periods of severe cold. Temperatures of 21, 19, 25 and 22 degrees
F were recorded on January 18th, 22nd, Jan 27th and January 31st, 2022, respectively. The lemur’s hand injury was first
documented on Jan 22, and the De Brazza’s and capuchin tail amputations occurred on January 31 and February 1,
2022, respectively. Not providing adequate shelter heat and confinement during severe low temperature events can
cause significant pain and suffering for the animals experiencing them. Per the regulations, outdoor housing facilities for
nonhuman primates must provide adequate shelter from the elements at all times. It must provide protection from the sun,
rain, snow, wind, and cold, and from any weather conditions that may occur. The shelter must safely provide heat to the
nonhuman primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 45 degrees. Temperatures for March 12, 2022
are anticipated to be 19 degrees F. Correct on or before March 12, 2022.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
About a quarter of the ceiling of the binturong enclosure has dark brown/black material evident. Having suspected black
mold in an enclosure area puts the animals contained in that area at risk of disease. Per the regulations, indoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to
contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
