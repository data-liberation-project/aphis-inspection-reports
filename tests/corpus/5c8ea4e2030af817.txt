FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor African crested porcupine enclosure houses three porcupines. Wire fencing material has been placed
under a layer of dirt/gravel to keep the porcupines from digging out. The shelter box is sitting on the ground and the
porcupines have dug out some of the dirt/rock exposing the wire mesh. They have started doing the same along the
side of the enclosure with the door into the enclosure. The porcupines may injure or trap themselves in the exposed
wire mesh flooring. The ground/flooring needs to be constructed and maintained in a condition that will prevent
injury to the porcupines. Correct by Dec. 15, 2015.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Three African crested porcupines are currently housed outside. The perimeter fence around the property currently
consists of a four foot high livestock fence material with 4inx4in openings. A perimeter fence of six feet height is
necessary to keep out unauthorized persons and unwanted animals and to act as a secondary containment system
if the porcupines get out of their enclosure. The facility needs to build an appropriate perimeter fence or obtain a
variance from the Regional Office. Correct by Dec. 15, 2015.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two young red kangaroo are currently being housed in the house in pet taxis and allowed exercise by being let out
for play. The facility representative states that they are getting too old/large for their exhibit purposes and will be
replaced with younger ones. The two kangaroos are out of the pouch and eating solid foods. The crates do not
allow the kangaroos to hop, stand up tall and lie down stretched out. The kangaroos, if kept, need to be given more
space to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Correct by Dec. 15,
2015.
