ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The adult, female dog with id number 15 has excessive tartar on its teeth and red, receded gums. The adult, female
dogs with id 55 and 61 have overgrown toenails and it appears some have already broken off.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control and treat disease.
Dogs must undergo dental cleanings when they have large accumulations of tartar and inflammation of the gums.
The veterinarian must document which animals are in need of dental cleanings at the time of her kennel inspection
and exam. Dental cleanings are necessary to maintain healthy dogs and puppies, especially in a breeding facility.
Dental disease can lead to infection and systemic disease in dogs and puppies. Trim the nails on all dogs as often
as necessary so that they do not get caught on the enclosure and break which causes pain.
To be corrected by August 20, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
