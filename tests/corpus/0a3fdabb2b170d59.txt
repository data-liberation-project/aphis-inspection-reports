3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing one vervet has a build-up of food waste, hair, grime and/or animal waste on at least one
perch within the enclosure. The waste is building up on the wall above the perch, in the crack between the wall and
the perch and in the holes within the perch. Failure to clean primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards, pests
and odors.
Hard surfaces with which non-human primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and indoor primary
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of dirt, debris, animal or food waste, or disease hazards.
If the species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced at regular intervals as determined by the
attending veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The enclosure housing at least twenty-four degus has a severe build-up of food waste, soiled bedding and/or animal
waste within the enclosure. The waste and soiled bedding visible along the glass enclosure walls is caked on to the
side of the enclosure and is several inches thick. There is a clean layer of bedding present on top of the soiled
bedding. There is a thin layer of grime, dirt and/or waste covering the inside walls of the enclosure. The enclosure is
made of clear glass and this layer of dirt, grime and/or waste makes it difficult to see in to the enclosure.
Failure to clean animal enclosures can lead to health hazards, pests and odors. Enclosures shall be cleaned and
soiled bedding and excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein, to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. This is a focused inspection to assess the indoor housing facilities, animal health, feeding, watering, and shelter.
