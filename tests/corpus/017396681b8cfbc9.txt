FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an open bag of hedgehog food present, and bags of food are stored directly on the floor. Food stored
directly on the floor, against walls or left open can be contaminated and allows deterioration or access to rodents
and other pests. All open supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
contamination and spoilage.

SANITATION.
The room for the hedgehogs has accumulated bedding, fecal material and other refuse present on the floor. In
addition, excess equipment and supplies are filling one side of the room.
Accumulated bedding and fecal material on the floor, and other refuse contributes to odor and makes it difficult to
maintain adequate pest control. Excess equipment and supplies make the animal room difficult to clean and
sanitize and to maintain adequate pest control.
The floors of the animal room must be cleaned, and discarded materials and other refuse removed from the animal
housing room. In addition, if the room is to be used for the storage of equipment and supplies, these areas must be
cleaned and organized.
