CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
On the East side of the sheltered adult housing facility, there was more than a day’s accumulation of feces in the
outdoor portions of 6 enclosures, housing 22 adult dogs. The feces were throughout the enclosures and the dogs
could not avoid walking through them, as evidenced by multiple fecal piles smashed into the concrete floor. Several
feces had a white mold-like discoloration and there was a strong odor of excrement that could be smelled from
several feet away. Accumulations of excreta within animal enclosures creates an unhealthy environment and can
cause health hazards for dogs. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is removed from the primary
enclosures daily, as required, to prevent soiling of dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
Correct from this day forward.
