Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The domestic pig’s left ear tip was raw, bloody and had the appearance of fly strike. The licensee noticed the condition of
the ear but has not communicated the condition of the ear to the attending veterinarian. Raw exposed flesh can be an
attractant to pests and the condition can be painful to the pig. The condition of the ear should be communicated to the AV
for assessment and treatment options.

The bobcat displayed a lameness in the right rear leg when stood up and moved around the enclosure. The licensee
noticed the lameness but attributed it to old age. Any change in mobility for an older animal should be communicated to
the vet in a timely manner to properly assess condition of the animal and provide treatment options.

Facilities, general.
There is one wood board for the base of the bobcat shelter that is rotted away. The base of the shelter connects to a
wood panel wall. The inspector was able to put her hand up through the missing section of wood and connect with hay


bedding in the shelter. This section of wood needs to be replaced to keep the enclosure in good repair for safety and
containment of the animal.

The kinkajou enclosure next to the food prep building needs to be addressed. Several areas of the enclosure have areas
of rust along the frame of the enclosure and the bucket in the enclosure is also showing signs of rust. Rusted areas can
deteriorate, and these areas of the enclosure must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animal.

Facilities, general.
The chest freezer needs to be cleaned. There was an accumulation of dead ants around the seal of the freezer when it
was opened, and the bottom of the freezer had old fluids from past meat products that needs to be cleaned.

The feeding tubes for the cougar needs to be cleaned, there was an accumulation of debris along the sides of the PVC
tube and some food was being consumed by ants in the right tube. It is important to keep these tubes clean as well so
that food is not contaminated as it passes through the tubes.
