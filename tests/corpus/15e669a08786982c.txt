ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A black pig, Joey, has a moderately, overgrown hoof on his left front foot as well as overgrown dewclaws on both
front feet. The overgrowth of hooves/nails may cause the animals discomfort and lead to injuries or lameness if not
appropriately addressed. The facility must establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that
includes timely hoof/nail care and trimming when needed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Deer shelter: Part of the wooden siding of the shelter structure has come loose and detached along the bottom
leaving about a two inch gap and an exposed, pointed metal screw. Also, there were two exposed, pointed ends of
sharp, metal nails in areas of potential contact with the deer. Gaps in housing structures poses the risk of an animal
getting parts of their body caught, trapped or injured. Also, sharp, protruding points or edges in areas of contact with
the animal may lead to injury.
Goat shelter: A corner on the outside of one of the wooden, shelter structures has an area of excessive wearing of
the wood with an exposed metal nail within contact of the animals. Sharp, protruding points or edges of metal nails
in areas of contact with the animals may lead to injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other hazards in order to
protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.

WATERING.
The water receptacle in the goat pen contained dirty, brownish colored water with a buildup of dirt and debris on the
bottom surface. Also, the water receptacle in the llama pen had an accumulation of greenish algae coating the
inside walls and bottom surface.All water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the animals are
provided with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate
hydration. Water receptacles must be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry
practices.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
There were excessive amounts of feces on top of and mixed within the straw bedding inside of the two shelter
structures in the goat pen. Excreta must be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of the goat pen must
be more effective to prevent the buildup of feces and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
