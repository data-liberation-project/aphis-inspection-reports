Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
The licensee purchased 2 young camels from an unlicensed source on 4/27/21.
Purchasing from unlicensed sources who are required to be licensed does not allow for inspection at those sources to
ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.

Facilities, outdoor.
A water buffalo calf was being housed in the round pen adjacent to the barn. The licensee reported the calf had been
housed there since being acquired 2 days ago. There is no shelter from sunlight available in the pen. The high
temperature reported by the National Weather Service for the previous day for this area was 90 degrees F with clear or
partly cloudy skies and today’s forecasted high temperature is 89 degrees F with clear or partly cloudy skies.
Failure to provide shelter from sunlight can cause discomfort and lead to overheating, especially during periods of hot
weather as this area is currently experiencing.


Sufficient shade by natural or artificial means must be provided to allow animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from
direct sunlight.

Watering.
A water buffalo calf was being housed in the round pen adjacent to the barn with 2 other animals (equines). The licensee
reported the calf had been housed there since being acquired 2 days ago. There was no water source in the pen and the
licensee stated they were typically given water in the morning and evening but had not been given water today (inspection
was conducted between 9 am and 10 am). The inspector asked the licensee to provide water to the animals. All of the
animals immediately crowded around the water bucket and competed for access. When the water buffalo calf was given
access to the bucket, the calf drank voraciously for almost 2 minutes until the bucket was almost empty and was
removed.
Failure to provide water often enough to prevent excessive thirst can result in discomfort and distress and may lead to
dehydration or other health conditions.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal.
