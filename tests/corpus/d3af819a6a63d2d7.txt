PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In multiple non human primate enclosures, there were sharp points from fencing materials that had been cut and left
sharp, or had broken creating sharp points or edges. Specifically in the older female lemur shelter, the floor had
separated, sagging and creating sharp points and in the inside enclosure for the three younger lemurs, the entry
way had been created by bending the wire mesh, leaving multiple areas of sharp points. In the Patas monkey
shelter, there were bolts sticking out, and loose wires were present throughout the sheltered areas for the
nonhuman primates. Primary enclosures for non human primates must be structurally sound and kept in good
repair to prevent injuries to the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In various areas around the facility, the perimeter fence did not meet the requirement of 8 feet for the potentially
dangerous animals held at this facility. In several areas the measured height of the fence was 7 feet, or there was a
large gap, measuring approximately a foot, under the fence. In the area of the facility near the baboons, there was
fencing material stored adjacent to the perimeter fence, reducing the effective height of the perimeter fence. The
perimeter fence is to protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through or under it, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.Correct by 31 July, 2019

SANITATION.
In the off exhibit holding area, there was a large dumpster that was overflowing and piles of trash, bedding and fecal
material on either side of it. The barn area was cluttered and full of debris. In various places around the grounds,
trash and other items were discarded and not picked up. Buildings and grounds shall be kept clean and in good
repair in order to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
