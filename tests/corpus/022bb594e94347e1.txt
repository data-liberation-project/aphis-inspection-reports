2.32(b) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Investigators conducting regulated research activity failed to submit a proposal for new activity to the IACUC for
review. This new activity was conducted, without IACUC approval, from September 2017 through September 2018,
and the procedures involved caused more than momentary distress in the animals on study. It was determined at
the time of inspection that the investigators did not recognize the activity as a deviation from the approved protocol,
and therefore did not realize the necessity of submitting the activity to the IACUC for review. Training and instruction
shall be made available to personnel involved in animal care and use with sufficient frequency to fulfill the research
facility’s responsibilities under 2.31 of the AWR.
This non-compliant item was voluntarily self-reported by the facility at the time of discovery. The facility has
instituted corrective measures to prevent recurrence and the activity will be submitted to the IACUC for review.
To remain corrected from this point forward.
This inspection was conducted from 5/29 - 5/30. The exit interview was conducted on site with facility
representatives.
