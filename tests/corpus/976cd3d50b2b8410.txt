3.28(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The space provided for most of the guinea pigs in their primary enclosures does not meet the standards in this
section. In the two guinea pig rooms where the animals are group housed, each primary enclosure houses two to
five guinea pigs, with a majority of enclosures housing 5 guinea pigs. Each primary enclosure measures 20x22
inches, providing 440 square inches of space. Most of the guinea pigs present were of similar size and
appearance. Two animals were weighed and their weights were 520, and 480 grams, for an average of 500 grams.
Guinea pigs weighing over 350 grams are required to have 101 square inches of floor space each.
In these shared enclosures, each 440 square inch enclosure shall house a maximum of 4 guinea pigs (>350 grams)
in order to meet the space requirement. The animals should be provided with adequate floor space so as to
facilitate adequate freedom of movement. Failure to provide adequate floor space could have a negative impact on
the health and well-being of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one of the rabbit rooms, 32 rabbit enclosures did not meet our minimum space requirements. The primary
enclosures measured 20x22 inches, providing 440 square inches or 3.05 square feet of space. Two rabbits were
weighed, and they weighed 4.2 and 4.85 kg each. Each rabbit over 4 kgs is required to have 4 square feet of space.
Adequate floor space in primary enclosures is essential in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the
rabbits. Overcrowding can result in stress, disease, and injury. Primary enclosures should be measured and the
rabbits weighed so that rabbits can be maintained in housing where they have adequate floor space.
