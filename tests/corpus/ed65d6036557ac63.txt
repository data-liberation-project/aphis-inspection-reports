2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On Sunday, February 15, 2016, the barrier fence which is normally around the water buffalo exhibit was temporarily
taken down & relocated to be used for a non animal purpose during a special event.
During this time, one of the buffalo charged the fence and knocked down some patrons who were at the fence to
take photos with the animal. It was stated that there was an employee in the general area, but not at this exhibit.
The barrier fence has been reinstalled, but it is not 3 feet from the enclosure in 2 areas.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public at all times so as
to assure the safety of animals and the public. The barrier shall be placed at least 3 feet from the primary enclosure
around the entire exhibit.
Correct immediately.
This is a focused inspection limited to the reinspection of the non compliant items identified on the previous
inspection and the inquiry into a complaint.
