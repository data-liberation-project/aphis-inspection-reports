ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1759 on
20-Sep-17. I went to the licensee's house. Family at the house informed me the licensee would not be home for a
while. No one else was available for inspection. I told them I would try back another time.
End of report.
