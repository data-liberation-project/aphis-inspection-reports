and pelvic bones were easily visible, with no palpable fat. The licensee states that she is on a higher quality dry puppy
food, but based on her condition and the nutritional needs she requires to nurse puppies, additional supplementation of
nutritive value should be provided to maintain the normal condition and weight of the animal during this life stage.
