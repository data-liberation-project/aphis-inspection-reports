ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30a on
03-Oct-17.
ACI Bartels and Species Specialist MaGinnis arrived at the facility. The gate was closed to the property not
allowing us to make it to the door to knock. ACI Bartels honked the horn of the government owned vehicle, and
called a number on file and left a voice message. ACI Bartels received a return phone call from the licensee stating
they were unavailable to return home at that time.
