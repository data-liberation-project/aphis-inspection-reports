3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing sheep is in poor condition. Sections of the welded wire fencing are leaning and appear to be
pushed down by animals attempting to reach over them or through them to the outside of the enclosure. It is
possible that an animal could be entangled and injured by this fence while attempting to exit the enclosure.
This enclosure needs to be repaired or replaced in order to protect the animals contained in it from injury.
