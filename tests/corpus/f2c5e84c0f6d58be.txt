2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On April 1st, 2022, an adult female grey wolf escaped from her primary enclosure when zookeepers failed to properly
secure the primary enclosure’s fence gate while maintenance work was being done. The animal pushed off the main
enclosure gate without the zookeepers noticing it and got out. The primary enclosure is surrounded by a perimeter fence
which serves as a secondary containment but the gate was left completely open and the animal was able to bypass both
fences. Another staff member that was nearby saw the animal outside and alerted everyone. Escape protocols were
enacted, all gates were closed quickly and visitors were moved indoors by staff members. The animal was always
contained inside facility premises but never gained access to public areas. The animal was darted and recovered on the
same day. The animal did not suffer any injuries but was weak when recaptured and received medical attention. The
animal was kept under observation in the medical ward for several days and was slowly reintroduced into her habitat. A
total of 3 grey wolves are housed together in this enclosure but the other 2 were locked in the night quarters and never
escaped. No member of the public or facility staff was harmed while the animal was out. Facility records show that
zookeepers involved in this incident were re-trained. This handling mistake could have resulted in a potential injury to the
animal or any member of the public or the facility staff. Handling of all animals must be done in a manner that cannot lead


to an animal escape and prevent trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
