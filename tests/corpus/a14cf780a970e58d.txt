ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****A young female Aoudad born early spring of 2016 was limping and placing little weight on the right front leg.
The licensee stated today was the first time the problem with the right front leg had been noticed. Leg problems can
be painful causing discomfort when the animal has to place weight on the leg, it can affect the mobility and daily
activity of the animal. In the goat public feeding enclosure a young female tan colored goat was noticed with a
yellowish green discharge from the nostrils, the same goat had a greenish black tarry substance under its tail and
slightly down the back legs. The licensee stated this condition was not noticed when the goats were moved to the
public feeding area earlier that day the licensee removed the goat from enclosure during the inspection to
quarantine pen. The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure an
accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
