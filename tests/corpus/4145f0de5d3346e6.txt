HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection, there was a wallaby loose inside of the store and not inside of an enclosure during business
hours. The licensee informed the inspector that the wallaby is used for exhibition purposes. Animals must be
handled to minimize the risk of harm to the public or injury to the animal. There must be sufficient distance and/or
barriers between the animal and the public. This will assure the safety of the animals and the public.
To be corrected from this day forward.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a strong ammonia odor at the entrance of the store and remained throughout the entire store during the
inspection. Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means to provide for
the health and to prevent discomfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either
by means of windows, doors, vents, fans, or air-conditioning and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors,
and moisture condensation. Frequent cleaning of enclosures (as often as necessary) and increased ventilation will
help maintain healthy air quality to protect the health and welfare of the animals.

SANITATION.
Inside of cage # 12, which contains a ferret named (cid:28)Pena(cid:29), there is an excessive amount of feces inside of the
enclosure. Inside of cage # 8 housing four hedgehogs, there is an excessive accumulation of greenish/brown
material on the exercise wheel. Excreta shall be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained and to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of these enclosures
should be more timely and effective to prevent the build-up of excreta.
To be corrected from this day forward.

SANITATION.
The kitchen area has an accumulation of dirty bowls and debris scattered throughout the food preparation area.
The sink has an accumulation of food particles along the edges of the sink and brownish material scattered on the
walls of the kitchen. Lack of proper husbandry practices in the food preparation area could possibly lead to disease
hazards and contamination of the food. Premises shall be kept clean and clear to protect the health of the animals.
To be corrected from this day forward.

SANITATION.
Throughout the entire facility, there were an excessive amount of flies inside and outside of the animal enclosures.
Flies harbor diseases and can contaminate the food in the receptacles. An effective pest control program needs to
be established to control insects and ectoparasites. The pest control program shall be established and maintained.
