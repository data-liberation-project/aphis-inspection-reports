2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: Four of the five alpacas have excessively long lower front teeth. These lower
teeth extend out and over the upper lip, especially the white alpaca. Four of the eight goats have overgrown feet,
especially the rear hooves. Some of these goats have malformed hooves that require regular trimming to prevent
lameness. The need for these husbandry procedures had been identified by facility personnel months ago but have
not yet been done. The veterinarian was called during this inspection and an appointment was made.
Teeth extending out of the mouth may break causing pain/discomfort to the animal. Overgrown hooves may cause
foot problems and lameness. Husbandry procedures must be done in a timely manner to maintain the health of the
animals and prevent discomfort.
