WATERING.
The water in the water buckets for the arctic foxes and the African crested porcupines was brown and opaque in
color. The bottoms of the water buckets could not be visualized through the water. A brown thickened material was
noted on the sides of the African crested water bucket at the level of the water line. Discolored brown water may not
be potable and may make the animals disinterested in drinking the water. All water receptacles shall be kept clean
and sanitary to ensure that the drinking water is potable. Correct within 24 hrs./by Nov. 25, 2014.

SANITATION.
During the inspection, numerous rats were noted running along the ground and above (on rafters) of the enclosure
housing the African crested porcupines. At one time ten rats were visible simultaneously. The facility has been
trapping rats but has not yet consulted with the attending veterinarian or put into place a comprehensive pest control
program. Rats can transmit diseases and parasites and be an irritant to the animals. The facility shall consult their
veterinarian and put into place and follow a written pest control program. Correct by Dec. 15, 2014.
