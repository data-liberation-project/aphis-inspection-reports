2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:36 pm on 17-JUN-
2022. Went to the venue on the itinerary in Puyallup, WA; however, I did not see the licensee. I then called the contact
number and was able to speak with him. The licensee stated he had been delayed in traffic and was still in Oregon.
