20-JUN-18.***On Wednesday, June 20th 2018, between 13:00hrs and 13:30hrs, a responsible person was not
available to conduct an inspection. Inspector attempted to contact licensee by (calling cell/home and leaving
message, knocking on door, honking while in driveway). This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals. A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal
welfare inspection.
