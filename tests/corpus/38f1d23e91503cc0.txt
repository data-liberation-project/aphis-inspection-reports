INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC (Institutional Care and Use Committee) approved protocol did not contain a complete description of the
activities using a regulated species. In the study, rabbits weighing approximately three kilograms undergo a series
of 12 bleeds of 1.5 ml over a five hour period of time. Some animals in the study undergo a second series of bleeds
after a "washout" period. The length of the washout period is not included in the description, thus the period of time
between bleeds is not described. There are no assurances that the blood volume being collected will not result in
distress to the animals, especially those being bled twice.
Inadequate descriptions of activities using animals may prevent the IACUC from identifying deficiencies in those
activities. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of
proposed activities that involve the use of animals in order that those activities may be adequately reviewed and
determined to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.

2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol did not contain a description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and
pain to the animals is limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research,
including appropriate provisions for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, or tranquilizing drugs to minimize discomfort
and pain to the animals. The protocol contains contradictory statements regarding pain and distress, stating that
"There is no discomfort or pain associated with these studies" while acknowledging "...minimal stress associated
with holding animals and restraining the animals for approximately 5 - 6 hours during the study and for drawing
blood samples." The protocol then states that to minimize stress the animals are to be handled by a person who is
well trained in animal handling. There is no description of potential signs of pain or distress from drawing blood or
being restrained for five to six hours, nor is there any description of what the handler should do if the animalsappear to be stressed or painful. The protocol also includes a reference to the use of Ketamine for anesthesia for
use during surgery, however no surgical procedure is described in the protocol. If Ketamine is to be used during
blood collection, the protocol does not describe when or how often it should be used.
Restraining animals for prolonged periods of time may cause pain and/or distress to the animals. The IACUC should
ensure that protocols contain a description of procedures designed to address pain and distress that may occur
during those activities.
