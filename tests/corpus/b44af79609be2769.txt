ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0930 hours on
20-JUL-17.
Called licensee cell phone and she answered saying she was in Springfield at appointment and that was why she
missed me last time. I asked to text me what days she will not be home for the next 30 days.
