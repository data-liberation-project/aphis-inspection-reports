2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
***On May 24, 2016 I visited Dawn(cid:25)'s Country Market and determined that farm animals (a steer, sheep, goats, a
pig, and rabbits) are on exhibit to the public. The public is allowed to visit, pet, and feed the animals housed on site.
In accordance with the Animal Welfare Act, any person operating as an exhibitor must obtain a USDA license.
Dawn(cid:25)'s Country Market must obtain an exhibitor license for its current business activity.
CONDUCTING REGULATED ACTIVITY WITHOUT A VALID USDA LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF THE ANIMAL
WELFARE ACT.
