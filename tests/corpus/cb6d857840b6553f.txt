FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Strutural Strength
*** One pig and one sheep have access to a pen in the petting zoo which has broken wires on the fencing near the
ground. The animals may be injured by the wire ends protruding into the enclosure. There is also chicken wire
detaching from the wire and wood fencing that may cause animals to get caught in the loose wire or to be injured
from the wire ends.
***The petting zoo enclosure housing 4 goats and one alpaca has broken wires on the fencing near the ground by
the circular trash receptacle. The animals may be injured by the wire ends protruding into the enclosure.
***The top of the wood ramp to the elevated resting structure for the wild cat is rotting. There are holes in the wood,
wood splinters, and nail heads protruding up out of the wood. The animal may be injured by the damaged wood or
nail heads.
Once the APHIS officials identified the condition of the fencing in the petting zoo to the licensee, the licensee had
facility personnel repair the fencing. The wood ramp must still be repaired to protect the animal from injury.
Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

WATERING.
***The water bowls for the skunk, porcupine, and wolf have a buildup of a dark brown / green material on the inside
surface of the water receptacles. Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to prevent contamination of the
drinking water. Water receptacles must be cleaned at a frequency and in a manner that prevents the build-up of
debris on the surface of the water containers to ensure the animals have potable water to drink. Correct by

SANITATION.
Housekeeping
***Old feces from turkeys and peacocks are present around the circular trash receptacle near the petting zoo
enclosure for the llama and goats. Also in the petting zoo area, an excessive amount of tortoise and bird feces is
present in the corner in front of the barrier fence near the opossum and new guinea singing dog enclosures. At the
time of inspection, a pig and a sheep had access to the petting zoo area where the excessive amounts of
bird/tortoise excreta had accumulated. Grounds should be kept free of an excessive amount of excreta and debris
to facilitate cleaning practices, to minimize pests, and for the health of the animals.
This inspection was conducted on September 24, 2015. An exit briefing was conducted on September 25, 2015 with
the facility owner; Gloria McFadden,VMO; and Mary Geib, VMO.
