2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
According to the facility representative, the facility's attending veterinarian retired from practice in August. The new
attending veterinarian has visited the facility during a weekend exhibition but has not yet formally scheduled a visit
to the premises nor has she completed a new written program of veterinary care. The written program of veterinary
care needs to detail a preventative health and care program to include any vaccinations, ectoparasite control,
endoparasite control, blood parasite control, emergency care, euthanasia, TB testing and any other topics such as
zoonotic diseases, nutrition, handling etc. as appropriate for any and all the species housed and exhibited. The
attending veterinarian needs to be employed under formal arrangements with a written program of veterinary care
and needs to conduct regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor in order to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals. Correct by Nov. 14, 2014.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The smaller of two prairie dogs is completely missing hair over its upper back in an irregular pattern about 2inx 1in
in size. In addition, hair is sparse/missing on its face. The visible skin is pigmented and smooth. The facility
representative stated that this must have just occurred as it didn't have hair loss when acquired. The attending
veterinarian has not been contacted yet. Appropriate veterinary care is necessary to ensure that medical problems
are addressed. The facility shall have the veterinarian evaluate the prairie dog in order to establish an appropriate
treatment plan.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility keeps a few animals year round and acquires other animals for the fall exhibit season. Acquisition
records for the current animals on exhibit are not complete. Some animals such as the kangaroo, goats, bison, and
a baby camel being exhibited have no recorded acquisition information. For the other animals exhibited, the
information is not complete. For each animal on exhibit, the facility needs to record the following: the name andaddress of person from whom the animal was acquired, their USDA number or driver's license and plate numbers,
date acquired and species/number acquired. Acquisition records are necessary to allow identification of animals and
to allow medical and legal tracing of the animals. The facility shall make and keep records for all animals acquired
that includes all the required information. Correct by Nov 15, 2014.
3.77(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The marmoset exhibit housing two marmosets is located in a sheltered barn structure. The lighting in the structure is
very poor especially on cloudy days (current conditions) and is not adequate for evaluating the enclosure and the
animals. It was difficult to inspect the enclosure and required a flashlight and camera flash in order to detail the lack
of cleanliness of the enclosure (especially the lower portions of the enclosure). Even with a flash, the lack of light
made taking photos difficult. The sheltered housing facility must be lighted well enough to permit routine inspection
and cleaning of the facility and observation of the non-human primates. Correct by Oct. 21, 2014.
3.78(a)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The two snow macaques have been moved to a new enclosure such that they are currently being housed outdoors
(previously had sheltered housing). The attending veterinarian has not yet evaluated the macaques in order to
determine that they are acclimated to the prevailing temperatures and humidity of the outdoor housing. This is
necessary in order to ensure that they can tolerate the range of temperatures and climatic conditions known to
occur at the facility without stress or discomfort. Only those non-human primates that the attending veterinarian has
determined (and documented) to be acclimated to prevailing temperatures and humidity may be housed outdoors.
Correct by Nov. 14, 2014.
3.78(b) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The two outdoor housed snow macaques only have one pet taxi crate available for shelter. There is no roof, solid
top or solid sides on their enclosure. This one crate has no flap or protection from the elements at the entrance and
is actually lying upside down with the openings on the side near the ground. There are pools of water present on the
floor of the crate with only a limited dry area on which a macaque can sit. It has been raining with thunderstorms,
some severe over the last few days. Outdoor housing facilities must provide adequate shelter from the elements at
all times to include protection from sun, rain, snow, wind and cold and any other weather condition that may occur to
provide for the comfort and health of the non-human primates. Correct by Oct. 21, 2014. 3.78(c) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The two outdoor housed snow macaques only have one pet taxi crate available for shelter.It has been raining with
thunderstorms, some severe, over the last few days. The crate is small for two macaques to use comfortably
enough to be able to make normal postural positions. In addition, the male is a dominant and aggressive individual.
The facility representative has reported that they have to feed the two seperately as the male won't let the female
have access to the food otherwise. During the inspection today, only the male was noted using the crate. Multiple
shelters or other means to ensure protection from the outdoor elements for each non-human primate must be
supplied when aggressive/dominant individuals are being housed. Correct by Oct. 21, 2014.
3.80(a)(2)(7) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The two snow macaques currently are housed in an outdoor enclosure made of welded wire on all sides and the
top. There is no provision for shade. There is only one small crate in the enclosure but sun can still enter through
the open door and holes in the sides. Shade is necessary to prevent heat stress and discomfort to the animals from
direct sunlight. The enclosure shall provide sufficient shade to shelter all the nonhuman primates housed in the
enclosure at one time. Correct by Oct. 21, 2014.
3.80(b)(2)(1) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A spider monkey over 6 months of age requires a primary enclosure having a floor area of at least 25.1 sq ft and a
height of at least 84inches. A young female spider monkey almost one year old is currently being housed in her
primary enclosure which measures approximately 30 inches high and has an approximate square footage of
3.5ftx2ft=7sq ft. This combination of height and floor space does not provide sufficient space to allow the spider
monkey to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement which for spider monkeys
includes brachiation. The spider monkey shall be provided with minimum space to include 25.1sq ft of floor space
and 84 inches of height. Correct by Nov. 15, 2014.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
According to the facility representative, the facility's attending veterinarian retired from practice in August. The new
attending veterinarian has visited the facility during a weekend exhibition but has not yet formally scheduled a visit
to the premises nor has she reviewed and directed the facility's environment enhancement program. Non-human
primates are highly social animals whose psychologically well-being, to include socialization, environmental
enrichment and special considerations, needs to be cared for in order to ensure their overall well-being. Under thedirection of the new attending veterinarian and in accordance with accepted professional standards, the facility shall
develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of the non-human primates. Correct by Nov. 15, 2014.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a stronger than expected odor in front of the marmoset enclosure. The enclosure is difficult to evaluate
because of dark conditions. A flashlight and camera flash were used to note thick black brown buildup on objects
within the enclosure such as a blue enrichment toy on the side of the enclosure and wooden ramp structures in the
bottom of the enclosure. The wire of the enclosure itself was also coated on the bottom and lower sides. Excreta
and wastes must be removed from enclosures daily to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. For scent
marking species, such as these marmosets, hard surfaces in the primary enclosure must be spot-cleaned daily.
Correct from this day forward.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four adult camels are currently being housed at the facility. The enclosure fencing consists of two types of fencing.
Part of the fencing consists of six strands of wire. The top strand only reaches to the top of the leg of the adult
camel. A camel was noted pushing against the wires and simply leaning over to eat the grass on the other side of
the fence. The fence does not appear to be either high enough or strong enough to keep the camels in the
enclosure if they wish to test the fence. The outdoor housing facility shall be structurally sound to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
*The enclosure used to house two prairie dogs is made of wire mesh on all sides, top, and the bottom/floor in a
diamond pattern. The openings are larger than fhe feet of the prairie dogs. The prairie dogs are contantly balancing
themselves on the thin wires of the flooring to prevent their feet from slipping into the openings. There is no bedding
available for foot protection or digging, a normal behavior of prairie dogs. The flooring of the enclosure must be
constructed and maintained in a manner that protects the animals from injury.

*The enclosure previously used to house pigs has been divided into two sections/smaller enclosures at this
inspection. One houses two pregnant female pigs. There is no shade available in this section for these two pigs.
The larger section contains a shelter structure with a solid top which provides some shade inside but the shade
cloth over the shade structure is no longer stretched over the top of the structure and is not functional. Sunlight can
cause overheating or discomfort to the animals. Sufficient shade by natural or artificial means shall be provided toallow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight. Correct by Oct. 21, 2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The enclosure previously used to house pigs has been divided into two sections/smaller enclosures at this
inspection. The smaller section currently houses two pregnant female pigs. There is no shelter structure or natural
shelter from inclement weather present in this enclosure. It has been raining with thunderstorms, some severe, over
the last several days. Shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions shall be prvided for the pigs kept outdoors
to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort. Correct by Oct. 21, 2014.

*An outdoor enclosure currently houses three cavy. There is one pet taxi crate in the enclosure for use as a shelter
structure but the back half of it is filled with brown muddy water and thus it is not usable comfortably by the animals.
Shelter appropriate for the local climatic conditions large enough to house all the animals comfortably shall be
provided for the cavy kept oudoors. Correct by Oct. 21, 2014.
3.127(c) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The enclosure previously used to house pigs has been divided into two sections/smaller enclosures at this
inspection. Eight pigs of various sizes were noted in the larger section of which the entire ground was a large mud
pit filled with deep, oozing mud. The smaller piglets were noted standing up to their abdomens in mud. The pigs
were coated with mud on their faces, heads, bodies and legs. Their legs were sunk into the mud past their ankles
and the smaller ones past their knees. The pigs' feet could not be evaluated because they were sunk into the mud.
Only the shelter structure contained any dry flooring. The smaller section housing the two pregnant pigs was also
muddy but straw had been put down over half the enclosure ground which gave them a drier place to stay. Constant
standing in mud can lead to feet and limb issues along with discomfort.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility currently has a perimeter fence variance for four species (macaque, lemur, kangaroo, camel). The
facility has added the following animals to outdoor enclosures in their seasonal exhibit: zebra, cavy, deer and
African Crested porcupines. An amended variance request submitted was returned to the facility for additional
information which was never resubmitted. A secondary perimeter fence is required to ensure that the animals are
not injured/distressed by outside animals/wildlife/humans and to act as a secondary containment system in case of
escape. The housing facilities for all the outdoor non-farm animal species exhibited must be enclosed by a
secondary perimeter fence of at least 6 ft height or an addition to the current variance needs to be obtained. Previously cited veterinary care non-compliance involving snow macaque has been corrected.
