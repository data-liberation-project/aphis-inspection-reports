3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***There was a large tree that had fallen over and several large limbs had landed across the top of the perimeter
fence on the south side of the facility near the tigers' and liger's enclosure. The limbs had pushed down the top of
the fence and were lying across the top. These limbs could provide ramp-like access over the top of this secondary
containment structure. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
functioning as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence must also be of
sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The licensee must remove the fallen tree from the
fence and ensure that the perimeter fence is constructed and maintained so that it can function as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facilitly at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO), Stephanie Osborne (ACI) and the
licensee.
