At time of inspection there was an open bag of food in the commissary area for the 8 month old wolf hybrid pup.
When the licensee was asked whether this was all the animal received, she stated that she poured blood on his
food as well as supplements. When asked if the attending veterinarian had been consulted regarding this animal's
dietary needs, the licensee said she had not.The attending veterinarian shall be consulted regarding diet
preparation with consideration for the age, species, condition, size and type of animal. Open bags of fed need to be
