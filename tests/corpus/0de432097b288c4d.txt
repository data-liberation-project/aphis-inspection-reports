2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee has incomplete acquisition and disposition records for 2 non-human primates, 25 goats and 10 rabbits.
The record for a squirrel monkey is missing the following:
1) Name and address of the person from whom this animal was acquired.
2) The USDA license number of the person from whom this animal was acquired (or vehicle license number and state or
driver’s license number if not licensed).
3) The name and address of the person to whom this animal was sold or given.
4) The date of purchase or acquisition of this animal.
5) the date of sale or disposition of this animal.
6) The species of the animal.

The records for a spider monkey, white artic and two silver foxes are missing the following:
1) The address of the person from whom this animal was acquired.
2) The USDA license number of the person from who this animal was acquired (or vehicle license number and state or
driver’s license number if not licensed).
Incomplete acquisition and disposition information interferes with the inspection process and the ability to track the

movement of regulated animals. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly
disclose all of the required information in 2.75 (b) (1) for animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise
acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under this or her control, or which is transported,
sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The record shall include any offspring born of any
animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. Correct from this date forward.
2.78(a)

Health certification and identification.
* On approximately February 1, 2022 one squirrel monkey was transported in commerce to a licensee in Kansas. No
health certificate accompanied the non-human primate to Kansas. Health certificates for non-human primates help to
ensure that they appear free of any infectious disease or physical abnormality that would be a danger to themselves,
other animals, and the public. A health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian must accompany all non-human
primates. It must state that the veterinarian inspected the non-human primate on a specified date which shall not be more
than 10 days prior to the transportation of the non-human primate. To be corrected from this date forward.
3.81

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
* The facility does not have a copy of the environmental enhancement plan available during this inspection. The
written plan allows APHIS inspectors to determine if the facility is meeting the needs of the nonhuman primates in a
manner approved by the attending veterinarian. This is particularly important with special considerations such as with the
individually housed nonhuman primate that this facility has. Lack of an environmental enrichment plan can lead to
behavioral problems. The licensee must have a written plan for environmental enhancement for nonhuman primates that
is approved by the attending veterinarian and made available for APHIS inspectors upon request. To be corrected by
3/28/22.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
