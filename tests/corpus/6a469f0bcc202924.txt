2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
01-Jun-17.
The licensee was not available to conduct the inspection, and the licensee's wife did not have adequate knowledge
of the pertinent records. Without access, the inspection process is impossible. The licensee must ensure that a
knowledgeable facility representative is available during regular business hours to accompany APHIS inspection.
Correct from this time forward.
