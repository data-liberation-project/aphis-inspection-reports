3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces (3) Cleaning.
In the elevated outdoor enclosures, the enclosure on the far left had an excessive amount of dirt and grime on the
walls of the inside portion of the enclosure. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential for a healthy environment and
reduces disease hazards by eliminating harboring places for diseases. The licensee must clean this enclosure and
must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.1(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(e) Storage
Open supplies of food and bedding were being improperly stored. A partially used bag of dog food was sitting on a
chair outdoors. The top of the bag was open with a plastic tarp draped over part of the bag. The facility
representative stated that this dog food was being used to feed the dogs. Inside the whelping building, a partially
used bag of wood shavings for bedding was lying on the floor. Improperly stored food and bedding can become
contaminated by pests such as insects and rodents. Storing dog food outdoors can also attract animals such as
raccoons, opposums, and skunks that can harbor diseases that can affect the health of the dogs. The licensee
must store all open supplies of food and bedding in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids.
3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements. (4) Contain clean, dry bedding.
None of the outdoor shelters contained adequate clean, dry bedding for the ambient temperature of just below 50
degrees F at the time of the inspection or for the ambient temperature of less than 30 degrees F the night before.
The licensee is currently using wood shavings as bedding.
***In the elevated outdoor enclosures, the enclosure on the far left which housed a short-haired Dachshund, had a
shelter with wood shavings for bedding. However, all of the shavings were completely wet. Likewise, an igloo usedas shelter for Beagles had shavings that were completely wet.
***In the outdoor enclosures nearest the field, one enclosure housing two Cocker Spaniels and another enclosure
housing one Pug had almost no bedding with the majority of the shelter flooring being visible. The other shelters
had varying amounts of bedding, but not enough for the temperatures that the dogs were experiencing. Two of the
dogs using outdoor shelters had been recently shaved.
The lack of appropriate amounts of clean, dry bedding increases the risk of illness, stress, frostbite, and
hypothermia in the dogs. The licensee must provide an appropriate amount of clean, dry bedding for temperatures
below 50 degrees F and must provide additional bedding when temperatures fall below 35 degrees F. The
inspectors pointed out that a winter storm was expected that night and the following day; therefore, the dogs needed
more bedding before the end of the day. However, the facility representatives stated that providing bedding was
futile because the dogs track the bedding out of the shelters. The inspectors stated that bedding will have to be
replaced repeatedly as long as the ambient temperatures warrant bedding.
3.6(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(c) Additional requirements for dogs - (1) Space.
A black Labrador puppy was housed in an enclosure that did not provide the required head space of 6 inches.
Adequate head space is necessary to allow dogs to make normal postural movements. The licensee must ensure
that the interior height of all primary enclosures is at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the
enclosure when the dog is in a normal standing position.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 6, 2015.
On February 23, 2015, the Attending Veterinarian came to the facility and examined all of the dogs.
***The veterinarian(cid:25)s notes stated that the male Boston Terrier named (cid:28)Mister(cid:29) (DOB 3/31/07) was too thin for
breeding. The vet also noted that the skin condition resulting in hair loss appeared to be improving. The licensee
has this dog separated from any females. This dog was dewormed and his food was changed. The dog appears to
be gaining weight.
***The veterinarian(cid:25)s notes stated that 3 dogs in the kennel, including (cid:28)Willie(cid:29) (#00070C34D8) needed to have
dental cleanings. The licensee has made appointments for (cid:28)Willie(cid:29) and one other dog to have dental cleanings next
week. The vet noted that the third dog needed a dental cleaning within the next 6 months.
***The veterinarian did not note any problems with the female pug named (cid:28)Sally.(cid:29)
***The black and white female Shih Tzu named (cid:28)Oreo,(cid:29) the male Poodle named (cid:28)Paul (#95600008678081),(cid:29) and the
male Shih Tzu named (cid:28)Willie(cid:29) have had their matted hair removed.The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted by Konnie Plumlee-VMO and Katy Vernon-ACI with facility
representatives on March 3, 2015. An exit briefing was also conducted via phone with the licensee's wife on March
4, 2015.
