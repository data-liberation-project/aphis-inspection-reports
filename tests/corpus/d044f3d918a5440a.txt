ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A geriatric agouti is laying on its side and is unalert and inactive. The animal appears thin and has regional hair loss
on the face, neck and along his legs. The animal has difficulty standing and is uncoordinated when it walks. The
owner explained that he has noticed these issues and that the agouti has been having these problems intermittently
over the past few weeks. However, the owner said that he has not communicated these issues with the attending
veterinarian for guidance on potential veterinary care needed. Changes in the health condition of a geriatric animal
should be communicated with the attending veterinarian in a timely manner so that decisions regarding veterinary
care for the well-being of that animal may be addressed.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The interior wall of the rabbit enclosure has an exposed nail protruding into the nest box area at the level of the
rabbit's eyes, and the wood is chewed in a 12 inch diameter area with loss of paint and an rough surface. These
conditions could lead to injury of the animal. This enclosure needs to be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the rabbit from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The current perimeter fence is still only 4 feet high and is not of sufficient height to keep animals contained if
they are out of the primary enclosure. Additionally, a 4 foot high fence does not prevent unauthorized access to the
animals. Fences less than 6 feet high for animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The perimeter
fence needs to be addressed to ensure the safety of the animals.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
