3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
In the temporary holding/quarantine pen containing three, adult goats, the ground is diffusely wet, with ~2 inches of mud
from rain water and urine that has not drained out of the enclosure; there are no dry areas for the animals to stand.
Standing water and mud can cause animals discomfort, promote skin and hoof problems, and encourage the growth of
pathogens as well as the presence of pests and vermin. The licensee must provide a suitable method to rapidly eliminate
excess water or otherwise prevent the situation where the animals have no dry surfaces on which to stand and walk to
reach food and water. Any methods for correcting drainage shall comply with applicable Federal, state and local laws and
regulations pertaining to pollution control or the protection of the environment.
TO BE CORRECTED BY OCTOBER 15, 2022.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
As of the date of inspection, no progress has been made on repair/replacement of the perimeter fence to ensure that it is
sturdy and can serve the intended purpose of a true perimeter fence:
The perimeter fence is less than six feet in height around the "Yard" pen at the front of the facility. Additionally, the rear
perimeter fence line is in poor repair and is constructed of weathered wooden and metal posts connected with broken


and/or sagging wire; it is less than six feet in height all along its visible length. Neither of these fence sections are true
perimeter fences because they are functioning as the walls of primary enclosures and can therefore not serve as a
secondary containment system for any escaped animals; they also cannot prevent other animals and unauthorized
persons from entering. These situations pose a risk of injury for both people and animals. The licensee must modify the
existing fence(s) or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 6 feet in height (for the species inventoried at
the time of this inspection), a minimum of three feet from the primary enclosures, and constructed so that the fence(s)
protect(s) the animals by restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it,
or having contact with the animals in the facility.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There is a turkey carcass lying on the ground in the "backyard" housing the majority of the goat herd, one adult kangaroo
and one donkey.
The presence of dead and decaying animals can attract pests and vermin and be a source of disease-causing agents and
odors. Premises must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from illness and injury, and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in the Animal Welfare regulations.
