On the night of 1/25/2020, an incident at the facility resulted in a male tufted Capuchin needing to be tranquilized on
the morning of 1/26/2020. The licensee requested assistance from a neighboring facility in order to accomplish this
task. According to the attending veterinarian, the instructions to the licensee was to contact the attending
veterinarian for instructions when sedation of any kind is required at the facility. The licensee did not contact the
attending veterinarian concerning this matter until the incident was over. The male Capuchin was examined by the
attending veterinarian on the morning of 1/27/2020 to ensure that the animal was without injury.
Lack of accurate and timely information to the attending veterinarian increases the risk of injury or illness to the
animals. The licensee must relay accurate and timely information to the veterinarian as required.
To be corrected from 1/29/2020 forward.
