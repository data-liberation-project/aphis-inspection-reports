ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female blackbuck had a prolapsed rectum about the size of a fist. This animal had given birth a couple of
weeks ago at which time this first occurred. Rectum was replaced and animal seemed fine, but now the prolapse
has recurred and vet had not been notified. Need to obtain vet care and/or euthanasia as soon as possible to
prevent further pain/distress. Correct by June 10, 2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is no eight foot perimeter fence for the two newly acquired hyenas. There is also no six foot perimeter fence
for three fox and two kangaroos housed near the hyenas. Currently there is only 3-4 foot high farm fence at the
perimeter in this area. Need to construct an 8 foot high perimeter fence for the hyenas and at least a 6 foot
perimeter fence for the fox and kangaroos that completely surrounds the enclosures and prevents unauthorized
people and other animals from contact. Correct June 30, 2014.
