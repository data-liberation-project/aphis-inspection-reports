ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10am on
10-DEC-18.The licensee was unable to be available for an inspection and was not able to provide another person to
show us through the facility for an inspection.
I asked that the licensee contact me with any times or days that are better to try and conduct an inspection if there
have been changes.
