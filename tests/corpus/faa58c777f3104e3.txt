2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult red male miniature daschund with microchip number 497A440351 has a hole in his upper right gums
between where the canine and cheek teeth would be. He is missing all of his teeth on the right side. The hole in his
upper gums is approximately the same size as the diameter of a pencil. The left upper canine and the cheek teeth
have a brownish green material covering approximately 75 percent of the surface. The gums on both sides are
swollen and reddened. None of the other teeth on the left side could be visualized and photographs were difficult to
take due to the dog's reluctance to let the inspector examine the inside of his mouth. The dog was observed licking
frequently and his tongue was hanging out of the side of his mouth. The licensee stated she had not noticed this
behavior.

Open wounds and other problems in the mouth can be painful, make it difficult to eat, can lead to the development
of other health problems, and can affect the well-being of the animal.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and provide the
inspector the documentation of this visit upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals are given proper
veterinary care at all times. The licensee made an appointment with the veterinarian while the inspector was still at
the facility.
