3.14(c)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Three puppies arriving at SFO on Alaska Airlines flight 3494 in two shipping crates with waybill numbers 027-9029-3464
and 027-9029-2333 did not have a Consignor's Certification statement regarding feeding and watering. There was no info
regarding when the puppies were last offered food and water, when they should be fed and watered again, and no
signature from the consignor with time and date.

Failure to provide feeding and watering instructions clearly displayed on the crate could result in inadequate care for the
puppies especially in the event of delays in transit. Airline must ensure that these requirements are met at the time that
the animals are accepted for transport.
3.15(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Three puppies arriving at SFO on Alaska Airlines flight 3494 in two shipping crates with waybill numbers 027-9029-3464
and 027-9029-2333 were inspected in the cargo office. It was found that tape used to attach items to the top of the crates
was covering nearly half of the ventilation openings on the sides of the crates.



When accepting animals for transport, the airline must ensure that the enclosures have adequate ventilation, and that
ventilation openings are not obstructed. Failure to do so could result in harm to the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with airline representatives in the cargo office.
