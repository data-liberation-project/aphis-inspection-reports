ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 a.m. on
07/09/2014.
Facility was open for business; however a facility representative informed me that there was not any one available
this week that would know anything about the license or where the records are kept. She advised me that the
person that I would have to talk to was on vacation and would not be back in until next week. I left my business card
and asked her to have that person contact me once they return.
