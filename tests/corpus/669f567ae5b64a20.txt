FACILITIES, GENERAL.
This facility lacks back up electrical power for the marine mammal housing building. In addition to this, Two large
standing fans and one small window fan are the only cooling system for the three dens at night.This is not enough
to cool this area during times of extreme temperature conditions. The polar bears are placed in their dens at 18:00
hours and let out at 0:730 hours for a total lock down time of thirteen and a half hours every night. There was no
generator to turn on the fans during the two power outages that the zoo reported in August 2016. Temperatures in
Ohio at this time were still in the high 70’s to 80 degrees at night. Extremely hot warm temperatures without
adequate cooling could greatly affect the health and comfort of the three adult and one juvenile polar bear locked
inside for thirteen and a half hours. The facility must provide adequate fans and a backup generator for the hot
weather and-or power outages.
