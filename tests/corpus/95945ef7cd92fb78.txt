Dog with USDA tag #019, Yorkshire terrier male, was noticed to have an excessive amount of watery discharge
around the eyes and licking its mouth. Upon further examination, this dog was noticed to have an excessive buildup
of dental calculi on a majority of his teeth. There were areas where the gum line was red and swollen. In addition,
there were areas that the gum line has started to recede. Having dental issues can cause the dog pain and
discomfort if left untreated. Licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of
the examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained and made available for inspection.
