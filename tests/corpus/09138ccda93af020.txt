FEEDING.
-The freezer used to store the meat for diets has an excess accumulation of frost and can no longer be effectively
cleaned.
-The floor in the hay storage shed cannot be seen due to the accumulation of hay, so it can serve as a harborage
for pests or vermin.
Storing food in clean storage areas prevents contamination of the food, prevents infestation by vermin and
maintains the wholesomeness of the food. A system of maintenance and cleaning should be in place to maintain
the cleanliness of the food storage areas.

SANITATION.
In the hare enclosure, the bed is ripped, exposing the stuffing that has been pulled out and contains excreta
intermixed with the fibers. The staff describes cleaning the bed by brushing the excreta off it, but they cannot wash
the bed anymore due to the hole. Brushing excreta off does not effectively clean bedding material, and the bed
should be replaced to facilitate cleaning.In the raccoon enclosure, the floor consists of wire mesh covered by dirt. In one particular area the dirt has been
worn or washed away to create a 1-2 inch space under the wire where excreta and other materials can be caught.
This area under the wire floor cannot be effectively cleaned.
A system of maintenance should be in place to ensure that the primary enclosures are able to be cleaned and
maintained in order to protect the health of the animals.
