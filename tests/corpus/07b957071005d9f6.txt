RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** This facility did not have records of animals previously on-hand, nor acquisition or disposition records of those
animals. There are currently no regulated animals at the facility. The licensee did produce records showing
vaccinations given by the attending veterinarian but did not have acquisition/disposition records for the animals.
This facility purchases new animals each year for exhibition and sells them once the season is over according to the
licensee. The facility must ensure that accurate records are maintained, including the purchase and sale of animals
each year. This assists in the inspection process and ensures animal tracking can be completed, if needed. This is
especially important in the event of a disease outbreak. Correct this by maintaining complete and accurate records.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The pasture fencing that serves as the outdoor enclosure for the goats and sheep requires repair. There are areas
where the fencing is bowed or loose from the structural supports. Also, the electric fencing has several areas where
the wire is either broken, loose from the plastic insulator carriers, or in contact with weeds and grasses that could
affect the function of the fence. Fencing in disrepair poses an injury risk for the animals and may not adequately
contain the animals. Facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair. Currently, there
are no animals in this enclosure.
