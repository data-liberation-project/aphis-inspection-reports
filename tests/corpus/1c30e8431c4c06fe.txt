Outdoor housing facilities.
There is a large wooden post and a large tree limb that have fallen onto the perimeter fence, behind the grivet enclosure,
which have caused the fencing to bow inward.
Areas of the perimeter fence which are in a state of disrepair impact the integrity of the fence and can potentially allow
the entry of other animals.
Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they prevent entry of unauthorized persons or other unwanted species.
Correct by removing the post and tree limbs from the perimeter fence.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There are tall weeds surrounding the outside housing area for the three brown capuchins. The weeds are approximately
two feet in height and surround a majority of the enclosure.
Uncontrolled weeds can make it difficult to facilitate cleaning of the premises and can allow for harborage of pests.
The weeds must be cut in order to maintain proper husbandry practices and pest control.

Facilities, general.
In the fallow deer enclosure, there are several areas in a state of disrepair. On the spring house, a piece of metal roofing
material has been torn from the rear right corner of the building which has created an approximately six inch by four foot
gap in the roof. There is an additional 12 inch by 12 inch piece of metal roofing missing from an area below the above
mentioned gap. This area is covered by a wire panel but still contains jagged edges which could cause injury if the deer
were to step through the paneling. The spring house is built into the the hillside which would allow the deer to have
access to the gaps and sharp edges in the roof. The other small building, in the same enclosure, has several rusted
roofing panels which are becoming detached from the structure.
These areas of structural instability, sharp edges, and detached roofing could cause injury or entrap the animals.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain them. The facility must remove, repair, or replace the above mentioned items to ensure the
safety and well-being of the regulated animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
