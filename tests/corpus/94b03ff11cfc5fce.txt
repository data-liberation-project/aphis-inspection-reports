Sanitation.
There are accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding in four enclosures in rack # 1, housing adult guinea pigs and their
offspring. Soiling bedding has not been removed in over a week. Ineffective and infrequent cleaning exposes the animals
to increased ammonia odors and to potential disease hazards. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to
prevent accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by
cleaning enclosures on a more frequent basis to prevent accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding. Correct by January
20, 2023.
