2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) approved protocol identified as AUP-2015-03-7329 specifies
that water restriction may be utilized to motivate desired behaviors. The protocol specifically states that "The animal will
then determine its daily fluid consumption over the course of two to three weeks, and this amount is considered the
animal's daily fluid allotment." The inspectors were shown a dry erase white board on the wall that listed the daily fluid
allotment for each animal on water restriction. For the macaque monkey identified as 14C006 that amount was 200 ml per
day.

The protocol goes on the explain that "If the animal does not earn its daily fluid allotment in the session, the difference will
be supplemented in a water bottle on the home cage."

Upon examination of the water intake records for 14C006 for the first twenty days of this month it was discovered that on
eleven of those days this animal did not receive the full 200 ml, and in fact on six days he only received 100 ml, for
example where 50 ml was consumed during the session, and only 50 ml was then provided to him back in his enclosure
afterward.



Whereas the animal was also being monitored for dehydration via checking his weight, skin elasticity, and stool
consistency, and no ill effects were noted, this failure to adhere to the approved protocol constitutes a significant change
and cannot be carried out without IACUC approval.

Water restriction has the potential to be distressing to the animal, and should be carefully monitored. The facility should
take measures to ensure that significant changes to protocols do not occur without IACUC approval. To be corrected from
this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
