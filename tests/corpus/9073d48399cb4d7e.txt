Primary enclosures.
On June 16th 2021, a rhesus macaque was found dead, entrapped in the cable used to open and close the shift door of
its primary enclosure. According to a facility representative and the facility’s review of the incident, the clasp used to
secure the cable and keep the shift door closed may not have been positioned correctly, creating laxity in the cable. The
animal, while in its enclosure, was able to get caught in the cable resulting in injury. Primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so that nonhuman primates are protected from injury.

This item was corrected by the IACUC through a temporary and immediate redesign of the door mechanism and
retraining animal care staff on new husbandry practices. The facility is also in the process of replacing all shift doors with
a new type.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conducted from 06/17/2021 to 06/21/2021.
