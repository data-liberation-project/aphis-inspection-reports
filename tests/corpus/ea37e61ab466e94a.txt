Facilities, general.
During the inspection of the barn facilities, USDA inspectors identified several pens in the barn in need of repair. Several
wooden enclosures housing domestic goats had broken 2x4 boards with large jutting edges. An enclosure housing two
juvenile domestic cattle had sections of warped metal edges that posed a risk of injury to the animals. An enclosure
housing one Red deer had sections of its wooden gate that had splintered and come apart. A young bison juvenile was
observed to have entrapped its head under the metal bar of its enclosure gate. The animal was vocalizing and struggling
to free itself for a period of 1 to 2 minutes before an individual unlocked the metal gate and released the animal. The
manner in which this animal entrapped itself could have led to serious injury or death. The facility must ensure that the
indoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.

Sanitation.
The inspection of the barn pens revealed the presence of human trash (plastic drink bottles, food containers, old food
wrappers) in and around animal areas. These objects were seen in the bottle baby pen area, the pen housing two Nilgai,
in the runways for moving animals and above the enclosures housing red kangaroos. The facility manager explained that


their staff had been instructed to pick up trash approximately every two hours. The current housekeeping practices are not
effective in keeping the premises clean and in good repair. The presence of trash items in and around animal areas poses
a risk of foreign body ingestion for the animals and also attracts pests. The facility must create and implement an effective
plan for removing trash in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set
forth in this subpart.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
On the second day of inspection, USDA inspectors observed an excessive swarming of insect pests on and around
animals within the auction barn. Two domestic calves were covered in numerous flies. The calves were flicking their ears
and swishing their tails in agitation. In the area adjacent to the warm room under the barn, numerous flies were flying
amongst the animals in their transport cages. The facility manager explained that their current pest control program
included hanging up fly bait bags around the barn. She identified them throughout the rest of the inspection of the facilities
however, there were no bags in the areas with the worst accumulation of insect pests. Excessive amounts of flies can
cause distress and injuries to the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian
and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.
Correct prior to the next auction.
3.138(d)

Primary conveyances (motor vehicle, rail, air and marine).
Metal transport caging housing 4 red river piglets did not have solid bottoms attached to them. The solid bottoms are
intended to protect the animal held within from coming in contact with discarded food, water, and urine and/or waste
material produced by itself or other animals. Cross contamination of these materials between individuals and between
species poses a risk of zoonotic disease and parasite transfer. Primary enclosures used to transport live animals shall


have solid bottoms to prevent leakage during shipment.
Correct prior to next auction.

The inspection took place on October 1st-2nd. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Office Manager
and Attending Veterinarian.
