2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee has relocated to a new address and APHIS Animal Care was not notified of the change 90 days prior to the
move. Notification of changes in business locations are necessary to ensure Animal Care has assessed the new housing
arrangements and activities to meet the appropriate standards for all regulated animals on hand, as enforced by the
Animal Welfare Act.

Licenses are issued to specific persons, and are issued for specific activities, types and numbers
of animals, and approved sites. A licensee shall notify Animal Care no
fewer than 90 days and obtain a new license before any change in the name,
address, substantial control or ownership of his business or operation,
locations, activities, and number or type of animals described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
