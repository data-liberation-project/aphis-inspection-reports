FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***This facility has made significant progress on correcting the issues with the perimeter fence. Maintenance
personnel were present and met with the inspector to show the work in progress and the time line to have the
fencing completed was also discussed. The facility has corrected the items listed on the previous inspection that
were a concern near the main staff entrance. There are just a few more sections of fencing that need to be
completed before the perimeter fence is completed and compliant.
This was a focused inspection on the progress of work completed for the facility perimeter fence.
An exit briefing was conducted with the Director and head keeper at the time of the inspection.
