RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The Disposition 7006 forms have not been used when selling regulated animals. There are receipts with most of the
required information being kept, however the ID numbers of the animals sold are not on the receipt, and the proper
7006 Disposition forms have not been used.
All records must be kept on the correct forms, including all sales, donations and transfers on the Disposition of Dogs
and Cats 7006 form.
The licensee must utilize the Disposition 7006 form and fill it out completely with the required information for all
sales, donations and transfers of regulated animals.

3.1(c)(3)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are six primary enclosures that have rubber mats that have a buildup of dirt and grime around the edges
between the mats and wall and throughout the dimpled/pegged surface of the mat that holds dirt to it. The flap doors
that lead to the outdoor runs have a heavy buildup of brown/black grime on both sides of the door, and around the
inserts and inside walls around the doors where the dogs faces rub when opening the flaps. The cement instep
along the front of these 6 kennels have a thick buildup of dirt, hair and grime that has not been cleaned properly and
is also building up on the bottom of the fence. While the kennel runs are very clean and kept up daily, the indoor
areas have not been scrubbed and sanitized in several weeks.
A buildup of dirt and grime on the surfaces of the kennel that the regulated animals come in contact with can be a
possible health issue and source of disease and bacteria.
All surfaces, flooring, walls, matts, fencing, door flaps and inserts must be cleaned thoroughly and sanitized at least
once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of hair, dirt and grime.
