2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- In an outdoor enclosure there was a year old, male Boston Terrier named "Brutus" that had a moist looking,
reddish 1/2''(cid:29) prolapsed growth of tissue protruding from the lower medial corner of the left eye and a 1/4'' red, moist
prolapsed growth of tissue protruding from the lower medial corner of the right eye. This could be caused by
infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee had noticed the
red masses in each eye approximately four months ago and this animal had not yet been seen by a veterinarian for
an evaluation. The animal's vision did not appear to be affected at the time of the inspection. This animal must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated. Documentation (health records)
should be available on all medical problems and made available to the inspector. The diagnosis and any
recommended treatment must be part of the documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.

3.3(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
- In the sheltered housing portion of the facility containing four dogs, there was not any working air conditioning
inside the building. The licensee stated that two separate air conditioners were installed in the spring and neither
one worked so the dogs had been without cool air inside the building all summer long. The ambient temperature
outside was 97 degrees. The dogs did not appear to be overheated and had adequate shade and water. The doors
on each end of the building had been propped open creating a nice breeze inside the building. Allowing the
ambient temperature in a sheltered housing facility to exceed 85 degrees F for more than four hours at a time can
result in heat related stress and illness in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the ambient temperature must
not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs are present in the building.

WATERING.
- There were six water receptacles that had an algae looking substance in them. The receptacles are located in
outdoor enclosures with shade structures. There are 12 dogs drinking from the receptacles. The licensee stated that
they were cleaned every two weeks. Contaminated water is no longer considered to be safe for the dog to drink and
could lead to potential health risks. It indicates that a lack of cleaning and sanitation is occurring often enough to
prevent the water from becoming contaminated. The licensee must ensure all water receptacles are cleaned and
sanitized once every two weeks or more often if needed for the health and well-being of the dogs.
