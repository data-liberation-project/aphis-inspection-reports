2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The inspector reviewed Protocol 3655 and three associated animal medical/surgical/anesthesia records (Rabbit
#16008, Rabbit #16006 and Rabbit #16005). Record review indicated that the animal activities are not being
conducted as outlined in the protocol. The protocol states that all animals will be weighed weekly, however the three
records reviewed indicate that animals were weighed on 6/21/16, and no weights have been recorded since that
time. The protocol also states that the animals will be sedated with a volume range of 0.25-0.5 mL of a
Ketamine:Rompun mixture, however the three records reviewed indicate that the animals received a dose of 1.1-1.2
mL of the mixture for sedation prior to a surgical procedure. Continuing review of animal activities is necessary in
order to ensure that all animal activities are conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations. The
IACUC must conduct a review of the activities involved in the aforementioned protocol and ensure that all animal
activities are conducted as stated in the protocol, or that the protocol is amended to reflect the activities as they are
conducted.
