Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female mini-golden doodle (tattoo #45, microchip #2778172) has an abnormal mass between the toes of the right hind
foot. The mass is approximately 1 inch in diameter, inflamed, and slightly reddened. A small amount of discharge is
coming from a dark red area located in the center of the mass. The condition of the dog's foot has not been identified by
the facility and no treatment has been provided. Abnormal conditions of the foot could cause pain and discomfort to the
animal.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must
be evaluated by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The licensee must
ensure each dog receives adequate veterinary care at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
