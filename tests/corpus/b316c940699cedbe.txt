2:30 pm on 29-NOV-17.Inspector attempted to contact licensee by (calling cell/home and leaving message,
knocking on door, honking while in driveway). This is the first attempted to accompany the inspector on an animal
welfare inspection.

not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
