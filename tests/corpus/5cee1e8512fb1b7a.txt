PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least two enclosures do not provide the minimum amount of floor space for each dog within. One enclosure
houses three dogs and has a floor space of approximately 5 square feet. The dogs in this enclosure require a
minimum of 10.48 square feet. Another enclosure housing three dogs is also approximately 5 square feet. The
dogs in this enclosure require a minimum of 9.24 square feet. Failure to provide the dogs with the minimum square
footage of floor space could have a negative effect on their health and well-being.
Each dog housed in a primary enclosure must be provided a minimum amount of floor space as directed by the
mathematical calculation located in regulation 3.6 (c)(1)(i) in the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee must provide
these dogs with the minimum amount of floor space for each in order to support their health and well-being.
