HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.1 (c) Surfaces (3) Cleaning.
****In the sheltered facility, several of the access doors to the outside had a build up of a brown oily residue on the
doors and the frames. Two of the enclosures also had a strong ammonia-like smell when in front of them. These
enclosures contained a total of five Pugs and they each had cushions and rubber type mats for the dogs to sit on.
The cushions appeared soiled and discolored. According to the licensee, the cushions had been in the enclosures
for approximately one week. The floor inside these enclosures had an accumulation of dirt, hair and grime along
the edges where the mats meet the floor. The concrete block steps that lead to the access doors also had a large
amount of hair, grime and dirt around their bases and between them and the enclosure sides. Surfaces in contact
with the dogs which are not properly cleaned and sanitized can result in odors, pests and other disease hazards.
The licensee must establish and maintain a program to ensure that all hard surfaces that come in contact with the
dogs are spot cleaned on a daily basis and sanitized no less than once every two weeks to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
3.4 (b) Shelter from the elements.
****In the outdoor enclosures, there are three enclosures that did not have separate areas of shade in addition to
the shelter structures for the dogs. One enclosure contained two adult Siberian Huskies, one contained an adult
Labrador Retriever and the third contained three adult Beagles. The licensee stated that one pen had lost its shade
structure during a storm in the fall from a falling tree branch. The other two enclosures had no additional shade
other than the trees which were without leaves at this time of year. Shade in outdoor enclosures is important to
protect the dogs from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that, in addition to the shelter unit, there
is one or more separate areas of shade that is large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them
from the direct rays of the sun.
