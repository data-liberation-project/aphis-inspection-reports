Primary enclosures.
Three rabbits were housed on the ground in a wire fence primary outdoor enclosure, approximately 3 feet high. The top
was also enclosed in wire except for an uncovered opening measuring approximately 12 inches wide and 30 inches long
at the back right corner. Other animals, including predators, have direct access to the rabbits which may cause stress,
injury, or transmission of diseases. Outdoor housing facilities for rabbits must protect the animals from injury, contain
them and restrict the entrance of other animals.

Sanitation.
The primary outdoor wire enclosure housing three rabbits is located on the ground and the wire is being cleaned with only
soap, water, and a rag as needed. The dirt floor of the enclosure is spot cleaned, and hay is provided. The wire sides and
top of the enclosure are not being sanitized since the water does not reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit and a disinfectant is
not being applied. When enclosures are not sanitized adequately, there is higher risk of large numbers of germs
remaining on the surface which creates a health hazard for the rabbits. Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized
by washing them with hot water (180 degrees F) and soap or detergent, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent


solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two lemurs have access to an outdoor enclosure surrounded by a 6-foot perimeter fence that lacks an adequate distance
from the enclosure at two corners. The perimeter fence is only 5 inches away at the back right corner and only 18 inches
away at the back left corner from the outdoor primary enclosure. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high and 3 feet
from the enclosure is needed with sufficient wire spacing to prevent unauthorized humans and other animals from going
through or under it. Not having an adequate perimeter fence is a safety risk because other animals and/or people may
contact them, and there is not adequate secondary containment. The facility shall ensure the outdoor housing facilities for
the lemurs are enclosed by an appropriate perimeter fence, or a variance, if appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be
requested from the Administrator/Regional Office.

Facilities, general.
Two areas within the outdoor wire fence enclosure housing 4 goats need attention:
• The back right corner of the wire fence has sharp points pointing in toward the enclosure where the wire isn't
securely attached to the corner post from the ground up to a height of approximately 2 feet.
• The metal roof that overhangs both the front and back of the wooden shelter by approximately 2 feet is bent down
and flared outward, so the corners of the metal roof's sharp edges are at an approximate height of 2 feet from the ground
at the rear and 3 feet from the ground at the front.
These sharp edges and points may lead to injury if the animals rub against them. The outdoor housing facilities shall be


structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain them.
