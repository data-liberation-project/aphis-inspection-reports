ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: A male Jamaican fruit bat died at the facility on March 6, 2014. Facility
personnel noted signs/symptoms from February 23, 2014. See citation Section 2.40(b)(3). The bat was not
examined or treated by the attending veterinarian. Treatment as directed by the attending veterinarian may have
been successful and prevented the death of the bat. Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control,
diagnose and treat diseases and injuries as directed by the attending veterinarian for the health of the animals.

2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(3) Veterinary care: Facility records documented health problems in a male Jamaican fruit bat
starting on February 23, 2014. The bat was worse on March 5, 2014 and was put in its own enclosure. The bat
was noted to be cold, lethargic and not eating. Facility personnel gave nursing care, but the bat was noted as
minimally responsive on March 6, 2014. The bat died on March 6, 2014. The attending veterinarian was not
informed about the bat's condition prior to its death. There must be a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication so timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian to direct the care of the animals.
Correct from this day forward.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Section 3.128 Space requirements: Two Jamaican fruit bats are housed in a wire mesh enclosure measuring 24
inches by 24 inches and 20 inches high. The enclosure does not provide sufficient space to allow the bats the
opportunity to fly. Spreading their wings and flying is a normal postural adjustment for bats. The enclosure housing
the bats must provide the bats adequate freedom of movement to fly safely for their health and well-being.
