2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current written program of veterinary care is missing the following components:
*All regulated species to be covered under the program are not listed. Camels, llamas and pigs are missing.
*The method of euthanasia does not contain a dosage, route of administration or name of the drug.
*The parasite control program does not accurately reflect the practices currently used at the facility. The PVC states
dewormers for sheep and goats will be administered every thirty days and are actually administered twice yearly.
*Emergency and after hour coverage should be clarified. It was unclear after discussion with the licensee if the
attending veterinarian can consistently provide emergency services.
The written program of veterinary care should be fully documented and accurately reflect current practices at the
facility. A comprehensive written program is necessary to ensure appropriate husbandry standards are used and
that guidance from the attending veterinarian is communicated and complete.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple goats and sheep were identified during this inspection with overgrown hooves. Animals needing foot trims
because of abnormal hoof length, chipped or curled hooves were seen in livestock pens 1, 2 and 3. Overgrowth and
misshapen hooves can cause structural and gait abnormalities and discomfort. Routine foot care and animal
husbandry should include regular trimming as dictated by hoof growth. Correct by: March 6, 2018.
3.56(a)(3) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The licensee stated that the area underneath the six wire rabbit cages is being utilized as worm bins. There were no
worms or composting material other than rabbit feces under the cages. The fecal material was mounding in some
areas and white or gray in color. Additionally, the metal wall panels immediately adjacent to the cages were coated
with a yellow/tan material. The material was identified as dried rabbit urine and the licensee could not remember the
last time the panels were cleaned. Housing facilities should be maintained in a sanitary condition to minimize disease hazards and protect the health
and well-being of the animals.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following housing facilities were identified as needing repair or replacement:
* Multiple livestock pens had wood panels attached to the sides and interior of the enclosures that were damaged
with resulting holes.
* The self feeder in pen #1 contains a plastic panel that is cracked in multiple areas and has resulting holes.
*The self feeder in pen #1 also had metal flashing accessible to the animals that was damaged, curled and had
sharp points that could cause injury. This flashing was removed and the non-compliance corrected during this
inspection.
*The self feeder in pen #2 has damaged and missing wood on the interior. Underneath the missing wood is
damaged metal with sharp points potentially accessible to the animals. A metal panel on the exterior of the feeder is
damaged and has a hole.
*The panel fence at the back of pen #3 has a hole that was intentionally cut by the licensee. A young goat was
seen during this inspection entering and exiting the pen through this hole. The back fence also has multiple areas
of broken welds with pieces of damaged fence pointing prong-like into the enclosure.
*The self feeder in pen #3 has a metal side panel that is damaged and bent with resulting holes.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair.to protect the animals from injury and
contain the animals. Damage to enclosure structures, furnishings and fencing can cause injury to the animals,
compromise structural integrity and containment. The damaged areas identified above should be repaired or
replaced. Correct the above by: March 6 2018.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
*The top surface of the self feeder in pen #1 had an accumulation of goat feces on the edge directly over the open
area containing food accessible to the animals.
The top surface of the feeder in pen #3 had an accumulation of chicken feces noted in multiple areas.
Food receptacles should be kept clean and sanitary at all times to minimize the risk of food contamination or
deterioration and prevent disease exposure that could compromise animal health. Correct by: February 8, 2018.
3.131(a)
SANITATION. *The enclosure housing 4 pigs had a confluent layer of feces present on the dirt surface. All dry ground areas in
contact with the pigs in the enclosure were feces covered.
*On the same side of the barn the enclosure housing the intact male llama was multi-sectioned and had an area
covered with mounded feces. When the llama is confined only to this section for handling ease there is little surface
area on the ground in contact with the animal that is not feces covered.
Excreta should be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
and to minimize disease hazards that could compromise their health. The llama and pigs were unable to avoid
direct exposure to feces when confined in these primary enclosures. Correct by: February 8, 2018.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee on 2/6/2018. The exit interview was conducted in person with the
licensee on 2/7/2018.
