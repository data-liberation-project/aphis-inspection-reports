2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Upon inspection today, the licensee was unable to provide records or forms that accurately verified the current
animals on hand. During the inspection, both the licensee and inspectors had to collaborate and manually count the
number of animals for some of the species, including Fallow deer, goats, sheep, and rabbits. The licensee was able
to provide an animal census from 2016, but those records had not been updated since then to include newly
acquired animals.
Facilities that lack up-to-date records prevent animals from being tracked as they move from one premise to
another. This is especially important when there are disease outbreaks and its origin confirmed. Further, an
accurate animal census is needed to correctly identify the number and type of species on hand.
Exhibitors shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose acquired or otherwise
owned, purchased, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor. The records shall include any
offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The small ruminant primary enclosure containing numerous sheep and goats is comprised of chain link fencing.
Along one side, the fencing adjacent to the ground had separated from the posts, causing the potential for animal
injury or escape. During the inspection, two goats were observed butting against the fence from opposing sides.
When the goats pushed against the fence, the bottom of the fence was raised high enough that another animal
could easily walk through from either side. Two additional enclosures (llamas and alpacas in one, and camels in
another) had sections of wire fence paneling lying on the ground loose within the enclosure.
Fencing that is not in good repair can injure the animals housed if their skin were to get trapped or snagged by the
loose fencing. Additionally, gaps within the fence line could prevent proper containment of the animals housed, andalso allow other animals to enter the enclosure. The panels present in the two enclosures could cause entrapment
of the legs and/or feet, resulting in trauma or injury to affected extremities.
The outdoor housing facilities must be constructed of such material and such strength as appropriate for the species
involved. The facility must have a system of maintenance so that all structures remain structurally sound and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and efficiently contain the animals.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
A white raccoon enclosure containing two raccoons had piles of increased amounts of excreta on the floor of the
enclosure. The licensee stated that he is unable to clean their primary enclosure daily due to the very aggressive
nature of both raccoons. Thus, he cleans their enclosure roughly every two weeks, entering when they are sleeping.
The accumulation of excreta can pose health risks to the animals by contaminating the enclosure and attracting
unwanted wildlife and vermin that may carry diseases.
The licensee should have a practice in place to ensure husbandry standards are met in accordance with the animal
welfare regulations. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
