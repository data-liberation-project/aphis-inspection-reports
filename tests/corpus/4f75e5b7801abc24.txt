ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One aged breeder was found dead at the time of inspection and one litter of newborns had died. These issues
appeared confined to two enclosures but were not recorded or relayed to the attending veterinarian. The animals
need to be monitored daily and recorded to assure early identification of adverse trends which may then be
conveyed to the attending veterinarian. This assures the continued health and wellbeing of the animals. Correct: this
point forward.
