2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Several expired and improperly labeled drugs were found intermingled with current and properly labeled drugs
during the inspection:
**A bottle was labeled as "Diluted Acepromazine 5-8-15". No expiration date was noted.
**Acempromazine maleate bottle expired 3-15
**A bottle was labeled as "Ephedrine Exp 1-15"
Drugs that are expired or are in containers that do not at least identify what the medication is, how it should be
administered, and when it expires are not safe or appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain and
distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.
The facility has established a program to monitor supplies for expired drugs but did not conduct the inspection that
was due around the end of June.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping
The East enclosure housing 2 teaching horses had a large pile of limbs and tree debris extending along
approximately 2/3 of the length of the South fence. There was also a smaller pile of tree limbs near the Northwest
corner of the enclosure that had fallen onto the wire fencing between the two horse enclosure, bending the wires.
The accumulation of the tree limbs and debris was due to storm damage to trees outside of the enclosure as well as
to the one inside the enclosure near the Northwest corner.
These limbs should have been removed from the enclosure as soon as possible to prevent damage to the fencing,
prevent the piles from being a potential hiding place for vermin, and to eliminate the risk of injury to the horses.Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas
and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
A barrier to prevent the horses from getting into the large pile on the South side should be placed by 7/19/2015 to
minimize the risk of injury.
Permanent removal of the debris and repair of any damaged fencing will be done by 7/30/2015.
