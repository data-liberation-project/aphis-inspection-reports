deaths of animals in their care. The list includes one ringtail lemur, 1 bobcat kitten, 2 adult watusi, 2 cavy, 1 fox,
one peacock, one Chinese pheasant and two fallow deer. The applicant has recently acquired 2 Whitetailed deer
fawns. The applicant has no experience bottle raising these animals. The applicants husband stated that the
technician that was hired this spring supposedly had wild and exotic animal experience but they found out she had
only worked at a dog kennel which is also the only experience that the applicants husband has with animals and the
applicant also has not stated that she has any experience with wild or exotic animals.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is allowed to hand feed animals on exhibit including: nine goats and a watusi, . The public may contactthe animals during feeding. Employees or attendants are not present during these times of public contact. One of
the rabbits present at a previous inspection was seen by the attending veterinarian for a back issue that was
causing lameness. The care takers are not aware of how the injury happened because there are no attendants
present at times of public contact. Unattended public contact may result in physical injury to the animals by trauma
or them eating unapproved items. The animals experience mental harm when they are subject to ignorant and
inappropriate human contact. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must
be present at all times during public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Watusi is still in the primary enclosure for the horses. The horse enclosure is in very poor condition and is not
sufficient to contain a Watusi.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
All animals must be contained in an enclosure that is appropriate for the species to prevent escape or injury of the
animals. Repair or replace the Watusi enclosure fencing.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two cavy are in an enclosure that does not have a perimeter fence.
On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet
high for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent
physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such
fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
A perimeter fence must be errected around any enclosure housing a wild or exotic animal to act as secondary
contaiment and to prevent death of the animal by a predator.3.131(a)

Clean the excreta from the cavies enclosure to prevent soiling of the animals and to reduce the risk of disease and
odor.
Exit conducted with a facility representative.
