3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The written program of veterinary care is incomplete. There is no specific frequency or number of animals noted for
sampling dogs for the specific parasites listed in Section 3.13(a)(3). There are also no specific treatment plans listed for
animals with positive test results.
Parasites are a common cause of disease in dogs and, if undetected and not properly treated, can lead to serious illness
and even death. The program of veterinary care must be completed and followed, to include plans for sampling and
treatment for the specific parasites noted in the Section 3.13(a)(3). The missing information must be added to the program
of veterinary care to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
