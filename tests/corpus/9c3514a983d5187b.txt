2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care remains incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of
veterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written
PVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended
treatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration. Regarding frequency of administration, the written PVC says "as needed" for the majority of the
species. There is no guidance elsewhere clarifying what "as needed" means. Additional guidance for the use of
these drugs must be provided in the written PVC for all species for which these drugs are intended to be used.
Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure welfare of the animals
maintained by the facility as mis-communications may lead to failure to provide measures for prevention, control,
and treatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that complete guidance
regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species that are not
specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary (PVC) authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for tranquilization
(without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority of species
including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai, Fallow Deer,
Eland, and Elk. Records on hand show that the facility is still currently using the drug.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysisof respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of
animals. This includes camel, sheep, kangaroo, muntjac deer, goats, porcupines, cows, and mini-zebu cattle.
These animals are housed in multiple areas including the walk through area of the zoo, the production barn, the
dairy barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to the public. There are no barriers or signs present to
discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate. There are no
attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals.
Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch
the animals. Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals.
Licensees must ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or
barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of
attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Guests are allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendant is present in the drivethrough area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: deer,
antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. This facility also has horse drawn wagons that takes
guests thru and allows public feeding with an attendant present. Allowing guests to feed from vehicles without
attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or distance from the
animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public contact.
*** Inspection and exit interview conducted with the facility Farm Manager and facility staff.
