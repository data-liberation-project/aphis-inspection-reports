Sanitation.
Inside the barn the two rabbit cages, each housing one rabbit, has an excess accumulation of feces inside and under the
cages. Both cages have excess debris accumulating on the cage wires. There is dried and smeared brown substance on
the pieces of wood inside the cages. Bacteria and fungus may grow in the excessive debris and feces and cause the
animals to become ill. Rabbit cages should be kept reasonably free of feces and fur to prevent exposure of the animals to
potential disease. The cages must be thoroughly cleaned (inside and outside) as needed to prevent the build-up fur, and
other debris. Feces must be removed and disposed of properly to ensure animals are in a clean environment and not
exposed to vermin or other disease hazards.

there is 5 exposed nail heads protruding outward towards the animals. The exposed nail heads pose a hazard to the
