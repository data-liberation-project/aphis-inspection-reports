2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility is allowing the public to interact with the Asian small-clawed otters and the sloths. There is neither a
restraint on the animals nor a barrier between the animals and the public during these encounters. There have
been two incidents where visitors have been bitten by the otters, and the bite incidents were documented by the
licensee. In addition, at least one visitor has been bitten by a sloth when interacting with the animal.
Otters can be aggressive and have strong teeth and powerful bite. They have the potential to cause serious injury
to a person. Sloths can also bite. The most prominent teeth on a sloth are the two front teeth that they use to bite
off their food, and these teeth are hard and sharp. During public exhibition, all animals must be handled so that
there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public. Some ways this may be achieved are by using a barrier
between the public and the animals, a harness on the otters, or training that requires the animals to respond
immediately to commands.
Correct from this time forward.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The facility does not have a pest control program for flies. There were numerous flies noted in the facility and on
the food, and flies present on the animals. Flies can transmit disease and be irritating to the animals. The licensee
must establish and maintain effective methods of pest control for flies.
