ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Approximately 5 of the 15 Dorper sheep were noted to be lame but ambulating adequately. Several sheep were
also noted to have misshapen and/or cracked hooves. Improper hoof care can lead to gait abnormalities, lameness
and diseases.
***The zebu was noted to have misshapen and mildly overgrown hooves, which has the potential to impact its ability
to ambulate appropriately and can lead to lameness and disease issues. Inspectors noted that the zebu is
moderately overweight. Park Supervisor and Town Administrator stated that the zebu has been professionally
trimmed in past 6 months and are aware that ongoing trimming may be needed.
The Attending Veterinarian is aware of the lameness issues and is working regularly with the facility to correct the
hoof issues throughout the facility. The addition of professional hoof care may needed to correct and stabilize the
current hoof problems using appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases. Correction date:
August 19, 2015.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four raccoons were sighted in the buffalo enclosure in and around the shelter. The inspectors noted that the
raccoons were gaining access/departure by crawling under the enclosure fence behind the shelter. It is important
that the facility be maintained in good repair to exclude unwanted animals from the buffalo enclosure, due to risk of
disease and injury to buffalo. Repair or replace unwanted animals' access point. Correction date: August 12, 2015.
