FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage
***The top of the enclosure housing 3 tigers is constructed with wood and wire panels with 4x4 openings. The
openings allow for rain to come directly into the enclosure. The enclosure is excessively muddy following a heavy
rain the night before. Water has also pooled in the left front of the enclosure. Enclosures should be designed to
prevent the build-up of water and to rapidly eliminate excess water.
Measures must be taken to prevent the settling of an excessive amount of water. Additionally, a method to rapidly
remove excess water from the enclosure must be established and maintained to ensure there are dry areas in the
enclosure for the tigers to walk and/or rest. Correct by July 30, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
This is a focused inspection in response to concerns in a complaint.
