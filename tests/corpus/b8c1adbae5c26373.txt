ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The zebu and the zebra are overdue for hoof trimming. The hooves are too long and need to be trimmed so that
the animals can move without impediment. The licensee stated that the animals will need to be sedated for the hoof
care so the licensee will discuss this and make arrangements with the attending veterinarian.
