3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***On April 11-12, 2015 between 5:00 pm and 7:00 am two dogs gained entry to an outdoor enclosure containing
eight deer at the facility. Six of the deer were run to death while two deer jumped the fence knocking it down in the
process of escaping. Law enforcement was able to catch one dog while one escaped. The security on the premises
supposedly checked the enclosure every hour. The primary enclosure fencing was recently reinforced and there
were no possible deficiencies that could explain the way in which the dogs were able to get in the enclosure.
However there was a storm drain that could have possibly given them access to the deer. Also there were some
noticeable paw tracks in the area of the outside drain. The drain is large enough that a medium-sized animal could
gain access. The weak access point had been addressed pertaining to a previous incident involving a breach in the
enclosure. It was stated that covering the drain to allow only water in could be sufficient in keeping predators out.
The outdoor enclosure should be constructed to keep animals from getting in and possibly injuring the deer. The
facility currently doesn't have anymore white-tailed deer in that enclosure. One deer has been seen on the premises
but they have not been successful in catching/containing him. Covers have been placed over the drain on both ends
as a corrective action.
This was a focused inspection of the white-tailed deer exhibit.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the curator.
