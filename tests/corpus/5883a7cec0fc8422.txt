2.31(d)(1)(iii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Review of Protocol 2020-06: The protocol did not contain a written assurance by the principal investigator that the animal
use activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments.

Per this Section, the IACUC shall determine during the review of proposed animal use activities or significant changes in
ongoing activities that the principal investigator has provided written assurance that the activities do not unnecessarily
duplicate previous experiments. This requirement ensures that the animals under study do not experience research
activities that are unnecessarily duplicative. The IACUC needs to address this deficiency and ensure that all approved
protocols contain a written assurance regarding unnecessary duplication. Correct by 10/19/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
