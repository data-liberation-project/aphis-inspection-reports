In enclosure #8, Frosty a male Maltese dog has an accumulation of green/brown material adhering to the upper
portion of the cheek teeth. The normal tooth structure cannot be identified under this material. Dental issues can
be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal.
In enclosure #3, Benny a male Yorkie has excessive clear mucous discharge from both eyes and the left eye has a
cloudy appearance to the pupil. Color changes and mucous discharge to the eye could be indicative of infection,
injury or other medical issues.

receded away from a portion of the teeth. There is a buildup of green material along the gum line that is receding.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee has acquired a nilgai and has no acquisition form filled out or other information on where the nilgai was
acquired.
The licensee informed the inspectors of two coatimundis(cid:25) were born on the premises and then were sold but there
were no record of disposition with the correct information regarding the transaction of the two animals.
Every dealer must make and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding
the acquisition and disposition of animals other than dogs and cat. This is required to ensure that the transactionsare done legally, so that animals may be properly tracked through during the inspection process, and to ensure the
humane care and use of animals during transport, housing, and exhibition. Ensure that records are available for the
inspector at time of inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
