ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) available at the time of inspection. In order to ensure
problems of animal health are addressed adequately, there needs to be a written PVC. The written PVC shall
include the species being utilized or sold in regulated activities, preventative care, common health problems they
may have and how these will be addressed by the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian. Ensure that the formal
arrangement with the Attending Veterinarian includes a detailed written Program of Veterinary Care and is made
available for review during the inspection process.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Licensee did not during the time of inspection have a record book containing the required information for two dogs
(Luke and Mona Mi) used for exhibition. Identification tags, written descriptions, and clear photographs of these
animals were not available. Appropriate identification of dogs used in exhibition is necessary to ensure that animals
have been acquired legally and are able to be tracked to ensure humane transport, care, and use in regulated
activities. Licensee shall identify all dogs under his or her control whether held, purchased, or otherwise acquired
with the required identification methods under this Section of the AWA regulations.
