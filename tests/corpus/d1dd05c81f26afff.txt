3.78(d) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
There is a large wooden post and a large tree limb that have fallen onto the perimeter fence, behind the grivet enclosure,
which have caused the fencing to bow inward.
Areas of the perimeter fence which are in a state of disrepair impact the integrity of the fence and can potentially allow the
entry of other animals.
Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they prevent entry of unauthorized persons or other unwanted species.
Correct by removing the post and tree limbs from the perimeter fence.
3.125(a) Direct Repeat

Facilities, general.
During the inspection, an injured, adult female fallow deer was found lying down outside the facility's fencing. When
asked about the deer, the facility representative stated that there had been a breach in the fallow deer fencing
approximately two months ago and five fallow deer had escaped at that time. The fencing had been repaired at that time,
but the other fallow deer have not been found. When the facility representative approached the animal, the fallow deer
dragged her back legs behind her as she attempted to walk away. The facility representative immediately restrained the
deer, carried her into a contained area, and the Attending Veterinarian was contacted for further instructions.



In the fallow deer enclosure, there are still several areas in a state of disrepair. On the spring house, two pieces of metal
roofing material have been torn from the rear right corner of the building which has created an approximately 18 inch by 4
foot gap in the roof. There is an additional 12 inch by 12 inch piece of metal roofing missing from an area below the above
mentioned gap. This area is covered by a wire panel but still contains jagged edges which could cause injury if the deer
were to step through the paneling. The spring house is built into the the hillside which would allow the deer to have
access to the gaps and sharp edges in the roof. The other small building, in the same enclosure, has several rusted
roofing panels which are becoming detached from the structure.
Enclosures with gaps, holes, sharp edges, or unstable structures can allow for the entrapment, serious injury, escape, or
death of the animals.
The fallow deer must be evaluated by a Licensed Veterinarian for further diagnosis and treatment of its health issues.
Correct by 10/07/2022.
The facility must also remove, repair, or replace the above mentioned items in the fallow deer enclosure to protect the
animals from injury and contain them.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
