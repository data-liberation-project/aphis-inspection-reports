OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 12 dogs in 4 outdoor enclosures that do not have enough bedding provided in their shelters. There was
some bedding in all of the shelters but bare floor could be seen. Two dobermans were observed shivering. The
outdoor temperature at the time of inspection was 22.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
When the temperature drops below 50 degrees Fahrenheit bedding must be provided for the dogs to stay warm.
When the temperature drops below 35 degrees Fahrenheit extra bedding must be provided so that the dogs can
burrow down into the bedding for additional warmth and protection from the weather.
The licensee must provide additional bedding to all of the outdoor enclosures. Licensee must ensure that clean dry
bedding is provided for the dogs when the temperature drops below 50 degrees Fahrenheit and additional bedding
is provided when the temperature drops below 35 degrees Fahrenheit to protect the dogs from the cold.
