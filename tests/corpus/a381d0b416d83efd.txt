ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 500pm on
07/20/2015.
I knocked on the door and called and left a voice mail with no response. I waited for 20 minutes in the driveway and
left.
