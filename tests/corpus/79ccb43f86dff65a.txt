2.77(b)

Records: Carriers and intermediate handlers.
A copy of the health certificate was not being maintained for all puppies transported across state lines or delivered for
transportation by air. Dealers, brokers, and transporters shall keep and maintain a copy of the health certificate as
required by section 2.78. A copy of the heath certificate needs to be maintained so that APHIS officials can review the
certificate to determine that a licensed veterinarian inspected the dog or puppy not more than 10 days prior to delivery
and that the animals appeared to be free of any infectious or physical abnormality. The licensee must keep and maintain
a copy of the health certificate. Correct by April 14, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
