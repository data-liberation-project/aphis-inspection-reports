3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are many hard surfaces in contact with the dogs that require cleaning. This includes several doggy doors
and back walls of the enclosures. In addition, there are surfaces not in contact with the dogs that require cleaning
including the dirty water supply lines, dusty tops of enclosures, and clumps of hair hanging beneath the enclosure
floors.
All of these areas require cleaning to reduce disease hazards to the dogs and to satisfy accepted husbandry
standards.

FEEDING.
At least half of the self-feeders are either dirty, rusty, or chewed. All feeders must be kept clean and in good repair
to ensure they can be properly cleaned and sanitized. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining all feeders. Worn
or rusty feeders must be repaired or replaced.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces under the top and bottom outdoor enclosures for the sheltered facility.
Failure to remove feces from under the enclosures on a regular basis may lead to disease hazards, insects, pests,
and odors. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining under primary enclosures on a more frequent schedule.
