2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The licensee is not scheduling regular visits to her facility by the Attending Veterinarian (AV). The licensee's
Program of Veterinary Care states that these visits will occur annually, however, the last visit by the AV was on
04/06/15 according to records supplied during the inspection. Licensee confirmed that the veterinarian has not been
to the facility within the past year.
Facility visits are necessary to ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care is being understood and followed by the
licensee, to check the health and well-being of the animals, and to determine if changes in the Program of
Veterinary Care are needed.
The licensee must employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements that include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the facility.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***Next to the shelves holding the enclosures of twenty-eight hedgehogs, there was a shelf with an accumulation of
dirty, used food bowls. On the shelves below, there were several plastic hedgehog “houses” covered in dust and
bits of food, as well as a scale that was also covered in dust.
Accumulation of debris and trash near animal enclosures can lead to pest infestation, disease transmission,
reduced health of the animals, and may be an indication of substandard husbandry practices.(cid:9)
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
