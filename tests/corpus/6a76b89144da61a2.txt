2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white male chinchilla was observed to have a problem with its left front leg. The licensee reported that it was
purchased in March 2016 with a stump left front leg and hadn't had problems with it. In inspection today it was
observed to have crusted tissue and hair around the leg, its foot was missing and bone was protruding from the
center of the lesion. This condition can be painful and the bone protruding from the stump leg is an open route for
infection to enter the chinchilla's leg and needs veterinary treatment. The facility must ensure that the attending
veterinarian evaluates this animal's condition and ensure that the prescribed treatment is followed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the gray fox enclosure, a broken shelf has left several sharp wire points exposed both above and below it. The
fox was laying under the shelf during the inspection, but must stand on this shelf to access it's food dish. The sharp
points could injure the animal.
Repair or replace the shelf to prevent possible injury to the fox.
In the Santa Cruz sheep pen, there is a gap between the fence and the ground measuring approximately one foot
high by three feet wide. This gap is large enough for the smaller sheep to potentially escape from the pen. The gap
also allows for outside animals to potentially gain easy access to the pen.
Repair or replace the section of fence to prevent escapes or unauthorized entrance into the pen.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelters for the zebu cattle and a llama were excessively soiled and muddy. While the animals did have access
to dry ground outside and around the shelters, the soiled shelters would not provide them a dry area for them to getout of inclement weather. Excessively soiled shelters could cause animals discomfort during inclement weather.
For animals' comfort ensure that the shelters are maintained clean and dry.
