2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection four degu pups were discovered dead and were removed by the licensee. The licensee
stated that he had not noticed the four dead degu pups prior to the inspection. He also stated that there were
previous occurrences of degu litters with dead and/or stillborn animals within the previous six months of breeding
the animals. The licensee did not contact the attending veterinarian regarding the previous deaths of degu pups.
Appropriate methods to identify/observe sick, dying, and/or injured animals must be used to ensure proper
diagnoses and treatment of those affected animals in providing adequate veterinary care. A program of adequate
veterinary care must be in place to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries for the health and well
being of the animals housed in the facility. Ensure that all employees are properly trained to make observations and
report any and all animals that show signs of sickness and/or injury in addition to contacting the attending
veterinarian regarding the proper care of the animals.
