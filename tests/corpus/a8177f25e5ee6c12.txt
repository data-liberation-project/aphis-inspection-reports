The lesion at the tip of the tiger Kahn's tail noted on the inspection of 3-5-14, is still present. According to a note
written by the veterinarian it was healing well when he rechecked the cat on 3-10-14. The president stated that the
wound was scabbed over yesterday. The tiger is no longer on antibiotics. Today there is a 4" lesion at the tip of
Kahn's tail which is raw and bleeding. Failure to provide proper treatment to this wound can lead to infection,
suffering and even death. Kahn is suffering due to his current condition. At the time of the inspection the president
of the facility contacted the attending veterinarian. The veterinarian directed that Kahn be placed on antibiotics and
that the condition of his tail be closely monitored. APHIS inspectors asked that treatment records and observation
notes be maintained for Kahn. These records must be made available for review by APHIS inspectors.

There is a 4" lesion at the tip of Kahn's tail which is raw and bleeding. The time was approximately 12:20 PM. An
employee of the facility had already provided water to Kahn earlier in the morning according to the facility president.
This person should have noticed the problem with Kahn's tail. Kahn's condition had not been observed by anyone
at the facility and had not been reported to the attending veterinarian. Kahn's tail wound had been healing well
according to the facility president. Personnel should have been instructed to monitor and evaluated Kahn very
closely to verify continued progress of wound healing. Kahn's condition should have been recognized by personnel
at the facility and reported to the attending veterinarian. Failure to observe health issues and promptly report them
to the veterinarian will lead to unnecessary suffering and even possible animal death. Kahn is suffering due to his
current condition. Kahn's condition was reported to the attending veterinarian at the time of inspection. Thorough
daily observations of all animals should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra scrutiny.
Report all health issues promptly to the veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The two domestic cats are housed in an enclosure that contains two litter boxes. Both of these litter boxes hadexcessive feces in them. Primary enclosures are to be cleaned of fecal material daily. Excessive feces in the litter
boxes can lead to odor problems. It can also be a potential source of disease and pest control issues. This is more
of a risk now as the daily temperatures are starting to warm up. Excessively dirty litter boxes can also be a source
of discomfort to the cats as they will hesitate to use the boxes when they are overly soiled. This could also lead to
them beginning to defecate outside the boxes which could result in soiling of the cats and ingestion of feces as they
groom themselves. Clean litter boxes daily.
Correct by: Correct from this time forward.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water container provided for the two coyotes had fecal material frozen into the ice that was still present in the
container. It also had a bone sitting on top of the ice. The water container provided for the tiger Sundar had feces
frozen into the ice still present in the container. The water container provided for the lion had leaves and other
debris frozen into the ice still present in the container. Water for all of these animals had been placed in these
contaminated containers. It is vital that all animals have access to clean water in order to promote their health and
comfort. Contaminated water can affect its palatability causing animals to drink less. Contaminated water can also
cause diseases which may be spread by fecal material or other debris. Cats are particular sensitive to kidney
damage from lack of adequate water which may be the result of water palatability. Clean these water containers
and keep them clean.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In the warm room area containing the two baboons, the inspectors observed three empty antifreeze containers on
the ground in a puddle of water. This water extended over the floor to the enclosure housing the olive baboon. The
water was right next to the enclosure housing this animal and had likely began to wet the bottom layer of bedding in
the enclosure. It could be possible for small amounts of antifreeze left in these containers or on them to
contaminate the water that they were in. Antifreeze is extremely toxic to animals and has a sweet taste which could
be attractive to baboons. Very small amounts can cause significant kidney damage when ingested. This could lead
to animal suffering and possible death. This area needs to be cleaned up to prevent unnecessary animal injury.
Clean up the empty containers and other debris and water in this area.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There were several rodent holes in the leopard barn which houses four tigers. A rat was seen by the inspector in
the anteroom located directly off the butcher area. Rats can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to theanimals housed in this area. Rats present in the butcher area can contaminate surfaces used to prepare the meat
with fecal material or other diseases, one of which can be spread by rat urine. A more effective means of pest
control must be established for this area.
Time still remains for correction of the citation listed under section 3.132 on the inspection date of 3-4-14.
At the conclusion of the inspection, APHIS inspectors had an exit interview with the facility president. APHIS
expectations regarding treatment and observation of Kahn were made clear to the facility president. Another exit
interview was conducted on 3-19-14.
