2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
***Based upon information received in a complaint and obtained from the Dreamy Puppy website, it was determined
that Dreamy Puppy is conducting regulated activity without a USDA license. On March 10, 2016, I spoke with the
manager of the Dreamy Puppy regarding their activity of selling and shipping puppies via the internet. This activity
no longer meets the exemption requirement for a retail pet store selling puppies.
In accordance with the new retail pet rule, any business selling puppies or dogs in which a face to face transaction
between buyer and seller does not occur, must be licensed as a dealer and subject to inspection by APHIS officials.
Dreamy Puppy, LLC must obtain a dealer license for its current business activity in accordance with the Animal
Welfare Act.
CONDUCTING REGULATED ACTIVITY WITHOUT A VALID USDA LICENSE IS
A VIOLATION OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE ACT.
