2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Last fall, a student intern was cleaning the coati mundi enclosure with the animal in the same primary space. The
animal was on top of the students head and when she went to lift the animal off her, it reached around and bit her
hand causing injury. Although there is a holding enclosure the animal can be shifted into, this animal was not locked
down. The holding enclosure is challenging to access without the proper equipment (specific screwdriver) and there
are no protocols in place for proper handling while cleaning and feeding the animals. Handling of the animals must
be done in a manner that does not cause stress or physical harm. It is important that when inexperienced students
are working with exotic animals that safeguards be put in place for the protection of the animals and students.
*** The fox is still housed in an enclosure inside the main building that does not provide adequate space. In addition,
there is no shift area for this animal and currently the licensee is trying to catch the animal in a wire trap to move it
to an outdoor enclosure. The wire trap has been in the current enclosure for the past three days with no success of
catching the animal. Keeping the trap in the animals enclosure and actively trying to bait and catch it for several
days is stressful for the animal and can lead to overheating and potential physical harm. This enclosure is not
designed to facilitate daily husbandry care of the animal in a safe manner.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** There is poor ventilation in the building housing mammal and reptile species. Throughout the area, there is a
musty damp odor. There was no fresh air, or air circulation in the building. The chinchilla's have been moved to an
enclosure on the outside wall, but when the enclosure was opened, there was a strong ammonia odor. Ventilation
needs to be addressed in this building for the health of the animals.

3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS. *** The fox is still housed in an enclosure that does not provide the animal space for normal postural movements
and adequate freedom of movement. Currently there is a humane trap in the enclosure because the licensee is
trying to catch the animal. This trap has been in the enclosure for the past three days and can be an additional
cause of stress for this animal. This fox needs to be safely moved to an enclosure that meets his normal postural
needs of digging, creating a den, and climbing.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
*** At the time of the inspection, the refrigerator in the diet area did not seem to be working as all the shelves and
bins were warm. The three plastic bins in the fridge all contained produce that had gone bad and was moldy. The
current temperature of the fridge does not keep the food wholesome and palatable and needs to be addressed for
the health and welfare of the animals.

3.132 CRITICAL REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
*** The licensee does not have a program in place for the student interns that provides adequate training to care for
the animals at the facility when he is away from the area. The facility design does not facilitate shifting of animals
into lock down areas for the safety of the animals and the students, which is the current professional standard of
care for this type of program. In the past year, students have been injured by the animals due to not securing them
in a holding area. In addition, there are no written protocols that clearly define daily husbandry tasks, there is no
written diet plan to follow for feeding the animals daily and no clear schedule for who is responsible for the animals
when the licensee is away from the facility. It is important for the animals at the facility that employees/interns be
adequately trained for their safety and the well-being of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
