ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****
There were 4 dogs that had localized hair loss with associated scaly skin. A female black Cocker Spaniel, tag #037,
has a circular area of hair loss, approximately 1 inch in diameter, in between her eyes with a roughened and bumpy
appearance. When questioned by the inspectors the licensee stated that "he hadn't noticed it" until it was pointed
out to him. A female Boston Terrier (tag #95), a male Boston Terrier (tag #089) and a female Poodle (tag #161)
were each observed with significant hair loss on their inner and outer ear flaps with flakiness of the exposed skin.
When questioned by the inspectors about the conditions of both Boston Terriers' ears, the licensee stated that
"they've always been like that". This could be a sign of a hypersentivity, parasitic, fungal or another veterinary
medical condition.
A female Pomeranian, tag #146, was observed with an abnormal whitish crystalline mass inside the central portion
of her left eye. This is an abnormal condition and could cause pain and/or blindness.
All animals should receive adequate and timely veterinary care at all times.
The licensee must have these animals evaluated by a veterinarian by 5 May 14 for an appropriate diagnosis and
treatment plan.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces (3) Cleaning
****(cid:9)
On the north side of the sheltered building, the outside sections of at least 3 enclosures, affecting 3 dogs, there is
an accumulation of hair, dirt, and grime on the tops of the enclosures. Inside of the whelping building there are at
least 9 enclosures, affecting 2 adult dogs and 29 puppies, with an accumulation of hair, dirt, grime and fecal
material on the underneath side of the enclosures. On the two enclosures with the 2 adult dogs and 10 puppies
there is also an accumulation of hair, dirt, and grime built up on the sides, and tops of the enclosures. This could
increase the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must clean these enclosures and surfaces. All surfaces incontact with the animals and other surfaces of the housing facility must be cleaned and sanitized as often as
necessary to satisfy generally husbandry standards and practices.
This is a repeat non-compliant item.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements (4) Bedding
****
In an outdoor enclosure, housing two young dogs, there was no bedding provided. The temperature at the time of
inspection was 48.7 degrees Fahrenheit according to the inspector's Kestrel 3000. The overnight low air
temperature for the area during the previous night was 40 degrees Fahrenheit according to the National Weather
Service. Bedding must be provided for the dogs when the ambient air temperature drops below 50 degrees
Fahrenheit so that they can stay warm, for their comfort and well-being and to decrease the risk of hypothermic
situations. The licensee provided bedding for these dogs when requested by the inspectors.
Corrected at time of inspection.
The veterinary care issues identified during the previous inspection conducted on 22 Oct 13, a female Boston
Terrier, tag #095, with left eye issue, and a female Poodle, tag #161, with a wound on her left ear have been
addressed.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
