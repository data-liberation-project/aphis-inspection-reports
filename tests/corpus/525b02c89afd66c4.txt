3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
In several nonhuman primate (NHP) facilities, surfaces that come in contact with the nonhuman primate were no longer
able to be readily cleaned and sanitized. There were focal areas of rust (primate pad 1 and 2, Orangutan bedroom shift
mechanism, Bonobo bedroom) and floor cracks (Schmidts bedroom, primate pad, Silver Leaf Langur sheltered housing)
that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization.

A system of maintenance is in place, but has been impacted by COVID, and the facility still needs to maintain the
surfaces, preventing areas of rust or floor cracks in order to effectively clean and sanitize the enclosures for the NHP's.

Corrected during inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Curatorial staff.
