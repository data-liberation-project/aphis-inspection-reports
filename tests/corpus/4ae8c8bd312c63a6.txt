ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current written program of veterinary care does not include any guidelines from the attending veterinarian
regarding the care for the straw colored fruit bats currently housed at this site. In addition, the written program
includes a recommendation for fecal testing that is not complete. The written program of veterinary care needs to
include all species and be complete in order to ensure that the veterinarian's guidelines regarding the preventative
health care for all the animals are known by the facility and are being followed to ensure the health and well-being of
the animals. Correct prior to conducting regulated activity from this site.
This is a new site inspection.
Inspection and exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
