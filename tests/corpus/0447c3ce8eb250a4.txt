2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A focused inspection was conducted on February 25, 2019.
In December 2018, two of the facility’s animal care staff hunted and killed one axis deer and one sika deer for sport.
The incident occurred while handling a small herd of various hoofstock for a sale. These actions resulted in a
termination of these staff members and the facility replaced them with new employees. The handling and housing of
animals should be done in a manner that prevents trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary
discomfort. All animals must be handled in ways that prevent any stress or physical harm to their well being.
Correct: From this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with animal care staff and the facility director.
