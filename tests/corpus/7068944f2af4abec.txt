3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The entrance to two fiberglass igloo sheltered structures are chewed exposing a jagged, roughened edge. The
shelter structures used by two dogs are located in outdoor housing. Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. A chewed, roughened surface could harbor disease causing agents
which affects the health and well-being of the dogs. The potential for dogs to ingest chewed plastic exists which
could cause potential digestion problems. In addition, continued chewing of the sheltered structure can affect the
ability of the igloo to provide adequate protection from the elements. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces
are maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced
when worn or soiled. Correct by 4/13/16.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Rodent droppings were observed accumulating on the storage shelf located in the whelp building. Lack of an
effective program that controls rodents can create unsanitary conditions and lead to potential spread of disease. In
addition, damage by rodents can be costly. No bait, bait traps or other means to control or eliminate the rodents
were observed during the inspection. The licensee must establish an effective program for the control of insects
and external parasites. This program must be established and maintained to promote the health and well-being of
the animals and reduce contamination by pests in the animal area. Correct by 4/13/16.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 3/30/16 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
