2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific
guidance for the care of animals. There is no specific guidance for the parasite control and treatment of conditions
for the various species, only a list of drugs. Species specific dosing and route is not included for the drugs included
in the PVC. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee. There
is no specific guidance in the PVC for the method of euthanasia to be used by the facility, including its use,
equipment, and the personnel trained and authorized to perform the euthanasia for the various species. Specific
guidance and training in the procedure for euthanasia by the attending veterinarian is required to ensure animals
are humanely euthanized according to the latest AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2013 edition).

Additional specific guidance is required for the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.
Correct by November 20, 2015.
3.31(a)(3) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(3) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: There were fifteen previously used guinea pig
enclosures with fresh bedding and hay ready to house new guinea pigs arriving at the facility. There was a buildup
of a white to brown roughened scale and debris in the corners, on the sides and around the bottom of the
enclosures. The cleaning process utilized does not seem effective in removing this buildup. Housing guinea pigs in
dirty and used enclosures exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral
diseases. The licensee must ensure that enclosures will be cleaned and sanitized prior to the introduction of guinea
pigs into previously occupied enclosures. This is a repeat non-compliance that was cited earlier this year.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility president; Mary Geib, VMO; and Robert Markmann, ACI. Additional Inspectors
