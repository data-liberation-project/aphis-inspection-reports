Cagewash rooms had extensive sections of peeling paint, exposed seams, and damaged drywall, which was present on
almost every section of the dirty side ceiling surface, including an approximately 2x1 inch hole completely through the
drywall in that room. Damaged surfaces in cagewash areas impair proper sanitary practices and may contribute to
contamination of animal cages and water bottles. Rooms used to facilitate required husbandry practices must be kept in
good repair.
