2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While reviewing records it was noted that the written program of veterinary care was not complete. The program of
veterinary care had not been completed to include a schedule of vaccinations and parasite control program for the
lemurs. The program of veterinary care should reflect the appropriate vaccinations for the animals currently on
hand. The program of veterinary care should be updated to accurately reflect the vaccination and parasite program
for the animals. Lack of a complete program of veterinary care does not ensure that proper veterinary care is being
provided in accordance with currently accepted veterinary medical standards.
