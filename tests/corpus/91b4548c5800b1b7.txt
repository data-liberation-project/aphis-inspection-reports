FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the main facility where the majority of the animals were housed, there were mounds of feces on the floor below
the primary enclosures which were equipped with wire floors. The mounds varied in height and reached
approximately six inches in some areas. The licensee explained that the feces is removed once a year and that the
facility was due for a waste disposal. Walking through the rows of enclosures, a moderate amount of flies could be
seen flying around the facility. Accumulations of fecal waste can lead to strong odors and attract pests. In addition,
waste can pose a disease hazard which can have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the rabbits. The
licensee shall have provisions for more frequent removal and disposal of animal waste to minimize the risk of
vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards.

SANITATION.
A mixture of cobwebs, dust and rabbit fur could be seen all along the floor and hanging from the ceiling within the
main facility where the majority of the animals were housed. A significant amount of the mixture surrounded all of
the primary enclosures, wrapped around poles and wires laying on top, draping the feeders to the side, and
extending below the enclosures. The licensee explained that the enclosures are cleaned by flame when the rabbits
are turned to another enclosure, approximately once every 6 to 8 weeks.
Inappropriate husbandry practices and unsanitary conditions can have an impact on animal welfare and lead to
animal disease. Each rabbit enclosure must be sanitized at least once every 30 days in order to keep it reasonably
free of excreta, hair, cobwebs, and debris.
