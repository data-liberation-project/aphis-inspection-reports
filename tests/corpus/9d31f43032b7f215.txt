ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1. During this inspection I was informed that the licensee had acquired a male java macaque. This primate was
housed in a barn with 2 other male primates (baboon and capuchin). According to the licensee, this macaque began
to self-mutilate himself. He had a severe injury that required surgery by the attending vet, but he also bit himself in
other locations that required antibiotics on and off until his death on 2/20/15. Medications had been prescribed by
the attending vet, but there was no documentation in the animals(cid:25) records that the medications were given to this
macaque. Medical records for medications and treatments prescribed by the attending vet, need to be currant,
accurate and maintained to ensure that the animal is being provided adequate care. Again, there is no
documentation on the licensees premise that the primate was brought to the vet, or what, or when treatments /
medications, were administered to this animal. This facility should have a system of health records that sufficiently
demonstrate that the animals on the premise are provided adequate care.

2. Also during this inspection I was informed that a hybrid fox had been playing and suffered a spinal cord injury.
According to the licensee, she called the attending vet within a few hours of the injury and was prescribed
medications. She administered the medications that day. However, the medications the licensee showed me were
not labeled. And there was no documentation as to how, or when, to administer them. There was no documentation
in the animals(cid:25) records that the medications were given. Medical records for medications and treatments prescribed
by the attending vet, need to be currant, accurate and maintained to ensure that the animal is being provided
adequate care. Again, there is no documentation on the licensees premise that the primate was brought to the vet,
or what, or when treatments / medications, were administered to this animal. This facility should have a system of
health records that sufficiently demonstrate that the animals on the premise are provided adequate care.
All medical incidents need to be documented to ensure that the animals are provided appropriate veterinary care.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
While conducting this inspection it was noted that the Syrian Brown bear was no longer on the premise. When
reviewing the records the only documentation found was a health certificate. The health certificate was not
completely filled out. The licensees information was present. However, in regards as to who received the bear, there
was only a name, Chris Curley, and a city and state, Cooksville, PA, documented on the form. The USDA #, or
Drivers license # / vehicle plate #s, were not obtained. All animal transfers need to be documented with all of the
required information.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection I was informed that a hybrid fox had been playing with the licensee and suffered a spinal cord
injury which resulted in his death a few days later. Due to the fact that there was no documentation as to how, or
when, this happened all handling procedures will need to be reevaluated and addressed. All the animals on the
premise shall be handled in such a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or
unnecessary discomfort.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
During this inspection I was informed that the licensee had acquired a male java macaque. This primate was
housed in a barn with 2 other male primates (baboon and capuchin). According to the licensee, this macaque began
to self-mutilate himself. He had a severe injury that required surgery by the attending vet, but he also bit himself in
other locations that required antibiotics on and off until his death on 2/20/15. According to the licensee, additional
enrichment items were added to his enclosure. There is no documentation to verify that this was actually done.
While the self-mutilation continued. This animals health, enrichment needs, and environment should have been
evaluated by the attending vet. This animal should have been moved to another area of the premise. This animal
was obviously under psychological stress and needed special attention. It is apparent that this macaque did not
receive the attention it needed. All primates on the premise need to be observed on a daily basis and there
enrichment needs must be met. ***To Be Corrected By: Correct Immediately

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The small barn that is used to house the primates, coatimundi, fennec foxes, and African crested porcupine in the
winter is in need of attention. There is a very strong smell of ammonia present. To ensure the health of animals this
barn will need to cleaned out more often and more air exchanges will need to be done.
