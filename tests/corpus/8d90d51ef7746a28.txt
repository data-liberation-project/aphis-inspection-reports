2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Daily observations are not being performed in an effective manner as shown by several guinea pigs with health conditions
that had not been observed or treated by the licensee. There were 2 guinea pigs with masses under the chin. A red and
black adult guinea pig in Row 3 Pen 10 and a black and white adult guinea pig in Row 4 Pen 2 both had firm movable
masses approximately 1 inch in size under the chin. The animals were in good body condition and did not appear
lethargic. There were 2 guinea pigs with apparent fight wounds on the back. A black and tan adult guinea pig in Row 3
Pen 10 and a red and brown adult guinea pig in Row 4 Pen 21 had areas over the back with gaps in the top layer of the
skin with reddish areas and scabs. There was 1 guinea pig with a head tilt. An adult gray and white guinea pig in Row 3
Pen 15 had a head tilt to the left. The licensee had not observed the health conditions in the guinea pigs, had not
contacted the attending veterinarian, and was not administering any treatments.
Failure to observe and communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian can lead to discomfort and disease
transmission.
The licensee must develop and implement a plan for effective daily observations and regular communication of those
findings to the attending veterinarian.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 565 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Sanitation.
The guinea pig pens contained a large amount of soiled, wet bedding especially in the areas of the automatic waterers. In
addition, there was a large amount of fecal material and discarded food and hay mixed with the bedding and the pens
were in need of more frequent cleaning. The licensee said he cleans every 2 weeks.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.

Sanitation.


Although it was winter, there were numerous flies inside the guinea pig building. There were several flies observed in the
soiled bedding near the automatic waterers. There was a dead mouse laying on the floor. The licensee stated he has
some rodent baits but is still seeing live mice.
Excessive pests such as flies and mice can cause discomfort to the animals and result in increased disease spread.
An effective program for the control of pests including flies and rodents must be established and maintained.
