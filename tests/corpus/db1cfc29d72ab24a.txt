3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There were flies in the whelping enclosures housing dogs. Flies were all around the puppies and their food bowls. There

program for the control of flies must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the
dogs.
