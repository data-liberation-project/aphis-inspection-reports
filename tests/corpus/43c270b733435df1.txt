3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The sheltered building housing adult dogs has a buildup of feces and liquid waste in the wash down area on the
north side where the drain leaves the structure. The feces are also building up on the ground directly below this
area. There were large numbers of flies on the feces and a strong odor. Accumulation of waste leads to pests,
odors and possible disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities provide for regular and
frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, debris, garbage, water, other fluids
and wastes, and dead animals, in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Housing facilities must
be equipped with disposal facilities and drainage systems that are constructed and operated so that animal waste
and water are rapidly eliminated and animals stay dry. Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and
pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All drains must be properly constructed, installed, andmaintained. To be corrected by 29 June 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Kendall Lundy, ACI and Margaret A Shaver,
VMO in attendance.
