2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Written Program of Veterinary Care.
***The Licensee employs a part-time Attending Veterinarian and there was a written Program of Veterinary Care
(PVC) dated 1/29/16 using APHIS Form 7002 available for review at the time of the inspection. However, the
written PVC did not contain sufficient details under several subsections of Section IV. The Parasite Control
Program subsection was blank; the subsection on provisions for Emergency Care only contained the word “Ivomec”;
and the Method of Euthanasia subsection was blank.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever an exhibitor employs an attending veterinarian under part-time or
consultant arrangements, a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is required. The written PVC should include
complete and specific details from the Attending Veterinarian concerning the preventative medical practices and
health topics to ensure that adequate veterinary care is provided to the animal species on the premises of the
Licensee.
The written PVC needs to be revised to include the missing detailed information and a copy of the revised PVC
needs to be provided to all traveling units and to the home site of the Licensee.
Correct by 10/1/17.
NOTE – Inspection conducted at the Franklin Fairgrounds in Greenfield, MA with representative of the Licensee.
Exit briefing held 9/7/17 on-site with representative of the Licensee and also by phone with the Licensee on 9/7/17.
