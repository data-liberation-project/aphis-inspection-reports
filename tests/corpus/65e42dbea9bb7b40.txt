***A bottle of Penicillin was in the medication refrigerator with an expiration date of May 2021. In addition, a tray of
intranasal vaccines was found with an expiration date of 30 July 2021. Expired medication can negatively affect the
animal if used. The Program of Veterinary Care for the facility states that expired drugs will be removed from the kennel
area. Medication and vaccines need to be removed from the medication area or refrigerators once they are expired.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One Yorkshire terrier "Luxie" was observed to be licking her right rear foot, and had a red raw ulcerated area observed
between the toes. The dog held the leg in the air at times, and was reluctant to bear weight when on the wire section of
the enclosure. However the dog did bear weight on the foot when in the solid surface portion of the enclosure. This
condition was not previously identified by the licensee. Veterinary care issues must be identified in a timely manner so
that treatment can be initiated. All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being, and
communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being
is communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner.
The written program of veterinary care describes instructions for the licensee for treatment for intra-digital cysts and the


licensee contacted the attending veterinarian regarding this dog while the USDA APHIS official inspector was at the
facility.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was a buildup of feces observed in multiple enclosures throughout all areas of the kennel. Some of the feces was
moldy. There was also an excess buildup of feces under many of the enclosures. Excess waste can harbor disease and
affect the health of the dogs. Enclosures must be spot cleaned, and excreta removed from primary enclosures daily, and
from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to
prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and
odors.

Veterinary care for dogs.
***A Yorkshire terrier #79 was observed with matted hair around the mouth and on the front legs. The dog also had long
nails which need to be trimmed and severe tarter build up on the teeth and along the gum line. Matted fur pulls away from
the skin and can be painful and cause skin irritations. Long nails can begin to splay outward or could curl under into the
pad of the foot. Grooming needs to be done on a routine basis to prevent these conditions and for the comfort of the dogs.

*** A poodle "Cookie" was observed with tartar buildup on the teeth. Dental abnormalities and tartar build up can cause
discomfort, as well as negatively affect the overall health of the dog. The written Program of Veterinary Care includes a
dental plan, however currently it is not being followed by the licensee. There has been no recent intervention or treatment


of any current dental issues affecting the dogs in the kennel.
Each dealer, exhibitor, and research facility must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs . This includes
preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy
eyes, ears, skin, and teeth.
