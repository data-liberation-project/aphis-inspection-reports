FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosure housing a kangaroo, goats, pigs and a donkey had loose metal wire inside of it. Towards the
public viewing side/front of the enclosure, 6 segments of wire about 3 feet in length each were sitting on top of the
shelter and hanging off of the edge. Another bent piece of wire was hanging off of old fencing. Old wire fencing
inside was not secured to a post and easily swung open like a gate when an ostrich manipulated it. Old wire
fencing lay on the ground in the front right corner of the enclosure and provided to be an obstacle for a goat that
tried walking over it. A wooden post inside the enclosure had three nails sticking out approximately 4 inches. In the
back right corner of inside the primary enclosure, more wire fencing lay on the ground, as well as coils of barbed
wire.
Protruding wires, nails and loose fencing can be cause for various health injuries in animals. The outdoor housing
facility shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Corrective actions were implemented at the time of inspection.

WATERING.
An approximately 8 inch diameter water receptacle for the primary enclosure housing pigs, goats, a
donkey and a kangaroo was lined with a thick film of dark green algae along the base, up along the edges and lip of
the bowl, and contained leaves inside.
Water receptacles need to be kept clean and sanitary so that the water provided to the animals maintains their
health and overall welfare. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
Corrective actions were implemented at the time of inspection.
