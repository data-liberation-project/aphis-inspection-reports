2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and the public. At
the time of this inspection the pigs had an enclosure that was easily accessed by children and adults with no
attendants present. Unrestricted/unsupervised access to the animals could result in harm to the animals or the
public. The pigs need to have an enclosure that does not easily allow the public to enter the enclosure and allows
the pigs to escape from the public if they desire or an attendant needs to be available to supervise public/animal
interaction at all times public have access to the animals.
