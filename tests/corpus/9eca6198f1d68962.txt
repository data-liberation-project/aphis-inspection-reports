Handling of animals.
In July 2020 ,one female Kinkajou escaped her enclosure when a gate was not properly closed . She was found
deceased many miles from the home facility sometime later . Handling of animals must be done as carefully as possible
that does not cause physical harm . All caretakers have been instructed to double check enclosures gates are latched
properly. Note : there are plans for a new kinkajou enclosure that will have a double entry gate system to prevent
accidental escape.
