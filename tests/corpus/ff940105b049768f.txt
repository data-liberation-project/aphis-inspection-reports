HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the enclosure housing a callimico there were holes noted in the dirt floor at the back of the cage along the
edge of the pen and the night house. One hole was very near the margin of the pen wire. On the outside it was
noted that a board attached in this area was loose and caused concerns about a potential hole expanding and
allowing a passage in or out of the pen. The housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be kept in good repair
and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from
entering.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**There were several nonhuman primates housed in enclosures with surfaces which were not cleaned. In the
golden-headed tamarin enclosure there was a cross beam along the side, which the monkey used to perch on, that
had dark discoloration on the top that looked like a layer of waxy grime. In the common marmoset pen a there was a
similar wooden beam with a thin layer of green discoloration on it. In the enclosure housing three spider monkeys
there was a wooden beam on the base of the pen that had a green layer of discoloration. The surfaces of housing
facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and
sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. All items were corrected before the exit interview.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**In the black bear enclosure at the base of the aisle to the night house, there was a rotten and deteriorating wood
beam with large gaps in the wood that left large bolts exposed. The rotten wood had a wire fence panel attached to
it that, if the wood gave way, could potentially be bent, pushed out or loosened and create an escape hazard for the
bears.
**In the enclosure housing two muntjac and a kangaroo, there was a large gap under the fence which had been
mostly filled in with concrete blocks. These blocks could create an injury or tipping hazard to one of the animals iftheir leg was to get stuck in the openings in the blocks. Item was corrected before the exit interview.
**In the enclosure housing two giraffes, the male giraffe was observe blocking and pushing the female, non-
aggressively, toward the barn in a manner in which her head and neck were very near to the sharp edge of the tin
roof of the building. The female was able to move away and avoid being pushed into the building and the roof. In
addition to that interaction, both animals were observed coming to the front corner of the pen for feeding encounters
and they had to maneuver around the point of the tin roof. The sharp tin edge on the roof presents a potential injury
hazard to the giraffes if they were to push one another into it or if they accidentally ran into it.
The housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** There is an excessive amount of vines and vegetation growing on or near the perimeter fencing. There was a
large segment of the fence that was affected and in some areas there were trees and/or bushes that were up
against the fence. If an animal escapes, the vegetation creates an opportunity for it to more easily climb out and the
vegetation may also add weight on the fence and potentially cause damage that could affect the integrity of the
fence. The fence itself also was leaning inward in a number of areas and appeared to be held up by brace posts
and retention wires. There was a hole under the fence of a size through which a small dog or other animal could fit.
The hole was filled by the time of the exit interview. These findings may affect the integrity of the perimeter fence.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
** There was an excessive number of flies around several pens including the lions and tigers. An area around the
interactive lemur cage also had excessive flies. The facility has several animals (two wolves and two tigers) with
ongoing symptoms consistent with fly strike including scabs and sores on the ears and or other areas of skin. They
were all under veterinary care and receiving treatments and/or preventative fly spray. The facility director indicated
that they have been trying very hard to prevent the fly infestations but that it is a seasonal occurrence. She stated
that they have a pesticide company that comes twice monthly and they treat the facility for flies and they are using a
spray on the animals which has helped quite a bit. They also stated that they have used the fly predator release on
the facility in the past. They clean cages daily and rake excreta up and dispose of it off site. In spite of the statedefforts there is ongoing and recurring impact on a number of animals at the facility indicating that the pest problem
remains a concern for the health and welfare of the animal. Wounds on the big cats cannot be treated easily on a
daily basis so if wounds from excessive fly bites become infected this could potentially result in a situation requiring
additional handling and restraint of the large felids which could potentially have additional risks to their health and
well-being. The recurring and chronic nature of the fly impact on the animals indicates that current pest control
efforts are not sufficiently successful to resolve the animal impact. A safe and effective program for the control of
insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pest shall be established and maintained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted by two VMO inspectors with the facility director. Records were
reviewed with the curator.
The Director of the facility refused to sign but did receive a copy of the report.
