2.126(a) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
At approximately 11:30am, inspectors contacted the licensee to initiate the inspection. The licensee became agitated
asking why he was being inspected so frequently. It was explained to him that the previous inspection was a focused and
did not address prior non-compliant items, which was the purpose of today's inspection. The licensee did not seem to
listen to this explanation, and he continued yelling aggressively and with explicit language while inspectors asked him to
calm down, to stop yelling, and whether he was refusing to allow the inspection. He did not respond to these requests, so
he was given a final warning that we would leave and cite this interaction as a refusal to allow inspection. At that point he
told us to leave while shouting expletives. He continued to shout at inspectors as we entered our vehicles, and one
inspector needed to ask him to get out of their way so they could leave the property. The licensee continued shouting as
we pulled out of his driveway.

Allowing inspectors to conduct inspections is a requirement of all licensed facilities under the Animal Welfare Act.
Refusing inspection inhibits the regulatory process and prevents inspectors from assessing animal health and welfare,
and prevents the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. This non-compliant item can be
corrected by allowing inspectors to conduct inspections during normal business hours without harassment or interference


in the inspection process by the licensee.

Correct immediately.

This inspection was refused by the licensee.
