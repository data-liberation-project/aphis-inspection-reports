Sanitation.
There was one guinea pen that was in need of cleaning. Pen 117 containing approximately 14 guinea pigs had an
accumulation of soiled wet bedding with excess fecal material and debris. In addition, the majority of the guinea pig pens
had spiderwebs present on the inside of the enclosures, adhered to the ceiling and the wire mesh on the sides of the
enclosures. Debris and bedding were observed to be mixed in with the spiderwebs.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
