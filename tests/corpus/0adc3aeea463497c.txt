Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The Institutional Officer is still creating the reports for the IACUC and the report to himself was lacking any minority views
or a statement saying that there were none to report. The IACUC remains responsible for the evaluations and reports as
required by the Act and regulations. The reports shall be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members and
must include any minority views. The reports must contain a description of the nature and extent of the research facility’s
adherence to this subchapter, must identify Specifically any departures from the provisions of title 9, chapter I, subchapter
A – Animal Welfare, and must state the reasons for each departure. The reports must distinguish significant deficiencies
from minor deficiencies. A significant deficiency is one which, with reference to Subchapter A, and, in the judgement of
the IACUC and the Institutional Official, is or may be a threat to the health or safety of the animals. Failure to continuously
provide complete and thorough semiannual reports to the Institutional Officer hinders the facility's ability to adequately
address animal welfare concerns appropriately.
2.32(a) Repeat

Personnel qualifications.
Conversations with the Principal Investigator and IACUC members, and review of IACUC/facility records and the October
2020 inspection report indicates that the staff/member's lack knowledge about the Animal Welfare Act and protocol review


process. Adequate knowledge is necessary to ensure that the facility remains compliant with the Animal Welfare Act
Regulations and Standards and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. The facility must ensure that the
veterinarians, principal investigator and facility staff are provided training and instruction on their duties under the Animal
Welfare Act.
2.33(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During the April inspection, conversations with the attending veterinarian led to scheduling a visit to reassess the thyroid
of several dogs with weight issues. The AV stated he would conduct examinations soon after the inspection. The AV had
not visited the facility since the previous inspection to reassess or examine any animals of concern. To get clarification on
the animals health at the facility because the Program of Veterinary Care nor medical records showed any evidence or
notes on any recent examinations, an attempt was made to visit the AV at the address on the PVC. The address led us to
an old site for the clinic and directed inspectors to a new location which was not detailed anywhere or updated on the
PVC. The AV didn't keep his scheduled visit with the facility and the Program of Veterinary Care was not updated with the
current location of the part-time veterinarians information. It is important to update the PVC with accurate information to
assist the facility in getting the animals adequate care in the manner the program of veterinary care prescribes. In the
event the AV doesn't keep his scheduled visit it is up to the facility to reschedule to ensure the animals are being
evaluated. Correct from this day forward.
2.33(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During the inspection a dog was observed with a bite wound on the right front paw that was identified by the facility on
August 20, 2021. The Institutional Officer/Principal Investigator observed the wound on August 30, 2021. On August 31,
2021 the IO/PI ordered the Chair to give medications that should only be prescribed by the attending veterinarian. The


Chair was instructed to wash the wound with chlorohexidine and give cephalexin and rimadyl by mouth. Once the USDA
inspectors discovered the wound the AV was then contacted. It was then that the IO/PI arranged for the dog to be
transported to a local vet and not the AV. The local clinic that they used did not have a PVC on file. The research facility
does not allow the AV appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use for the well-being of the animals. Correct from this day forward.
2.33(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
While examining the dogs there were several dental issues and dental cleanings had not been conducted. Inspectors
examined 10 dogs on hand. There were 6 dogs with a moderate amount of tarter build-up and one dog with severe tarter
accompanied with a broken tooth close to the base near the gumline. There weren't any preventable measures in place to
ensure healthy teeth for the animals and there was a lack of dental attention evident by the excessive tarter build-up and
reddened gums observed. The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries
must be made available to ensure that adequate veterinary care is received. Correct from this day forward.
2.33(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The facility conducts many observations daily between the facility employees and the IACUC Chair. At the time of the
inspection veterinary care issues found at the facility needed immediate medical attention and currently the Chair is not
allowed to call the attending veterinarian directly in a timely manner to communicate the health concerns of the animals.
The facility employees and Chair have been instructed to communicate all of the concerns directly to the Institutional
Officer/Principal Investigator and not to call the AV directly. Health concerns aren't being communicated in a direct and
timely fashion and many of the animals' conditions are going unattended and are never addressed. There were three
dogs at the time of the examination that needed immediate attention, not including a dog with a bite wound to the paw that


was identified a week prior but received veterinary care when inspectors arrived.

"Cotton" is a 11 year old neutered yellow labrador retriever with an open wound to the left side of his face. The left ear
was also full of dark-colored debris completely covered and spilling out from beneath it. The dog was recognized by its
excessive head shaking. The Chair has been noting this for a while and he had not received any veterinary care.

The second dog was "Daisey" a 13 year old female pointer with her left lower canine tooth that had broken down to the
base of the gum leaving it exposed. She also had excessive tarter and reddened gums. This injury went unnoticed and
the AV had not seen the dog nor had it been reported to the IO/PI or the AV.

The third dog was "Kiss" a 12 year old female chocolate labrador retriever which had masses on the face, leg and
bilateral masses on the abdomen area. There was a raised mass protruding from the left side of her face. On the left side
of her body there was a subcutaneous mass about 3 in. in diameter. There was a subcutaneous mass near her right
nipple in the abdominal area that was about 2 in. in diameter. Also a subcutaneous mass that was located on the left front
leg that was about 2 in. in diameter. Under her neck there were several subcutaneous masses, nodular in shape, that
were smaller than the others noted. These masses had all been observed and reported by the Chair to the IO but there
weren't any notes from the attending veterinarian.

Additionally, there was another dog, already identified by the facility, to be transported to the local veterinarian on August
31, 2021 was "Isa" a female rottweiler had a bite wound to the right front paw. There were two visible puncture wounds on
the bottom of the paw and the skin and tissue around the wound was reddened and appeared raw and infected. The dog


was constantly licking the wound during the inspection.

Cotton, Daisey and Kiss were recognized by inspectors to need immediate care and they were transported to the AV
September 1, 2021 in the afternoon. Direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV. Correct immediately.
2.35(b)

Recordkeeping requirements.
There were 16 dogs that did not have any acquisition forms required. 2 dogs didn’t have any acquisition or health
certificates. 3 dogs had health certificates but didn’t have any acquisition forms. One Rottweiler did not have any papers
showing its origination. There was an incomplete acquisition form that indicated 10 yellow labs were received and no
other information provided. Every research facility shall make, keep, maintain records or forms which fully and correctly
disclose the following information concerning each live dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise.
Correct from this day forward.
3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The fencing near the walkway of the most eastern exercise pen has a gap approximately 9 inches between it and the
walkway and 9 inches from the ground which is large enough for a dog to get wedged. This may allow an animal to get
caught under the fencing which could potentially harm the animal. There was also a hole in the fence for a turnout pen
adjacent to the patio runs on the main building that was about 5 by 4 fencing links in size. This could also allow an animal
to get wedged in the fence. The facilities must be maintained and kept in good repair to keep out unwanted animals and
to prevent injury.
3.11(d)



Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During the inspection throughout the facility there were an excessive number of flies. In the runs of the animals especially
those with open wounds there were flies irritating the dogs. An effective program for the control of insects, external
parasites affecting dogs, and birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by October 10, 2021.
3.12

Employees
There were several deficiencies involving the maintenance, husbandry, vet care and overall IACUC functions that it is
evident that there aren’t enough employees to carry out the responsibilities of the facility and committee. Currently there
are two fulltime employees with one person conducting mainly enrichment activities for the dogs. One fulltime employee
of the facility is also the Chair of the IACUC and is required to carry out daily husbandry practices, bathe 5 dogs a day,
manage the facility, conduct the research study, observe vet care issues of the dogs as well as perform duties of the
IACUC. Each person subject to the AWA regulations maintaining dogs must have enough employees to carry out the
level of husbandry practices and care required to ensure the animals well-being and achieve adequate functioning of the
facility. Correct within 45 days.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC representative.
