***There was a dwarf hamster with hair loss under its left front leg and along the chest. The patch of hair loss was
approximately 1/4 inch by 1/2 inch in size. The exposed skin appeared to be reddened where there was hair loss.
The animal was also observed scratching occasionally. According to the licensee, he had not noticed this animal's
condition until it was pointed out by the inspector. Hair loss is an abnormal situation that could be the result of a
parasitic infection or other veterinary medical condition. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian no
later than April 28, 2014 regarding this animal's condition in order to obtain a diagnosis and an appropriate
treatment plan. The treatment plan must be followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
