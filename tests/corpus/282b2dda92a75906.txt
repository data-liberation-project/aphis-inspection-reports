3.101(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
Screws with sharp points (on the lower support beam on the back wall of the main inside pool) are protruding into the
animal enclosure. Bolts securing chain link fencing to the gates are protruding into the animal enclosures. Recently ,one
sea lion sustained a laceration on the flipper which required veterinary care. The sea lion was found dead in the enclosure
four days later. Exact cause of the injury is unknown but the protruding screws and bolts into the housing area may cause
injuries such as this laceration. Enclosures must not contain sharp or protruding objects that could cause injury to the
animals and must be maintained in good repair . A facility employee began to work on removing these sharp points during
the inspection . CORRECT BY : 4/5/2022
