FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In Aubie and Brianna the tiger's enclosure there are several areas of the primary fence that is only 14.5 ft. tall.
There are several other tiger enclosures at the facility that the fencing doesn(cid:25)t appear to be 16 ft tall in comparison
to the latter measured at 14. 5 ft in height.The fencing containing the animals is an open, straight up fence which the
upper most part of the fencing is attached to a single 2 x 4 board which allows the fencing to be loose and flimsy.
The height of the primary fencing for the big cats had been discussed at a previous inspection on June 5, 2013 with
the owner and the fencing was modified by making the primary enclosure a 16 ft. open, straight up fence to properly
contain the animals. Currently the height and structural composition of the primary fencing for these tiger's
enclosure is not constructed of such material and of such strength to securely contain the tigers. All enclosures
fencing for big cats should be measured. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
