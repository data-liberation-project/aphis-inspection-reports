ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The pig has a pea size pink/red abrasion on the snout. This area is also attracting flies to it. The attending
veterinarian has prescribed a course of treatment using Neosporin which began on April 3rd.
The Neosporin that is being applied to the affected area has expired back in 3/13.
The use of expired medications is considered adulterated and not an appropriate method to treat diseases &/or
injuries. Expired medications are ineffective, and in some cases, can become toxic to the animals being treated.
Correct immediately.
