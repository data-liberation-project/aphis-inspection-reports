SANITATION.
There is a moderate to heavy accumulation of fecal material in the back third of a sheep enclosure. Although the
facility is following a regular cleaning schedule, more frequent cleaning of the enclosure is needed. Accumulations
of fecal material may increase disease hazards to animal areas.
Excreta should be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
