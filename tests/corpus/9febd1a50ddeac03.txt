2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult female corgi (Tag WC16) was seen intermittently non-weight bearing on the left hind limb. When she was
removed from the enclosure, multiple wounds were seen on all four feet. The wounds were reddened with hair loss
around them and appeared to be in varying stages of healing. The injuries had not been observed by the licensee.
Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress. A more complete
method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to assess their health, well-being and for
timely communication with the attending veterinarian. The above described dog needs to be evaluated by a
veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

LOST TAGS.
At least 18 adult dogs have no official identification tags affixed to the dogs’ necks. Many of the identification tags
were on chain collars hanging on enclosure fences and many were missing entirely. Official identification by means
of tags on dogs necks allow for the identification of individual dogs as well as allow the tracking of the movement of
dogs in, out and around the kennel. In the event an official tag is lost from a dog the licensee must make an effort
to locate and reapply the tag to the appropriate dog or affix another official tag to the dog as prescribed in section
2.50.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In an enclosure housing two dogs, a shade structure constructed from corrugated metal and wood was sagging
severely in the middle. The structure was next to a dog shelter and partially obstructed the entrance. One dog in the
enclosure was also seen jumping on top of the structure. This structure could cause injury to the animals if it were to
collapse. The primary enclosure, including the structures within it, must be structurally sound and kept in good
repair.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive accumulation of excreta in all of the dog enclosures. When the licensee was asked when
the last time these enclosures were cleaned, he replied “It had been a while.” Excessive amounts of excreta in
enclosures can increase disease transmission and soil the dogs. Excreta must be removed from primary
enclosures on a daily basis.
