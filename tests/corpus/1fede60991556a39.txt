3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Within the hybrid cat enclosure, the ceiling made of hardware wire had an access point cut into the wire for maintenance
of the space above, leaving sharp points where it was cut and then was resecured with zip ties. The facility also has a
textured surface (carpeting) on the wall adjacent to it, allowing the cats access to the area with sharp points. Primary
enclosures must be constructed and maintained so they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs and
cats, in order to ensure the welfare of the animals in the enclosure.
