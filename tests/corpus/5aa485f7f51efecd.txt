FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The feed pellets and shavings were stored inside of a trailer. The gate on the trailer was open. At least two bags
of feed had holes in them and feed had spilled on the floor of the trailer. The licensee stated that a pig had gotten
up in the trailer and busted the feed bags. There were also discarded items and trash in this storage area. A bag of
shavings was open and stored by the opened gate. Feed/food and bedding that is stored inappropriately can be
contaminated by pests, inclement weather or other sources and if used, cause illness in the animals. Supplies of
food and bedding must be stored in facilities which adequately protect them from deterioration, molding or
contamination by vermin as required.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
***In the alleyway beside the pig enclosure, there was old produce on the ground. Pigs that were being allowed to
roam free in the alleyways were observed eating some of this produce. Old food products on the ground and eaten
by the animals could cause the animals to become ill. The licensee must remove the old produce and provide
nutritious food/feed as required.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
***In the pig enclosure that housed at least 65 pigs of various sizes, there was not enough feed receptacles to allow
access to all of the pigs. When the inspectors arrived at this enclosure, there was no feed in the receptacles. At
least 1/4 of the pigs in this enclosure were underweight and at least twelve of these pigs had varying degrees of hair
loss. One employee began busting pumpkins and at least half of the pigs ran to the fence awaiting the produce. As
the pumpkins were being thrown over the fence, the pigs began running over each other to get to the produce. The
inspectors requested that feed also be fed to these pigs. A 50 lb bag of pig pellets was provided in the feed
receptacles. Once again the pigs proceeded to run over each other to get to the feed. One receptacle was so tall
that the larger pigs had to crawl into the receptacle to eat. Once there were four pigs in this receptacle, there was noroom for any of the rest of the pigs to eat from it. There were a few small receptacles that hung from the fence, yet
were place at a height to where only the taller pigs could reach the feed. The smaller pigs were forced to eat only
what was spilled onto the ground below these receptacles. Lack of access to feed can lead to health issues in the
animals. The licensee must provide enough feed receptacles of appropriate sizes so that all of the pigs have access
to feed without over-crowding and assure that all animals have access to feed as required.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***There was an excessive amount of equipment, discarded material, at least twenty large, uncovered plastic barrel
type trash cans full of excreta/waste material from the enclosures and general clutter deposited around the
barns/enclosures containing animals, storage shed for the hay and straw, feed storage area, alleyways between the
barns containing animals and across the front (street side) of the property. At least four pigs were observed to be
free roaming through the alleyways and exposed to these areas of clutter. Numerous flies were seen around the
barrels of waste. The licensee stated that the barrels are dumped twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday. Clutter
provides a harboring place for rodents and pests which can increase the risk of disease to the animals. Cluttered
items also create sharp points and edges which increase the potential for injury to the animals. The licensee must
remove all of the clutter from the animal areas and assure that it is properly stored at all times to promote a safe and
healthy environment for the animals as required. The licensee must also remove the barrels of waste material from
the facility far enough that it does not attract pests and vermin as required.
***In the pig enclosure there were numerous amounts of old corn cobs on the ground that were left over from
feedings. The licensee stated that the corn cobs had not been removed from the enclosures yet because all of the
waste barrels were full. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease by attracting pests and
providing an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must remove the corn cobs from the enclosure
and assure that all waste products are removed in a timely manner as to promote a healthy environment for the
animals as required.

3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. ***The entire facility had a numerous amount of flies. No form of fly control was being used at the time of inspection.
Pests carry diseases which increase the risks of contamination and disease to the animals. The licensee must take
measures to control pests in the facility to include, but not limited to cleaning and assure that an effective program
for pest control is established as required.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The licensee currently has 2 full time employees that care for the animals. Due to the extensive number of
husbandry issues at this facility this does not appear to be enough employees. Lack of the appropriate number of
employees for the animals within the facility leads to an unhealthy environment and health issues for the animals.
The licensee must have enough employees that are adequately trained to achieve compliance for the number of
animals at the facility as required.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
