2.38(b) REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on16-Aug-17 at 1:45pm.Attempts to contact the authorized representative included
via cell phone and email (as requested on the outgoing voicemail message). There was no response to either
method and no one appeared in the office for 30 minutes following initial contact. A second faculty member was
also unreachable by phone.
Without access to conduct the inspection, regulatory oversight is impossible. Correct by ensuring a knowledgeable
facility representative is available during normal business hours, and alert your inspector as to any scheduling
conflicts which would make inspection impossible.
