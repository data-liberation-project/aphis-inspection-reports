3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor runs of 10 of the dog enclosures had an excessive accumulation of fecal material. It has been
extremely cold for the past couple of weeks, but a method of removing the fecal material from the dog runs must be
established so that it can be removed on a daily basis. Accumulations of fecal material can lead to infectious
disease problems and in warm months can attract vermin and pests. Removal of waste material from inside the dog
enclosures must be performed daily.
