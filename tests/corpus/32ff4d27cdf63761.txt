ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female Dromedary camel, "Sheba", was noted by the APHIS VMO to be limping on her right front leg and the
carpal joint ("knee") appeared enlarged as compared to the left side. No one at the facility had noted this condition
nor had a veterinarian been contacted. Joint swelling and limping are signs of potentially painful conditions (eg.
arthritis, injury, infection) and need to be identified in a timely manner so that appropriate diagnosis can be made
and treatment can be prescribed by the attending veterinarian.
The Operations Manager contacted the veterinary office during the inspection and treatment was prescribed by
telephone. The attending veterinarian (AV) is scheduled to come for a routine health check on all the camels on
6/10/2014. This camel should be examined by the AV and a diagnosis of this condition should be documented. A
plan for addressing this condition should by documented with any treatment prescribed and directions for
re-evaluation if the condition does not improve. All records for the diagnosis, treatment, and plan for this animal
must be available for review during the next inspection by the APHIS VMO.
The exhibitor shall establish and maintain a written program of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate
methods for prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and injuries for all animals.
Corrected during this inspection.
Accompanied on the inspection by the licensee and the Operations Manager. Exit interview conducted on site with
the Operations Manager.
