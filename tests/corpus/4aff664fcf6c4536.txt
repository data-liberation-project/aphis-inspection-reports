SANITATION.
***There is a serious roach infestation in the animal facility. There were numerous roaches observed in the ferret's
and hedgehog's enclosure. It was also expressed that there has been a mouse problem as well. It was stated that
the pest control management has changed since the facility's management has changed. The current pest control is
not effectively managing the roaches and mice in the facility. A more effective pest control plan needs to be
established and maintained. The pesticides and methods used should be discussed with the attending veterinarian
before implementing them to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by August 20, 2014
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the curator.
