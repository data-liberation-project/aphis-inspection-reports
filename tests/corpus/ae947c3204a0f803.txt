3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is a strong smell of ammonia in the room of guinea pigs. The bedding mixed with feces and urine is building
up inside of the pens.
It's not healthy for adult and young guinea pigs to be breathing ammonia. The animals in the affected area do not
have outside access to escape fumes, this can cause respiratory distress and affect the health and well-being of
guinea pigs.
The accumulation of animal waste and its breakdown is a source of odors, and can contribute to the risk of
diseases, pests, and vermin infestation.
Also was observed an accumulation of grime, debris and bedding material around of the water nipples pipes, this
can contribute to the clog of the nipples and to the contamination of the water source.
The primary enclosures need to be properly cleaned more frequently to avoid the build-up of feces grime and soil
and reduce the ammonia and feces accumulation in the guinea pigs room.
Licensee must re-evaluate his waste disposal and frequency of cleaning. Another more frequent method of waste
collection and disposal must be develop and practiced.
Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris:
Provided, however, that such enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
