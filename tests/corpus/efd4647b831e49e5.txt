ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinarian Care for this facility was last updated in 2012. Since that time their original Attending
Veterinarians has retired. Although the facility has been seeking treatment from a new Attending Veterinarian, a
new Program of Veterinarian Care has not been established for the facility. A program of Veterinarian Care is
required to ensure that adequate measures are in place to ensure all health issues are addressed in an appropriate
and timely manner. Licensee must ensure that they have a written Program of Veterinarian care for the facility that
has been signed off and approved by the current Attending Veterinarian. In addition, Licensee must ensure that the
Veterinarian Care Plan is detailed with all treatments, medications, vaccinations, dosages, administration etc.
