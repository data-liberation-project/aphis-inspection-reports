FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several areas of the fence around the goat and alpaca enclosure that had gaps or bent wire that could
be a danger to the animals. Additionally, the sheet metal on the outside of the large barn had become loose and
presented a sharp edge that could injure the animals.The fence needs to be repaired and the sheet metal repaired
to assure the animals do not become trapped trying to escape or injured by the sheet metal. The indoor and outdoor
housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence at the back (uphill) of the property had an area where it was lower than the rest of the fence.
This area was near a piled rock structure which made the fence effectively shorter still at this point. This area
presents a likely point for an animal to get over the fence. The facility must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is
of sufficient height (at least eight feet) to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. This height must be
maintained for the entire length and vegetation must not be allowed to compromise the integrity and effectiveness of
the fence. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that
it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
An exit interview was conducted with facility director.
