ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The one year old fallow deer "Peyton" has overgrown hooves on four feet. Both toes on all four feet are elongated
enough to cross at the ends. Untreated, overgrown hooves can contribute to orthopedic dysfunction and discomfort
to the animal.
The attending veterinarian should be consulted for appropriate methods to treat and prevent hoof abnormalities.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The coati mundi is housed in an enclosure that has a floor partially constructed of metal. A metal section in the
middle of the floor has been damaged by the animal with a resulting hole approximately 6 inches in diameter. The
rough edges of the hole have been pulled into the enclosure. Continued damage to the floor can contribute to
possible escape and/or injury to the animal.
Housing facilities must be kept in good repair in order to safely contain the animal and prevent injury. The damaged
floor should be repaired or replaced.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
