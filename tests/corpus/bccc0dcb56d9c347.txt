ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care is incomplete. There is no guidance or recommendations for several of the species
that were on hand and/or indicated on purchase records, including: fallow deer, jacob(cid:25)s sheep, pigs, rabbits, cavies,
groundhog, degu, and ferrets. Lack of adequate veterinary guidance for prevention, control, diagnosis, and
treatment of diseases and injuries is not consistent with adequate veterinary care for these species. The written
program of veterinary care should include guidance for all species on hand or under the licensee's possession or
control that are for regulated purposes. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to establish a written
program of veterinary care that includes all species purchased, held, or otherwise acquired by the licensees for
regulated purposes.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility representative indicated that he and the licensee are both authorized by the veterinarian to perform
descenting on their young skunks, and that they performed this practice on their young skunks that were recently
sold. This practice is painful and requires veterinary expertise not only to perform the procedure, but also to monitor
the animals before and after the procedure is complete, including anesthesia, analgesia, and recovery. It is not
consistent with current veterinary standards of practice to have this procedure performed by someone other than a
licensed veterinarian. Correct by ensuring that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases
and injuries are used, including seeking veterinary care for those procedures that must be performed by a licensed
veterinarian.
Correct from this time forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.The facility has inadequate recordkeeping. The facility was able to provide a record of animals on hand for several
species of covered animals that were noted and seen on today's inspection. However; this document did not include
any offspring that were born at the facility, or several other covered species that were physically seen within the
facility by inspectors. This would include but is not limited to at least 1 cavy, 5 fallow deer, 2 juvenile cows, 1 goat
and 31 rabbits. In addition, there were acquisition records at the facility for 1 groundhog purchased from an auction
on 9/18/2015; 6 degu, 1 groundhog and 1 cavy purchased from an auction on 9/19/2015; 1 ferret and 3 cavy
purchased at an auction on 11/6/2015. None of these animals were listed on the record of animals on hand and
there were no correlating disposition records to indicate that these animals had been sold. When asked about these
animals, the facility representative informed inspectors that there were 2 cavies located in the trailer in the middle of
the facility, that inspectors were not allowed to access this area at the time of inspection, and that the other animals
listed above had already been sold through means of internet sales. He also stated that they did not have or
maintain records for the sales of these animals, or for any of the animals that had been sold from the facility since
the last inspection. This includes 2 coyotes that were recorded on the previous inspection 's inventory, and an
undetermined number of the fox offspring that had already been sold in 2016. No records of births had been kept for
animals born on the premises. The facility representative indicated that they used to keep their records locked up in
the tailor located in the middle of the facility. However; there had been a recent break-in and several of their records
had been taken at that time. Inadequate recordkeeping hinders the inspection process and does not allow for proper
tracking of animal movement. APHIS officials need to inspect acquisition and disposition records to ensure that
animal transactions are being conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. This facility must maintain
proper acquisition records which fully and correctly disclose appropriate information on all animals purchased,
offspring born, or animals acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his possession or under his control; as well
as proper disposition records for all animals transported, sold, died, euthanized, or otherwise disposed.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
While inspecting the back pasture area, APHIS officials heard noises coming from inside the trailer that is on the
premises. The representative accompanying APHIS officials stated that there were only caged birds housed in this
trailer, and no regulated animals were located inside. After looking through the window, one inspector was able to
visualize a cavy on the floor of the trailer. When asked again if there were any regulated species inside, the
representative said no. However, when asked another time if there were cavies inside, he stated that yes, there
were
a pair of cavies inside the trailer, but that they were pets only and not to be used for breeding. There was no
paperwork showing the gender of the two individuals located inside. Additional records showed that the licensee
had
purchased 3 cavies on 11/6/15, gender unknown, in addition to the 1 cavy that was noted on the previous inspection
on 9/28/15; however, there was no disposition paperwork for any of these animals. When the APHIS officialsindicated to the licensee that the sale of those animals qualified as regulated activity and requested entry into the
trailer to inspect the cavies, the representative refused. He stated that those were pet animals only and they were
not
to be used for breeding and that he would not accompany us into the trailer. One of the inspectors asked, "Are you
refusing us access to an animal area?"(cid:29) and the representative said, ""Yes."(cid:29) At that point the inspection was
terminated. The inspector informed the representative that this would be documented and cited as a refusal on the
report, which would be discussed via telephone exit interview and delivered by certified mail and email.
Refusal to allow APHIS officials to enter a facility in order to inspect regulated species and other potentially
regulated
animals is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Access must be granted to any facilities as deemed necessary by
APHIS officials in order to enforce the provisions of the AWA regulations and standards, including but not limited to
animal housing areas, procedure areas, transportation conveyances, holding areas, or other auxiliary areas related
to
the care or use of regulated species. Correct by allowing APHIS officials to enter and examine all facilities, property,
and animals as are deemed necessary to enforce the Animal Welfare Act.
2.131(b)(1) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection, a newborn rabbit was noted stuck in the wire mesh floor of its enclosure, with its head and
forelegs through an opening in the floor and facing down towards the ground. The newborn was at first thought to
be dead, but closer inspection revealed that it was in fact breathing and struggling in spastic movements. The
moribund condition of this animal and the fact that it was stuck in the floor of the enclosure was alerted to the facility
representative, who began to try to extricate the baby rabbit. At first the head and forelegs were grasped and
squeezed, trying to force the baby rabbit back up through the mesh floor. After ~1 minute at this attempt, the facility
representative retrieved some long-handled graspers to try to reach the newborn from the inside of the enclosure,
as his arms were not long enough to extend to the back of the four-foot long enclosure. The graspers were placed
around the middle of the newborn, behind the shoulders, and then used to try to elevate the newborn(cid:25)s legs to the
point of popping through the floor and back inside the enclosure. This effort was continued for approximately
another minute before the newborn was successfully extricated from the opening in the floor and returned to the
nest box. At that time, the inspectors asked the facility representative if he would prefer to have the inspection
stopped so that he could further remedy the situation by relocating the animals to a different enclosure; the
representative declined doing so and stated that he could take care of it after the inspection was completed.
Handling this newborn rabbit in such a way with the graspers in an attempt to extricate it from its position could
cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Additionally, it was unclear how or why the newborn
rabbit got into that position in the first place, but potential causes could include: falling out of the nest box, trying to
escape the nest box if it was excessively warm or dirty for the newborn(cid:25)s comfort, or being chased or dragged out
by either of the adult rabbits in the enclosure. Some or all of these factors may have contributed to the newborn
becoming entrapped in the wire mesh flooring, and the handling practices leading up to this incident were not doneas expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct by ensuring that handling of all animals is done in an
appropriate manner as described here.

Correct from this time forward.
3.51(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The rabbit trailer is inadequately ventilated. One end of the building is equipped with a window that was unopened
at
the time of inspection. On the other end, there was an exhaust fan that was used as the sole source of ventilation
for
this area. The exhaust fan was moving slowly and was covered with an excessive amount hair, cobwebs and debris
at the time of inspection. 85% of the walls of the building are covered with animal enclosures stacked on top of each
other, the fronts and sides of which were also covered with an excessive amount of calcium buildup, excreta, hair,
cobwebs, debris, and other organic material. The ammonia levels in this area were high enough to
irritate the inspectors' nose, throat and eyes. Due to the inadequate cleaning of the building and enclosures, paired
with the use of the exhaust fan alone as the single method of ventilation, the
ammonia levels were elevated to a rate that was noxious to the inspectors after being inside, with the door open, for
just a few minutes. The air quality inside this structure was not sufficient to provide for the health and comfort of the
animals housed therein. This facility must ensure that they have adequate ventilation for all rabbit areas to alleviate
odor, high ammonia levels and to provide fresh air, and to use auxiliary methods of ventilation when the ambient
temperature is above 85F.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a trailer that is currently being used to house a total of 23 rabbits. The interior walls and surfaces of this
trailer are constructed with plywood and or a similar material. These surfaces are not substantially impervious to
moisture and are not able to be readily cleaned or sanitized. 90% of the wall surfaces were covered with brown to
black organic material, hair, waste and debris. Having improper husbandry practices and surfaces that do not allow
for proper cleaning or sanitization exposes the animals to unnecessary hazards and directly contributes to the odor
and ammonia levels within the facility. All interior building
surfaces of indoor housing facilities must be constructed and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to
moisture and may be readily sanitized.Correct by: 6/8/2016

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During the inspection of one of the outdoor rabbit enclosures containing a breeding pair, one newborn rabbit was
noted to be caught with its head and forelegs through an opening in the wire mesh floor. The newborn at first
appeared dead, but upon closer examination it was noted to be breathing. The facility representative was alerted to
the newborn(cid:25)s position and its moribund condition, and he proceeded to extricate the baby after an effort of several
minutes. The openings in the wire mesh floor were big enough to allow this newborn to fall through and become
entrapped, causing severe distress, pain, and suffering. If the animal had not been removed at the time it was
noticed, it would have died in the position, as it took several minutes and significant effort to extricate it from the
opening in the floor and return it to the nest box. At that time, once the newborn was returned, the inspectors asked
the facility representative if he would like to stop the inspection in order to place the mother and babies in a more
appropriate enclosure and to remove the adult male. He declined to do so at that time, saying he would come back
to it after the completion of the inspection. Rabbits must be housed in primary enclosures that do not cause harm or
injury, contain them safely, and protect them from predators. This newborn rabbit was at risk for serious injury,
distress, and even death as a result of the construction of the primary enclosure (mainly, the openings in the wire
mesh floor were large enough for the newborn to fall partially through, face-first). Correct by ensuring that primary
enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect rabbits from injury, to contain them, and
to keep predators out.

WATERING.
Most of the rabbits' water receptacles were contaminated with a buildup of organic material, spent food, and other
debris, causing the water to become dirty and murky. Lack of adequate potable water can be devastating to an
animal(cid:25)s health and comfort, especially given the heat and air quality in the rabbits(cid:25) environment. Correct by
ensuring that sufficient, potable water is provided daily, and that all water receptacles are sanitized when dirty, at a
frequency not less than once every 2 weeks.

SANITATION.
All sides, tops, floors, and litter pans underneath of the primary enclosures inside the rabbit trailer and most of the
outside rabbit enclosures have an excessive amount of calcium buildup, excreta, hair, cobwebs, debris and otherorganic material build up within the enclosures. Having improper cleaning and husbandry practices expose the
animals to unnecessary disease hazards and directly contributes to the odor within the facility, which was to the
point of causing irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract of the inspectors after only a few minutes inside
with the door opened. The facility must perform periodic cleaning of all primary enclosures, to keep them
reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs, and other debris. They must use an appropriate method for cleaning and
sanitization that has been set forth by 3.56(b)(3) of the Animal Welfare Act.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
After contact was made with the facility representative, while waiting on the public road for the representative to
arrive
and begin the inspection, a young deer was seen coming through the bushes and circled the facility several times.
This deer had a tag in the left ear, which the representative stated later that any deer purchased by the licensee
through the auction would have been tagged at the auction. The representative stated that, while inspecting the
pasture area, there should have been 5 fallow deer inside, but APHIS Officials were only able to identify 4. The 5th
one, presumably, was the one seen on the outside of the facility. The facility representative stated, I don t know
where she could have gotten out, so he was under the impression that that animal was indeed one that belonged
inside the property. The fence surrounding the pasture area is the only fence surrounding
the entire property. The section of fence adjacent to the driveway is 4 feet tall; the fence facing the road is 7 feet;
the
fence at the back of the pasture area is 5 feet. Correct by ensuring that the primary enclosure is constructed so that
it protects and safely contains the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several open bags of food stored on the floor in a shed on the premises. Having open bags on the floor
leaves them vulnerable to deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin, as well as accessible to any of the
number of free-roaming birds on the premises. Correct by storing supplies of food and bedding in a manner which
adequately protects them against deterioration, molding, and contamination.

3.130WATERING.
The single water trough for the deer, sheep, pigs, and cows in the pasture contains a small amount (about 2(cid:29) feet
deep) of murky water contaminated with bird feathers, mud, feces, and other debris. Additionally, the tub is
approximately two feet tall, and the micro pigs housed in the enclosure only stand about that tall at the shoulders, so
they could have difficulty reaching the water at the level it was currently filled to in the trough. Lack of adequate
potable water can be devastating to an animal(cid:25)s health and comfort, especially given the heat (National Weather
Service reported the high temperature as reaching 89 degrees F in the afternoon on the day of inspection). Correct
by ensuring that sufficient, potable water is provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of all animals,
considering the age, species, condition, and type of the animals. Additionally, all water receptacles must be kept
clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
The majority of the enclosures and nest boxes containing skunks and foxes are excessively dirty, with piles of feces
and spilled feed on the ground of ground-level enclosures, as well as wet, soiled bedding in the nest boxes, and
tufts of hair matted on the floors and walls of wire enclosures. Dirty conditions cause discomfort to the animals if
they cannot escape contamination and odor; they also attract pests which can transmit infectious disease to the
animals contained therein. Correct by removing excreta, spoiled bedding, and spent feed as often as necessary to
prevent contamination of the animals and minimize disease hazards and odors.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The pasture containing the deer, sheep, pigs, and cows is littered with unused building materials, sections of
fencing, empty cages, and other debris. There are two barn/shed-type structures that are open and accessible to
the animals, but which contain an assortment of unused equipment, supplies, and cages which are in various states
of disrepair. There are loose boards allowing entry underneath the trailer in the middle of the pasture, which the
facility representative stated that the pigs will often enter and stay in this area for an indeterminate amount of time.
There is no way to know what types of hazards are situated under the trailer, and it is impossible to remove excreta
from this area as a result of the pigs entering this space. Additionally, other animals may become entrapped if they
were to attempt to enter this area. These materials and locations are potentially injurious to the animals, posing
risks of punctures, cuts, or foot or body entrapment, and must be removed or repaired so as to protect the animals
from injury and to facilitate appropriate husbandry practices. Correct by keeping premises clean and in good repair
in order to protect the animals from injury. Accumulations of trash and unused building materials shall be placed in
designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals.3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The premises as a whole is infested with flies, such that inspectors were continuously swatting flies away during
inspection. It was also noted that the deer, pigs, cows, and sheep were continuously swishing their tails to keep flies
off. This degree of fly infestation causes discomfort to the animals, as well as poses a risk of disease transmission
to the animals. Correct by establishing and maintaining a safe and effective program for the control of pests
