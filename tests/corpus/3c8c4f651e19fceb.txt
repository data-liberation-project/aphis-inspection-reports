NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
An inspection at this location was made at approximately 11:30 am on 3/21/16. Wagon Trail Pets and
Supplies LLC is no longer in business at this location. The current occupant at this business location provided the
USDA inspector with a phone number for the owners of Wagon Trail Pets. I telephoned Mr. Overstreet and he told
me that they are breeding/selling regulated species at their home address. I explained to him that a licensee must
notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in address within 10 days of any change.
To be corrected by: April 1, 2016.
No regulated activity can occur until the licensee has notified the Western Regional Office in Fort Collins of the
above
changes and the new site has been inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
