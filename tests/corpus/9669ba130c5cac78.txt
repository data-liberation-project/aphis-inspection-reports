2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
The wire barrier fence surrounding the upper end of the enclosure (containing 14 mouflon, two blackbuck and four nilgai)
was sagging so it was only 2 feet high which would allow anyone to easily step over and reach the primary enclosure.
The barrier fencing near the end of the wallaby enclosure was limited to a single chain, which could easily be stepped
over .
The public barrier in these locations is insufficient to keep the public from contacting the primary enclosures. All public
barriers must be constructed and maintained to assure the safety of the animals and the public.

An uncovered can of dog food, and a plastic bag of liquified greens are in the refrigerator door; moldy carrots are mixed in
with fresh carrots and produce intended for animal consumption are in an open bin on the bottom shelf. There is liquid
material coming from black bananas dripping on a piece cardboard on a lower shelf.


Animals can become ill from consuming food that is spoiled or contaminated with insecticides or chemicals. All food must
