2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, there were multiple prescribed drugs for USDA covered species that did not have an expiration
date on them. Expiration dates are essential to determining the period at which the efficacy of the drug starts to diminish
and is no longer effective; and if missing, this information cannot be determined when treating the animals. Drugs that
have questionable efficacy pose a potential health risk to the animals, in addition to them not treating the condition/illness,
leading to more suffering. Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include
the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.

2.131(b)(1) Direct

Handling of animals.
At the time of inspection, a single, juvenile (a little over a year old) male dromedary camel was observed pacing in his
small enclosure. He never stopped moving back and forth and was never observed laying down, standing calmly, or
chewing his cud. He was also mouthing/cribbing and chewing on various parts of the fencing along his enclosure. This is
abnormal behavior in ruminants. He was seen rubbing against a pole and plucking his own hair out. There are also videos


from social media depicting the same mouthing/chewing behaviors from March 2022.

The licensee has discussed this behavior with the attending veterinarian and recommendations were made. Only two of
the many recommendations made by the attending veterinarian have been implemented by the facility and the camel’s
abnormal behavior is ongoing.

The above-mentioned behaviors are all significantly abnormal and are indicators of stress, anxiety, and potentially
stereotypic behavior. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that
does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, or unnecessary discomfort.

2.131(c)(1) Repeat

Handling of animals.
On April 20, 2022, a member of the public (a minor) was scratched on the leg by one of the lemurs during the public
interaction encounter conducted at the facility. The health and well-being of the animals and public can be negatively
affected during these exhibition encounters if the animals are not handled in a manner that is conducive to minimal risk of
harm to both parties (lemurs and public). During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of
harm to the animal and to the public.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection there were several goats (a mix of adults and a kids) contained in an enclosure with 3 alpacas (2
adults and 1 offspring), and 2 lambs. There was a piece of sheet metal in the sun that was cemented into the ground,


having been built as enrichment for the goats. The structure had dirt hoof marks on it, showing that the goats were using
it. The structure was hot to the touch, as my hand could not be placed on the object longer than a few seconds without
causing pain/burning. The metal easily retains heat, and consequently poses a hazard to the well-being of these animals
as they could burn and injure themselves during its use. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such
strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and
shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
At the time of inspection there were numerous fruit flies both flying around and settled on the food for two kinkajous (that
were on exhibit), as well as the produce stored in the prep kitchen used for other USDA covered species. Fruit flies can
transfer germs from dirty surfaces to clean ones, and therefore possibly lead to illness of the animals through food
contamination. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pest shall
be established and maintained.
