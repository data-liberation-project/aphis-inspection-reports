WATERING.
All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty.....
At least 4 water bottles had a dark layer of algae on the inside. Water bottles must be sanitized when dirty. Water
bottles must be cleaned at least every two weeks or as often as needed to maintain them clean. Dirty water bottles
can cause many animals to get sick. Clean water bottles as a routine practice, minimally every 2 weeks but more
often if they are dirty.

SANITATION.
Pest control.
Many black flies were observed to be in the building and the enclosures. No method of fly control was seen to be in
place. Flies were landing on guinea pigs and in their feed. Large numbers of flies and pests can cause animals to
get sick and can spread sickness to other animals. Effective and safe methods to control pests must be put into
practice and maintained to protect the health and wellbeing of the guinea pigs.
