PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***** The feet and legs of multiple puppies were observed passing through enclosure floor openings. Two puppies
are in contact with the affected flooring located in outdoor enclosure of whelping house. Flooring that allows the feet
and legs to pass through any openings could lead to possible injury. In addition, the daily activity and mobility of the
puppies is affected. The licensee did place four one by one square foot pieces of tenderfoot flooring in the enclosure
during the inspection. The licensee must ensure that all flooring does not allow any feet or legs to pass through any
openings in the flooring.
Corrected at time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee by Bill Heine ACI.
