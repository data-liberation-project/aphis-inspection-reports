2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Chinchilla in 21C seen in last inspection (11/3/2021) with a hard lump under its left mandible was not on a treatment plan
at re-inspection. The attending veterinarian(AV) relayed through a clinic technician on a phone call with the VMO on
11/18/21 that this chinchilla had not been discussed with the AV. While this chinchilla was still observed to be in good
body condition, the hair loss and lump on its jaw could indicate a problem with its mouth and needs further evaluation by
the attending veterinarian. The licensee must ensure this chinchilla is evaluated by the AV and the treatment plan must
be followed by the licensee.

Note: In the exit interview on 11/22/21 the licensee said he contacted the AV to formulate a treatment plan. The VMO
called the AV on 11/22 and confirmed this animal's treatment was discussed with the AV.

Employees.
The licensee said that a dedicated employee has not been hired or trained to work daily with the chinchillas and that he
spends 2-4 hours in the morning and/or 2-4 hours in the evening and sometimes more time on the weekends depending
on other tasks that need to be done for things other than tasks with chinchillas. We observed the old hay cubes had been


replaced, animals had food and water and the gutters under enclosures were clean but little progress has been made on
changing feeders with rough/sharp edges and the licensee said other things had to be fixed in the past two weeks in the
facility so feeders couldn't be done. The remaining maintenance issues observed and time available that the licensee has
reported without help from employees is not adequate to maintain an acceptable level of maintenance and daily
observations of animals. Ensure that a sufficient number of trained employees are in place to maintain the professionally
acceptable level of husbandry practices required by the Animal Welfare Act.

The inspection was conducted with the licensee and his employee. The exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
