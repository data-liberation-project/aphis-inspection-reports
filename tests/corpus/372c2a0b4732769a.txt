The door to the metal storage bin for the grain did not close properly. This door was bent open and had jagged
edges, and the grain stored inside was not in storage bags or containers. This condition can allow rodents and
pests direct access to the feed for the sheep. Contamination of food materials can lead to health issues of the
animals. Food storage containers must seal properly in order to prevent contamination and entrances of pests. This
door to the feed storage bin must be repaired in order to maintain a proper seal.
