FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
After a heavy rainstorm, the outdoor enclosure that houses 11 wolves does not have adequate drainage. The
enclosure is located at the southwest end of the facility and water from the storm has accumulated in one corner of
the pen. Proper drainage is necessary to ensure the animals have a clean, dry and comfortable enclosure at all
times, and the accumulated water promotes sanitation and husbandry issues.
As a temporary solution, the licensee is using a pump system to assist with drainage of excess water. In addition, a
permanent solution for the drainage issue has been scheduled for October 22, 2016. At that time, a local group will
be providing personnel to help place 120 tons of rock to resurface the facility enclosures. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures have a suitable and effective method to prevent the accumulation of water or an effective
method to rapidly eliminate the excess water.
