ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Bichon id # 011 was heavily matted, with matted fur being twisted tightly and corded, over 90% of his body. This
included his back, hind legs, under his belly and his feet. Heavily matted fur pulls and separates from the skin
causing potential skin irritation, may not insulate the dogs well and can be painful. Dogs should be groomed as an
appropriate method to prevent matting.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility is currently removing feces from primary enclosures and then discarding the feces a few feet away from
the outdoor enclosures. The fecal material is not composting due to cold temperatures and is left to accumulate
adjacent to the kennel area housing animals which may pose an increased risk of contamination and disease.
Licensee must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of accumulated wastes to minimize
contamination and disease risks.
