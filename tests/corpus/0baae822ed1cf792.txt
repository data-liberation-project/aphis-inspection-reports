2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs were noted with health issues that were not under veterinary care at the time of the inspection.
The left hind dew claw Pekingese, female, #199 had grown long and curled into the skin.
Female, ID #198, had a white, milky area with rough, irregular appearance to both corneas, with changes more
prominent in the right eye. The eyes appeared dry with slight reddening of the whites of the eyes.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment. Diseases of the cornea
can cause intense pain. Breeds with eyes that bulge or protrude are susceptible to drying and damage to the eyes.
Daily observation and prompt care is necessary to provide optimum care and welfare.
Corrected by the end of the exit interview.
3.1(c)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The surfaces of the hopper and bowl of feeders for multiple dogs had a thick accumulation of dark brown, sticky,
material that appeared to be food residue. Additionally, the edges of the food bowls were bent upwards, resulting in
sharp points along the edges. Sharp points were also noted in several kennels due to screws protruding into their
interior, two exterior run doors that were chewed with resultant sharp edges, and a small divider panel in a kennel
housing approximately two-week-old puppies that was broken and chewed.
Lack of maintenance from cleaning can allow harboring germs and transmission of disease between animals.
Sharp points may cause injury to the animals.
A regular program of maintenance for surfaces is required to maintain optimum health and welfare if the animals. Corrected by the end of the exit interview.
This inspection was conducted with a facility representative 13-November-2019 and owner on 18-November-2019.
The exit interview was conducted with Marvin Knepp.
