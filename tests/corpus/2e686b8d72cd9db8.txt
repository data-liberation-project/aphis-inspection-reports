(This is a focused inspection)
The licensee acquired a cougar cub approximately 7 months ago.This animal now weighs approximately 45 to 50
pounds and is 9 months old. The facility acquired the animal without having a suitable enclosure for this animal as it
grows into an adult animal. The animal is currently in an enclosure measuring approximately 15'(cid:25) by 11'(cid:25). The
licensee must provide an enclosure which will meet the needs of an adult cougar. Failure to provide the availability
of an appropriate enclosure with adequate space for exercise, climbing and resting platforms for this growing
animal, may lead to issues concerning the well-being of this animals overall health.
