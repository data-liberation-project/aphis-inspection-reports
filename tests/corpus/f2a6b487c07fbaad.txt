ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Male Maltese (tag #5) has tartar covering all of the upper teeth on both sides. Additionally, the gums are red and
receded on the upper canine teeth and premolars. There is an accumulation of greyish fluid along the gum line,
especially on the right upper premolars. Documentation shows that this dog was examined by the attending
veterinarian on June 12, 2014 and was found to have a dental score of Grade 2. The licensee has not documented
any progression of this dog's dental disease. This dog must be examined by the attending veterinarian to determine
needed treatment. Dental disease left untreated can lead to significant health problems and can also be painful.
Documentation of exam and treatment must also be maintained by the licensee for future review by APHIS officials.
