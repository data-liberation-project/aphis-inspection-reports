ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not have a formal arrangement with a part time attending veterinarian and an attending
veterinarian has not visited the facility for over 1 year. Although the licensee has recognized this deficiency in the
program, the facility does not have a written program of veterinary care. This is necessary to ensure that the
animals on hand are receiving adequate veterinary care. This program must be completed by the applicant and the
attending veterinarian, include regularly scheduled visits to the premises, and made available for review during
USDA inspections.
