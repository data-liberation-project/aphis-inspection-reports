CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The bottom and sides of the inside of the water receptacle for the dog/wolf hybrids are coated in a green film. There
is also an accumulation of debris on the bottom. Water receptacles that are not kept cleaned and sanitized
demonstrate that unsanitary conditions exist with this receptacle. All water receptacles must be cleaned and
sanitized at least one every two weeks or more frequently to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris and other
disease hazards. Correct by 7 February 2019.
