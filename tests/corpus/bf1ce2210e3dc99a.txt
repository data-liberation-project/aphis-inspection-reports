ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult black and white shih-tzu identification number KSDBG 2-15, date of birth 07-24-2006, has a buildup of a
tartar like substance covering the upper premolar teeth on the right and left side and about half of the canine teeth.
A buildup of tartar can lead to dental disease, be painful, and impact the dog(cid:25)s ability to eat normally. Left
unattended tartar can cause damage to gum tissue affecting the overall health of the animal. The owner must have
this dog seen by a veterinarian to address the tartar buildup and teeth cleaned to help ensure the good health of
this dog. Correct by 07-15-2016.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility owner and Karl Thornton, ACI.
