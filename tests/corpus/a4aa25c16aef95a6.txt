2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The individual at this premise has been conducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license. The inspector
visited the premises with a US Fish and Wildlife agent on July 30, 2015 where the individual admitted to selling a
juvenile ringtail lemur on or about July 15, 2015. She also admitted to selling three other juvenile ringtail lemurs at
some point this year. In the presence of the US Fish and Wildlife agent, I informed her that conducting regulated
activity was in violation of the Animal Welfare Act. In addition, upon inspecting sale records from Madison Animal
Auction on January 7, 2015, there was a record of her selling two coatis. There have been two application
packages sent to this individual, one approximately two years ago, and the other early in 2015. According to an
Inspection and Licensing Assistant at the Western Regional Office who spoke with her over the phone after the
second application packet was sent, she asked about what involved regulated activity. She still has not applied for
a license.
Persons conducting regulated activity must have a valid USDA license to ensure compliance with the Animal
Welfare Act by inspection of the animals, animal facilities, equipment and records.
The premise owner must not conduct regulated activity without a license. Any person operating or intending to
operate as a dealer or exhibitor must have a valid license.
An exit interview was conducted by Lynn Clarke, ACI, with the premise owner and in the presence of a US Fish and
Wildlife agent.
