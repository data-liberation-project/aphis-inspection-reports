2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. There were 2 weanling size guinea pigs in Pen 66 with a
skin abnormality. A white weanling and a brown and white weanling had a circular area approximately 2 cm in size on the
bridge of the nose with hair loss and flaky or scabbed skin. The licensee had observed the health conditions in the guinea
pigs but was not currently administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care addressed the condition and
provided treatment options.
Skin conditions with hair loss and redness can be a sign of infectious disease that may cause distress to the animals and
may spread to other animals if not treated.
The licensee must initiate treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending
veterinarian to determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
