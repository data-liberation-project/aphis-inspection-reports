Veterinary care for dogs.
The current program of veterinary care does not include a sampling program with a schedule approved by the attending
veterinarian for intestinal worms, coccidia, and giardia. Lack of a sampling program makes it difficult to determine the
effectiveness of the treatment plan for parasites. A sampling program for worms, coccidia, and giardia with a scheduled
approved by the attending veterinarian must be established to help maintain an effective parasite program.
