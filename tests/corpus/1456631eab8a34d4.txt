3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
Each enclosure has a plastic bucket that is used to provide water to the dogs. In at least seven enclosures, containing a
total of fifteen adult dogs, the top edge of the bucket has been excessively chewed and worn. Brown material, wood
shavings and hair are trapped in the damaged areas of the buckets. Damaged surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized which could increase the risk of disease towards the animals.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities-including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects-that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
The licensee must replace the chewed buckets or alter them in a manner that eliminates the damaged areas and allows
for cleaning and sanitizing of the bucket to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are properly maintained at
all times to support the health of the animals.

Each cat enclosure contains wood shelves that are used as resting surfaces for the cats. In at least three enclosures,
containing approximately eight adult cats, the paint has been scratched off the surfaces of the boards exposing the wood

beneath. The exposed wood is no longer impervious to moisture. Wood that is not impervious to moisture cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease towards the animals.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities-including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects-that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
The licensee must alter the wooden resting boards in a manner that makes them impervious to moisture and allows for
proper cleaning and sanitizing to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are properly maintained at all times to
support the health of the animals.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility uses wood shavings to cover the floors in the dog enclosures. In at least two enclosures, containing a total of
six adult dogs, the wood shavings are completely saturated and no clean and dry shavings remain. The licensee thought
it had been several days since the shavings had been cleaned out and replaced. Saturated shavings are unable to
absorb any further liquids which may result in the hair coats of the dogs becoming wet and contaminated and could also
increase the risk of odors, disease hazards and the attraction of pests.

Contaminated material such as wood shavings must be replaced. The licensee must remove the saturated wood
shavings from the enclosures and ensure that each enclosure remains free of contaminated material to support the health
of the animals.

3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The adult dogs are housed inside a large barn and each enclosure contains one or more shelters for the dogs. In at least
ten enclosures, containing a total of twenty-one adult dogs, the shelters are too small to compliantly accommodate the
dogs. In several of these enclosures the dogs are significantly taller than the shelter and are unable to sit or stand inside
them in a normal position. Other shelters are not large enough to contain all the dogs in the enclosure at the same time.
In one of these affected enclosures which contains four adult Australian shepherds, the two shelters only appeared to be
able to each contain just one dog compliantly. Shelters that do not allow dogs to sit, stand and lie in normal positions
could cause discomfort to the animals. Shelters that are not large enough to accommodate all animals may result in an
animal failing to find protection from frigid temperatures.

Outdoor facilities for dogs or cats must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each
outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely. The licensee must provide compliant shelters to each enclosure in order to support the
health and well-being of the dogs.

Feeding

Thirteen Australian Shepherd puppies are housed in enclosures with wood shavings spread across the floors. The food
receptacles for the puppies are heavily contaminated with wood shavings making it difficult for the puppies to consume
the food without also consuming the shavings. Food contaminated with foreign material may discourage the animals from
consuming it leading to poor body condition. Ingesting the foreign material could also cause digestive problems and lead
to other serious health issues.

Food must be uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the normal
condition and weight of the animal. The licensee must ensure that all food provided to the animals is free of wood
shavings and other contaminates in order to support their health and well-being.

Watering
One enclosure, containing one adult male Australian Shepherd, has no water in the water bucket. Only dry wood
shavings were observed in the bucket. An adult female Australian shepherd has recently whelped four puppies and is
kept in a large wire crate inside the house and is let out numerous times a day to exercise and access water. While inside
the crate the female has no access to potable water.

In at least two other enclosures, containing a total of four adult dogs, the water in the buckets is heavily contaminated by a
thick layer of wood shavings making it difficult for the dogs to drink water without also consuming the shavings. Failure to
provide potable water may result in dehydration which could lead to further serious health issues.


Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs, unless restricted by the attending veterinarian. The licensee
must ensure that each dog is provided with potable water at all times in order to support their health and well-being.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee believes the adult dogs were all vaccinated and dewormed in July 2022, but there is no documentation of
these treatments/preventatives. Failure to document the vaccinating and deworming of the animals may interfere with the
ability of APHIS officials to determine if the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must maintain medical records that include the names of all vaccines and treatments administered and the dates
of the administration. The licensee must document the vaccination and deworming of the animals on a medical record.
The licensee must ensure that all veterinary care provided to the dogs is documented on a complete medical record
containing all the required information.

Veterinary care for dogs.
In November 2022 the facility had heartworm testing and fecals done on some of the adult dogs. There is no
documentation of this testing and the results of these tests. Failure to document testing and test results could interfere
with the ability of APHIS officials to determine if the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.


Dealers must keep copies of medical records that include the dates and findings/results of all screening, routine, or other
required or recommended test or examination. The licensee must ensure that all tests for heart worms and intestinal
parasites is documented along with the results of such tests. The licensee must ensure that all veterinary care provided to
the dogs is documented on a complete medical record containing all the required information.
