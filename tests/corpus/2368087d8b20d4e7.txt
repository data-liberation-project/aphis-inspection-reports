ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An approximately 10 year old, neutered, male, red-coated Pomeranian dog named "Farm Dog" has missing teeth,
loose teeth with receding gums, heavy buildup of hard, brown material covering the enamel of the teeth, red and
swollen gums, and pus at the gumline. These signs could indicate a periodontal disease process that could be
painful and lead to systemic infections. The licensee has not consulted a veterinarian about this dog's dental
condition.
A black and white, adult, female cat of unknown age has mucopurulent discharge from the nose and crusts around
the eyes. These signs could indicate an illness that could cause discomfort and difficulty breathing. The licensee
has not consulted a veterinarian about this cat's health concerns.
A calico, adult, female cat of unknown age has mucopurulent discharge from the nose and crusts in the corners of
its eyes. This cat also has a large patch of hair loss and crusts on its back. These signs could indicate illnesses that
cause discomfort and pain to the cat. The licensee has not consulted a veterinarian about this cat's health concerns.
The licensee must work with a veterinarian to ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,
and treat diseases. A veterinarian must be consulted about the health concerns of these animals and the licensee
must comply with the directions of the veterinarian.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Supplies of food for the cats and dogs are stored with bags in direct contact with the walls. This prevents cleaning
around the food supplies and could therefore lead to spoiling of the food. The supplies must be stored off the floor
and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies.
A bag of food on top of the stored food supplies has several holes ripped in the packaging exposing the food inside.
This could allow the food to become infested with vermin and become contaminated. All open supplies of food and
bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.

SANITATION.
In the guinea pig enclosure, there is a bench-sized wooden box that is open on one side and has a glass floor. This
box is open to the guinea pigs and is used to store feed bins. The glass floor of the box has several areas with
crusty, brown grime that is firmly adhered to the surface. This material cannot be sanitized and could harbor
microbes that could cause illness in the animals. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to
prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris. The licensee removed this box from the enclosure between the first
and second day of the inspection upon recommendation of the inspector.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
The food being fed in the guinea pig enclosure has a swarm of flies on it. Flies can transmit disease-causing agents
that can cause illness in the guinea pigs. An effective program for the control of insects shall be established and
maintained.

CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Three rabbits are housed in an indoor enclosure that also houses several tropical birds of varying sizes. Housing
rabbits with other species of animals can stress the rabbits and increase the chance of injury to the rabbits. Rabbits
shall not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals.

3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
A prairie dog enclosure has a 3 inch by 4 inch hole chewed in the wooden wall near ground level. This hole opens
outside the enclosure to the large common room of a barn. One of the prairie dogs is found loose in this large
common room at the time of inspection. Outside of its enclosure, the animal is at increased risk of injury. The
licensee returned the animal to its enclosure and placed a wooden plank over the hole at the time of inspection.
Between the first and second day of inspection, the prairie dog enclosure was rebuilt using glass walls that the
animals cannot chew through.
There is a 4 foot section of wire cross fencing where the wire mesh at ground level is bent upwards leaving a gap.
This fencing is part of an outdoor enclosure that houses pigs, goats, and sheep. Several piglets were witnessed to
be escaping the enclosure through this gap. Escaping the enclosure increases the risk of injury to these animals.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

FEEDING.
There is fruit and vegetable produce placed on the ground for feeding in an outdoor enclosure that houses
patagonian cavies along with swine, poultry, water fowl, and a tortoise. Some of the produce is rotten as evidenced
by brown discoloration, softness and loss of form, and putrid odor. There is a swarm of flies on the produce. There
are bird droppings on the produce. This food is contaminated and unwholesome. It could cause illness and
malnutrition to the animals. The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient
quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.

WATERING.
The 300 gallon watering tanks in the paddock by the barn have green algae growing on the inner walls and floating
on the surface of the water. These watering tanks are used as a source of drinking water for sheep, goats, and pigs.
Blue-green algae can produce toxins which can cause illness to the animals in this enclosure.
In an outdoor enclosure housing patagonian cavies, multiple water bowls have cloudy water with white substance
that appears to be bird excretions in the water. The inner surfaces of the water bowls have brown slime
accumulations. The water in these bowls is contaminated and could case illness in the animals. All water
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
CORRECT BY: July 27, 20183.131(d)
SANITATION.
There are multiple field mice in the prairie dog enclosure. The mice were seen feeding on the prairie dogs' food.
Mice can transmit diseases to the prairie dogs. A safe and effective program for the control of mammalian pests
shall be established and maintained.
