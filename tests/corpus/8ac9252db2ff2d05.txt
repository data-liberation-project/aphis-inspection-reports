3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(1) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: There were 38 breeder guinea pigs housed in 6
excessively dirty enclosures. More fecal material was visible than bedding material. Animals standing in fecal
material are potentially exposed to bacteria and parasites. During the inspection the excessive fecal material was
removed from the enclosures. The licensee must ensure that animal enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta.
Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(3)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(3) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: There were 10 previously used guinea pig
enclosures with new bedding and hay to be used to house about 100 guinea pigs arriving at the end of the week.
There was a heavy build up of a white to brown roughened scale and debris in the corners and around the bottom of
the enclosures. Feces and old bedding were observed on the enclosure rack. Housing guinea pigs in dirty
previously used enclosures exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal and viral
diseases. The licensee must ensure that enclosures will be clean and sanitized prior to the introduction of guinea
pigs into empty primary enclosures previously occupied.
Correct from this day forward.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: There were accumulations of moist dirt and debris by the automatic water valves for
2 racks of enclosures housing 85 guinea pigs in 9 enclosures. The moist dirt and debris may harbor disease
hazards such as bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The licensee must ensure that the animal racks/water valves are
kept clean to ensure the health of the guinea pigs.
Correct from this day forward.
