2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has three Coatimundi located in one primary enclosure. One of the three animals is currently under
veterinary treatment for a skin condition. During inspection, a second Coatimundi was observed to have three
approximately half dollar sized areas of hair loss and skin irritation on the left chest and possibly another
approximately quarter-sized area of hair loss on the left chest and rump. The facility has not communicated the hair
loss issue noted on the second Coatimundi to the attending veterinarian and no veterinary care has been initiated.
Medical conditions affecting the skin negatively affect the physical health and comfort of the animal and may
progress to further serious health issues. Communicate the hair loss issue occurring on the second Coatimundi to
the attending veterinarian. Provide adequate veterinary care by having the attending veterinarian assess the
animal's condition, make a diagnosis and prescribe treatment. Maintain and make available upon request during
subsequent inspections the documentation of veterinary examinations, diagnosis, treatment prescribed and
administered for the Coatimundi. Correct by: 18 August 2017

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fence.
The primary enclosures for a wolf pup and a juvenile black buck are located behind the main exhibit campus and
outside the perimeter fence. Lack of a perimeter fence will not keep people from accessing the animals' primary
enclosure or act as a secondary containment for the animals in the event of an escape. Establish a perimeter fence
around the primary enclosures for the wolf pup and black buck. Correct by: 21 August 2017
