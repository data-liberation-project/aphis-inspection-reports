3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Areas of wire points and loose wire fencing were seen in the fallow deer and calf's enclosure. Also, parts of a panel were
broken and protruding into the elk enclosure. Loose wires and wire points in animal areas could cause injury to animals.
Ensure that the enclosures are maintained structurally sound and in good repair to protect animals from injury.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
