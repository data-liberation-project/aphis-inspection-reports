2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A tan eight year old Chihuahua, "Hazel", had been to the veterinarian on 26 September, 2019 and a dental cleaning
had been recommended by the veterinarian for the reddened gums and brown buildup on the teeth (both incisors
and back teeth). The older tan Chihuahua "Piper" also had a dental cleaning recommended by the veterinarian for
brown buildup on the back teeth and inflamed, red gums. Both dogs had dental cleanings performed in 2017.
During this inspection, both dogs were observed to have a large accumulation of yellow to dark tan/brown to black
build up covering many of the teeth, with what appeared to be significant periodontal disease. The build up
appeared heavier on both sides of the back teeth. The dog's gums were reddened and had receded along some of
the teeth as well.
The veterinarian has previously recommended to the licensee that dental cleanings for both dogs be performed as
soon as possible. At the time of inspection, there were no arrangements for dental cleaning, approximately two
months after the Hazel's last veterinary examination. The dogs were currently not receiving any treatment. The lack
of treatment for these dog's dental conditions can increase the risk that the condition will continue or worsen. The
abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition
could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the
animal. The licensee must ensure that the veterinarian's treatment recommendations for both dog's dental condition
are followed for the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care
at all times.
