ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A black brindle female French bulldog named Bessie (microchip #0A01704470) had an approximately 2-3 inch
diameter gaping wound on the underside of her neck. The skin appeared torn and pink tissue was visible
underneath. There was a creamy white material oozing from the wound and dried yellow crust on the fur. The dog
was alert but quiet and appeared thin. The licensee stated that she was not aware of the injury but upon discovery,
the licensee immediately called the vet to schedule a same-day appointment. The vet later stated that it appeared to
be a ruptured abscess. Injuries and infections are painful and can quickly progress to life-threatening conditions. All
dogs must be observed daily for conditions affecting their health and welfare so that they can receive appropriate
and timely treatment.
To be corrected immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
