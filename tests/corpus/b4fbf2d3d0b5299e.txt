ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The tiger known as Mohan has a skin lesion on his left side. The hair was missing and the skin underneath
appeared raw and irritated. This area was about 6" x 6". If left untreated this lesion could continue to spread and
could become infected and quite painful. The attending veterinarian should be consulted regarding the condition of
this tiger. Documentation of the veterinarian's treatment recommendations and a treatment record must be
maintained and available for review by APHIS officials. This should be done by the end of the day 6-5-15.
2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The tiger known as Mohan has a skin lesion on his left side. The hair was missing and the skin underneath
appeared raw and irritated. This area was about 6" x 6". If left untreated this lesion could continue to spread and
could become infected and quite painful. No one at the facility had noticed this lesion. The lesion appeared to be
several days old. Failure to observe health issues and promptly treat and/or report them to the attending
veterinarian will lead to unnecessary suffering and in extreme cases even possible animal death. Thorough daily
observations of all animals should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra scrutiny. Report all
health issues promptly to the veterinarian.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
A training for facility employees has still not been conducted. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of
properly trained employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering.
Workers need to be trained in the basic needs of the animals at the facility. Observation of animals for abnormal
conditions and behaviors should be one of the topics covered. This training should be done in conjunction with the
attending veterinarian or his designee. A list of topics covered and attendees must be documented for review by
APHIS.
