HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sharp points
****
In 3 enclosures, housing 6 dogs, the woven wire panels have been chewed and pulled upon creating several areas
of sharp points. These sharp points were at the dogs level and could cause injury to the dogs. The licensee must
repair or replace these areas and ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp point and edges at all times to protect
the animals from injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
****
There is an accumulation of unused items stored around the housing facility such as wood, drainpipes, pvc pipes
and other materials. Some of this unused material was stored on top of the outside section of a sheltered facility
and some was stored on the north side of the sheltered facility "Bulldog building". This accumulation of unused
items can create a living and breeding area for rodents which could transmit diseases and pests to the dogs. In front
of a sheltered facility "Bulldog building" there is an accumulation of dog food and carpet remnants next to a hole,
large enough for rodents, that according the licensee stated "Must have been swept out of the facility". This
accumulation of food waste could be an attractant for rodents. A deceased rat was found in a grassy area in
between the sheltered facility "Bulldog building" and the outdoor enclosure.
There are areas were the weeds have grown around an animal facility and an outdoor enclosure. These weeds
could become a living and breeding area for pests and rodents.
The licensee must remove the accumulation of unused items from around the affected animal areas and address
the weeds around the facility. The licensee must ensure that premises where housing facilities are located,
including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from
injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living
areas for rodents and other pests and vermin. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste
products, and discarded matter. Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of thepremises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
