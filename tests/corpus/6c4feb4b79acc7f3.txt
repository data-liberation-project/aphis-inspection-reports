ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 pm CST
on 15-FEB-18.
Arrived at kennel to find the gate locked. I called the contact numbers and was told that licensee was out of country
and to contact the kennel manager. I called and left a message with the kennel manager. No one called back while
I waited for 30 minutes. I called back the kennel manager before leaving the facility at 2:05 p.m. and this time she
answered and said that she would not be back at the kennel until 5:30 p.m. as she was out of town. I discussed her
availability for inspection while the licensee is out of the country. No prior attempt was made to inform me of
changes in optimal hours for inspection.
