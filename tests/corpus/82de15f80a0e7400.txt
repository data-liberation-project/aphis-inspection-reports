FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a strong ammonia odor at one end of the rabbit room. This was also a problem noted on the inspection
dated 8/20/14. The odor was strong enough to cause my eyes and nose to burn and can be expected to cause
simillar discomfort to the the rabbits.An overhead exhaust fan at one end of the room is not working this date.
Facility employee stated that the fan is scheduled to be repaired but may take at least 2 more weeks. Additional
ventilation methods and more frequent cage cleaning must be used to reduce ammonia levels. Adequate ventilation
must be provided at all times to provide for the health and comfort of the animals.CORRECT BY : 11-2-15

maintained so they are impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.
