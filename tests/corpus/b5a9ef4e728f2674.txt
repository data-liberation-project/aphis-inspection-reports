3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Shelter box in Merlin's enclosure is heavily stained with urine. Materials used in construction include particle board,
which may be unsuitable as it is not impervious to moisture, and is difficult to seal to allow for cleaning as required.
The surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the
facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
