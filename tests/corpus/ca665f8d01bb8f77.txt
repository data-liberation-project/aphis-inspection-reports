2.1(a)

Requirements and application
Regulated animal activities are being performed without a valid license from the USDA. The licensee's place of business
changed and Animal Care was not notified 90 days in advance of the relocation. Licenses are not transferrable from one
location to another, therefore, the license is currently invalid. Regulated activity has continued at the new location without
a valid license. All regulated animal activity must have the appropriate license or registration from USDA APHIS Animal
Care. Correct by 7 April 2022 by applying for and receiving the appropriate license type before continuing regulated
activity.
2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
There was a major change in business location (moving from one site to another) and APHIS Animal Care was not
notified of the change 90 days prior to the move. It is imperative that Animal Care has accurate records regarding where
regulated activities are being performed and animals are being housed in order to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. Correct
by 7 April 2022 by applying through animal care for a new license that accurately represents the business location.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
