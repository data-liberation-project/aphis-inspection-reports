ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One enclosure adjacent to the exit gate currently houses 7 goats, 1 dog and 1 alpaca. Evaluation of the goats
showed at least three that require hoof care and veterinary treatment. One predominantly grey black goat has an
elongated, thickened claw on its left rear hoof. This goat spent most of its time lying down and when it did stand and
walk, it was noted that the affected hoof was placed on the ground in an abnormal position to avoid pressure on the
long claw. In addition, it was noted spending excessive time licking at its hooves. One predominantly white goat was
noted with a long, curved claw on its right rear hoof. The long claw curved upwards toward the sky when the goat
was standing. One white and brown goat was noted lying down most of the time and the left front foot appeared
swollen/enlarged over the top surface just above and between the claws. The interdigital area and area just above
the claws was filled with a black crusty material. The skin of this area appeared involved as well. Trimming of
hooves must be done as often as necessary to prevent abnormal growth, discomfort, lameness and infection.
Abnormalities such as swelling, discharge and lameness require the animal to be evaluated by a veterinarian for
diagnosis and treatment. These three goats shall be evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment and all
goats shall be supplied with routine preventative hoof care.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the last inspection, one zebra and one baby goat died. The disposition records do not list or otherwise notate
the death of these two animals. Complete acquisition and disposition records are necessary to allow the facility and
regulatory agencies to keep abreast of animal numbers and species present to ensure adequate care of all animals
present. The licensee shall make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose all required
information concerning all animals purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his possession or
which are transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of. Correct by 3/17/14.
3.9(b) DIRECT
FEEDING.The cat enclosure currently houses two savannah cats. Two food bowls were noted in the enclosure. One food bowl
was empty of food but was crusted with pieces of dried canned food. A second large bowl was heaped with dry food
with food spilling over the sides. When the top layer of cat food kibble was pushed aside there was noted a thick
hard layer of old caked and deteriorated cat food adhered to the bottom of the bowl. There was a white powdery
layer on top of the caked food. Spilled food and food debris was noted around the food bowls. Food receptacles
must be clean and located so as to minimize contamination to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration or
caking of the feed which may lead to poor nutrition, poor appetite or infection in the cats. All cat food receptacles
shall be kept clean and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by 2/28/14.
3.77(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The newly remodeled ringtail lemur enclosure has a sheltered, heated portion that currently has no natural or
artificial light source other than the red heat bulb inside the nest box and the red glow of a heater. There are no
windows, doors, skylights or artificial lights to provide uniformly diffused light. A regular diurnal lighting cycle is
necessary to provide sufficient illumination to aid in housekeeping, inspection of the animals and for the
well-being/normal circadian rhythm of the lemurs. The sheltered part of the lemur facility must be provided with a
regular diurnal lighting cycle of uniformly diffused natural or artificial light. Correct by 3/17/14.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*A large hole about 15 inches high at the center and 36 inches across was noted formed under the fence at the far
end of the mouflon enclosure (near pond) due to erosion of the ground/dirt. Apparently this occurred recently due to
excess water from rain and snowmelt. The enclosure houses two newly born mouflon. Such a large opening may
allow the animals to escape or allow unwanted predator animals to enter which may lead to injury or death of the
animals housed in the enclosure. This hole was closed off during the inspection.
*The main fence of the facility that runs along the main road has several sections where the fence is leaning and
unstable due to erosion and weak or loose posts. The portion previously cited for sagging has had strands of
barbed wire added and is now 63inches tall. However the post used to secure this sagging portion is set into a crack
in the soil and has not been anchored. It moves back and forth in all directions. Weak, leaning fences are not of
sufficient strength to keep animals, especially larger stronger hoofstock such as water buffalo and zebra, from
escaping and may allow unwanted animals entrance.
*The fainting goat enclosure consists of cattle panel type fencing material with a secondary thin flexible wire mesh
panel attached to the outside on the lower approximately 18 in. of the enclosure. One goat was noted putting its
head through the cattle panel material. The horns could get caught in the flexible wire material leading to the goat
getting its head caught and possible injury. The facility fencing must be constructed of such material and of such strength as to be structurally sound for the
animals housed and shall be maintained in good repair.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were numerous round bales of hay stacked outside on the wet ground adjacent to the pond and outside next
to the gift shop barn. A tarp covers a portion of the top row of a few of the bales next to the barn. The ground the
bales are set upon is muddy with areas of standing water which in some cases has a greenish algae film. Multiple
bales appear wet with discolored grey/black portions. The bales of hay have no protection from the weather. Poor
hay storage can cause deterioration and/ or contamination of the hay which could result in nutritional deficiencies or
disease spread in animals fed this hay. Hay must be stored in such a manner to prevent deterioration, molding, or
contamination. Correct by 3/17/14.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One enclosure houses two nilgai. Both nilgai were noted to have the lower half of their legs covered with dry and
fresh mud. The entire front of the enclosure has a four to twelve foot wide pit of mud along its entire front fence
length. The female nilgai attempted to meet us at the enclosure fence, paced along the enclosure fence and sunk
several inches deep into the mud with each step. The nilgai had to exert extra effort to get out of the area and was
noted slipping and sliding. The feed trough is situated such that the nilgai have to go through the mud to get to their
food. Wet enclosures can lead to discomfort to the animals, injury due to slippery footing and health
problems/diseases of the feet and legs. The enclosure shall be provided with a method to provide rapid elimination
of excess water or the animals should be moved to drier enclosures.
3.132(d) REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
Due to personnel health issues, the animals are currently being cared for by one part time caretaker with the
assistance of a volunteer. In addition a relative and a couple of volunteers were noted working on an enclosure
during the inspection. The caretaker and volunteers are currently not working under a supervisor and are unfamiliar
with the Animal Welfare Act regulations /standards and professional husbandry standards for the animals at the
facility. The caretaker is responsible for feeding and watering but the facility lacks an animal husbandry/curator type
person with training and a background in the standards of care for the animals housed at the facility. This issubstantiated by similar issues recurring. Several repeat citations are documented on this inspection report. Also,
goats with untreated hoof issues were identified during this inspection even though a veterinarian had been called
out earlier in the month to care for two other goats on the premises with hoof problems. Lack of an adequate
number of trained employees working under a knowledgeable supervisor can lead to inadequate care of the
animals. The facility shall maintain a sufficient number of trained employees working under a knowledgeable
supervisor to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices.
