2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- A nine year old black, male Shih Tzu named Calvin (ID# TR 67688805) had several abrasions/lesions covering
one or more of his legs, most noticeably his right rear leg. He also had a severe ear infection. His right ear was
severely swollen, reddened and had puss/discharge inside the canal of the ear. The infection could be caused by
parasites, yeast, or bacteria. Ear infections can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to health problems for
that dog. If left untreated ear infections could lead to continued health issues, tissue damage or inflammation of the
ear canal. He also had a moist dermatitis on his head with bruising. The lesion area was approximately an inch in
diameter, was circular in shape, reddened with dark spots, moist looking and was hairless. The licensee stated that
she hadn't noticed the problems with this dog and thought the injuries might have been caused from a fight. The
licensee immediately contacted the attending veterinarian and began treating the ear and cleaning the dog. The
licensee must have this dog evaluated and examined by the attending veterinarian and the appropriate treatment
must be administered and documented. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care to all animals at all
times.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- There was a heavy accumulation of feces in the outdoor portions of multiple enclosures containing approximately
twenty dogs. Some of the fecal material appeared fresh, but much of it was dry and white in color. The licensee
stated that the part time employee had starting cleaning the day before and then had an emergency and had to
leave so the cleaning was left unfinished. The feces had been scraped into large piles toward the ends of the
enclosures. The excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent an excessive accumulation so
as not to soil the dogs contained therein and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.To be corrected by: 3/2/2016.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with Brittany Light, ACI, Michael Tygart, VMO and the facility
representative.
