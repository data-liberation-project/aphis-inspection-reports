3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
While enrichment is provided for the ring-tailed lemurs housed at the facility, there is no written plan of
environmental enrichment.
Lack of an approved environmental enrichment plan does not ensure that the psychological needs of the
non-human primates are being adequately met.
An environmental enrichment plan must be developed. The plan must adddress manners to provide environmental
enrichment (toys, swings, etc) and social housing. The plan must also be approved and signed by the facilities
attending veterinarian.
