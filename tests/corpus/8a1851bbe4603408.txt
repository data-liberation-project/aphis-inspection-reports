ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two rabbits with areas of hair loss. One of the rabbits (gray) has the majority of its hair loss on the right
rear outer leg, which is almost completely bald. The other rabbit (brown) has "patchy" hair loss on the left shoulder,
side, and hip. While rabbits can pull their hair to use as a nest liner as suspected by the facility representative, hair
loss can also result from medical problems such as parasites, infection, and nutritional deficiencies. The licensee
must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian by 18 March 2015 in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The floor of one of the two shelter structures provided in the outdoor rabbit enclosure is completely covered with a
layer of excreta and dirt. Lack of cleaning along with accumulation of excreta can play a role in disease
transmission. In addition, accumulation of feces can cause the animals to become soiled. The licensee must keep
all enclosures reasonably free of excreta with periodic cleaning. To be corrected by 13 March 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative, Kendall Lundy, ACI and Margaret
A Shaver, VMO in attendance.
