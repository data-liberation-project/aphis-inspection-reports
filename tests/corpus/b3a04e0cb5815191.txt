2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An approximately 50 pound cougar was exhibited to the public on a small platform located on a stage. There were
no barriers between the general viewing public and the cougar. The cougar was about 15 feet from the public. It
was restrained by two leads attached to two separate collars on its neck. The leads were around the wrists of the
two handlers. During the exhibition the cougar noticed the video image of itself projected on the screen behind it.
The cougar became extremely agitated and leaped off the platform in the direction of the general public. The
cougar was restrained by the leads but continued to be very agitated. The handlers pulled it and it was slid a few
feet back from the edge of the stage. The handlers continued to pull, push and slide the cougar off the stage as it
attempted to strike the handlers. This appeared to be a very stressful for the cougar. This cougar is too large, fast
and unpredictable to be exhibited to the public in this manner. No more exhibitions should be done without
sufficient public barriers and adequate control of this animal. This animal can no longer be safely controlled by the
lead system being used.
