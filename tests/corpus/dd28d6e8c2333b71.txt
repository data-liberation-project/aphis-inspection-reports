FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Peeling paint is present on the walls in both rooms that house guinea pigs. The paint is peeling along the walls just
above the fiberglass reinforced panels. These damaged surfaces are difficult to clean and sanitize. The interior
surfaces of indoor housing facilities must be maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture and
readily sanitized to protect the health and welfare of the animals.
