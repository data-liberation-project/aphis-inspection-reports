FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility does have a perimeter fence completely around it with two gates, one in the front for the driveway and a
back gate that leads to another individual(cid:25)s house. Sometime between approximately 9:30 p.m. on May 5, 2015 and
9:30 a.m. on May 6, 2015 an unauthorized person(s) was able to breach the perimeter fence and take a baby red
kangaroo and four Nigerian Pigmy goats. The licensee stated that the front gate was open and that the back gate
was closed, but did not have a lock on it. Perimeter fences which are not properly constructed or gates left open
and/or unlocked does not protect the animals from coming in contact with unauthorized persons and animals. The
integrity of the perimeter fence must be maintained to prevent unauthorized persons and animals from entering the
facility and function as a secondary containment system for animals at the facility.
