Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
During the 2021 calendar year, the facility purchased more than $500.00 dollars worth of rabbits from an unlicensed
source who was required to be licensed. Licensure under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) is important for animal welfare
and well-being, because license holders are subject to oversight and inspections to ensure compliance with AWA
regulations and standards. Ensure animals are purchased from licensed sources when required.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility's documented program of veterinary care for dogs (PVC) doesn't address vaccinations against rabies and
frequency of rabies vaccination. Additionally, the PVC doesn't address testing/treatment frequencies for blood parasites
such as heartworm. Vaccination against rabies and testing/treatment for blood parasites are an important part of of the
PVC as they provide immunity and protection for the puppies. Ensure provisions for rabies vaccination and frequency of
vaccinations, and testing/treatment for blood parasites are addressed in the PVC.
