FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were 127 chinchillas housed on 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring. The large holes do not provide an
acceptable flooring surface for the chinchillas. The wire spacing can increase the risk of injury to chinchillas' legs
and/or feet as the holes are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas. Enclosures must protect the animals from
injury. The chinchillas must be provided flooring surfaces that do not have gaps large enough for their feet to pass
through.
This was a focused inspection on the direct noncompliances cited on the previous inspection only.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the licensee.
