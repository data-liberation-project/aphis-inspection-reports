rooms . The first event involved a thermostat malfunction resulting in the overheating of a room and the death of 2
animals. Necropsy reports indicate the deaths were due to hyperthermia. Corrective measures were taken an
override switches were placed in all animal rooms . Approximately one month later, there was another event
involving the HVAC system in another room in a different building . An improperly wired thermostat override switch
caused a room to overheat resulting in the deaths of 11 animals. Necropsy reports indicate all died from
hyperthermia.. The ambient temperature in the facility must not fall below 45 F for more than 4 consecutive hours
nor rise above 85 F for more than 4 consecutive hours when non human primates are present. Corrective

install temperature alarms in all animal housing rooms.
