3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Currently, there are trees that are too close to the fence that could still provide an opportunity for an animal to
escape. The enclosures with trees that are too close to the fences are #11(according to the licensee this will be
temporary, as the tiger will be moved to a different enclosure and this enclosure will remain empty), #15, #17, #18
and #19a. It should be noted that a 4ft panel was added to increase the height of this enclosure to 16ft, however the
trees near the fence were still too close and touching or leaning against the top of the fence.
The facility needs to remove any trees that are too close to the primary enclosure fences. If the trees are not going
to be removed, an adequate kick-in over the top of the tree and/or around it that prevents the animals from climbing
the tree to escape must be added or another method must be devised by the facility to effectively prevent the
animals from using these trees for the purpose of escape. Taking these preventative measures and maintaining the
enclosure fence according to AWA regulations and standards should decrease the risk of escape by the regulated
animals that can climb and decrease the potential for safety risks to the animal and general public.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee and Dr. Susan Kingston, VMO. The licensee refused to sign
the inspection report upon advice of their lawyers. The report was left with the licensee and a copy was sent via
certified mail.
