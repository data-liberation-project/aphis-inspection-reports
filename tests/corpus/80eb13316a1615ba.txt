2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 on
13-Apr-17.Attempts to contact the licensee included knocking on the doors of the house and leaving a voicemail on
the listed phone number. No response was received for a period of 30 minutes after the initial attempt to contact.
Lack of availability makes the regulatory process impossible. The licensee must ensure a knowledgeable facility
representative is available to accompany inspection during normal business hours. Correct from this time forward.
