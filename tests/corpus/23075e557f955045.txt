CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An enclosure housing a single snow macaque had an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, and waste. This
accumulation was primarily on the animal's food bowl, and on the ledge next to the food bowl. There were
numerous small insects in and around the food bowl. Accumulation of waste and debris is an attractant for insects
and pests, and may cause contamination to the enclosed animal. This enclosure must be thoroughly cleaned. All
primate primary enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent excessive waste buildup.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures housing, respectively, a single adult lion and a single adult tiger are open topped cages, with fence
heights approximately 10 feet. There are short kick-ins on both fences. Cage fences of this height may not be
sufficient to adequately contain adult lions or tigers. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing adult big
cats are constructed and maintained to adequately contain the animals.
