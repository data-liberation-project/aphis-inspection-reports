3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
None of the outdoor shelters contained enough bedding. There was a small amount of shavings in most of the
shelters, but not enough to even cover all of the floor in some of the shelters. The ambient temperature at the time
of the inspection was 41 degrees F, but had gotten down to 33 degrees F the night before. The licensees stated
that they had not added any bedding to the shelters since the previous spring. Inadequate bedding can result in
dogs becoming too cold, which can adversely affect the health of the animals. The licensee must ensure that all
dogs are provided with clean, dry bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F and additional
clean, dry bedding when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower.
This item must be corrected by November 28, 2018.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Three adult German shepherd dogs had inadequate shelter. Two of the dogs were in an enclosure with one shelter
structure that was of inadequate size for both dogs. The other dog had a shelter structure that was too small for the
dog. Inadequate shelter doesn't provide enough protection from the wind and cold, which can affect the health of
the dogs. The licensee must provide shelter structures that allow each dog enough space to sit, stand, and lie in a
normal manner and to turn about freely.
