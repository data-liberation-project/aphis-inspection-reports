Primary enclosures.
The primary enclosure of a male Cynomolgus macaque with tattoo #B13609 did not protect the animal from injury. On
April 20th, 2022, as an animal technician was attempting to squeeze the animal using the standard squeeze mechanism
built in the nonhuman primates modified enclosure, the animal climbed over the squeeze panel through a gap that is
present at the top of the cage and got stuck. While attempting to free itself the animal became unconscious. At that
moment the animal care staff removed the animal from the enclosure and provided medical attention immediately;
ultimately the animal was determined to be deceased. All other animals housed in the same primary enclosures were
transferred to different type of enclosures. To ensure other nonhuman primates do not get injured, the nonhuman
primates must be housed in appropriate cages for the type of study to which they are assigned.
Corrected at time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
