SANITATION.
The two housing facilities for the four coatimudis contain cat trees/condo furnishings covered in carpet. The furniture
is contaminated with urine and feces and can not be readily cleaned because of the carpet substrate. One of the
furnishings in the female coati enclosure has a large hole in the carpeted surface.
Premises, enclosures and furnishings must be kept clean and in good repair to reduce potential for disease
transmission and protect the animals from injury. Ingested pieces of carpet could cause injury to the animals and
gastrointestinal compromise. The choice of carpet as a substrate for cage furnishings should be reviewed.
