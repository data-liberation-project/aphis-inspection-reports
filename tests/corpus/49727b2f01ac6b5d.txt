ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Some treatments and medications being used at the facility do not have adeqaute written instructions from the
attending veterinarian to ensure that appropriate methods are being used:
-Extra-label use of oxytetracycline, amprolium, and penicillin are being used that are do not have written instructions
for rabbits.
-A new vaccine is being used for the rabbits that is not formally approved in writing by the attending veterinarian.
-Treatment for eye conditions are not adequately described in the Plan of Veterinary Care.
Extra-label use of medications (use for animals that the manafacturer's label does not have instructions for) must
have a description of the dose, route, and reason for why the medication is being given. This is to prevent animals
from recieving too little or too much of a medication. Treatments and preventive care methods must be adequately
described and guided by the attending veterinarian. Contact the veterinarian to update the Program of Veterinary
Care so that it accurately reflects and guides the treatments and preventive care methods that are being currently
used at the facility.
