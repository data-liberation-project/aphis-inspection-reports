2.131(c)(1) Critical Repeat

Handling of animals.
On 9/28/2021, a guest was bitten by one of the kinkajous which caused a puncture wound on the tip of the finger. The
guest had squeezed their finger under the kinkajou enclosure door. Security footage shows the guest and child down on
the floor attempting this contact without being observed or stopped by employees. On 11/13/2021, a guest was bitten by
Chip, an Asian Small Clawed otter, during an interaction session when the guest attempted to reach down and hand a toy
to the otter rather than drop the toy from higher up as instructed by employee. The otter jumped to grab the toy and bit
the thumb of the guest.

Animals must be exhibited in a manner and with sufficient barriers or distance between animals and the public to assure
the safety of the animal and the public.

Structural reinforcement of the bottom of the kinkajou enclosure door was made prior to the inspection. Staff oversight
of the otter interaction participants and enforcement of interaction rules and staff directions has been increased prior to
the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
