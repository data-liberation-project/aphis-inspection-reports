Item primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats (ventilation) 3.15 c 2
On June 21, 2021 Air Lingus Airlines transported 3 dogs on flight 105 to JFK in NY, on arrival one of the dogs was sick
and the importer tried to get the dog to a veterinarian, but the dog died before they could get to the vet. A necropsy was
not performed. A photo of one of the kennels used for transport shows there is no projecting rim on the front of the
kennel., however the front of the kennel did have openings for ventilation.
Projecting rims are important in order to prevent obstruction of the openings in order to allow the free flow of ventilation.
When transporting animals, the airline must ensure that the kennel is properly constructed and has projecting rims on all
sides of the kennel in order to prevent the obstruction of the openings and allow for the free flow of ventilation between
the primary enclosure and anything that is placed next to it.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
