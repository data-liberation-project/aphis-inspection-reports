RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
During the inspection of the APHIS form 7005’s held by the Licensee at least one Adult Female Boerboel was found
to not have all necessary information on the form. The APHIS Form 7005 lacked the name and address from which
the dog was purchased or otherwise acquired. Having the name and address of the individual from which the dogs
are acquired allows for clear animal traceability as well as for the follow-up of safety, health and welfare concerns.
Correct by ensuring that all required information is maintained on the APHIS 7005 forms and is made available at
the time of inspection.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with Facility Representative and Veterinary Medical Officer, Michael
Neafsey.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “received by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector received the
original inspection report, which occurred on 17 August 2016.
