2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
A litter of five 2-week-old Cockapoo puppies did not have any form of identification on themselves or on their
enclosure.
Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition,
transport,
and healthcare documentation. The licensee must properly identify puppies with an acceptable form of
identification,
which include a cage card (if litters are not comingled), a microchip, a collar and tag, or a plastic-type collar with the
required information legibly written.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
An adult Cocker Spaniel and her five 2-week-old puppies had no bedding in their shelter. They had been housed
indoors until a few days earlier when the licensee moved them outdoors. Also three other adult dogs did not have
any
bedding in their shelters. According to the National Weather Service the temperature in the area had dropped to
38 degreesF the night before. A lack of bedding during cold weather can result in dogs becoming cold, stressed,
and
uncomfortable, which can adversely affect their health. The licensee must ensure that outdoor shelters contain
clean,
dry bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is
required when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower.
The licensee was verbally instructed to add adequate bedding to these shelters before the end of the day.
The licensee had bedding on hand to comply.The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
