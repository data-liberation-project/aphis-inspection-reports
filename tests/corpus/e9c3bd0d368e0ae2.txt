3.6(a)(2)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
During inspection, one dog was observed to be running loose outside the primary enclosure in the outdoor walkway. I
observed another dog escape his enclosure by squeezing through the feeder hole in an outdoor enclosure. Later on I
observed at least 6 dogs running loose outside of their enclosure in the outdoor walkway. When we went outside, the
enclosure door was open. The primary enclosures are meant to keep the dogs safe. When they get out, they may not be
able to get back into their enclosure in which case they may not have access to food or water. All enclosures that dogs
can get out of must be fixed so the dogs cannot escape their enclosures.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 3/12/23 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
