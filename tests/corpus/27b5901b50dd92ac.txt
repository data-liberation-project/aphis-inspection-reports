2.5(d) REPEAT
DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
- The drive through area of the park is currently open for visitors, but is not an approved site. Site 002 (drive
through site) is not a valid site and must be in complete compliance with all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act prior
to being used for regulated activity.
2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
- At the time of inspection the animal inventory was not up to date (inventory on hand was dated May 20, 2014) and
the licensee was not able to provide an accurate animal inventory. There were no Jacob sheep present on the
inventory and four Jacob sheep were present in the park. Complete and accurate records are necessary to ensure
each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace those animals. The licensee
must maintain complete and accurate records of all animals at all times and must ensure those records are
available to the inspector upon request.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, such as a rhinoceros and a tiger, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals might
negatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle these
animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site can be
approved for regulated activity.
2.131(d)(2) REPEATHANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- At the time of inspection the drive through area of the park had members of the public driving through and feeding
animal feed from paper Pepsi cups that are available for purchase at the gift shop. There were no park employees
present during this public/ animal interaction. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or
attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the Serengeti area, there are many shelters in poor repair. One structure (building 6) has a large approximately
2 foot by 8 foot sheet of plywood in the middle of the area the animals use to get out of the elements. Many
structures (building 6, 15, and 18) have boards lying on the ground by the shelter area. Many of these boards have
long nails pointing up. A lame black draft horse was present in building 6 at the time of the inspection. The roof on
shelter 6 is wavy and the roof on the short shelters next to the Rhinoceros enclosure has metal pulled up which has
sharp edges. These points, nails and sharp metal edges pose risks of injury to any animals using the shelter. All
shelters must be repaired or replaced, and maintained appropriately.
- In the Serengeti area there are multiple holes in the fencing. Some holes are in the perimeter fence and others
are in the fence next to the rhinoceros enclosure area. These openings are a potential source of injury/entrapment
to animals in the park. All areas of the park must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
- There are two large holes/openings on the top surface of a large metal drainage pipe embedded in the road a
short distance before the entrance to the Serengeti. One hole is partially covered by a large flat rock, while the
other opening is completely exposed. These openings are a potential source of injury/entrapment to animals in the
park. All areas of the park must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
- In the area beside the medical barn was an area where there were numerous loose rolls of fence on the ground.
This fence/wire poses a risk of injury to any animal in the area of the park. The fence must be repaired and
maintained in good condition or removed if not necessary.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The old well under the fence in the Rhinoceros enclosure has standing water. The facility representative stated thewell was not used and water was present only when rain occurs. The water was green in color with a thick film of
green material on the surface. The presence of standing water in or near animal enclosures increases exposure to
insects and risk of contamination to the animals. The licensee must provide a suitable sanitary method to prevent or
rapidly remove pools of water from the enclosure. The chosen method shall comply with applicable Federal, State
and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the environment.

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
- At the time of the inspection the daily feeding records from September 2, 2014 to October 1, 2014 for the tiger over
the last month indicate that the only food she had received was 10 pounds of chicken every day. There were no fast
days or supplements administered according to the daily feeding records. The facility representative stated that the
tiger was not doing well the week prior and the AV came out and gave her an injection of a B vitamin and she was
much improved. The facility representative stated that they give the tiger beef once a week however, the records do
not indicate any beef had been given over the last month. Historically, the only food present for the tiger at the time
of inspections has been chicken parts primarily chicken quarters. The licensee was not able to present any written
documentation for the recommend tiger diet from a licensed veterinarian. The food must be of sufficient nutritive
value and quality to maintain the animal in good health. The licensee must follow the AV guidelines on a balanced
diet.

WATERING.
- The enclosure housing the hyena had a single water receptacle. The container had a moderate amount of
greenish colored material concentrated on the sides and bottom of the container. The facility representative stated
that the water bin was cleaned that morning. Brush marks were noted scattered in the greenish material.
- At the time of the inspection there were scattered watering containers in the drive through portion of the park.
Some in the front part just past the cattle guard and some in the Serengeti area. One water container in the front
just past the cattle guard and two in the Serengeti area (one with the zebras and one by the Rhinoceros) had
moderate amount of greenish colored material concentrated on the sides and bottom of the container. Brush marks
were noted scattered in the greenish material. The facility representative stated that the water bin was cleaned thatmorning. Water receptacles must be clean and contain potable water for the health and well-being of the enclosed
animals. More frequent cleaning and sanitizing is needed.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
- At the time of the inspection there were numerous areas throughout the drive through portion of the park that had
construction debris (by the medical barn), metal straps (by medical barn), old thrown horse shoes with nails present
(zebra enclosure), and loose wires present. These objects pose a risk of injury to the animals in these areas of the
park. All debris, metal objects, and wire must be removed and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the
animals.
To be corrected by 20 November 2014.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
- At the time of the inspection numerous wasp nests, several of which were active, were observed in shelters
throughout the Serengeti area. The zebra shelter had four wasp nests of which one was active. Wasps can sting
and cause injury to the enclosed animal. They can also contaminate food, water and living areas. A more effective
method of pest control needs to be established and maintained.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
- At the time of the inspection there were not a sufficient number of trained employees to maintain the professionally
acceptable level of husbandry practices set in the AWA. The facility representative stated they did not have enough
employees at present time and were advertising and working on hiring more employees. Adequate number of
trained employees must be maintained at all times to properly care for the animals present.
