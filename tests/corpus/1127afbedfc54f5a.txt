FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-During the night of Friday, December 9, 2016; Lightning, a male wolf, dug under the primary wolf enclosure fencing
near the seasonal water feature where some erosion had occurred. This allowed Lightning into the hoof stock pen
gaining access to the hoof stock gate, and worked his way into the area between the primary enclosure and the
perimeter fence.
-The primary enclosure shall be constructed and maintained in a way that is structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. An adequate program of regularly
scheduled review and maintenance of the primary enclosure fencing shall be used to identify and quickly repair any
area that poses a risk of non-containment. Steps must be taken to ensure this non-compliant item does not repeat.

3.127(d) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
-During the early morning animal observation on Saturday, December 10, 2016; the lead keeper was unable to
observe the male wolf, Lightning. The emergency policy was put into motion and the manager was called. The call
to the manager occurred around 8:30 am and a more extensive search was conducted. This search revealed that
Lightning had dug the ground underneath and pulled the sweeper flap fencing on a perimeter fence gate and was
outside the facility. The manager quickly responded and arrived on grounds. Extensive tracking located Lightning
approximately two miles from the facility. After reviewing the emergency policy and assessing the situation Lightning
was euthanized.
-The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility and functions as a secondary
containment. A full review of the perimeter fence policies, practices and maintenance must be conducted and
corrected to ensure the function of the perimeter fence protects, and contains all animals in the facility. Correction
must be sufficient so this non-compliant does not repeat.
-Preliminary corrective measures have been implemented.
-To be corrected by: January 10, 2016Exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
