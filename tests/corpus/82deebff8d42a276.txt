ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:36 pm on
11-OCT-17.
I honked the horn several different times and walked up the driveway calling out "Hello." I attempted calling
licensee on government cell phone and my adroid both of which did not have service in this area of AR. I waited 30
minutes until 3:06 pm and left my business card taped to door of the sheltered building with a note.
