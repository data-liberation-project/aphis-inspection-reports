2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Thirty seven rabbits underwent blood collection immediately prior to euthanasia in amounts that exceed what is
allowed by the IACUC approved protocol and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures). A staff member stated that
some rabbits are bled from the ear vein until no more blood can be obtained and that the rabbits are then
euthanized in the carbon dioxide chamber. When bleed records for euthanized rabbits were checked from March
15, 2014 through the day of the inspection (35 days), 37 rabbits had blood collected in excess of what was allowed
by the protocol prior to euthanasia. In most cases, the amount of the final blood collection was approximately double
what was allowed by the protocol.
Twenty eight goats underwent terminal blood collection immediately prior to euthanasia between January 1, 2013
and April 30, 2013. The amounts of blood collected in these terminal procedures exceeded what was allowed by the
IACUC approved protocol and SOP. A staff member stated that the terminal bleeds were approved by
subcommittee on May 30, 2013. However, the IACUC community member position was vacant during May, thus the
facility had no functional IACUC at that time and no outside member had the opportunity to participate in the May
protocol evaluation. The community member position was filled in July and the member was first present at a
meeting in August 2013. Between May and the August meeting an additional 84 goats underwent terminal blood
collection, again exceeding the amounts allowed by the protocol. Additionally, according to the August 2013 IACUC
minutes, the protocol was not reviewed during this meeting. An additional 168 goats were euthanized with terminal
collections between the August 2013 meeting and the next February IACUC meeting, the next protocol review.
Significant changes in the care and use of animals in ongoing activities may adversely affect animal well-being. The
IACUC should review proposed significant changes to activities involving animals prior to the implementation of
those activities.
Previous correction date: Correct immediately.
2.31(e)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).The facility has been carrying out terminal bleeds in rabbits and goats, where the amount of blood that is collected
from the animal, shortly prior to euthanasia, is much greater than the amount normally allowed to be collected
during routine blood collection as described in the protocol.

Proposals to conduct activities involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the
animals. It is especially important that procedures that may involve pain and distress be completely described in the
protocol, or in a standard operating procedure document that is referenced in the protocol. Procedures such as
terminal bleeds involve anesthesia and/or euthanasia, and the IACUC must have a complete description of these
procedures to review and approve in order to ensure that pain and distress are being minimized. Additionally,
personnel carrying out these procedures must have a well-described routine procedure to follow in order to
safeguard the welfare of the animals. All activities involving animals, including terminal bleeds, must be completely
described in the protocol and/or relevant SOP prior to their implementation.
Previous correction date: Correct by May 30, 2012.

FEEDING.
A large bag of alfalfa cubes meant as rabbit food and enrichment was found uncovered in a feed barn. Peacocks
are loose in the barn. Uncovered food may become contaminated by dust or bird droppings and may provide an
environment favorable for vermin. Food should be stored in such a manner that it is kept wholesome, palatable, and
free from contamination. Consuming contaminated food may be detrimental to the health of the animals.

3.56(a)
SANITATION.
Approximately 30 rabbit primary enclosures have an excessive amount of hair build-up. Hair is adhered to the floors
and sides of the enclosures. The hair is thick enough to prevent feces from falling through the wire flooring in many
enclosures and also appears to be stained with urine in some enclosures.
Approximately 50 rabbit primary enclosures have an excessive amount of rust adhered to the sides of the
enclosures under the automatic water spigots or on the identification card holders attached to the enclosures.
Rabbit enclosures should be kept reasonably clean and free of hair and debris such as rust. Failure to keep thecages clean could increase animal exposure to disease causing agents and be detrimental to their health.

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Hay used to feed the goats at the facility is being stored directly on the ground and uncovered, or partially covered
by tarps. The sides of several stored bales are noticeably darkened and discolored. A staff member stated that
while the hay appears to be bad on the edges, the center of the bales are not bad and are fed to the goats while the
edges are fed to the unregulated cattle.
Hay that is stored so that it is exposed to the elements may become contaminated and may lose nutritive value. Hay
should be stored in such a manner that it remains wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of
sufficient nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health.

An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
