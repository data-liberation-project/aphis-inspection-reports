2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Four semi-annual program and facility evaluation review reports since November 2020 (dated November 2020, May 2021,
November 2021, and May 2022) did not contain a description of the nature and extent of the facility's adherence to the
Animal Welfare Act and Regulations nor did it contain the signatures of a majority of the IACUC members (only two of five
signed).
• The semi-annual evaluation report functions as method for the IACUC to notify the Institutional Official (IO) of the status
of the animal care and use program at the facility. A majority of the IACUC members must evaluate the facility inspection
and the program of humane care and use review conducted by subcommittees and finalize the report with any minority
opinions included to the IO. This gives the IO a complete update of the facility and program at the institution.
• The facility shall ensure that the IACUC completes an evaluation report to the Institutional Official upon completion of the
required semi-annual evaluations. The report must be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC, describe the
nature and extent of the research facility's adherence to the Animal Welfare Act Standards and Regulations, identify any
departures from the provisions, and any minority views.
MUST BE CORRECTED BY: NOVEMBER 1, 2022
