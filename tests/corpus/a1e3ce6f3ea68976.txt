3.26(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig room. There were no vents, doors, or windows
observed to be open to allow proper ventilation of the room.
Failure to provide fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
Remains uncorrected.
3.29(d) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The self-feeders attached to the inside of the guinea pig enclosures contained fecal material material mixed in with
the feed. The fecal material appeared dry and not fresh and there was little to no pelleted feed available in the
feeding trough of some feeders.
Failure to clean feeders often enough to prevent contamination with fecal material can result in avoidance of food or
spread of disease.
Food receptacles must be located to minimize contamination by excreta and must be kept clean.
Correct from this day forward
3.30
WATERING.
The PVC piping used as drip pans for the water bottles contained an accumulation of fecal material, debris, and
bedding and was in need of more frequent cleaning.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.
