2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A protocol was identified on inspection that was listed under a study director who had left the company several
months prior to the inspection. At this facility, the title of study director denotes that an individual serves as the
single point of control for the protocol and is responsible for the implementation of research involving animals under
that protocol. Another study director was assigned to the protocol, but this change was not reviewed or approved by
the IACUC.
Because of the level of responsibility held by the study director in directing the care and use of animals under the
protocol, a change in study director constitutes a significant change in ongoing activities. This individual is
responsible for assuring that the care and use of the animals conforms to the Animal Welfare Act.
The IACUC shall review and approve all proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in
ongoing activities. Amendments for this significant change in personnel must be approved by the IACUC for all
affected protocols.
To be corrected by April 24th, 2018.
Additional Inspectors
Karr Eilis, Veterinary Medical Officer
