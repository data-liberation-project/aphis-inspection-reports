ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** The facility’s geriatric Asiatic black bear, “Dillon”, was observed to have severe dental issues that were seen as
the animal was eating. The bear is missing several teeth and has a broken left lower canine tooth that has black
discoloration in the center of the remnant of the tooth. There is a moist yellow discoloration on the lower left jaw
consistent with the appearance of a draining tooth abscess. The right lower canine tooth appears to be sheared so
that the pulp cavity is exposed and is visible below the natural gum line. The gum line is recessed, and the tooth
remnant has a black discoloration. There are no visible upper canine teeth. The severity and chronic nature of these
dental issues are likely to have caused the bear a significant amount of pain over a long period of time and the
condition of the teeth has continued to deteriorate since first documented in 2017.
Discussions with the facility representative revealed that they are aware of the dental issues with the bear but the
Attending Veterinarian (AV) has not been comfortable sedating the bear for further examination and potential
treatment.
Additionally, the bear is morbidly obese, with limited mobility and exhibits a repetitive behavior in which he sits on
his haunches and repeatedly rocks himself back and forth by using his forepaws to push against the wall in front of
him, and will rock back against a large stone behind him in his enclosure. The caretaker confirmed this is a
behavior that is observed frequently. Repetitive abnormal behavior of this nature, can often be an indicator of pain
and or psychological distress. This repetitive behavior was first documented in 2017 and has been viewed on
subsequent inspections and no methods of assessing, addressing or minimizing the underlying causes for this
behavior have been put into action.
The facility’s geriatric bobcat is similarly obese and the caretaker stated that the animal no longer utilizes climbing
structures within the enclosure. The AV hasn’t evaluated the bobcat for weight gain, changes in behavior and
decline in mobility or activity.
Both the bear and the bobcat are declawed and housed in enclosures that consist of only concrete as the ground
surface with the exception of dens that have straw bedding and two rubber mats placed in the bobcat’s enclosure.
The combination of old age, obesity, and being declawed, likely contribute to impacts on mobility due to arthritis orjoint pain. There have been no plans to pursue any diagnostics or treatment to diagnose or alleviate any discomfort
the animals might be experiencing.
Facilities are required to establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Failures to address the old age
related problems, obesity, and lack of mobility of these animals, and the dental disease of the bear are having a
negative impact on the health and welfare of these animals.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a section of chain link in the bobcat enclosure that has been cut above the pvc water trough. There are
pieces of chain link protruding into the left side of the enclosure. These sharp ends have the potential to cause
injury. These areas of cut chain link need to be addressed to keep the enclosure in good repair and for the safety of
the animal.
