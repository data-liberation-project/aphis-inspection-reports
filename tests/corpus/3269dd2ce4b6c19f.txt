3.84(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The three Emperor Tamarins have an enclosure that is currently being sanitized on a rotational schedule to account for
scent marking. However, the facility is currently only sanitizing half of the enclosure every 2 weeks, leaving all items
cleaned and sanitized on a monthly basis. Although the attending veterinarian has approved these methods, the
commonly accepted USDA standards for non-human primates is every 2 weeks. Ensuring the appropriate sanitization
frequency of all surfaces is important for maintain animal health and preventing disease transmission. All indoor primary
enclosures housing non-human primates must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as often as necessary to
prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, food waste and excreta.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class "C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the

must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
