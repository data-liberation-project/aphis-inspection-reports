3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Two outdoor areas for dams with litters had a build up of feces. Daily spot cleaning hasn't been done for these two
outside areas although the indoor area was clean for all dogs. Surfaces that dogs contact need to be spot-cleaned daily
to prevent build-up of soiled areas and to reduce disease risk. Ensure that all areas that dogs contact are spot-cleaned
daily to prevent any build up of soiled material.
