injuries.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The area around the kennel and outside runs has a significant amount of weed and grass growth that needs to
be trimmed back and controlled. There was also accumulations of discarded matter in the bushes and next to the
kennel. This overgrown environment creates an area for pests to live and breed. This area needs to be addressed
to keep the area clean and in good repair.

have not been used for multiple weeks but there is still sawdust and excess food on the floor underneath the
enclosures. This excess food is an attractant to pests and the area needs to be cleaned on a routine basis to reduce
this hazard.
