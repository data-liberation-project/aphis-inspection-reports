ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 pm on
24-Jan-17.
I arrived at the facility and attempted to make contact by phone and left a message for you to contact me. I did not
receive a return call so I waited 30 minutes and then left.
