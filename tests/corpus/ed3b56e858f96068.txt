ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 am on
07/26/2016.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 10:45 am and I spoke with one of the owners who was running the
admission booth. The owner told me that he was running the facility by himself today because the other owner was
ill and that he would not be able to do the inspection.
