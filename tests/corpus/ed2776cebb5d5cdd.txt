implemented to ensure there is no repeat of the adverse event. The IACUC must ensure that the new process for
sexing hamsters is in writing, either by protocol admendment or an SOP, and that all pertinent personnel have

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
***On January 22, 2014 five hamster pups were found dead or morbid in a cage containing two males and one
female. The female hamster was missexed and her pregnancy was undetected. The husbandry and research staff
failed to properly identify the sex of the female hamster. A new process for ensuring hamsters are properly sexed at
weaning was established but not formally written. Changes in procedures should be documented in writing and
formal training provided to all pertinent personnel. The research and husbandry staff must receive training on the
new process for sexing hamsters. Additionally, the training should be documented to ensure all personnel are aware
of the new process. Correct by March 20, 2015
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.
