Contingency planning.


The facility has not developed a Contingency Plan. The contingency plan requirement ensures a sound plan is in place in
the event of emergency situations, identifying the tasks and chain of command on-hand. Exhibitors must develop,
document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and
care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated and expected
to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals in their possession).
