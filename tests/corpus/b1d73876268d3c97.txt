Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from 1:15 pm to 1:45
pm on 04-JAN-23. There was no answer at the house or the kennel building. I called and left a message to licensee's
phone at his work place. Receiving no responses, I left the facility at 1:45pm.
