FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In Ocelot/Serval night quarters pen #5, "Ozzy" a 15 1/2 yr old Female Ocelot #203035 chewed through a corrugated
fiberglass type panel near the shift door creating a jagged uneven hole. She apparently got her right front paw
stuck and chewed her foot free. She was discovered on Feb 19, 2017 with a severely damaged right front leg that
required amputation. Housing facilities need to be constructed of materials suitable to the animals housed and be
designed and constructed to protect the animals from injury.
Correction: Completed prior to inspection. The corrugated material has been covered by a wire mesh to prevent
further chewing or injury.
The euthanasia of Julius, 11.5 year old male giraffe #208070, is under review.
The death of Ozzy, 15.5 year old female ocelot #203035, is under review.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
