The temporary holding enclosures for 3 GS-mixed puppies had interior heights about 3 inches above the dogs' heads
which is less than the required minimum of 6 inches. Lack of adequate interior height might not provide a comfortable
space for the affected the dogs. Ensure interior height of primary enclosures are at least 6 inches higher than the head
of each dog in an enclosure when the dog is in normal standing position.

Maintain correct from this point forward.
