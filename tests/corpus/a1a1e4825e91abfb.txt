PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are four primary enclosures on the East side of the Breeder building that have pieces of broken wire from the
center panels in the outside runs areas that the regulated animals have contact with. There are at least 12 middle
panels that have the rubber coating worn off over 40% of the surface area, exposing the metal. The worn off coating
with the jagged edges provides surface areas that can not be sanitized.
Sharp pointed pieces of wire can cause possible injuries to the regulated animals by poking them in the eyes, face
or by being stepped on. Areas where the rubber coating is worn off, leaving jagged edges provides an area for
bacteria to remain which results in an area not being sanitized efficiently and according to AWA standards and
regulations.
The licensee must remove the broken pieces of wire pointing inside the primary enclosures, and repair or replace
the middle panels and floor panels where the rubber coating has worn off providing an unsanitizable surface area.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the Whelping building the top of the cages are being used as a storage area for a variety of things, including
medicines, wormers, syringes, cleaning supplies and rat poison. There were 2 open bowls of rat poison pellets
sitting on top of 2 enclosures, that could have fallen down and come in contact with the regulated animals. It would
have been very easy for the animals to have contact with the poison if a mouse dropped the pellets when running
across the cages, or if the dogs jumped up and bumped the top causing the contents to fall into the primary
enclosure. The rat poison was removed during the inspection. In the Whelping building there is an accumulation of
old food, mouse droppings, dirt and debris under the wash down areas.
The accumulation of clutter on top of the primary enclosures can be a possible health hazard if any of the itemswere to fall into the enclosures and the animals were able to chew on or ingest any of the medicines, poisons or
cleaning supplies. The lack of cleaning under the washdown areas where there is an accumulation of dirt and debris
provides an area where vermin can inhabit or be drawn to, and this area can house potential health hazards for the
regulated animals.
The licensee needs to remove the clutter from on top of the primary enclosures and put them on a shelf or
somewhere else where they can be kept away from contact with the animals. The floor space under the washdowns
must be kept clean and free of dirt and debris.
