ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***** In the outdoor enclosure an eight year old male Pekingese with Microchip #AVID 100868805 had an excessive
build up of yellowish brown debris on his teeth that extended into the gum line and the teeth were barely visible.
Dental disease can be painful and eventually lead to a decrease in appetite. It can also lead to infection in the
mouth as well as potential spread of infection to other organs in the body. The licensee must have the teeth
cleaned.
To be corrected by 5/21/14.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
