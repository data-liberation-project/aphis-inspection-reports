FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sea lion enclosure the paint is peeling off of the underwater surfaces of the pool. All surfaces should be
maintained in good repair so that they can be adequately cleaned and disinfected, and so that they do not generate

Steps should be taken to repair the surfaces of the pool so that they are durable, nontoxic, and easy to clean and
disinfect as appropriate.
To be corrected by 10/6/15.
