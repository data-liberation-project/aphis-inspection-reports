Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. A wall is under construction separating the guinea pig room from the food storage area. There is bare
wood on the wall panels and support frames. Interior building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that
surfaces are impervious to moisture, will not retain odors, and can be readily sanitized. The bare wood on wall and
supports must be sealed or covered with an impervious surface so that such surfaces are impervious to moisture and can
be readily sanitized. Correct by April 1, 2021.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
Guinea pig enclosures numbered 32, 36, 80, 83, 84, and 88 had accumulations of dry fecal material covering the floor. A
total of 29 adult guinea pigs and 6 offspring were present in these six enclosures. The six enclosures were cleaned and
fresh bedding was provided during this inspection. The weekly cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not
effective in removing this fecal accumulation inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the
animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal and parasites. Correct by ensuring that enclosures are
kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta (feces) and soiled bedding, and that the
primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by February 17, 2021.
