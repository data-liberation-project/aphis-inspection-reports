Facilities, general.
There was a 2-3 inch hole with jagged edges in the plywood of a barn wall that was housing sheep and goats. Facilities in
disrepair have the potential to lead to animal injury. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength
as appropriate for the animals involved. Additionally, housing facilities should be structurally sound and be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury. The licensee must repair the hole in the wall.
