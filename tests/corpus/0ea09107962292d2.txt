CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
During this inspection 5 puppies in four primary enclosures arrived to IAH from DFW and were continuing to YVR
via United on AWB 16-29323766. No certification was attached to the four enclosures documenting the last time
food and water was offered and specific instructions for the next feeding and watering for a 24 hour period.
To ensure dogs/puppies are fed and watered during transport according to the standards and regulations of section
3.16 under the AWA the required certifications for travel must be complete and securely attached to the outside of
the enclosure. A carrier must not accept a dog/puppy for travel without a certification signed by the consignor
containing the date and time of last watering and feeding and food and water instructions for the next 24 hours.The
certification must be securely attached to the outside of the enclosure and easily readable. In cases of extended
travel and unforeseen delays these instructions will provide information to those unfamiliar with the animals that
may prevent potential dehydration and nutritional compromise.
