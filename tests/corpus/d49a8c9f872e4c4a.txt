ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 on
07-Mar-17.The licensee's wife attempted to contact the licensee at work. He was unavailable to come home at that
time for the inspection. Alternate contact methods and optimal hours for inspection were discussed with the
licensee's wife.
Lack of availability for inspection inhibits the regulatory process. The licensee must ensure a knowledgeable,
responsible adult is available during regular hours to accompany inspection.
Correct from this time forward.
