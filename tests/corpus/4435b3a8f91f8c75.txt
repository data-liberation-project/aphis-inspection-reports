INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not adequately review animal activities being
performed under the rabbit antibody production protocol. Review of the blood collection SOP, the polyclonal
antiserum production SOP and the newly approved policy on antibody production indicates that the amount of blood
collected and the weights of the rabbits will be recorded in order to monitor the health of the rabbits and ensure that
the blood volume collected does not exceed approved amounts. Blood collection records did not indicate the
amount of blood collected, although weights are regularly recorded.
Adequate IACUC review of animal use is necessary to ensure that activities involving animals are being conducted
in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. The IACUC should make certain that all activities relating to the care
and use of animals receive adequate oversight and that the activities are in accordance with the IACUC approved
protocols, SOP's and policies.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The current Environmental Enhancement Plan (EEP) for non-human primates was approved by the previous
veterinarian. A system should be in place to ensure the EEP is updated and signed by the current attending
veterinarian.
The current EEP for non-human primates indicates that toys will be evaluated for "evidence of diminished integrity",
complete with pictures of toys that were no longer appropriate. There were two toys present in enclosures with
Macaques that showed evidence of diminished integrity. A system should be in place to ensure that the EEP is
followed.
The environmental enhancement plan to promote psychological well-being of non human primates must address
each sub part under this regulation, including special considerations, be approved by the attending veterinarian, bein accordance with currently accepted professional standards and be followed by the facility.
