ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Great Dane (“Daisy”, 0A01375173) was injured during a fight with another dog. The licensee had
consulted with the attending veterinarian on the care of the dog after the incident. The veterinarian told the licensee
to give the dog 5-6cc’s of penicillin every other day for an 8 day period and to treat the wounds with Vetericyn spray. The dog received the first penicillin treatment on October 10th and the last treatment on October 18th. At the time
of the inspection the left front leg has a significant amount of swelling midway down the leg in an area that received
numerous lacerations. Physical examination by the inspector revealed that this area of swelling was much hotter to
the touch than other areas of the dog’s leg and body. The licensee has not had the condition of this dog’s leg
re-evaluated by the veterinarian.
A female Great Dane (“Blue Velvet”, 0A02025018) has discharge coming from both eyes. The lower eyelid on both
eyes is drooping and the hair surrounding both eyes is wet and is becoming thickly coated with the discharge. The
discharge from the right eye has a yellowish color. The licensee stated that this dog had surgery on her upper eye
lids at some point during this year. The dog is not currently receiving any treatment approved by a licensed
veterinarian for her eyes.
A female Mastiff (“Sansa Stark”, 0A02036007) has discharge coming from both eyes. The discharge is yellow in
color and is located beneath both eyes. The left eye has a significant amount of discharge that is attached to the
hair beneath the eye and the hair directly under this eye is wet. The hair beneath the right eye is also wet and has a
large amount of yellow discharge attached to the hair and in the corner of the eye. A strand of the discharge is
across the eye and attached to the upper eyelid. The licensee had not noticed the condition of this dog’s eyes.
Poor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Areas of swelling on the body could also cause pain
and discomfort to the dog and could indicate an underlying health issue. The above mentioned dogs must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
provide all dogs with adequate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one indoor enclosure containing one adult female Great Dane and four puppies, there is a heat lamp hanging
down into the enclosure. The glass bulb in the heat lamp has no protective guard and the heat lamp is hanging so
low that it touches the adult dog’s side when she is standing. Failure to have a protective guard on the heat lamp
may cause the bulb to break if the adult dog came into contact with it and the broken glass could cause injury.
Direct contact with the bulb could also cause burns to the adult dog.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed in a manner that protects the dogs from injury. The
licensee must remove the heat lamp, or raise it to a level that will not allow the adult dog to reach it, or add a
protective guard to the heat lamp. Correction date: October 28, 2016
There are at least three outdoor enclosures, containing a total of six adult dogs and two puppies, which have
multiple sharp points. The majority of the sharp points are created by broken wire fencing surrounding the shade
trees located within the enclosures. In one of these enclosures the sharp points were found on broken fencing in a
corner near the grapevines. All of the sharp points are located at the level of the dogs. Contact with sharp points
could cause injury to the dogs.
Surfaces of housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must remove the sharp
points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the
enclosures remain safe for the animals at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least two outdoor enclosures, containing a total of four adult dogs, the wood frames around the access doors
of the shelters have been excessively chewed and shredded. In one outdoor enclosure, containing eight puppies,
the plywood around the door frame has also been excessively chewed and shredded. In this same enclosure the
puppies have chewed a hole through the plywood and insulation in the wall. Chewed and damaged surfaces
cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis and any surface that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must repair, replace, or alter the
damaged areas in a manner that allows the surfaces to be properly cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must
ensure that all surfaces remain in good repair at all times.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The licensee is housing twenty-one puppies in outdoor enclosures. The licensee has a statement from the previous
attending veterinarian approving puppies to be housed outside. There is no statement from the current attendingveterinarian approving the housing of puppies in outdoor enclosures. Extreme outdoor temperatures and weather
could have a detrimental effect on puppies. It is necessary that the attending veterinarian has knowledge of and
approves that puppies are housed in outdoor enclosures in order to ensure that this is appropriate for their breed
and age and to protect their health and well-being.
The following categories of dogs must not be kept in outdoor facilities, unless the practice is specifically approved
by the attending veterinarian: sick, infirm, aged or young dogs. The licensee must consult with the attending
veterinarian concerning approval to house puppies in outdoor enclosures. The approval must be documented in
writing and available to the inspector upon request.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are at least four puppies under four months of age that are currently housed in outdoor enclosures with adult
dogs that are not their dam or foster dam. One enclosure contains one eight week old puppy and one twelve week
old puppy along with two adult dogs. Another enclosure contains one twelve week old puppy and one thirteen week
old puppy along with two adult dogs. Housing puppies with adults that are not the dam or foster dam can result in
excessive aggression from the adults towards the puppies and this aggression could result in serious injuries to the
puppies.
Puppies under four months of age may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs, other than the
dam or foster dam. The licensee must house these puppies in enclosures that do not contain adult dogs, other than
the dam or foster dam, in order to ensure their health and well-being.

FEEDING.
In at least one outdoor enclosure, containing two dogs, the food receptacle is a metal self-feeder. In the section of
the feeder that the dogs eat from there is a significant amount of dried, caked feed. The caked feed has hair
sticking to it and when it broke apart a white mold was found growing on the bottom of it.
In one outdoor enclosure, containing three puppies, the food receptacle is a metal self-feeder. In the section of the
feeder the puppies eat from there is a significant amount of dried, caked feed beneath the fresh feed. While movingthe fresh feed from the top of the caked feed, the inspector observed a white mold growing on top of the caked feed.
Food contaminated by mold may have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration, and caking of feed. The licensee must
remove the caked and moldy feed from the self-feeders. The licensee must ensure that all feed remains free of
caking and contamination at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Within at least one shelter in one outdoor enclosure, containing three adult dogs, there is a heavy buildup of dirt and
cobwebs. There is a heavy buildup of dirt along the interior walls of this shelter and a large amount of cobwebs
coated with dirt and dust hanging from the entire ceiling of the shelter.
Within the shelter of one enclosure, containing two puppies, there is also a heavy buildup of cobwebs coated with
dirt and dust hanging from the ceiling and located in the upper corners. The buildup of dirt, dust and cobwebs could
increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
All primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent the
buildup of dirt, grime, food waste, debris, and other disease hazards. The licensee must clean and sanitize the
interior surfaces of these shelters. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of primary enclosures remain free of
the accumulation of cobwebs, dirt, grime and any other disease hazards.
