SANITATION.
There was a large number of bees present throughout the facility affecting several animal enclosures. The facility
representative stated that a general pest control company has attempted to control the bees but there has been no
effect at reducing or eliminating their numbers. Insects such as bees may pose a health risk to the animals through
stings or possible allergic reactions. Additionally insects may present health risks by contaminating food sources.
Adequate control of insects and other pests is needed to protect the well-being of the animals and to reduce
contamination and potential disease hazards. An effective program of pest control must be established and
maintained.
