2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
15-Aug-16.Attempts to contact the licensee included leaving a voicemail on the listed phone number and beeping
the horn of the vehicle several times from outside the locked gate. After 30 minutes with no contact from the
licensee, the inspector left the premises.
Lack of availability renders the inspection process impossible. The licensee must ensure that a responsible and
knowledgeable adult is available to accompany APHIS inspectors during normal business hours.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 15, 2016.
