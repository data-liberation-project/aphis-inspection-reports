HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***On 3/31/2014, an approximately 2-year old male zebra (colt) became injured and ultimately died during routine
vaccination. It was separated from its mother (mare) in an outdoor enclosure, because of its history of repeatedly
startling and running behind the mare during the last vaccinations.
On 3/31/14, there were 2 zoo keepers present in addition to the attending veterinarian (AV). A keeper walk-way
separated the enclosures of the colt and an adult male zebra (stallion)
The AV stated that as she approached the enclosures with the dart gun, the stallion became startled and began to
run in his enclosure. She could hear the colt running as well. The AV stated she felt the running stallion had startled
the colt. The AV then saw the colt, with its head down, run into the fence and fall to the ground. The AV and keepers
entered the enclosure and administered emergency veterinary care, but the colt died. The AV took radiographs
which confirmed a cervical fracture and other trauma. The AV and park staff held a meeting afterwards to discuss
what had gone wrong and how to prevent this situation in the future. When the general curator and AV were asked
what changes would be in place moving forward, none were given beyond using a "(cid:28)buffer zone"(cid:29) between animals.
The handling of this animal to facilitate routine vaccinations was not conducted in a manner that prevented trauma,
behavioral stress, and physical harm.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected from this date forward.
Exit interview was conducted on-site with facility representative.
