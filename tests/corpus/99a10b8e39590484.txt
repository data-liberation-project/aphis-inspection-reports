escaping. Failure to do so can lead to injury or death from falls to the ground, escape from the animal building, or become
trapped outside the enclosures. The facility including enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair, to protect the guinea pigs from injury, and to restrict other animals such as mice from entering. Correct by
