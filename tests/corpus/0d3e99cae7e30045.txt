Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection on Wednesday, August 3, 2022, no records were readily available for inspection. The licensee
stated that he would e-mail them to the inspector by the next day. The documents were not received by the inspector.
Identification is required to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record-keeping
requirements.

Each dealer and exhibitor shall use Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) and Record of
Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep, and maintain the information required by paragraph
(a)(1) of this section.

2.134(a)

Contingency planning.
On the inspection conducted on Aug. 3, 2022, the licensee did not have a written or otherwise documented contingency
plan available for inspection.



A contingency plan needs to be available on inspection to ensure that a plan has been developed and would be
implemented in case of vehicle mechanical/power breakdown, accidents, animal escapes, or natural disasters most likely
to be experienced. This planning and implementation potentially decrease the number of adverse effects on the health
and well-being of animals in an emergency event or disaster.

Dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to
provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the event of an
emergency or disaster.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
