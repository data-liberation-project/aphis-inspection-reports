Facilities, outdoor.
-The two male sheep housed together were noted constantly panting. The temperature at the gate of their enclosure read
87 degrees F at approximately 11:30 AM. The shade cloth used in the outside area of their enclosure does not provide
any significant shade. The shade cloth used is for plant nurseries. There was a fan at the end of the row of male goats
and sheep, but there was no air reaching these two sheep.
-The single, adult, Holstein cow has not shade except for inside its shelter. The cow was noted going into the shelter for
10-20 seconds and then running out. The Holstein cow was noted to be sweating on its sides.

When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or artificial means
shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.

Sufficient shade must be provided to these animals to afford them comfort, and prevent overheating.
