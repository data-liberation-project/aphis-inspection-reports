2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Vials of Parvovirus vaccine have been stored in a cabinet in the kennel overnight and are still in the cabinet at
approximately 2 pm the next day. At the time of the inspection the temperature in the kennel was 57 degrees F. The
label on the vaccines states that the vaccines should be stored at 35-45 degrees F. Failure to store vaccines at the
proper temperature could affect their ability to adequately protect the dogs from disease.
The facility must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The Parvovirus
vaccines must be moved to a storage area that is the proper temperature in order to ensure the health of the animals.
