FACILITIES, INDOOR.
(d) Interior surfaces. The guinea pig house has wooden flooring. The wood is saturated with moisture in the front.
The moist wood creates a surface that can harbor disease hazard (bacteria, viruses, mold, etc.) which may cause
illness. The solid surfaces in guinea pig enclosures must be made impervious to moisture to allow them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by March 2, 2016
