2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(c)(1) During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
A 3 year old male leopard is brought out onto a stage only connected to a large chain tethered to the owners waist.
The stage is approximately 3 feet high. There is a public barrier approximately 10 feet from the stage that is about 4
feet high. During the show the leopard jumps upon a platform that sits about 3 feet from the front left corner and is
about 6 feet high. Leashes/chains and handlers are not considered adequate public barriers for large felids. If the
leopard decided to leap from the platform it is doubtful that the handler could restrain the animal to prevent it from
going close to or contacting the viewing public. An additional form of restraint must be used to continue exhibiting
the animal in this manner to assure the safety of the animal and the public.
