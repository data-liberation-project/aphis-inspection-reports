3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Some of the fencing and structures in the blackbuck enclosure and the giraffe enclosure are in poor repair.
Approximately 15 feet of fence on the right side of the enclosure containing 15 blackbuck is bent or leaning over. The
fence is comprised of wooden posts and metal wire panels. A tree has fallen on the fence and in this area there were two
wire panels held together by a strap or tie. The edges of some of the wire panels have sharp points. There is an
approximately 12 foot by 12 foot wooden shelter structure in the blackbuck enclosure that has a sagging roof, and the
roof has become separated from the far wall.
The outdoor section of the enclosure housing one adult male giraffe is made of wood posts and metal wire panels. At
least 4 wooden boards within the fence are broken, and 2 more boards are falling down from the top of the fence. Two of
the boards have nails sticking out of them. Numerous posts are leaning outwards.
Adequate structural strength and regular maintenance of fences and shelter structures is important for animal comfort,
health, and wellbeing. Animals can escape or become injured by inadequate or poorly maintained fences, and shelter
structures that are falling down may fail to provide adequate shelter from the elements.
Correct by maintaining facilities and enclosures that are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain the animals within.


3.127(d) Critical Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
In April 2020 one David's deer, two sika deer, and two sheep were killed by predators at the facility. Coyotes were
observed in the area around the time of the deaths, and a gap beneath the perimeter fence was found that appeared to
be dug out by coyotes, wild dogs, or other wildlife predators. The gap was identified and filled in with concrete and no
additional deaths have occurred due to predation since that time.
The perimeter fence beside the giraffe enclosure, next to the road, is in poor repair. The fence consists of 6 foot tall metal
wire fencing next to the road, with black plastic tarps in some areas. The metal fence has some gaps and openings and is
less than 6 feet tall in some areas. Inside the metal fence there is a partially competed solid wood fence, which is leaning
outwards in some areas. There are numerous trees, bushes, and vines close to the fence and touching the fence.
Animals who are not protected by an adequate perimeter fence may be injured, killed, or sickened by contact with wildlife,
unauthorized people, or stray animals. Animals who are killed by predators suffer from stress, pain, and injury or death.
Correct by maintaining a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height and strength to prevent access by unauthorized
people or animals, and which acts as secondary containment in the event that an animal escapes from its primary
enclosure.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
