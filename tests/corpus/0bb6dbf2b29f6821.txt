3.80(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
In the monkey house, the first enclosure to the left of the entrance had two areas where the enclosure fencing had pulled
away from the metal bar securing the fencing to the ceiling. This exposed two separate areas with protruding metal wires
and allowed an approximate 3 foot section of the fencing to be pulled away from the ceiling allowing for possible injury,
entrapment or escape of the animal/animals held within the enclosure. Additionally on the side of the same enclosure
there was a section of enclosure fencing that was loose, with a small section of wire not secured.

Enclosures for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species
of nonhuman primates housed in them and kept in good repair.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


Adjacent to the perimeter fence behind the baboon enclosure, there remains a large accumulation of debris composed
mostly of chain-link fencing, fence paneling, and other construction materials piled up approximately 6 x 4 x 50 feet. In the
entryway to the lemur, vervet and Patos monkey night house, there are discarded materials accumulated in the barn.

Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in
good repair in order to protect the nonhuman primates from injury, and to reduce or eliminate the breeding and living
areas for rodents, pests, and vermin.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the managers.
