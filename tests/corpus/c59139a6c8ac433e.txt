ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The program of veterinary care was incomplete. The program of veterinary care needed an updated date and,
signature from the veterinarian and exhibitor. The program also needed to included the goats, pigs and rabbits.The
program needs to be updated and signed to ensure that the plan has been reviewed and animals have been seen
at least once a year. Also the exhibitor has to arrange a formal written agreement with a veterinarian to provide
adequate veterinary care to the animals in the event veterinary care needs to be provided for the betterment of the
animals. The plan didn't include any euthanasia and emergency procedure. The program should inlcude these
components to ensure there is a plan in place if an animal must be euthanized or if there is an emergency. The
program needs to be complete so that appropriate measures can be taken and promptly addressed.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a brown rabbit that was reluctant to move and looked lethargic. When the rabbit moved it stumbled to
the right. The right ear was drooping and had a reddish brown flaky debris that was in the lower half of the ear which
the owner did not notice prior to the inspection. The attending veterinarian needs to be contacted and consulted
immediately and veterinarian care should be provided as soon as possible. There should be a daily observation
made of all animals to assess their health and well-being. There should be a direct and frequent communication of
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being to the attending
veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***There were no records documenting the acquisition of any of the covered species and the exhibitor shall make,
keep and maintain records or forms which correctly disclose the information of these animals. The records shall
include offspring born of any animals while in his/her possession or under his or her control.
2.131(e)HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***All of the rabbits were observed panting and stretched out in their cages reluctant to move. The heat index was
104.7 degrees F using the kestrel at approximately 6:00 pm. There was also one lethargic rabbit that appeared to
be in distress that was subjected to these conditions. Each cage had a little fan above it to keep the animals cool
but this was insufficient in improving the climatic conditions. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's
health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may
never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's health
or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, overall health status, and
acclimation. Correct by August 21, 2014
