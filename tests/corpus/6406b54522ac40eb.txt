ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white Alpaca located in the llama/alpaca paddock has overgrown teeth. This excessive growth of teeth produces
an impediment to the normal movement of the animal while eating, causing the loss of part of the food that falls out
of the mouth. Although this animal appeared with good body weight, the progression of this condition may lead to
loss of weight and unnecessary suffering.
There was no documentation that the facility has contacted a veterinarian regarding this animal. Correct by having
this animal examined by the Attending Veterinarian and following all recommendations. Additionally the licensee
must maintain a record of these findings and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
During this inspection the same toys in the cages of the chimpanzees were observed and there were no enrichment
means different from those observed during the previous inspection. There are no items that would add cage
complexity or foraging opportunities for these animals. The physical environment in the primary enclosures must be
enriched by providing means of expressing non-injurious species-typical behavior.
Although there were no serious behavioral problems observed during the inspection which included several hours of
observation by the inspector, the enrichment program should be followed all the time and rotation of the
environmental enrichment methods needs to be done more often, to promote psychological well-being and prevent
stress and behavior problems.
Examples of environmental enrichments include providing perches, swings, mirrors, and other increased cage
complexities; providing objects to manipulate; varied food items; using foraging or task-oriented feeding methods.

FEEDING.
The two 7 week old Lion cubs are still on a diet which is mostly formula with some chicken baby food. They are not
being offered any ground meat at this time.
By the time they are 10-12 weeks old they should be getting a diet very close to that of an adult in order to provide
for adequate nutritive value. Licensee shall start adding meat to the bottles by 2-3 weeks of age, with the majority
of the diet being meat by 8 weeks of age. Bottles can still be provided as enrichment by the age of these cubs, but
should only be a minimal part of their full diet. Failure to provide for adequate nutrition for these growing cubs can
lead to dietary deficiencies. Correct by transitioning to a meat diet.
Correct by: From this time forward.
