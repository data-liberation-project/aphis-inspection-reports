FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The cool room used to store unopened bags of feed including the guinea pig feed had a musty moldy odor. White
chips and residue of ceiling material were noted on the floor. A black moldy substance was noted on the ceiling in
the back right corner of the storage room. The unopened bags of guinea pig feed felt damp to the touch. Damp feed
may become contaminated and may no longer be nutritious. Ensure that the feed storage room is kept in a
condition that adequately protects food supplies against storage and deterioration. Correct by 2/22/18.
