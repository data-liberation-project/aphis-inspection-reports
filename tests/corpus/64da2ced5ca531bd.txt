ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:35pm on
10-SEP-19.
Telephone contact was made with the licensee who stated that they were out of town and would not be back for at
least another 2 1/2 hours. They gave me partial optimal hours for this week and will text or call when they are going
to be out of town.
