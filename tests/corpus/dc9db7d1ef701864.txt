MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on09-FEB-17 at 11:00 am.
*** I arrived at the facility at 11:00 am. The employee stated that the owner was not available and that she wasn't
able to participate in the inspection. I discussed the annual report and pain category with the employee. I stated that
this would be an attempted inspection and left the premises at 11:45 am.
