2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The fox is wearing a harness and came to the facility with it on last November. The licensee is not able to get
hands on the animal to check the harness for tightness or remove it. Leaving a harness on an animal for an
extended period of time can cause physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. This harness needs to be removed in
a manner that does not cause harm for the safety of the animal.
