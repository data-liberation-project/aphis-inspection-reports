HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At time of inspection the metal base angle iron used to help support the enclosure gates are showing excessive rust
The affected area is located on east side of the building. The rust runs all along the bottom of the enclosures. The
metal used to seal off the front of the plastic drain underneath the enclosures is also rusted and missing in spots.
Wire expanded metal flooring has excessive rust in all enclosures. Twenty two dogs are in contact with the affected
support metal base and the metal flooring. Excessive rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces which
affects the structural strength of the metal. Rusted metal is hard to clean and sanitize. In addition, the ability to
protect the animals from injury could be questioned. The licensee must ensure that all metal surfaces are
structurally sound, kept in good repair and must protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by 08-20-15.
3.6(a)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection broken and protruding wires were observed in one enclosure. The wires have corroded to the
point that they have broken away from the side of the enclosure. One dog is in contact with the affected wiring
which is located on the east side of the shelter building. Sharp points could injure the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosure wires are maintained in good repair at all times for the safety of the dogs. To be corrected

3.6(a)(1) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection there was broken wire flooring observed in three enclosures. The affected flooring is attached
to the outside wall of the sheltered facility. Three dogs are in contact with the wire flooring. The gap created from
the broken wire was estimated to be one to two-three inches in width and 3-4 inches in length. Holes of this size
could potentially allow the dogs to get caught and cause discomfort. The broken wire flooring could be visualized
from the underneath side where the dogs are walking. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained in
a manner so it is structurally sound and in good repair. To be corrected 07-30-153.6(a)(2)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection the wire flooring has corroded to the point that it has broken away from the base of the
enclosure frame leaving a two inch gap along the base in one enclosure. Two dogs are in contact with the affected
wiring which is located on the east outside part of the building. Gaps could injure the dogs.The licensee must
ensure that all enclosure wires are maintained in good repair at all times for the safety of the dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(3) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection a three to four inch hole was observed on the front of one enclosure door housing one adult
dog. The wire was rusted and caused the opening. The door is located on the east side of the shelter building. The
potential for injury, stress or discomfort exists if any dog gets caught or jumps through the opening. The licensee
must ensure all enclosures contain the dogs securely at all times and are in good repair. To be corrected by

3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At time of inspection all primary enclosures located in the building housing twenty two dogs have an accumulation of
excreta waste underneath the enclosures on the vinyl drain. Lack of disposal can create unsanitary conditions that
could lead to potential contamination and disease risks. The licensee must remove excreta waste from underneath
the primary enclosures on a daily basis for the health and well being of the dogs.
3.11(b)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At time of inspection there is a mixture of dirt, grease, and grime on fiberglass wall boards inside the facility and on
the outside of the facility. The enclosures are located on the east side of the shelter building. Twenty two dogs are in
contact with the affected wall board. The affected area covers approximately 15 percent of the wall surface.
Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. It indicates
an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if needed. To be corrected
by 07-25-15.
