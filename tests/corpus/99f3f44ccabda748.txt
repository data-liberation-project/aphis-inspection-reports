2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection on December 19, 2017, I observed numerous adult goats and sheep showing lameness
while standing, walking, and running in the pasture near the barn that have not been provided adequate veterinary
care. I observed a young goat deceased laying in its cement culvert shelter that was not provided adequate
veterinary care.
There is a matted white and brown ram limping and favoring his front left limb while walking and keeping his limb
elevated while stationary. During the previous inspection on October 19, 2017, this sheep was putting more weight
on his left limb but now its mainly elevated when standing. A brown and white ewe is limping favoring her left front
limb while walking as she did during the previous inspection on October, 19, 2017. These two sheep were
identified on the previous inspection report as goats as a typographic error. There is a white ewe with overgrown
hooves limping favoring her rear limbs while walking to eat hay. There were several other goats and sheep that had
some lameness however I was not able to identify them due to many of them running away then standing in a
stationary position. There is a 3 month old goat deceased in its cement culvert shelter. This goat had been
deceased for some time due to the foul odor, excessive flies and maggots outside the rear area. The care taker
stated that this young goat was born a runt with medical issues they took care of but appeared not to have any
recent health problems. According to the care takers and manager none of these lame goats and sheep and the
deceased goat received previous veterinary. Without adequate veterinary care for these lame goats and sheep they
may develop further medical problems and endure more pain and discomfort.
For the health and welfare of the animals at this facility this exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of
adequate veterinary care to its animals that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,
and treat diseases and injuries.

2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).During the inspection on December 19, 2017, a three month old goat was observed deceased inside its cement
culvert enclosure. It was evident that this goat having a strong foul odor, covered in flies and maggots at the rear
area was not observed for numerous days. It was stated that this goat had previous medical issues since birth and
the facility treated it, however the attending veterinarian was never notified to ensure adequate veterinary care was
provided. Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being and Provided, further, That a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATLY
I accompanied the facilities attending veterinarian and licensee at the facility on December 20, 2017. The attending
veterinarian visually observed the goats and sheep that are lame but no treatment was provided. His
recommendations for treatment were given to the licensee. I spoke with the facilities manager by phone on
December 21, 2017, at 4:30 p.m., and the attending veterinarians recommendations for treatment would be
followed. The manager stated their facility intends to exhibit the farm animals as an agricultural exhibit and plans to
cancel their USDA license. Since there were some differences about the definition of exhibiting farm animals for
agriculture purposes, I recommended to notify the eastern regional office in writing to ensure compliance.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility care taker and manager on December 19, 2017, and
with the licensee on December 20, 2017.
