HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing one ring tail lemur has metal poles crossing the enclosure acting as supports for the
animal to climb and sit on. These poles have sections where the paint is missing and the poles are rusted. These
poles can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized and need to be replaced to facilitate cleaning of the
enclosure. This needs to be addressed for the health of the animal.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** At the time of the inspection the temperature inside the facility was 86 deg F according to the licensee's wall
thermometer. The facility had fans running but no additional ability to cool the area down. Three chinchilla's were
housed in an aquarium with a vented top. This enclosure does not allow adequate air flow to provide for the animals
comfort. Chinchilla's are animals that do not tolerate heat well and can become stressed if the temperatures are
above 80 deg F. The temperature of the facility is not compatible for the health and comfort of these animals. The
facility needs to address the temperature and have methods in place to sufficiently cool the area down for the
comfort of the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** The facility is housing two camels in stalls that are 12x12. Currently the animals are walked outside daily but do
not have access to a larger outdoor pen that allows for adequate freedom of movement. Camels are very social and
have been known to run, and dust bathe which is normal postural movements for these animals. These animals
need to have a pen that allows for room for these behaviors for their health and well being.

*** The African crested porcupine is housed in an enclosure that does not provide enough space for adequate
freedom of movement. This is a younger solitary animal and needs to have an area that allows it to hide as a social
adjustment. This needs to be addressed for the health of the animal.
