3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wires on approximately 10 divider wire panels between adjacent enclosures have deteriorated to the point that
there are wire points sticking into the enclosures as well as gaps between enclosures (there are also a few divider
panels between enclosures not in use at the time of the inspection that would need repair before these enclosures
could be used). Dogs could be injured on the wire points, or could escape from their enclosures through these
gaps. All enclosures must be kept in good repair to securely contain the dogs and protect them from injury. Correct
by 20 June 2017.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a build-up of oil and grime on at least 12 metal egress dog doors of the sheltered building. Surfaces that
are not regularly cleaned and sanitized can harbor pathogens. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact
must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least every two weeks to prevent accumulations of grime and reduce
disease hazards. Correct by 30 May 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
