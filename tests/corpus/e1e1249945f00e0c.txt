The licensee has not been filling out the APHIS Forms 7006. In addition the APHIS Forms 7005 are not up-to-date
and is missing seven adult dogs that are in the kennel. Not using APHIS Forms 7006 and not keeping APHIS
Forms 7005 up-to-date doesn't allow for proper tracing of the animals by an APHIS official. All sales must be
documented on APHIS Forms 7006 and all acquisitions of dogs four months or older must be documented on
APHIS Forms 7005. Correct by 6/29/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
