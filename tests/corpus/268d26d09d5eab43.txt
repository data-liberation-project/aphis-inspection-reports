2.126(b) Repeat

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:38 PM on 5-12-21.

Upon arriving at the facility, I called the registrant's contact number and honked the horn in attempts to reach the
registrant. All attempts were unsuccessful.

A responsible adult must be available to accompany the inspection process during business hours.
