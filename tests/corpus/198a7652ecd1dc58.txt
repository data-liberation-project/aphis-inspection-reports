3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
Two adult Shih Tzu dogs (male Smokey #38 and female Bertha #9) were housed in a building that had walls constructed
of untreated wood that was not impervious to moisture and that does not allow for regular cleaning and sanitization
practices.

The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.

Surfaces made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized aids in reducing disease hazards that can
affect the dogs that come into contact with those surfaces. The walls need to be made impervious to moisture to allow for
cleaning and sanitization by covering, replacing, or sealing the wood.

3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


Two adult Boston Terriers (male JW #959 and female Ruby #25) were housed in outdoor primary enclosures that
contained a build-up of more than day-old excreta and general dirt and grime. The old excreta had been present for more
than a few days, shows evidence of break-down due to weather exposure and has not been removed on a daily basis.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained
in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.

Primary enclosures should have excreta removed daily, or as often as necessary, to reduce disease hazards, insects,
pests and odors.
