Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records indicate that guinea pigs were sold to an operator of an auction and a dealer. The records of disposition do not
include the name, address, and USDA number of the licensed dealer and auction. Disposition records of animals sold
should be maintained as outlined in the Animal Welfare Act standards to facilitate the tracking of animals and to ensure
their health and well-being. The current disposition records and all subsequent records of animals sold must include the
name, address, and USDA number of all USDA licensed auctions and dealers to ensure complete records of guinea pigs
sold are maintained. Correct by November 13, 2021.
