ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection two animals were noted in need of care:
*One white alpaca was noted to be very thin. The animal's spine was distinctly visible. The hip bones were
protruding and very visible. The facility states they obtained the alpaca about six weeks ago and that they have
been administering ivermectin.
*One brown and white goat was noted limping on the left front limb while walking. The goat was able to get around
the pasture during the inspection and was weight bearing.
A veterinarian has not yet been contacted about these two animals to determine a diagnosis for their health
concerns and to set up a treatment plan. A diagnosis and treatment plan is necessary to ensure the health and
well-being of the alpaca and goat. The facility shall contact a veterinarian regarding the alpaca and goat to ensure
the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by 5/15/16.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing used to secure the goats, sheep, and cows in their primary enclosure is not constructed of appropriate
material and strength.
Three areas were noted where the fencing had been torn, stretched, or bent allowing for 5 goats to escape from
their primary housing. The goats remained nearby and were returned to the enclosure. One damaged area had
sharp points where the fencing was torn and could potentially injure the animals.
One goat was observed to be stuck in the fencing. It was unable to retract its head through the fence due to its
horns. A 2" x 4" area of hair loss was observed on the back of the neck from where it had been rubbing its neck in
frequent attempts to retract its head with no skin damage noted. During discussions with facility owners, it was
noted that this is a frequent occurrence for this particular goat and is corrected when observed.
Two areas of the enclosure fencing had a large enough gap between the bottom of the fence and the ground which
could allow for small animals to escape or unwanted animals to enter.
Fencing that is not structurally sound does not provide adequate protection from escape, injury, and entrance ofunwanted animals.
The facility shall ensure that the enclosure fencing is structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect and
the contain the animals. Correct by 5/24/16.
