3.75(c)(1)(iii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some metal hose clamps been used to secure joining sections at primary enclosures were observed to be
deteriorating; having sharp points/edges. Damage metal components on primary enclosures for nonhuman primates
(NHP's), could develop sharp points and edges, that might injure the animals. Housing facilities for NHP's must be
kept in good repair and must be free of jagged edges; protecting the animals from injury, and containing the animals
securely. The licensee immediately communicated the noncompliance to the facility's staff it could be fixed. All
damaged hose clamps at primary enclosures/cages must be replaced and/or fixed to prevent the potential of an
injury to regulated animals.
