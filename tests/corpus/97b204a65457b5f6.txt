TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The record books for 4 wolf-hybrid dogs did not contain a clear photograph of each animal: Spartacus, ID#96,
acquired 9/27/14, Trigger, ID#95, acquired 9/21/14, Tundra, ID#92, acquired 11/16/13, and Zoey, ID#99, acquired
4/30/15.
The record book requirements for exhibitors are necessary to ensure all animals can be properly matched to their
official identification, to ensure that they have been acquired legally, and to readily identify each animal when
exhibited to the public by photographic identification.
The licensee must have a record book containing each animal's tag number, a written description of each animal,
the data required by Sec. 2.75(a), and a clear photograph of each animal.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several bags of open dog food that were not stored in leakproof containers were found in the food storage area.
Open bags of food can become contaminated, allow for deterioration of the food from moisture, or attract pests.
These can diminish the nutritive value of the food or may pose a risk to the animal's health due to bacterial or pest
contamination.
All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
contamination and spoilage.
