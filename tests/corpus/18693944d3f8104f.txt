FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The new African crested porcupine emclosure has exposed underground fencing with 4x4 openings in the area
under the log structure. The openings allow the feet of the porcupine to pass through easily and makes it difficult for
the animal to walk or rest under the log structure, which provides shelter from the sun and inclement weather.
Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that is appropriate for the species enclosed within. The large
openings in the fencing is not appropriate for the African crested porcupine. The fencing must be replaced with a
material that does not allow the feet to pass through to prevent injury and for the comfort of the animals. Correct by
July 11, 2014.
