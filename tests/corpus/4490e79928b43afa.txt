Watering.
The water bowl for the African Crested porcupines was empty at approximately 12:45pm. When the animals were given
water, both animals rushed to the water bowl, vocalizing and eagerly began to drink. The animals consumed water for
approximately 3 minutes straight. The licensee stated the animals were watered two times daily and they would usually
consume water for several minutes. The eagerness and length of time spent consuming water when offered indicates the
animals were extremely thirsty and that the current schedule for watering is not sufficient to meet the animals needs. The
facility must provide water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals
