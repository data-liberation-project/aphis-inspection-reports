Facilities, general.
*** The two goats in the barn next to the chickens have chicken wire covering the wood over their hay trough and along
the wood entrance into their stall. This chicken wire is broken in several areas with some protruding wires at eye and face
level of the goats. This wire should be replaced with materials that are structurally sound for the goats and maintained in
good repair for their safety.
