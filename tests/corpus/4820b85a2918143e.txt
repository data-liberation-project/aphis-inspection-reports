OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are two outside pens with insulated dog houses that contain 5 Huskies, however there is not any additional
shade structures available for the dogs to get out of the sun or rain, except for the houses.
It is important to provide additional shade structures to allow all regulated animals to be able to get under to protect
them from the direct rays of the sun, rain, snow and wind, besides a dog house.
The owner must provide additional shade structures to the outdoor pens that are large enough for all of the
regulated animals to be able to lie down in a comfortable position and be in the shade at the same time if needed.
