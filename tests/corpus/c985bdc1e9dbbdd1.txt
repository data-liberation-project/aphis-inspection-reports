ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**DIRECT- At the time of inspection an adult male tiger, "King", (microchip #0006CEBC44) exhibited an emaciated
body condition. The vertebrae along his back and rib cage was visible and he walked with a hunched posture. His
hips were pronounced with a sunken appearance on both sides of the flank. The tiger attempted but was unable to
lift his tail to urinate. The tiger was observed drinking water for approximately 45 seconds. According to the facility
manager, the tiger was previously on the road and brought back to the home facility the week prior (04/17/17)
because he was not eating. The employee spoke with the attending veterinarian when the tiger was brought to the
facility and the veterinarian indicated he would evaluate the tiger but as of the time of the inspection had not
performed an evaluation. Lack of veterinary care can lead to pain and suffering of the animals. Licensee must
have the animal evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The facility must maintain documentation of the diagnosis
and treatment of the animal.

**CRITICAL-While on the road a 12 yr old adult White Bengal male tiger, “Prince” (microchip #0006CEC35A)
presented to a veterinarian in Oklahoma in a moribund, hypothermic condition. According to the veterinarian
“Prince” was in lateral recumbency, dehydrated and had labored breathing with a temperature of 97.4. Because of
the poor prognosis “Prince” was euthanized on 03/23/17 according to the evaluating veterinarian. Lack of timely
veterinary care can lead to pain and suffering of the animals. Licensee must have animals evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner as veterinary care issues arise.
