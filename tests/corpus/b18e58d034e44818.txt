On Saturday May 28th, 2016 in the afternoon, a 3.5 year old boy crossed the public barrier and entered the gorilla
exhibit. The public barrier is composed of elevated landscape held back by multiple retaining wooden log walls,
metal piping used as the framework for the hand railing, and two metal cables are between the ground and top of
the railing. Behind this railing is a dense assortment of bushes and trees followed by the substantial drop-off into
the moat. The total height from the asphalt pathway to the top of hand rail is 32 inches. The wooden log retaining
wall is 14in. tall from asphalt walkway and is where the hand rail is anchored into the ground. The two wire cables
run at 19in. and 25in. from the surface of the asphalt pathway. There is some slack in the cables that will permit the
cables to stretch an additional inch either way, so the 6in. gap between the cables can be manipulated to an 8in.
gap. The landscape in this area is 50% low level vegetation and 50% bushes roughly 18-24 inches tall. The drop
off into the moat is 15 feet with 1-2ft. of water in the moat. Guests notified the keeper of Gorilla World that a child
was in the exhibit and called 911. The keeper immediately initiated the facility’s emergency response. Zoo security
promptly responded to the incident. The Dangerous Animal Response Team (DART) was notified. A member of
the DART team arrived at Gorilla World approximately nine minutes later.
The two adult female gorillas were successfully recalled by the keeper into gorilla holding, but the 17 year old male
gorilla, Harambe, did not respond to recall as he had made contact with the child. No other animals were in the
enclosure. Harambe had dragged the small child around by the ankle in the shallow water of the moat, carried him
up the ladder out of the moat, and then dragged him several times on the ground of the gorilla enclosure. The
DART team member determined the child’s life to be in imminent, life threatening danger and shot the gorilla with a
single gunshot and the gorilla died instantly. The boy was recovered, no major injuries were apparent at the time of
his recovery. No other animals were harmed in this incident. All standard operating procedures relating to the
Dangerous Animal Response Team were properly followed.
This gorilla enclosure with its public barriers was constructed in 1978. No previous incidents involving the public
crossing the public barrier had been recorded until now. Fixed public exhibits housing nonhuman primates must
have a barrier between the primary enclosure and the public in order to restrict physical contact between the public
and the nonhuman primates.Corrected at the time of inspection. The facility has replaced the fence of the public barrier. It is now 41-42 inches
tall and is covered in a nylon mesh instead of the two cables. Three surveillance cameras were added to the
enclosure to enhance observation of the public viewing area and the enclosure.
This was a focused inspection for the incident that occurred on May 28th 2016 involving a 3.5 year old male child
and 17 year old male gorilla named Harambe.
The exit interview was conducted with VMOs Cody Yager and Kerry McHenry, Executive Director of the Zoo, Chief
Operating Officer, and the Director of Animal Collections.
