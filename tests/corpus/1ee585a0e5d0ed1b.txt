3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General
In the enclosure containing two guinea pigs, the wood along the bottom part of the cage is rotted exposing the
staples that hold the wire mesh flooring to the frame of the enclosure. The wire mesh is sagging in the middle and is
very loose from the staples coming out of the rotted wood. All surfaces of the enclosure must be impervious to
moisture and be repaired so that it is structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury.
