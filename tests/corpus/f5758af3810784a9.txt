3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure affecting one adult cat the majority of the floor at the bottom of the enclosure was covered with
feces, food, hair, and cat litter. The debris was wet and there was an obvious smell of ammonia consistent with
urine inside the building. The edge of the litter box had a build up of brown residue with hair stuck to it.
The lack of cleaning and sanitizing within the facility can cause disease to be harbored, attract rodents and pest,
and cause odors that could affect the respiratory systems of the animals. The licensee must clean and sanitize the
surfaces in contact with the animals in accordance to 3.11(b) at least every two weeks or more often as necessary.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
