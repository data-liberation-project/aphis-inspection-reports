2.33(b)(4) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
An adverse event was reported to the IACUC. On 9/9/2021, a NHP was undergoing a procedure. During the procedure, a
problem with respirations was noted. It was discovered that during setup system checks of the anesthesia machine, the
popoff valve was left closed. The step of reopening the popoff valve post-pressure check was missed. By the time it was
discovered, the NHP had suffered fatal barotrauma to the lungs.
Following approved procedural and safety protocols exactly is required for the safety of the animals and for the quality of
the science.
This was corrected prior to the inspection by retraining all personnel responsible for administering anesthesia, and by
ordering new safety valves for all the anesthesia machines that will be installed as soon as they arrive.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
