*** The main primate building has green algae growing on the ceiling above the enclosures. This is due to cleaning
and moisture condensation staying on the ceiling. This algae growth would indicate that there is not enough
auxiliary ventilation to reduce the humidity in the building which could become a health concern for the animals. This
needs to be addressed for the health of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** A sea lion pup died after he got his head stuck in a plastic toy on exhibit. Although the toy was approved for adult
sea lions, these same toys need to be reassessed with younger animals to prevent injury. This needs to be
addressed with all adult approved enrichment items for the safety of the new pup currently at the facility.
