WATER QUALITY.
A review of water quality records indicated that on March 16, 2015 the coliform bacterial count of the water sample
taken from the seal pool was 8297 MPN/100 ml of water. On March 24, 2015 the count was 4352 MPN, 3076 MPN
on March 25 and on March 30, 2015 a count of 299 MPN was documented.
No documentation or information was available to indicate that the facility took any steps to address or correct the
unsatisfactory condition of the water and as a result significant and prolonged elevated coliform counts were
identified. Primary enclosures must not contain water that can be detrimental to the health of the marine mammals.
The facility should review operating procedures for addressing elevated coliform counts.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some areas of the wire roof panels in the ocelot off exhibit housing facility are excessively rusted. Damaged
sections have been patched and repaired but excessive rust is visible and unrepaired in other sections. Rusted wire
can compromise structural integrity of the enclosure and permit accidental escape or injury to the animal.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain them. The roof of this enclosure should be repaired or replaced.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The kinkajou and porcupine are housed in outdoor primary enclosures. Neither animal has a natural or artificial
shelter available in the enclosure to provide protection from inclement weather such as driving rain and wind. A solid
roof is in place covering parts of the enclosure however, no barriers exist to provide protection on any sides for theanimals.
Since this geographical location experiences climatic conditions that include abundant rain and thunderstorms
sufficient shelter should be available to offer protection from inclement weather for the comfort and safety of the
animals.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The giant otter and agouti outdoor exhibits are not enclosed by a 6 foot perimeter fence. The outside walls of these
enclosures are constructed of solid buildings, rock work, glass and other sturdy, durable materials that exceed 6
feet in height. One open section of the otter exhibit is surrounded by a 6 foot gate that functions as the required
perimeter fence in this area. The agouti exhibit has a gate that is not solid and this area is enclosed by a second
barrier/fence that is not 6 feet high.
Written approval must be obtained from the administrator for exclusion of the perimeter fence where requirements
are met by solid and sturdy enclosure walls. Where requirements are not met (gated agouti area) a 6 foot perimeter
fence must be in place or approval must be granted. Perimeter fence requirements must be met to prevent
unauthorized animals and persons from contacting the animals and to serve as secondary containment in case of
escape.
