ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:00 am on
09-AUG-17.
I arrived at the facility and found no one there. I called the Wildlife Director and left a message. As I was leaving the
owner arrived and was able to make contact with the Wildlife Director. I spoke with her and she said she was not
available to accompany me on the inspection. I then left the facility.
