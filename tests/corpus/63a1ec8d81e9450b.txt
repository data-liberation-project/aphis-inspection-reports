Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of the inspection, the licensee informed the inspector that he was transitioning to a new veterinarian, but had
yet to set up formal arrangements. Upon contacting the vet he intends to work with, she informed the inspector that she
does not see agriculture species such as pigs and goats which are at the facility. The licensee must have an attending
veterinarian who is willing to provide adequate vet care to all his animals. These arrangements may be divided between
more than one vet who would specialize in certain species.

Two juvenile pigs were thin with a prominent backbone visible and ribs palatable. One of the pigs was facing a wood wall
in an apparent head pressing manner and when he was moved by the inspector he walked around the stall for a few
moments then went back to the wall and again pressed his head against the wall. The other pig would stand with his head
down to the ground and his breathing appeared shallow. He would then slowly fall to his side and move his legs in a
swimming motion on the ground. Both of these abnormal behaviors, and thin body condition of the pigs is concerning and
may indicate an underlying medical condition that needs to be diagnosed and treated.

For the health of these animals, the licensee must establish a relationship with an attending veterinarian who shall provide

adequate veterinary care to his animals.

Facilities, indoor.
Currently the guinea pigs are housed in a barn that is insulated but not heated. The ambient temperature of the barn at
the time of the inspection was 45 deg F according to the handheld Kestral reader. Per this regulation ambient
temperatures in facilities housing guinea pigs must not fall below 60 deg F. This needs to be addressed and these
animals moved to an area that can be temperature controlled within regulations for their health and well being.
