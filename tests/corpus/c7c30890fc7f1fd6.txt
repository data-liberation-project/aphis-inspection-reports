FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility has a six foot perimeter fence that is constructed of vertical metal bars approximately 4 inches apart.
There are also gaps of various sizes present between the ground and the bottom of the perimeter fence. The
resulting space and gaps may be wide enough to allow unauthorized animals or persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals at the facility, and should therefore be filled in.
The purpose of the perimeter fence is to function as a secondary containment for the animals and should be
constructed in a manner that minimizes the risk of unauthorized entry of animals and persons into a facility, to
protect the animal(cid:25)s health and well-being.
