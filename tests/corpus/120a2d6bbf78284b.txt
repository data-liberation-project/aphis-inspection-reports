2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee was unable to provide the inspector with a current, written, Program of Veterinary Care. When a
facility employs a part-time attending veterinarian, a written, up to date Program of Veterinary Care, which
accurately reflects the arrangement of veterinary care at the facility, is required in order to ensure all animals
receive appropriate veterinary care, and to protect the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must
ensure that they are able to provide the inspector with a current, written Program of Veterinary Care, which has
been developed in conjunction with the attending veterinarian. The Program of Veterinary Care must be kept current
at all times.
