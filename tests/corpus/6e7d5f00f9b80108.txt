2.38(b)(1)(2)
MISCELLANEOUS.
Access to required IACUC records including minutes, attendance, activities, deliberations, semi-annual reports and
recommendations was not available during this inspection. The absence of personnel with knowledge regarding
storage of the records, recent relocation of offices and staff and building construction contributed to the lack of
access during the inspection.
Access and review of required records is necessary to assess compliance with the regulations and standards under
the Animal Welfare Act. Records should be available upon request by APHIS officials.
Correct by: The facility faxed record of an IACUC meeting held in 2013 to the western regional office after the
inspection process. In the future all required records shall be available upon request for inspection purposes.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC chair.
