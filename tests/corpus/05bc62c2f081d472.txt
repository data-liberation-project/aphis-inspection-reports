RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
While reviewing records, it was noted that information was lacking for the acquisition records of a red fox and a
skunk that were purchased in the past year. On the skunk's paperwork, the only information that was present as to
where the skunk came from was the seller's first name and the first initial of his last name. The address was
absent. Failure to record all required information doesn't allow for APHIS officials to accurately trace an animal's
movement from one facility to the next. All required information for the documentation of the acquisition of animals
shall be collected and recorded when the licensee takes in any new animals from any source.
Correct immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following problems were observed during inspection:
---An enclosure containing two wolf/coyote hybrids had a shelter with a board that was hanging (at a slant) from the
top of the inside of the shelter.
---Inside the enclosure noted above that contains two wolf/coyote hybrids there was a multi level wooden deck next
to the shelter that the wolf/coyote hybrids can stand on. On this wooden deck, there was a board that was missing
on the floor causing there to be a gap in the flooring on the wooden deck. In addition, there was a nail head sticking
out where the board use to be nailed in.
---In an enclosure containing two cougars, there was two screws sticking out of the side of a wooden shelter.
---An enclosure containing five black bears had a wall that had recently been knocked down by one of the bears.
This broken wall left a couple of a screws sticking out from the top of the shelter.
---A raccoon enclosure had fencing running across the top of the enclosure. The raccoons are able to reach the topof the enclosure by climbing items within the enclosure. In the center of the fence line running across the top, there
is a small hole that has the potential to get larger in the near future.
Boards hanging from the ceilings of enclosures and nail heads or screws sticking out within the enclosures doesn't
adequately protect the animals within the enclosures. Holes along the fence lines of the enclosures doesn't ensure
that the enclosure can adequately contain the animals inside it. In addition, it doesn't adequately protect the
animals from injury within that enclosure.
The primary enclosures shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to ensure it can
adequately contain the animals.

3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was one wolf in an enclosure by itself. The wolf had been removed from another enclosure because it was
no longer compatible with the wolves that were in that enclosure. The new enclosure it was in was lacking shelter.
In one corner of the enclosure, there is a spot where a board is covering up one side of the fence line and another
board is covering up half of another side of the fence line. There is nothing covering up the fence line opposite of
the fence line that is half covered. This would not be considered adequate shelter as it does not adequate protect
the animal from inclement weather. Natural or artificial shelter must be provided to protect the animal from
inclement weather.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence surrounding the enclosures at the facility located on Sunrise Rd. located in Stacy, MN had an
opening gate that is 6 feet tall. At the back end of the property, part of the perimeter fence is not secured by posts
causing that part of the fence to be unsturdy. The fence can easily be moved at the top and can extend a few feet
inward or outward depending on which way it is moved. The enclosures within the perimeter fence contain wolves,
cougars, and bears. Not having an 8 foot tall gate and having part of the fence line not secured by posts doesn't
ensure that the animals contained within the perimeter fence can't escape if they somehow got out of their primary
enclosures. The gate must be corrected so that it reaches a height of 8 feet. In addition the fence line near the
back end of the property must be secured so the top part of the fence is not able to shift inward or outward the way
it can now.Correct by 6/10/16.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Multiple cans of food were found to be expired. Expired food doesn't ensure the food is wholesome, palatable, and
of sufficient nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health. All food shall be removed and discarded once it
has expired.
Correct immediately.

WATERING.
An enclosure containing five bears had a large container which was used to hold water for the bears. The water
inside was dirty brown. Unsanitary water could be contaminated with various types of parasites which could cause
illness or disease for the bears. All watering receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
Correct by 5/17/16.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Two enclosures had trees that were falling over and were leaning from the inside of the enclosure to the outside of
the enclosure. Both trees were leaning onto other trees on the outside of the enclosures. If these leaning trees fall
further, they will land on the fence of the primary enclosures that could give the animals inside of these enclosures
the opportunity to escape. One of the leaning trees would also land on the fence line of another primary enclosure
that is next to the primary enclosure that the tree stands within. In addition there are two trees that have fallen over
and are leaning on top of the fence line of a red fox enclosure. The weight of one of the trees has caused the top of
the fence line to bend inwards. While the fence line is not damaged to the point where it would allow for the escape
of the animals inside, any further damage to the fence line may allow for the animals inside to escape. The grounds
within the enclosures must be kept in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury.
