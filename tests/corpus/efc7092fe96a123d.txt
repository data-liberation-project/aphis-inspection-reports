3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
There are five hamster enclosures with large cracks that have caused gaps up to 5mm in width. In all the enclosures, the
cracks start at the metal ring surrounding the hole that is intended to be used with automatic water lines.
Cracks and gaps in primary enclosures can cause structural instability and make it difficult to clean the enclosure which
can adversely affect the health of the hamsters.
The licensee must ensure that the primary enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
hamsters from injury.
