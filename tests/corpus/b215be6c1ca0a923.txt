2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The most recent records of acquisition for dogs were not available for inspection. The licensee had acquisition
records up to April 4th of 2014 but no acquisition records after April were made available. The licensee was
unaware of the missing records and reported there should be more recent acquisition records. The licensee stated
that his son was responsible for recordkeeping. After some searching, the records could not be found. The absence
of acquisition records prevents the dog(cid:25)s movements to be tracked and verified. The licensee shall keep and
maintain all records of acquisition and disposition for all dogs. Correct this day forward. At the time of the exit
interview, the most recent acquisition records were made available.
3.2(c)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The sheltered housing facility called (cid:28)double stack(cid:29) does not provide adequate lighting for the dogs. During the
inspection a flashlight had to be used to adequately inspect the facility and the health of the dogs inside the
enclosures. The natural light provided by the one window did not adequately illuminate the bottom of the
enclosures. The inspection was in the early afternoon on a cloudy day. The licensee remarked that he uses a
flashlight to work inside the room. Proper lighting is essential in the health and well-being of dogs. You cannot
perform adequate cleaning of the facility nor can you properly assess the health of the dogs without suitable lighting.
The licensee has plans to no longer use this room for dogs after the end of March, 2015. Correct by providing
proper lighting that uniformly illuminates all enclosures that allows for appropriate cleaning and accurate inspections
to take place.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outdoor section of 12 enclosures in a facility called (cid:28)double stack(cid:29) had damaged white plastic PVC piping used
to lock the door between the inside and outside sections of the enclosure. The PVC piping was a permanent
structure inside the enclosure. There was a significant amount of chew damage around the end of the pipe, as wellas brown staining and a layer of grime around the outside of the piping. The roughened surface created by the chew
damage creates an ideal surface for organic debris and bacteria to accumulate and are not able to be cleaned and
sanitized properly. Failure to repair these areas of damage surfaces poses a risk of disease and contamination
which can negatively affect the animals contained therein. Correct by ensuring all surfaces of primary enclosures
must be readily cleaned and sanitized as required and must be replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by
12/19/2014.
3.11(b) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Numerous enclosures inside the sheltered portion had areas of excessive accumulation of brown material
consistent with feces and other excreta. The licensee states spot cleaning is done on a daily basis and all kennels
are pressure washed and then sanitized once a week; however, this process does not appear to be adequately
removing all accumulated excreta. The brown organic material can function as a suitable environment for bacteria to
grow and can serve as an opportunity of infection for the dogs in the enclosure. Proper cleaning removes all
sources that promote bacteria growth. Correct by cleaning all areas of the enclosures as often as necessary to
prevent accumulation of organic material and other excreta. Remains uncorrected.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
