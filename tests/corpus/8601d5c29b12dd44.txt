2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
On October 12, 2019, an incident involving the inadvertent pairing of two adult male Cynomolgus Macaques (#M165-19
and #M166-19) occurred due to a technician that accidentally transcribed the wrong animal identification on the room’s
pairing log. Before shifting the animals into the same enclosure, the technician also failed to verify the log with the email
communication from the animal behavior technician regarding the incompatibility of these animals with other macaques.
When the two macaques were moved to the same enclosure, they immediately began to fight. The husbandry staff
separated the macaques as quickly as possible, but one macaque (#M166-19) sustained lacerations to the face and
shoulder. M166-19 required veterinary care and was treated immediately. Over the next few days, the wounds were
treated again under sedation for complications. The animal received the appropriate analgesics and antibiotics, and
healed over the subsequent weeks. As a result of the mispairing of the macaques, adequate handling was not provided
in accordance with the facility’s established procedures, and an animal sustained unnecessary physical harm. Handling of
all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,
excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from this day forward by
ensuring corrective actions are followed to prevent further occurrence of incidents.
