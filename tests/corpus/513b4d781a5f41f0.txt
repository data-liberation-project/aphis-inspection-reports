ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
21-SEP-16.
The licensee's father indicated that the licensee and his wife were both out for the day and there was no
knowledgeable representative to accompany inspection. Lack of availability renders the inspection process
impossible. The licensee must ensure that a knowledgeable adult is available to accompany inspection during
regular business hours.
