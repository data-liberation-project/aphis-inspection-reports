ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female brown goat (tag #212) housed in a stall in the barn had an injured right hind limb at the time of inspection.
The goat holds the right hind limb up and does not attempt to bare weight on it. The lower part of the leg is also
swollen. An animal with a swollen non-weight bearing limb, indicates it is experiencing pain and distress. Animals
that sustain an injury must be provided with veterinary care. The goat must be examined by a veterinarian for a
diagnosis and treatment for the injury to relieve the pain and distress.
Corrected the evening of the inspection, May 22, 2017, with the attending veterinarian.
2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female brown goat #212 sustained an injury to the right hind limb. According to the animal keeper, the injury
occurred last Thursday, May 18, 2017 while housed in the enclosure with three (3) alpacas and three (3) goats.
Although the animals was moved into a barn stall to prevent any further injury, the attending veterinarian was not
consulted for treatment regarding the injury until Monday, May 22, 2017. Delaying examination and treatment for an
animals can cause pain and distress. A mechanism to have direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian
must be established to ensure animals receive veterinary care in a timely manner. Correct by May 24, 1017
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records of acquisitions and disposition. Specifically, there are no records for the disposition of a kulan, arctic
fox, and a Patagonian cavy. There no acquisition records for the llama, aoudads and coati. Records of acquisitions,
dispositions, and animals on hand must be kept and maintained. The record of animals on hand are not available
for review. These records must also be available for review at the time of inspection by a USDA inspector to assist
with the enforcement of the regulations and standards of the Animal Welfare Act and to ensure the well-being of all
animals at the facility.2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is only a single rope barrier in front of several animal enclosures including the kulan, camels, and a mixed
species enclosure housing blackbuck, zebra, nilgai, and aoudad. The single rope barrier is drooping close to the
ground in several areas making it easy to walk over the rope and come in contact with the animals. There is no
barrier separating the public from a second camel enclosure on the right side of the premises. Sufficient public
barriers must be in place to protect the of the animals and for the safety of public. Sufficient barriers must be
installed in front of both camel enclosures, kulan, and the mixed species enclosure housing blackbuck, a zebra, a
nilgai, and aoudads.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Lion Enclosure:
Structural strength: Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or
electric wire. The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel
poles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest
upon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep
roots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is
approximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. There is now an 8 foot high tensile wire barrier fence approximately
20 feet from the front of the enclosure.
The enclosure currently houses a -4 year old male lion and a – 3 year old female lion with limited mobility. The
enclosure is only 12 feet in height. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure
containment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats,
modifications to the enclosure to increase the height must be made to prevent escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were made.
*** The following additional structural strength items were noted during this inspection:
***Pot belly Pigs: A portion of the buried wire fencing is exposed and bent upwards along the front of the enclosure.
The corner edge of the fence is pointed and could potentially be a source of injury to the animals in the enclosure.
There is exposed wire fencing along the majority of the back side of the enclosure on the ground which could injure
the legs of the pigs. Fencing must be constructed in a manner that prevents the animals from escaping or injuring
itself. The exposed portion of buried fence must be removed or buried in a manner that will prevent the potbelly pigs
from exposing and pulling up the fencing for their safety and proper containment. ***The bottom fencing for the bear, alpaca, and potbelly pig enclosures have edges that leave sharp points. The
animals can come in direct contact with these areas and injure themselves. Modifications must be made to the
bottoms of the fence to eliminate the sharp points or prevent the animals from coming into contact with the points.
***Bale twine is securing gates in some of the primary enclosures including five (5) llamas, and kulan. The gate for
the back pasture of goats and sheep is secured with a black bungee cordon one side and bale twine on the other
side of the gate. Enclosure fencing and gates must be properly attached to poles and gates must be secured in a
manner that prevent unwanted entry into the enclosure to contain the animals and to prevent injury.
***The shift door slide to the bear shelter is detached and protruding outwards. Without the shift door working
properly the bears cannot be closed off safely for cleaning the dens. Additionally, the bears could be injured by the
protruding piece of metal that extends into the enclosure. The shift door must be repaired to prevent injury to the
bears and ensure the animals can be shifted when needed.
***The enclosure fence for the sheep/goats (back pasture) and deer secured fencing is damaged. There are
detached sections of fencing and section at the front of the deer that are bent downward. The fence must be
repaired
***The door to the outdoor tiger enclosure was being secured by a rachet strap and two hinges on the right side of
the gate. Correction: Additional chains and locks were added to the right side of the gate during the inspection.
All primary animal enclosures shall be structurally sound, maintained in good repair and constructed in a manner to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** Four llamas and one young llama are housed in an enclosure with no shelter from inclement weather. A lack of
shelter can cause pain and distress and illness. Shelter from inclement weather must be provided to protect animals
from wind and rain. The animals must be provided with a sheltered structure for protection from the elements and
for the comfort of the animals. May 26, 2017.
***The shelter in the enclosure housing fifteen (15) deer has a missing board and a detached board on the front.
The current structure is not structurally sound and puts the animals at risk for injury. Shelter structures should be
maintained structurally sound in a manner that will protect the animals from adverse weather conditions at all times.
The shelter must be repaired or replaced to provide adequate protection from the elements and to prevent injury to
the animals contained within the enclosure. May 26, 2017.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
***There are four (4) wooly pigs and one (1) potbelly pig housed in a stall in the barn that has a brown material on
the walls of the enclosure. The floor of the stall has a build-up of dirt and fecal matter approximately 10 inches with
straw on top. Approximately two-thirds of the enclosure floor was covered in an excessive amount of feces and wet
dirt. Numerous cobwebs with dust were hanging from the ceiling.
***There is a brown material on the walls of a stall in the barn housing two (2) goats.
Excessively dirty enclosures with a build of dirt and fecal material creates an environment for disease. Fecal
material and debris must be removed from the enclosures to prevent build-up and to minimize the animals exposure
to disease. Correct by May 26, 2017.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***There are numerous dead trees within the kulan, llama, and fallow deer enclosures. A fallen tree is lying on top of
the enclosure fence separating the kulans and llamas, bending the chain link fence downward.
The dead trees and sick trees may potentially fall due to weather conditions and natural deterioration, potentially
injuring and animal or damaging fencing. The health of the trees should be evaluated to determine which must be
removed to protect the animals from injury and to prevent damage to enclosure fences and shelters.
***Pokeweed, a poisonous plant for hoof stock is growing in several areas of the llama enclosure. There is a risk
that the animals may ingest such plants, which could potentially be a detriment to the health of the animals.
The removal of pokeweed and dead trees should be done periodically to protect the animals from injury and
maintain the structure of enclosure fencing. June 23, 2017.

EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 175 regulated and non-regulated animals. There is only one keeper was
present performing husbandry duties during the inspection. Based upon the number of housekeeping, maintenance,
building projects, there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform the day to day responsibilities
for maintaining the facility in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations. There must be a sufficient number
of employees to carry out the facility husbandry duties, repairs, and projects. Additional personnel must be obtained
to facilitate the maintenance of the facility in a timely manner to prevent the discomfort of animals and ensure
animals are contained and protected from injury. Correct by June 23, 2017.
