Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The wound above the brown bears left eye has increased in size and depth and compromises the entire forehead area
above the left eye of the bear. The wound has a necrotic center, is ulcerated and is hairless. There is significant swelling
around the wound.

The adult bobcat is obese, and has a matted haircoat down the neck and back. The bobcat is still walking very slowly,
gently, and stiff legged.

The nine-year-old male lion known as Damba is very thin with prominent vertebral bodies. According to the licensee this
lion was last dewormed one month ago with ivermectin. The licensee did not know when a fecal examination was last
done for this lion. The lion has not been seen by the attending veterinarian for his thin body condition.

Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries.

A veterinarian must diagnose and recommend treatment for the bear to prevent unrelieved suffering and pain. The

matting of hair on the bobcat must be removed to prevent pain and possible irritation/infection of the underlying skin.
Failure to have this lion evaluated and treated for its condition can lead to it worsening and causing the animal to suffer.
This animal needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for this thin body condition.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee noted a small growth on the adult, male brown bear in October, 2020. The license did not contact a
veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment for the bear. The growth grew larger and the licensees wife stated that the bear
tore the growth off with its paw. This created a 4-5" wound that the licensee has been treating with Blue Kote. During
inspection today the wound appears to be deeper, and necrotic.

The obese bobcat still appears to walk slowly, gently, and stiff legged.

The nine-year-old male lion known as Damba is very thin with prominent vertebral bodies. The licensee was not aware
that this animal is too thin. Failure to recognize the thinness of the lion and communicate this to the attending veterinarian
in a timely manner can lead to a worsening of the condition and suffering of this animal.

Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observations of all
animals to assess their health and well-being. If these daily observations are accomplished by someone other that the
attending veterinarian a method of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

A veterinarian has not been contacted to address any of these health issues.

Sanitation.
The bobcat enclosure still has excessive feces in the litter box, and another area around the center post for the enclosure.
There is a strong odor around the enclosure.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards
and odors.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
