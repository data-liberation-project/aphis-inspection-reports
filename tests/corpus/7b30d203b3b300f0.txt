HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--(3) Cleaning.
* There were several enclosures which had not been cleaned properly becasue the licensee was unable to shift the
animals out of their enclosures due to their aggressive nature. There was a small toy and a soft material resting
pouch hanging inside Coco's enclosure. Both of these items had surfaces with a build-up of black-brown grime.
The floor of Joey's enclosure was not sealed and stains could be seen where urine had soaked into the concrete.
The walls of the enclosures in the pink room had brown organic material smeared on them. One enclosure in the
pink room had a rag hanging on the enclosure wall which was soiled brown-black with fecal material. The bedding
material in the tortoise enclosure, immediately adjacent to an indoor chimpanzee enclosure, was also wet and
soiled brown. The licensee stated that once the weather warmed up, animals could be shifted around and the area
could get cleaned. There was also an outdoor shelter which had a solid surface just a couple inches under the wire
floor to catch waste material. That surface was filled with what appeared to be very old food and feces and the
monkeys housed in the enclosure were able to come in contact with the aging waste.
** Unsanitary conditions can lead to health problems for the animals.
*** The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces which come in contact with the animals (including enrichment
items) are properly cleaned and sanitized at frequencies which prevent disease hazards (every two weeks for
indoor facilities). Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that other surfaces of housing facilities (which do not come
in contact with animals) are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry
standards and practices. This is a repeat non-compliant item.

(e) Storage. * There was a bag of primate food in the animal housing area which appeared to be about half full that was stored
on top of the other unopened bags. The top of the bag was gently folded over but was not sealed.
** Open bags of food are an open invitation for pests and vermin to contaminate the food.
*** The licensee must ensure that open food and bedding supplies are kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting
lids. This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with the licnesee on 29 April 2014.
