Telazol); pre-emptive analgesia with carprofen.(cid:29) The Anesthesia Log for the procedure performed on one pig on
January 09, 2016 utilized ketamine, then propofol for induction, followed by Isoflurane for anesthetic maintenance.
While a suitable anesthetic regimen was utilized, it was not that listed in the protocol approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and failure to adhere to the approved protocol can result in pain or
distress to the animals.

utilized or submit for approval to the IACUC a new protocol or amendment to this protocol which contains an
anesthetic regimen created in consultation with the Attending Veterinarian (or other their designee veterinarian).
The IACUC shall review activities involving animals in order to approve proposed activities and specifically shall
determine that the proposed activities be performed with appropriate sedatives, analgesics or anesthetics, unless
withholding such agents is justified for scientific reasons, in writing, by the principal investigator.
