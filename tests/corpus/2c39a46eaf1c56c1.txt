2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The barrier fence surrounding the enclosure containing the two foxes is not of sufficient distance or height to
prevent the public from reaching over and potentially coming in direct contact with the animals.
The barrier wall of the primary enclosure of the two porcupines contains a significant gap between the wall and the
gate access point such that the public can have direct access to the animals.
There must be sufficient distance and/or adequate barriers between the general viewing public and the animals
during times of animal exhibition to assure safety to the animals and public.
