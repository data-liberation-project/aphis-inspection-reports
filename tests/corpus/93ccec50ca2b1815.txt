* The dividers between the enclosures are painted metal paneling with pipe framing. The paint for five of these
dividers had peeled off in areas along the bottom of the dividers. These areas were excessively rusty and flaking.
In places, the metal surface is corroding away. Two enclosure fronts were painted metal paneling and pipe framing.
The paint had peeled off along the bottom pipe of these fronts. These metal surfaces were excessively rusty and
flaking. These excessively rusty and corroding metal surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized.
Therefore, increasing the disease potential for the eight adult dogs. The areas of corrosion can affect the structural
strength of the metal surfaces or panels.
All metal surfaces must be kept free of rust and maintained of a regular basis. This will allow for required cleaning
and sanitization in the prevention of diseases. Also, this will maintain the structural strength of the metal surfaces.
