2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female reindeer, right ear tag #10, had excessively overgrown hooves on all four feet and was seen favoring her
left front leg when she moved. Excessive growth of hooves changes the angle of the toes, changes the gait, and
can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs such as arthritis.
**A plan needs to be developed and documented, with the input of the attending veterinarian (AV), to address the
need for hoof trimming for any animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the development of chronic
foot and leg problems. This plan needs to be available for review by APHIS officials.
A male reindeer calf was noted to be limping on his left hind limb. This animal had been diagnosed by the attending
veterinarian (AV) in approximately early July as having a fracture that had begun to heal on its own. This APHIS
VMO had talked by phone with the AV on 7/14/2014 and had been told of this animal's injury and what had been
done to diagnose and treat the condition. When asked if there was a plan to recheck the reindeer's leg to assess
healing, the AV stated there was not a plan to see the animal again. This APHIS VMO expressed concern that the
animal's progress should be assessed by the AV and not to just rely on the licensee's phone reports. The AV had
stated that she expected to schedule the herd health exam soon and agreed that it would be ideal for her to
reassess his condition sooner rather than later. At the time of this inspection, the AV had not seen this reindeer calf
and the herd health exam is not scheduled until 9/9/2014.
**This animal is still limping and needs to be re-examined by a veterinarian by 8/31/2014 to determine if the animal
is painful, if the leg is healing, and if further diagnostics and/or treatment is necessary.
A plan needs to be documented, approved by the attending veterinarian (AV), and be available for review by APHIS
officials for the monitoring of this reindeer by the licensee for pain and to recognize changes in his condition. This
plan should include criteria for when pain relief or other methods for reducing pain and distress need to be provided
to ensure a good quality of life and to prevent worsening of the underlying condition. The licensee should document
that he is monitoring this animal and when pain relief or other methods are provided to reduce pain and discomfort
so the veterinarian and APHIS officials can evaluate if the plan is effective.2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee was not on site for this inspection and was contacted by phone to determine if an inspection could be
conducted with a responsible person. The licensee granted permission to allow an employee to accompany APHIS
officials on the inspection but stated that the records were not on site and that they were with the licensee.
Records that are required under the AWA have not been available for the last 6 inspections.
Access to all required records for inspections is required for the Secretary to be able to enforce the AWA.
The licensee shall allow APHIS officials access to conduct inspections.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure housing 1 llama, 3 sheep, and 2 goats had three shelter structures with unsecured billboard
tarp material. This material was almost completely unraveled from the duplex style shelter so that most was lying
on the ground. The material was hanging loosely from the top of the other two shelters. This unsecured material
poses a risk of injury to the animals if they become entangled or ingest the loose material.
The wire and cattle panel fencing separating the reindeer cows and calves from the male reindeer had several
broken wires or support posts that had sharp ends protruding into the enclosures, posing a risk of injury to the
animals. There were also areas where the wire fencing was bent, loose, and pulled away from the rest of the
panels which pose a risk for animals' antlers or feet to become caught in the wire.
The facility shall be constructed so it is structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain the animals.
To be corrected by 8/30/2014.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The outdoor enclosure housing 1 llama, 3 sheep, 2 goats had an excessive accumulation of excreta from an
adjacent pen housing mules and burros along the north fence line. This accumulation extended at least 6 feet along
the fence and was as high as 18 inches and could fall into the water receptacle inside the sheep/goat/llama
enclosure. Inside this enclosure, there was an excessive accumulation of excreta with several large piles in themiddle of the enclosure and very little ground that was free of the waste material. This poses a risk of contamination
of the feed, water source, and the animals' hair/wool.
The excessive accumulation of excreta throughout the facility but especially around and in this enclosure is
contributing to the numerous flies seen throughout the facility. The flies and the potential for contamination of the
feed, water source, and the animals' hair/wool with excreta puts them at risk of disease.
Cleaning of enclosures. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The food storage shed had a broken bag of feed with spilled feed on the floor with an accumulation of rodent feces
on the floor and other surfaces within the shed. Rodent pests and droppings may contaminate the feed and be a
source of disease for the animals.
Numerous flies were noted throughout the facility including on the food receptacles and feed. The reindeer, mules,
and other animals were noted to stamp their feet and appeared to want to get away from the flies during the
inspection. The facility has placed fly traps and an electric zapper in the barn where the reindeer are housed but
these do not appear to be effectively controlling the flies. The amount of excreta in and around many of the outdoor
enclosures is excessive and is likely contributing to the number of flies seen during this inspection.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained and should include more frequent removal of excreta from and around the enclosures,
cleaning of spilled feed in the food shed, and other methods for preventing the contamination of food and facilities
housing animals.
To be corrected by 8/31/2014.
Inspection conducted with facility representative and 2 APHIS AC VMO's. Exit interview conducted by phone with
the licensee.Additional Inspectors
