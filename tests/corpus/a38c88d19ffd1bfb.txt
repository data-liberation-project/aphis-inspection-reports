RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Section 2.75(b)(1) Records: The last entry for the facility log book on animal numbers is 32 deer on October 10,
2014. On this inspection 26 deer and 11 fawns (born in 2015) were observed. There are no records of the births of
the 11 fawns in 2015. There are veterinary records for the disposition of two deer in 2015, but it is unclear what
happened to the other deer. Animal records are used for evaluating herd health, for tracking animal ownership and
are required to comply with the animal welfare regulations. Correct by updating the facility animal records to include
the birth and disposition of all the deer. Correct by June 23, 2015.
An exit interview was conducted with the owner.
