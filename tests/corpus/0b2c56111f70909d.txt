3.80(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The plastic trim piece along the bottom edge of the east side panel framing the skylight at the top of the Golden Lion
Tamarin (#2) and Night Monkeys (#2) exhibit was detached. As a result, there was a gap or space between the trim piece
and the side panel that a monkey's limb or tail could be caught in or injured.

Per this Section, primary enclosures for non-human primates must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with
representatives of the Applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 9/24/22 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection. Regulated
activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
