***One of the goats had excessively overgrown hooves, causing the toes to curl abnormally, as a result of not
receiving routine hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.

could come into contact with the pigs and lead to injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
