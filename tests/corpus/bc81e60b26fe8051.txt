ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:33 AM on
19-MAR-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I knocked on the door of the house located at the facility site. When there was no answer,
I called both the mobile phone number for Ms. Brown and the business phone number, leaving voice mails at 10:33
AM and 10:35 AM, respectively. I honked the horn twice. After waiting for 30 minutes, I left the facility.
