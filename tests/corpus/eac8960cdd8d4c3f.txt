3.6(b)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A cage containing one cat did not have an elevated resting surface. The use of elevated resting surfaces satisfies a
behavioral preference for many cats. The licensee must ensure that each primary enclosure housing cats contains a
resting surface or surfaces that, in the aggregate, are large enough to hold all the occupants of the primary
enclosure at the same time comfortably. The resting surfaces must be elevated, impervious to moisture, and be
able to be easily cleaned and sanitized, or easily replaced when soiled or worn.
