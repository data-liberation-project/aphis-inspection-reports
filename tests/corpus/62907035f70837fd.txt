3.127(d)(3)

Facilities, outdoor.
The kangaroo enclosure does not have a 6ft perimeter fence surrounding the primary fence. The primary enclosure fence
is 6.5 ft high and made of metal fencing material and wooden posts and top frame, and there is a secondary lock out on
the North side of the enclosure to keep the animals from escaping when entering/exiting the enclosure.

A perimeter fence is necessary as a second containment area if the animals were to escape the primary enclosure, and to
prevent the entry of people or other animals into the primary enclosure.

The licensee must provide a perimeter fence around primary enclosure for the kangaroos unless a variance is granted by
the Administrator giving written approval to not require the 6 ft perimeter fence.

To be corrected by July 1, 2021
