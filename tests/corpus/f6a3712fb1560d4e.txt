2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol 09147 did not provide a complete
description of some aspects of animal use. The description of the surgical placement of marmoset head caps, titled
"Head Cap Surgery," did not include the length of incisions, the amount of muscle removed, or the size of the head
caps. The description of a different, "Two Stage Head Cap surgery," states that the previously identified, traditional
head cap surgery removes most of the scalp and excises large portions of the temporalis muscle. The size of the
head caps are not described for either type of surgery.
Inadequate descriptions of activities using animals may prevent the IACUC from identifying deficiencies in activities
and ensuring that animal activities are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. The lengths of surgical incisions
and size of head caps are details that should be considered when assessing the adequacy of pain control, as well
as pre-procedural and post-procedural animal care. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the
investigator provides a complete description of proposed activities that involve the use of animals in order that those
activities may be adequately reviewed and determined to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During inspection, a Jerboa appeared to have significant fur loss on the dorsal surface of the body. The vet staff
had not previously been communicated with regarding the fur loss on this animal, and had no record of evaluation of
the animal.
The caretaker had finished feeding and observing the animals for the day but had not communicated the fur loss.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their well-being, appropriate documentation of those observations, anddirect and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues are necessary to ensure
that the animals at the facility receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensure
that all animals are observed daily, any health problems are documented, and the attending veterinarian is notified
when necessary.
Correct from this day forward.
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two hammocks in the Marmoset enclosures had hanging strings and were worn, and another Marmoset enclosure
had a nest box with a loose screw on the base, resulting in a gap that could catch digits. The hammocks should be
replaced due to wear and the nest box sturdily constructed for safe activity. All surfaces must be maintained and/or
replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces can impede cleaning, create hazards, and
otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.
Corrected during inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
