ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On Sunday, 9/14/2014, two adult female Labrador Retrievers that were housed together, with microchip #146 32
129 0A and #029 109 374, were fighting and the owner immediately separated the animals into different primary
enclosures. Both animals sustained injuries.
***Upon our inspection, the yellow Labrador (#146 32 129 0A) had a swelling on her neck extending over the
shoulder blades. Over the left shoulder, there was a circular area of black and crusty exudate on her fur. On the
dog(cid:25)'s nose, there is an abrasion extending from the tip to opening of the nares.
***The other dog, a chocolate Labrador Retriever (#029 109 374) had a reddened and swollen right eye. Also there
was a whitish-yellow, thick discharge coming out the corner of the right eye by the nose. At the time of inspection,
treatment was not provided for the animals.
Dog bites can cause significant injury to the skin, soft tissues and organs, which can lead to localized abscesses
or generalized tissue infection (cellulitis) or any other disease condition that affects these animals(cid:25) overall health
and well-being.
***There was another adult female, yellow Labrador Retriever (#0A02086003) had an area of hair loss on the top of
her head, about the size of a quarter. Within that area was a scab, about the size of dime. The licensee stated that
she was bit by flies about a week ago.
Insect bites can cause significant irritation to the skin and discomfort to the dog which can lead to severe pruritus
(itching) or any other disease condition that can affect this animal(cid:25)s overall health and well-being.
The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian concerning these two animals and ensure that adequate
veterinary care is provided to all animals as required by federal regulations.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: September 19, 2014.
***On inspection of medication being used for the animals. Out of all the medications inspected, one bottle ofpyrantel pamoate, used as dewormer, had an expiration date of 05/14. The licensee recently used the expired
dewormer for a litter of puppies in August 2014. According the licensee, there were no sicknesses noted due to the
exposure. However, the use of expired medication is not considered acceptable veterinary practice and therefore
inconsistent with adequate veterinary care according to the Animal Welfare Act. Administration of expired
medication, can be less efficacy and thus ineffective in the prevention and/or treatment of intestinal parasites.
The Licensee must ensure that all medications used on regulated animals are within the expiration date and provide
adequate veterinary care for all animals as required by federal regulations.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: Completed at time of Inspection
Exit Conference was conducted on September 17, 2014 with Dr. Ashley McIntosh (VMO), Beverly Hicks (ACI), and
Licensee.
