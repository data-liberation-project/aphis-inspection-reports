Housing facilities, general.
Several of the primate enclosures do not appear to have been thoroughly cleaned recently. The lemur enclosure had a
platform that had monkey biscuits along with old feces that was smashed flat and dried. One of the baboon enclosures
had several areas with old, dried feces. One of those areas was on a picnic table that also had pieces of monkey biscuits.
Enclosures with dirt floors must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to
avoidcontact with excreta, or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. The primate


enclosures need to be cleaned more frequently. Cage furniture that is not easily cleaned needs to be replaced following
the veterinarians recommended schedule.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
Facilities that house primates must have an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The current plan of environmental enrichment includes platforms,
ropes/swings, and “toys” that are to be changed every 2 weeks. There is no guidance on facilitating cognitive/sensory
enrichment.
There is also no indication that the current plan is being followed. There were minimal enrichment items in the primate
enclosures and all the cage furniture, platforms and swings, were unchanged from the previous inspection.

Sanitation.
The otter enclosure, both inside the holding area and outside in the viewing area, did not appear to have been cleaned
recently.
The outside area consisted of a pool surrounded by round river rocks. There was an accumulation of old feces or some
other substance next to the area where the food was placed.
One corner of the inside holding area had a large accumulation of feces.
Fecal material, old food, dirty bedding/dirt, and other debris need to be removed from the primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
The otter enclosure needs to be cleaned more frequently so that the health of the otters is not compromised
