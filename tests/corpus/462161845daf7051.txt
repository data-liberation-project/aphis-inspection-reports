2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult tri-colored female Sheltie identified by microchip (150964170A) is carrying its left front leg in an abnormal
manner. There is an open lesion on the bottom of the left front paw. The lesion is approximately an inch long. It
appears moist and is reddish-pink in color. The skin is pulled back enough to observe a white colored underlying
tissue. The licensee stated the dog was walking normally on all fours earlier that day when he was with the dog. An
employee stated that she had noticed the injury the day prior on February 10, 2015, but had failed to inform the
licensee. The licensee noticed the dog limping for the first time at the time of inspection. The licensee has advised
he has been in contact with the attending veterinarian and an examination will take place tomorrow.
The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate diagnosis and treatment administrated and
documented. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments must be made
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure; construction.
Within the large indoor housing facility there are primary enclosures adjacent to each other separated by wire
panels. The openings in these panels are large enough to allow the Sheltie dogs to come into contact with each
other.
Injuries or death can occur when non-compatible dogs are able to be in contact with each other. The licensee must
ensure housing facilities for dogs protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other
animals from entering.
