SANITATION.
The big building for the hedgehogs has a large amount of shavings that have accumulated on the carpeted floor
under the animal enclosures and along the back wall. Thick cobwebs are present in the back corners of the room.
Discarded feed bags are collecting in the front corner behind a rack of animal enclosures. In addition, excess
equipment and supplies are filling one corner of the room in both this building and the medium building.
Accumulated bedding and debris on the flooring, and discarded food bags and other refuse contributes to odor and
makes it difficult to maintain adequate pest control. Excess equipment and supplies makes the animal housing
room difficult to clean and sanitize and to maintain adequate pest control.
The walls and flooring of the animal room must be cleaned, and discarded feed bags and other refuse removed
from the animal housing room or placed in a leak-proof container with a lid. In addition, if the animal housing rooms
are to be used for the storage of equipment and supplies, these areas must be cleaned and organized. To be
