2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white and brown, adult, female Shih-Tzu (ID# 452E7B3062) has areas of abnormal hair loss between the
shoulder blades and along its tail. The skin on its tail appears reddened and scaly. Clumps of matted fur are tightly
adhered to the skin along the inside corner of both eyes. There is a clear wet discharge and crusty dark brown
matter present on the fur around the left and right eye. The dog also has areas of matted fur around the base of the
tail, legs and neck.
Matted hair on the dog can cause discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture. It can affect the skin and lead to
infections and other health problems. The licensee must remove all matted hair. Additionally, the licensee must
establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all dogs to prevent the development of excessive
matting.
Abnormal hair loss and skin problems can indicate poor health or nutrition or injury/trauma to the animal. The dog’s
abnormal health condition has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.
A fawn colored, adult, female Mini-Bulldog (ID# 00723C1A6) has two open wounds on its back above the left
shoulder area. The larger wound is circular in shape and approximately the size of a silver dollar. The smaller
wound is approximately the size of a quarter. Both are mostly hairless, reddened and moist.
The facility representative stated that he was unaware of the wounds and they were not currently being treated.
Open wounds can be painful and lead to infections.
The dogs listed above must be examined by a veterinarian and appropriate diagnosis and treatment administrated
and documented. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments and must
be made available to the inspector upon request.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative. *The eight year old, tri-colored female Beagle (ID# 057571894) listed under 2.40(b)(2) on the November 3, 2016
inspection report received veterinary care. This non-compliant item has been corrected.
