3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures. There is a buidup of dirt and grime on the back side of the wire
enclosures and on the rear support metal frames for the guinea pig breeders. The lower four enclosures on eight
racks have this buildup of dirt and grime affecting 241 adult guinea pigs and their offspring. Inadequate cleaning and
sanitation exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacteria, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary
enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, dirt and grime and must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean to prevent an
accumulation of dirt and grime and that enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
