ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1500 on
06/01/2016.
Upon arrival I called the licensee and left a message and waited 30 min. The licensee called later to update me on
current hours of operation.
This was the first attempted inspection.
