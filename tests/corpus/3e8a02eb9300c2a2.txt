SANITATION.
(c) Housekeeping.
***** At time of inspection the food preperation building interior walls were wood covered. This wood needs to be
sealed, painted or covered with a material which will allow for these surfaces to be impervious to moisture. This
wood currently allows for fluids from food prep and from cleaning to be absorbed by the wood which can lead to
contamination of the food being prepared for the animals, and allows for disease causing bacteria to grow which
can put the animals health and well-being at risk.The wood which needs to be sealed, painted or covered with a material to make it impervious to moisture is located
over the two compartment stainless steel sink, the walls in contact with the food prep stainless steel tables and the
wall directly behind the rack that is used for storage of the cleaned and sanitized food bowls and items used in the
daily preperation of food items.
***** The ceiling in the food preperation building is sheet rock which has been painted. The roof has been leaking in
three locations onto the interior and has caused areas in the interior to become discolored and for mildew or mold to
develope.
These roof leaks need to be repaired and the interior roof repaired or replaced in these areas to prevent this area
for mildew or mold growth to continue.
***** At time of inspection the stainless steel rack which is used to store items such as food bowls and utensils used
for food preperation for the animals at the zoo has shelves which have rusted and need to be repaired or replaced
to prevent contamination of the sanitized items being stored here.
***** At time of inspection the food preperation tables have lower storage shelves which holds canned food items
and items used in the preperation of food. These shelves need to have the stored items removed and a complete
cleaning and sanitizing needs to be conducted. These shelves should be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis
as part of the husbandry practices for this food preperation building.
