ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Six adult dogs had excessive matting of their hair coat. There were clumps along the back and hips and
numerous twists of the hair along the sides, legs and ventral area. The owner had begun shaving some of the
dogs, however, the matted hair has been present for a period of time as indicated by the amount of matting and the
severity of it. Matted, twisted hair can pull at the skin and cause discomfort and possible injury to the skin. The
condition of the underlying skin under matted hair cannot be observed nor treated. Matted, twisted hair cannot
insulate the dog for protection from the sun and temperature. The owner must ensure that the matted hair is
removed. The owner must have a regular schedule of grooming to prevent matted hair.

(e) Storage
****Inside the whelp building was an unopened bag of dog food lying on the cement floor. Also in this area was
shaved hair, spilled food and other debris. Food that is stored in an area with dirt, debris and other contaminants
could become contaminated and lose nutritional value. The owner must store food in a manner that protects the
supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away
from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Foods requiring refrigeration must be stored
accordingly, and all food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritivevalue.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS DAY FORWARD
