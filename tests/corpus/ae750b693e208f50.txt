HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The back wall for 14 enclosures on the north and south side of the Main Kennel had an accumulation of brown
grime, grey dirt and cob webs. One dog door and four dog door frames for the north and south side of the Main
Kennel had an accumulation of brown grime. 12 vinyl coated wire dividers on the south side of the Main Kennel had
an accumulation of brown grime, grey dirt and cob webs. Surfaces not spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often
enough can increase the disease hazards for the 42 adult dogs housed in these enclosures.
All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often for the prevention of disease hazards and
accumulation of waste on the surfaces.
To be corrected by, 12-October-2016.
