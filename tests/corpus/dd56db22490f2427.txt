2.132(d) REPEAT
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
Upon inspection of the records from the Feb. 2-3, 2018 and Dec. 1-2, 2017 auction sales, there were several
animals that were accepted for consignment from individuals without a valid USDA license. For example, the
following consignments for the December 2017 auction were from four unlicensed individuals: One porcupine and
12 hedge hogs (#9190; 9162-9173); 53 hedge hogs and 7 guinea pigs (#9236-9251, 9254; 9260-9262); one female
porcupine (#9148); one neutered male raccoon, a red fox, a pair of silver/marble fox, and a female coatimundi
(#9256, 9257, 9258, 9258). During the February 2018 auction a ring-tail lemur (#4020) was consigned from an
unlicensed individual. No official one-time exemption forms were included in the auction files provided to the
inspector or in the Animal Care Information System. In order for APHIS Officials to track animal movement,
investigate disease outbreaks, and to prevent illegal movement the person consigning the regulated animals to the
auction sale must have a valid USDA License. The auction must not obtain an animal from any person who is
required to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.
This was a records-only inspection conducted on April 5, 2018 at the Gulf Coast Auction in Madison, FL. Records
from the December 2017 and the February 2018 auctions were inspected.
The exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
