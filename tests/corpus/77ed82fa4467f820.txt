2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female, black German Shepherd puppy has a creamy discharge around the area of the right eye. The right eye is
closed and the condition of the eyeball could not be assessed. The left eye is open and normal. Eye problems can
be caused by trauma, infection, birth defects, as well as other medical problems and can be painful. This puppy
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and
resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Dogs in the northwest enclosure of the long sheltered building have pushed out one section of the enclosure panel
and are digging in the dirt on the outside of their concrete run. This is creating a gap between the fence and the
concrete slab that could trap a dog or dog part causing injury. All enclosures must be designed and constructed in
a manner that securely contains the dogs and protects them from injury. Correct by 13 March 2017.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The feet of one litter of three puppies housed on elevated mesh flooring are too small for the openings of the
flooring material. The legs and feet of these puppies were observed falling through these openings a few times
during the inspection. This could cause injury to the puppies. The flooring material must be constructed in a
manner that does not allow the animals' feet to pass through the openings.
3.6(c)(1)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
This is a litter of 9 nursing puppies that are confined a smaller elevated portion of the primary enclosure that does
not provide them with adequate space. This elevated sub-enclosure also contains the food and water receptacles.
Lack of space does not allow the puppies the move about freely and exhibit normal postural and social adjustments. These puppies must be provided with additional space. Correct by 8 March 2017.
