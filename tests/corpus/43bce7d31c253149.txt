FEEDING.
A seven year old, neutered male, Leopard, Nileca, was found to be obese with a sagging abdomen and obvious fat
over his hips, ribcage, and shoulders. Obesity can have a negative impact on the animal's joints as well as general
health and well-being. The licensee does have a general, written diet plan for Leopards approved by the attending
veterinarian. Animal diets should be prepared appropriate to the species, age, condition, and needs of the particular
animal. The licensee should consult with the attending veterinarian, and other specialists as needed, in order to rule
out any underlying medical issues, and to put into effect and follow a weight loss and weight maintenance program
for this animal.
Initial plan and evaluation to be completed and initiated by 10/15/2015.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representative.
