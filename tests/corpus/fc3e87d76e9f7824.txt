ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A seven year old black and tan Silky Terrier female (ID# 58) right and left eyes had an accumulation of green
mucus. The green mucus in the right eye was dry, crusty in appearance and cover approximately half of the eye’s
surface. The green mucus in the left eye covered approximately ¼ of the eye’s surface. The part of the right eye
that was visible was dark to grey in color. The grey color area was in the center of the eye. There was hair loss
around both eyes. Some of the hair around the area of hair loss had a buildup of dry green discharge in the hair
follicles.
The licensee stated that the she has always had green mucus in her eyes on and off. The licensee show a tube of
“Triple Antibiotic” used for treatment. When asked how often the dog was treated, the licensee replied, not very
much. I called the Attending Veterinarian (AV) to validate the treatment for the eyes of this dog, and the (A.V.)
stated the dog must be seen for proper diagnosis.
The condition of the eye can be due to infections, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be
painful.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian about the condition of the eyes to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that
all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
