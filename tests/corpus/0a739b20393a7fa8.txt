2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Ms. Jack is currently exhibiting 4 dogs, six days a week, for the last 7 weeks at a local show. Ms. Jack previously
started the pre license process in 2004 in New York but never completed it, and her application was subsequently
cancelled. She therefore knew that she needed a USDA license to exhibit regulated animals at that time before she
started to exhibit in Orlando, FL
You may not exhibit any regulated animals without a USDA license. The Raleigh Regional Office will be sending
you a pre license packet. When you receive it, please complete the application for license and submit it to the
Raleigh Regional Office with a $10.00 application fee to begin the licensure procedure.
The procedure for obtaining a USDA license was discussed during this visit.
