2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility uses a veterinarian under consulting arrangements to provide veterinary care for the animals. The facility
manager stated they are no longer utilizing the veterinarian on the written program of veterinary care dated
3/16/2016 given to the inspector for review. The written program of veterinary care needs to be updated and signed
by the current attending veterinary being utilized by the facility. There is no written guidance from the current
attending veterinarian to provide preventative care or treatment for routine and common veterinary problems. In
order to ensure problems of animal health are addressed adequately, a written program of veterinary care should
include the species housed and used in regulated activities, what common health problems they may have and how
these will be addressed (i.e. by the licensee or the attending veterinarian (AV)). If the facility is to provide veterinary
care to the animals for common health problems, how this will be identified, what treatment will be provided
(medication, dose, route, frequency, duration), and, if not resolved by that treatment, that the AV will be contacted
for further guidance
Each dealer shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care
and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer.
