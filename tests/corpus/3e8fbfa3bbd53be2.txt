3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The metal water bottle holders in several enclosures are still rusted and still have jagged, sharp points. The sharp
points are an injury risk to the animals within the enclosure. Additionally, the holders are no longer impervious to
moisture due to excessive rusting which prevents proper sanitization. A system should be
in place to ensure primary enclosures, including accessories, are maintained in good repair to protect the animals
and shall be constructed of smooth material that's substantially impervious to liquids and moisture.
3.28(c)(2)(ii) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The interior height of the primary enclosures housing dwarf hamsters (weanlings and breeding groups) is still 5
inches and still does not meet the requirements of at least 6 inches. Insufficient interior height of the primary
enclosure does not allow the animals to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. A
system should be in place and maintained to ensure this requirement is met.
3.28(c)(2)(iv) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The facility is still housing nursing female hamsters in the same primary enclosure with other hamsters. In several
enclosures, the Veterinary Medical Officers (VMOs) noted 1 male hamster with 2 nursing females and their offspring
of varying ages. In several other enclosures, the VMOs noted 1 male with 1 nursing female and her offspring.
Overcrowding of pregnant and nursing female hamsters can increase stress to the dam and result in increased
rates of cannibalism of the offspring and fighting. A system should be in place to ensure nursing female hamsters
with her litter shall be housed in an enclosure that contains no other hamsters and provides the required amount of
floor space.
Although the non-compliances noted above were cited as repeats at the new facility site, the licensee and business
operation remain the same. (Previous facility site has been cancelled).This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
