HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***An interview with staff revealed that on Sunday April 13, 2014 the attendant was working both the pony rides and
the petting zoo at the same time. She explained that the public was allowed to come in and out of the petting zoo
interacting with the animals while she was actively leading multiple ponies on the pony rides. A responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact to prevent injuries to the animals and/or the public. Correct from this day forward.

or that affects the structural strength of the surface. This was corrected prior to the exit interview.
***In the siamangs' primary enclosure the top cross beams were rusted. The siamangs were observed swinging
close to the rusted beams. Any surfaces that come in contact with nonhuman primates must be free of excessive
rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
