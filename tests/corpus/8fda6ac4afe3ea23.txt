treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
* There is a bottle of (cid:28)Pyrantel Pomoate(cid:29) dewormer, (cid:28)Nitrofurazone Sab(cid:29) and a bottle of (cid:28)Albon(cid:29) with no directions for
appropriate use from the attending veterinarian. These medications were found intermingled with other medications
in the refrigerator and medicine storage area and are therefore considered ready for use. Lack of approved
instructions can lead to misuse of a medication. The licensee must ensure that all medications are used in a manner
consistent with the provision of adequate veterinary care to protect the health of the animals and ensure drugs are
used in an appropriate manner. All medications must be labeled and administered properly as part of the facility(cid:25)s
programs of adequate veterinary care.
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date: nitrofurazone (cid:19) August 04, pyrantel pamoate (cid:19)
Mar 2014, Albon (cid:19) no expiration date and 6 vials of NeoVac DA2 (cid:19) 24-Feb-2014. These medications wereintermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Expired
drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. The licensee must
ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled properly in accordance with standard
veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Sec. 2.50 Time and method of identification. (a) (1) Identification.
* Two adult dogs were not identified with a tag, tattoo or microchip. The owner made an immediate correction and

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (a) Structure; construction.
* The plastic flooring for the three west end enclosures, in the main kennel, was sagging. This sagging was more
pronounced as the dogs walked on the flooring. The sagging flooring was causing an approximately 2 to 3 inch gap
between where the flooring and two panel dividers meet. These gaps were approximately ½ to 1 foot long. These
two gaps allowed access for dogs to fight with dogs in the next enclosure or get their feet and legs stuck. The six
adult dogs in the enclosure could possibly be injured from the fighting or from getting their feet or legs stuck. All
housing facilities, such as sagging flooring, must be structurally sound and kept in good repair. This will protect the
dogs from escaping or fighting with the dogs in the next enclosure.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces. (2) Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.

* The concrete flooring for three outdoor enclosures, housing six adult dogs, has an accumulation of brown waste
on the surface. Some of the brown stained areas are moist. The surface of the concrete is rough. There are
cracks in the concrete approximately 1 foot to 3 foot long and ¼ inch to ½ inch wide. The worn concrete surfaces
and cracks do not allow for proper cleaning and sanitation. The brown moist waste on the surface indicates the
concrete is not properly sealed. Concrete surfaces that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can increase the
disease potential. The concrete surface is in need of treatment and repair. All surfaces must be maintained on a
regular basis. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization. Thus, the disease potential is reduced for the
dogs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces(3) Cleaning.
* The outdoor enclosures, housing six adult dogs, have an excessive accumulation of fecal waste and brown waste
on the concrete flooring. This accumulation of waste indicates daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. The
accumulation of waste can increase disease hazards. The concrete flooring must be spot cleaning daily and
sanitized when necessary. Daily spot cleaning and sanitization will decrease disease hazards for the dogs.

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (f) Drainage and waste disposal.
* The drainage system in front of the outdoor enclosures, housing six adult dogs, has an accumulation of fecal
waste. There were numerous insects on and around the waste. This can increase the disease potential for the
dogs. Housing facility operators must provide regular and frequent collection, or removal, of dog and food waste in
a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest
infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. This will minimize the insects and decrease the disease risks forthe dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. (c) Housekeeping for premises.
* Inside the main kennel, housing 23 adult dogs and four puppies, there is an accumulation of dog hair and cobwebs
on the floor and hanging from the gates of the enclosures. There was dog hair hanging from the feeders. This can
attract rodents, pests and other vermin. The dogs and puppies health and well-being can be affected. Premises
and housing facilities must be kept clean. This will reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and
other pests and vermin. The health and well-being of the dogs and puppies will be protected from premises and
housing facilities that are kept clean.
