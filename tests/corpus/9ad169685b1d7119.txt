Facilities, outdoor.
Two sheltered enclosures were not enclosed by a perimeter fence. One sheltered enclosure housed one adult male and
one adult female serval cat, and the other sheltered enclosure housed one adult male and one adult female Mountain
Coati. The enclosures included an indoor area in a barn, and an outdoor area constructed of wood and wire panels with a
covered roof. There was no perimeter fence around the enclosures.
A perimeter fence protects animals from contact with unauthorized people and animals, and acts as a secondary
containment system in the event an animal escapes from its primary enclosure.
Correct by May 31st, 2021 by installing a perimeter fence of sufficient height to keep unauthorized people and animals
out, and to act as a secondary containment system for animals within the facility.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
