Facilities, general.
The pasture housing 1 alpaca, 1 llama, and 3 miniature donkeys has a 3-sided shelter that have detached sides. The
right-side panel is completely detached from the roof and right support pole and is swung open. The left-side panel is
detached from the left support pole and the bottom portion is pulled outward. There are also gaps in the left-side panels
due to the wear on the wood. Shelters must be constructed in a manner that protects the animals from injury and that will
prevent discomfort from the elements. The shelter must be repaired or replaced to prevent injury and to adequately
protect the animals from inclement weather. Correct by April 24, 2021.

Sanitation.
The pasture housing 1 alpaca, 1 llama, and 3 miniature donkeys is excessively soiled with straw, dirt, and feces. There is
a buildup of feces, straw, and dirt in the shelter that prevents the hanging toy from swinging as it is intended. Excreta and
debris should be removed from enclosures at a frequency that prevents excessive build-up. The soiled enclosure is a
disease hazard for the animals. The debris and excreta must be removed to prevent contamination and to minimize
disease. Additionally, an appropriate cleaning schedule for the enclosure should be established to prevent the enclosure
from becoming excessively soiled. Correct by April 11, 2021
