2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Licensing Requirements.
**The individual identified above operates a mobile petting zoo business ("Animal Affair") that advertises using
species of animals regulated by the Animal Welfare Act (specifically rabbits, pigs, sheep, and goats) but this
business does not have a valid USDA Class "C" exhibitor license. According to information posted on both the
business website and Facebook page, “It’s the zoo that comes to you” and is available for birthday parties, day
cares, schools, libraries, and other events.
This SEARCH inspection was a FOCUSED inspection to verify the conduction of un-licensed AWA Regulated
Activity at a public event that took place in Bridgewater, MA. The public event was advertised as a program for
children where they would meet the animals. The APHIS inspectors observed 3 goats, 4 rabbits, and some
domestic species of poultry inside an area enclosed by portable fencing that had been set-up where the children
would have supervised interaction with the animals. A representative from “Animal Affair” was present with the
animals inside the enclosed area.
“Animal Affair” had been licensed with USDA as a Class “C” exhibitor 8 years ago then ceased all activities so the
license was not renewed. The mobile petting zoo business was re-started several years later but an application for
another license was not requested until April 2016. A total of 3 application packets have been sent by the Raleigh
Office since April 2016, but to date an application for licensure has not been returned for processing.
Per this Section of the Regulations, any person operating or intending to operate as an exhibitor must have a valid
license with the USDA. The possession of a valid USDA license demonstrates that the premises, vehicles,
equipment, and the care of the animals comply with the Regulations and Standards as set forth in the AWA to
ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
An application for a license should be submitted to the Regional Director that contains all of the information
requested on the application form including a valid mailing address through which the applicant can be reached at
all times, and a valid premises address where animals, animal facilities, equipment, and records may be inspectedfor compliance.
No further USDA regulated activities should be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.
NOTE - Exit briefing held on-site 7/19/17 with the "Animal Affair" representative and a second exit briefing was held
by telephone on 7/20/17 with the owner. Inspection report delivered by e-mail 7/21/17.
