2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:00 pm on
03-Apr-18. I called the contact number provided by the licensee, knocked on the facility door, honked the vehicle
horn, and waited in the driveway for 30 minutes in attempts to contact the licensee. All attempts were unsuccessful.
A responsible person must be available to accompany inspection.
