2.126(b) Repeat

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30-11:30am on
22-DEC-21. I arrived at the facility at 10:30am and parked in front of the gate. I pressed the button on the call box, but
there was no response. I called the licensee and left messages at 10:32, 10:52, and 11:30. There were no replies to the
calls or honking the car horn or using the call box. I left a leave-behind flyer in the gate and left the facility at 11:30am.
