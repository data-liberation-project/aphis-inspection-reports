2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** A white female Bichon with no id, was circling in the outside portion of her enclosure for an extended period of time,
each time she came outside. The licensee stated that he had noticed she started this behavior but did not recognize it as
an abnormal behavior and had not communicated it to the veterinarian. This is a young dog housed alone in an enclosure
which could contribute to the abnormal behavior pattern, or this could be an indicator of an underlying health issue. The
licensee needs to communicate this behavior with the vet and have this dog assessed for her health and well being.

*** A cavalier male id #602620026 has a small round mass on the left hip just under the skin. The licensee did not notice
this until it was pointed out by the inspector. Daily observations must be done and issues of concern communicated to the
vet in a timely manner so the vet can determine next steps for diagnosis and treatment.

Daily observations can be performed by the licensee but the licensee must also be able to recognize signs of ill health
through behaviors so that this information can be accurately relayed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner.

Primary enclosures.
*** A wire mesh panel on the outside door of a Cavalier enclosure is only secured in one spot to the wood frame. This has
created a gap on either side of the door that allows the dog to get an appendage out of and could cause potential injury.

*** There is a wire mesh top over the last outdoor enclosure on the back side of the kennel that ends half way over the
enclosure. The end of the mesh has several areas of broken wire that are protruding into the enclosure and could cause
potential injury to the dogs.

*** There are several sections of wood inside the shelter boxes that are heavily worn through chewing or scratching
directly over the feeders. These areas no longer enable the surfaces to be readily cleaned and sanitized and are not in
good repair.

*** Several sections of the plastic paneling over the wood in a few boxes are in disrepair and are cracked and chewed
causing sharp points and exposing surfaces that cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized.

*** A green plastic crate in the female bichon’s enclosure that was circling is cracked on the top with a hole in the middle
and has sharp edges that could potentially cause injury. This crate should be removed and replaced for her safety.

Enclosures must be maintained in good repair so that they are structurally sound for the safety of the dogs and to facilitate
husbandry practices.

3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*** The shelter boxes in the main kennel have an excessive amount of old food around the box and there is evidence of
mold growing on some of the food. Food waste must be removed from the primary enclosure daily to keep the enclosure
clean and for the health of the dogs.

3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*** There is a layer of grime on multiple shift doors that needs to be cleaned. Several of the enclosures have buckets or
crates in the sheltered area of the enclosure which are dirty with an accumulation of dust and debris on the items.

These items and the enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks or as often as necessary to
prevent this accumulation of dirt, debris and food waste to prevent disease hazards and for the health of the dogs.
