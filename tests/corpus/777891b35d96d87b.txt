FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** Currently the tenrecs are being housed in a room with high heat and humidity suitable for reptiles and
amphibians. There is no ventilation in the room when the door is kept closed. Tenrecs have a preference for dry
and cooler climates particularly when going into torpor. Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated to
provide for the health and to prevent discomfort of the animals at all times.

*** The sugar glider enclosures in the back room need to be cleaned. There is accumulation of food debris and
grime along the frame of the enclosures, along the wire sides and the exercise wheels. The buildup is an attractant

of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and eliminate odors.
