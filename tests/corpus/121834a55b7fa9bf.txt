2.40(a)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility’s attending veterinarian’s recommendations regarding the provision of adequate veterinary care and other
aspects of animal care and use have been repeatedly disregarded or dismissed over the last year. Events of particular
concern are addressed as follows:
On the 15th of May 2021, Squirt, a 11-year old female Bottlenose dolphin, had a sudden decrease in appetite for 2 days
prior to the onset of construction and repair (coping) to her pool. From correspondence on June 9th, 2021 referring to an
animal welfare discussion between the AV, associate veterinarian, Facility Curator and Training Curator, the Attending
Veterinarian expressed concern for the dolphin’s poor appetite and requested a blood sample on this animal. The
associate veterinarian stated her concern to the General Manager regarding the trainers’ repeated denial that Squirt was
ill. She stated her concern for the trainers not appreciating or acknowledging the associate veterinarian’s concern for
Squirt on at least 6 occasions over 10 days. Per the medical record, Squirt’s base intake was decreased over a period of
10 days beginning May 15th, 2021. Once blood was finally obtained the 24th of May, the bloodwork was abnormal. The
veterinarians expressed concern that the construction and frequent lowering of the water could have adverse health
effects on animals in the Dolphin Harbor pool. The veterinarians recommended that pool repair, which required pneumatic
nail guns, be delayed in order to decrease stress to the animal. Both veterinarians recommended that Squirt be moved in


with a female-only group and away from a male currently housed with her to reduce stress. However, the Facility Curator
and Training Curator stated that this was not possible, and repairs continued. Alternatively, both veterinarians
recommended Squirt and an additional female be moved to a different pool away from the construction and male dolphin
to reduce stress on Squirt. The animal wasn’t moved into an all-female group until the 16th of June 2021.
Toki, a 56-year-old whale, had been maintained on a fish diet of 160 pounds that was decreased to 130 pounds by the
Training Curator, over the objection of the Attending Veterinarian. The veterinary concern was that Toki historically has
seasonal abnormalities in blood work and behavior and her alkaline phosphatase was quite low (indicative of overall
health and nutrition status). The AV was also concerned that Toki wasn’t getting enough water (as marine mammals
extract water from fish for their hydration needs) and that the lack of food volume would cause her distress and agitation.
The AV also had concerns with the Training Curator dictating the incorporation of fast swims and big jumps into training
sessions and shows for this geriatric whale. Toki’s bloodwork was abnormal and the AV believed these behaviors could
result in over-exertion and Toki becoming winded, which was actually observed by both the senior trainer and the AV.
The AV also diagnosed that Toki had hit her lower jaw, likely at the lower flume/bulkhead during fast swims. Toki’s
medical records indicate an injury to her lower mandible on February 25th, March 10th, March 31st, April 6th and 7th of
2021. In a medical entry written on April 3rd, 2021, the AV directed the staff to not request head in entry jumps from Toki.
The Training Curator, who has been working at this facility for 6 months, disregarded the veterinary instructions for Toki to
restart bow jumps only and re-instituted head in entry jumps including speed runs and multiple high energy jumps.
The veterinarians did not approve of a planned move of two Pacific white sided dolphins into Toki’s pool and strongly
disagreed the plan should proceed due to Toki being medically and behaviorally challenged. The attending veterinarian
and associate veterinarian expressed concerns regarding this move during an animal welfare meeting on June 7th, 2021.
The Training Curator, General Manager, and Animal Care Curator were in attendance. Additionally, medical entries on


June 7th, 2021 in Toki’s record document the AV’s concern regarding the lag move. Chasing, white water and aggression
between Lii and Catalina, two Pacific white sided dolphins, and Toki had been observed and was of concern as the two
dolphins being moved into the whale pool were a mom (38-year-old Loke) and 3-year old naïve calf (Elelo). In the
presence of the USDA inspectors, the GM, Facility Curator, Training Curator and Whale & Dolphin Harbor Supervisor, the
veterinarians expressed concern in opposition to this lag move. Despite the veterinarian’s objections, the plan was to
proceed the week of the USDA inspection but has since been postponed.
The Attending Veterinarian disagreed with the Training Curator decreasing 38-year-old male Pacific white sided dolphin
Lii’s dietary food intake from 15 pounds to 9 pounds. The AV was concerned that decreasing his food base lowered his
water intake and negatively affected hydration status. This had the potential to negatively impact Lii’s health. After a
discussion, the AV agreed to decrease his base intake to 11 pounds as a compromise.
The Facility Curator & Training Curator were communicating with a consulting veterinarian about changes to Toki's diet
without including the AV in the conversation. On March 11th, they contacted the consulting AV in order to justify the
continual decreases to Tokitae’s food base. Additionally, the Training Curator wanted to reduce her portion of salmon and
feed Toki salmon chunks and guts. Medical entries on February 24th, March 30th & 31st, April 2nd, May 12th & 27th and
June 2nd in Tokitae’s record document the AV’s notation that Toki’s base was too low. Documentation provided by the
facility confirms a downward trend in Toki’s base beginning January 2021 of approximately 160.7lbs and continuing
through June 2021 to 132.1lbs despite the AV repeatedly voicing her concerns. The Facility Curator and Training Curator
communicated with a different consulting veterinarian concerning the poor-quality capelin issue without discussing with
the AV who was onsite within the park when the conversation occurred. On March 3rd, 2021, the AV requested that the
bad capelin be withheld, and the Facility Curator said that it would. Two days later, the AV discovered that a consulting
veterinarian had been contacted without her knowledge and that he had agreed with Facility Curators that the bad capelin


could be fed after soaking in cold water. After this realization, the AV had a verbal conversation with the Facility Curator to
stop feeding the capelin until a new lot could be acquired. The morning diets had already been fed that day. March 6th,
2021 was the first full day with no capelin fed out to the cetaceans.
The decisions to decrease Toki’s base and continue to feed poor quality capelin to park animals were subsequently made
without the AV's approval.
Failure to allow appropriate veterinary authority poses a risk to the health and welfare of the animals. The Attending
Veterinarian must have the appropriate authority to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided and that they have the
authority to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care.
***Correct from this day forward.
2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
The inspectors observed the killer whale and dolphin show. After the completion of the show, approximately 50-100
people immediately congregated around the pool and the inspectors observed that the facility’s public barrier is
ineffective. A small male child was lifted over the metal bar and placed on the ledge of the pool. Another small female
child was also observed being held over the metal barrier and onto the ledge. Several members of the public were
observed holding cellular phones and cameras beyond the edge of the ledge. Three identifiable attendants positioned
around the area were not effective in addressing members of the public in a swift manner; in fact, two attendants were
observed standing behind the public.
The barrier installed at Whale Stadium is currently a metal bar structure that extends approximately 20 inches out from
the ledge of the pool. Additionally, there is a yellow line painted on the ground that extends approximately 16 inches from
the edge of the cement wall of the pool. The facility employs at least three attendants that are tasked with handling
individuals of the public that are leaning over the bar or holding objects beyond the ledge; however, this was ineffective.


Insufficient public barriers do not adequately ensure the safety of the public or the animals. Foreign objects dropped into
the pool pose a hazard to the animals and may be ingested. Unauthorized contact between members of the public and
the animals pose a safety hazard to both the parties.

3.101(a)(1) Critical

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, several pools and surrounding structures had surfaces that were in disrepair.
A and B pools in the whale stadium had areas of concern. A section of pool laminate on one side of the slide out area on
the island was missing, revealing the cement underneath. Additionally, the blue paint along the top of both pool walls was
warped and flaking off in several areas. Large areas of drooping paint (water behind paint) were observed within the
interior of the pool approximately 12 inches below the top of the concrete pool ledge. The current condition of the pool
allows for the paint and chips/flakes to fall into the water or be physically removed by the whale or dolphins and be
potentially consumed by the cetaceans as they dislodge. A trainer reported that pieces of paint had been brought to the
trainer by the animals.
***Phase I (Slide out defect): Corrected prior to delivery of inspection report. Phase II (Pool Repairs): Correct by October
31st, 2021.
The ship structure above the pool at Top Deck had large areas where paint was flaking off. These areas are located
directly above the pool so that chips/flakes fall into the pool as they dislodge.
***Correct by August 31st, 2021.
The Dolphin Harbor pool has inadequate fencing separating the pools and groups of dolphins. Sections of the underwater
fencing are held together with plastic zip ties. On the morning of April 18th, 2021, trainers observed that two dolphins,
Cobalt and Zo had broken into the same pool containing Bimini and JJ. Bimini, a 21-year-old female bottlenose dolphin


with a chronic medical condition (collapsed trachea and a consistently high white blood cell count), was seriously injured.
The Attending Veterinarian examined Bimini using an infrared camera and noted areas of concern over her chest. A hit
from conspecifics that may have broken her ribs was suspected and the AV stabilized the critical dolphin. A radiologist
confirmed the presence of at least 4 broken ribs on the 8th of June 2021.
***Correct by September 30th, 2021.
The training pools behind Golden Dome Sea Lion had many areas of disrepair. Several sea lion and seal enclosures had
areas of enclosure fencing that had been temporarily repaired with plastic netting that had been zip-tied into the existing
chain-link fence. Areas along the upper pool walls of an enclosure housing two sea lions had flaking paint. Additionally, a
large cement column within the same enclosure had an area where the paint had been scraped off. In an enclosure
housing two seals, a painted doorway had an area of exposed wood that was slightly damaged that the animals had
access to. An entryway between the outdoor pool and indoor holding area for several seals had a section of damaged
wall. The rough concrete underneath the current wall covering is exposed.
***Phase I (Fencing Repairs): Correct by July 7th, 2021. Phase II (Pool Repairs): Correct by August 31st, 2021.
The cement flooring between Pompano pool #1 and Pompano pool #2 had an area of cracked cement surrounding a
drain. Pieces of cement were missing and some of the cracks led towards the pools themselves. Additionally, the blue
paint covering the ledges of the pool walls was warped and flaking off in several areas.
***Corrected prior to delivery of inspection report.
The inner pool wall of the Celebrity manatee exhibit had areas where the cement was damaged and exposed.
Additionally, there were areas where the paint covering the walls was flaking off. The inner section of the metal barrier
surrounding the manatee pool also had areas where the paint covering was flaking.
***Correct by July 31st, 2021.


Paint sloughing off the wall and flaking paint can cause a health risk to the animals if ingested. Defects on the coating
surface or missing chunks of concrete may cause injury to the animals through skin abrasions, lacerations, or other
means. Cracking or other structural defects in the pool may put animals at risk. Inadequate fencing separating animals
can result in serious injury or death to the animals by injury from conspecifics. Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for
marine mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to
contain the animals within the facility, and to restrict the entrance of unwanted animals.
3.101(a)(3)

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, several training pool enclosures housing sea lions had evidence of rust staining. For example,
an enclosure housing three sea lions had rust stains on the dry resting area and near drains within their pool. Rusted
surfaces cannot be appropriately sanitized.
All surfaces in a primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning, and
disinfection as appropriate. All facilities must implement a written protocol on cleaning, so surfaces do not constitute a
health hazard to animals.
***Correct by August 31st, 2021.
3.103(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
At the time of inspection, several marine mammal pools lacked sufficient shelter to protect the animals from direct
sunlight.
At the Dolphin Harbor enclosure, the only pool that is adequately shaded is “D” pool. A, B, C, Little D and Med Pool do not
have adequate sources of shelter to protect the dolphins from direct sunlight. Additionally, inspectors watched interactions
with the public in B pool without shelter to protect the animals. Many dolphins were looking directly into the sunlight during


training and interactions. A number of bottlenose dolphins have eye lesions including Zo, a 14-year-old male, Aries, a 19-
year-old male, JJ, a 40-year-old male and Sam, 35-year-old female.
***Phase I (Mobile Umbrellas for Training Sessions in A, B,C, & Med Pool): Corrected prior to delivery of inspection
report. Phase II (Permanent Shade Structures): Correct by October 31st, 2021.
At the Flipper Stadium enclosure, the pool adjacent to the mangroves has adequate natural shade. However, the major
lagoon where the dolphin show occurs twice daily does not provide shelter that protects the animals from direct sunlight.
Onyx, a 26-year old male bottlenose dolphin has bilateral eye lesions. Skye, a 23-year old female bottlenose dolphin was
previously being treated with eye drops. The shows currently take place at 11:00am EST and 3:00pm EST when the sun
is directly overhead. The 3:00pm EST show was observed by inspectors. During the show, trainers interacted with the
animals on a dock with the sun positioned behind them. The dock lacks shade and the animals were asked to hold their
heads above water and look into the sun to receive their signals from the trainers and their fish rewards.
***Corrected prior to the exit interview.
At the Whale Stadium enclosure, both A and B pools do not have adequate shelter to provide shade for the animals. The
stadium provides shade for the public; however, the structures do not extend far enough to provide shade for the animals
as well. The animals participate in two shows a day (12:40pm EST and 4:30pm EST) and various sessions with their
trainers throughout the day. On June 8th, the inspectors observed the 12:40pm EST show and stayed in the stadium until
a little after 2:30pm EST. On June 9th, an inspector observed Toki in her pool from 11:30am EST until 12:30pm EST. On
June 10th, an inspector observed life support staff taking water quality samples from Toki's pool from 4:00pm EST to
4:30pm EST. These observations throughout different times of the day confirm that the current structure does not provide
shade for the animals. Toki, a 56-year old female orca and Lii, a 38-year old male Pacific white sided dolphin both have
lesions in their right eye. Trainers interacted with the animals while the sun was located directly overhead.


***Correct by June 23rd, 2022.
At the Seal Feeder Pool, the platform where the public is allowed to interact with the animals lacks adequate shelter to
protect the animals from direct sunlight. Individuals participating in the feeding session walk down steps into the seal pool.
During the period of time when the sun is overhead on a cloudless day, the seals must look into the sun when interacting
with the public. The enclosure provides adequate shelter from the sun when the animals are not in interactive programs or
being fed by the public.
***Correct by July 15th, 2021.
At the Top Deck enclosure, the current structure does not provide adequate shelter from direct sunlight when the dolphins
are asked to perform shows. Currently, there are two shows at 10:40am EST and 2:20pm EST. During the shows, the
trainers interact with the dolphins from the elevated view atop a ship structure. The shade structures originally above and
behind the ship were damaged during a tropical storm and have yet to be replaced.
***Phase I: Corrected prior to delivery of inspection report. Phase II: Correct by October 31st, 2021.
Direct sunlight can adversely affect the animal’s health, especially eye health, resulting in corneal damage and premature
cataracts. Though lesions or damage may have initially occurred from chlorine or trauma, direct sunlight can cause further
damage to the eyes. These conditions are painful and uncomfortable for the animals and may result in extensive
treatment or require surgery to correct the problem.
Additional steps must be taken to provide enough shelter for marine mammals when they choose to seek shade, and
when they are asked to interact with the trainers or the public. Strategic shade should be provided whenever the animals
are holding their heads out of water and looking toward the sky. The facility must review shade for all marine mammal
enclosures and ensure that adequate shade/shelter is provided to protect the animals from direct sunlight.
3.105(a) Critical

Feeding.


Beginning February 25th, 2021, poor-quality “fragile soft-bellied” capelin that smelled bad was fed to the marine mammals
despite concerns from some of the trainers and the Attending Veterinarian. The capelin was fed for 8 days to the
cetaceans and 2-4 days to the pinnipeds. Several animals went off feed, and abnormal fecal samples were observed in
some of the animals. Medical entries made by the AV for Toki, a 56-year-old female whale, tracked the effects of the
poor-quality fish for her and other animals at the park. One week later Toki developed inflammation according to her
bloodwork (increased SAA). Medical entries made by the AV for Sam, a 35-year-old female dolphin, noted that antibiotic
treatments were given to prevent further sickness caused by feeding the poor-quality capelin. Onyx, a 21-year-old male
dolphin, developed erysipelothrix-like lesions while being fed this capelin.
During the inspection, the Facility Curator acknowledged that poor-quality capelin was fed to the animals.
Feeding poor-quality fish or partially decomposed fish is detrimental to the health of the animals and can result in illness,
compromised immune systems and even death. The food for marine mammals must be wholesome, free from
contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain marine mammals in a state of good health.
***Corrected before the inspection.
3.106(b)(3) Direct

Water quality.
The facility has an older life support system. The system siphons water from Biscayne Bay without being adequately
treated to prevent the overgrowth of algae, which can harbor potentially pathogenic organisms such as nematodes and
arthropods. The facility maintains an “open” system for the marine mammals in Dome and Flipper pools and a
recirculating system in the Harbor and Whale pools. The Pompano pools 1, 2 and 4 are part of the Dome open system.
Pompano 3 is a separate closed system that is chilled. The Golden Dome and Flipper pools housing 10 harbor seals, 14
California sea lions and 4 Bottlenose dolphins were observed to have inadequate circulation and water flow. The facility
previously had a designated water quality specialist who was responsible for overseeing and analyzing the water quality


in all the marine mammal pools . At the time of inspection, inspectors observed pinnipeds and cetaceans with chronic eye
conditions and/or skin conditions. The facility’s water quality records were reviewed going back to September 2018.
Chlorine in 55-gallon barrels is added into the water system using pumps that must be manually adjusted by life support
staff. Total and free chlorine readings were taken daily during 2020 until midsummer. Since that time, the staff continued
testing free chlorine daily but reduced total chlorine testing to once a week. Within the last week from the date of
inspection, the facility had increased the frequency of testing total chlorine to three times a week
(Sunday/Wednesday/Friday). An inspector shadowed the life support staff while they explained how and where each
water sample was taken from the many marine mammal pools. Inspectors found that the free chlorine ranges the life
support staff used to manually adjust the chlorine pump were different than those listed on the water quality records
provided for review by inspectors. There were several instances where the written water quality records had the total
chlorine values recorded as lower than the free chlorine from samples which were presumably taken at the same time.
This is inaccurate as total chlorine is the sum of free chlorine plus any combined chloramines in the system.
During the inspection of the Whale stadium, the inspectors noted that the water in A and B pool was very turbid and the
bottom of the pool could not be visualized. The animals were observed to be squinting while inspectors attempted to take
photographs of both eyes. The inspectors gained access to two of the lower viewing windows in a non-public area under
the whale stadium. The tank bottom could not be observed, and heavy particulate matter was suspended throughout the
water column. Upon review of medical records for the cetaceans in the stadium, a number of water quality concerns were
noted.
On April 26th, 2021, a pump broke under the whale stadium. Cloudy water and foam bubbles accumulated at the surface
of the pool. The back-up pump was left off during the night because of all the loud sounds and vibrations it made and
turned on during the day for cooling purposes until the pump could be repaired.


On April 28th, 2021, it was noted that the back-up pump was again turned off so as not to disturb the animals because of
increased noise and vibrations and again turned on during the day for cooling the water. Toki, the 56-year-old orca
appeared agitated during the day.
On April 30th, 2021, Toki had visible white lines in her eyes which were indicative of injury from chlorine.
On May 6th, 2021, it was noted that the chlorine setting in the nighttime was running at a high pump percentage level that
could negatively impact Toki's eyes at night.
A review of the water quality records for Flipper pool identified a spike in free chlorine measured at 1.620 PPM and a
spike in total chlorine measured at 1.160 PPM on March 3rd, 2020. A comment written by life support staff indicated that
the chlorine was turned off, and the chlorine pump and injector were replaced. The subsequent free chlorine readings for
Flipper pool then dropped lower than the facility’s own suggested range of 0.3-0.5PPM for approximately the next 27
days. For example, readings taken on March 7th, 9th, 10th, 14th, 17th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 24th, 27th, and April 9th showed
free chlorine measured at 0.00PPM or testing was not done at all. A conversation with the attending veterinarian identified
a correlation between the lack of chlorine added to the water for that time period and the rise of clinical signs in the
animals related to an increased algae and parasite load in the water. Trainers began reporting increased twitching,
chuffing and self-mutilation (rubbing, etc.) exhibited by the dolphins in the pool as well as other species (sea lions &
manatees) throughout the park. The attending veterinarian evaluated samples of the algae floating in Flipper pool and
observed several species of parasites – nematodes, arthropods, and other unidentified species. The Flipper pool recently
acquired a new UV filtration system, though the facility has not addressed the lack of circulation in the dead spots of the
lagoon area.
The Manatee Celebrity pool was also affected by the lack of chlorine and subsequent increase in parasite load. A review
of medical records for Camlee, an adult female West Indian Manatee, described a severe clinical presentation of diffuse


nematode larval migrans with a secondary bacterial infection. Skin biopsies showed nematodoiasis. Parasites that were
identified include arthropods (mites), copepods, and nematodes. The AV prescribed appropriate medications as well as
copper treatments to the water. Within 24 hours of the copper treatment, all three manatees began eating normally.
A review of the water records for the Golden Dome Pool show consistently high levels of free chlorine, especially within
the last 3 months of 2021. On June 1st and 3rd, the free chlorine was 1.0 PPM. On the 15th of May, the free chlorine was
1.0PPM. On the 16th of May, the reading was 0.94PPM. On the 18th and 20th of May, the readings were both 0.87PPM.
On the 22nd of May, the free chlorine was 1.0PPM. The free chlorine reading for the 29th of May was 0.82PPM. Going
back further, the free chlorine measured between 0.83 and 0.87 PPM on April 2nd, 3rd, and 5th. The Facility Curator and
life support staff stated that chlorine is intentionally added to the Golden Dome Show pool at higher levels since the water
from that pool “filters” back into the additional feeder and training pools for the seals and sea lions. Free chlorine levels in
these pools were observed to be 2-3 times lower than those of the show pool.
While the facility has consistently measured free chlorine levels in their pools, total chlorine testing is crucial because it
includes both free chlorine and chloramines. Chloramines are much more irritating to skin, eyes, and lungs than free
chlorine. The higher levels of free chlorine, and subsequently total chlorine, may be contributing to the skin and eye
problems seen at the facility. Industry standards for total chlorine levels are under 1PPM for marine mammals.
The facilities current method for measuring total chlorine is not a reliable method and may be giving lower readings than
actually observed. There were many instances where the total chlorine recorded was a value that was less than the free
chlorine taken at the same time. Furthermore, the manual method of adjusting the chlorine pump according to the free
chlorine levels is imprecise. Using a consistent and accurate method to measure total chlorines is required to accurately
assess the water quality for all marine mammal pools at the facility.
The water that is provided to the marine mammals has evidence of the presence of organisms such as nematodes,


arthropods, and other unidentified species that have caused discomfort, harm, or serious injury to the animals and have
the potential of causing more problems in the future. Providing resident animals with water free of pathogens or harmful
organisms is a critical factor in their well-being.

3.109 Critical

Separation.
There have been a number of serious injuries over the last several years, some involving death, from dolphin
conspecifics. When inspectors asked how the facility keeps track of which dolphin is with whom and which pools the
animals are placed at any given time, the Facility Curator indicated that they do not have a way of tracking which animals
are housed together on a particular day and said that animals are often rotated in and out of interactive sessions.
Gemini, a 7-year-old female bottlenose dolphin, sustained a hit to her head behind her blowhole by a conspecific in May
of 2021. Veterinary examination revealed crepitus in the area, and the infrared findings revealed a circular injury that
spread outward indicating a rostrum hit from a conspecific. Medical entries on May 21st and 22nd, 2021 describe poor
behavior and decreased appetite.
Sam, a 35-year-old female bottlenose, was seriously injured in the right eye from trauma to the head by a conspecific on
January 18th, 2021. She is now blind in that eye. Medical records on August 18th and September 7th, 2020 indicate
aggressive behavior was exhibited by Sam towards conspecifics and trainers. Numerous medical record entries beginning
on October 29th, 2020 indicate that Sam had an eye condition requiring medical treatment. On January 18th, 2021,
medical records indicate there was a white-water incident that indicated an altercation between animals. Immediately, it


was noted that Sam was bleeding from the same injured eye. She was subsequently moved on that date to the medical
pool.
Abaco, a 19-year-old male bottlenose dolphin, had been moved to a different pool due to inappetence on March 26,
2020. Following the move, the dolphin had made a full recovery. Two weeks later, on the 9th April 2020, he was found
dead on the bottom of the pool with scrapes and erosions around his rostrum. Though he drowned due to his rostrum
being stuck in the fence, he had acute rhabdomyolysis and hemorrhage indicative of trauma from a conspecific.
Indigo, 5-year-old male bottlenose dolphin, had no clinical signs prior to his death. There had been documented
interactions among two younger dolphins in the pool on March 30, 2020. Indigo was found dead at the bottom of the pool
the next day from acute trauma and pulmonary shock.
Echo, a 23-year-old male bottlenose dolphin, was documented to be involved in increased activity with another dolphin on
February 27, 2019. Physical examination revealed no external abnormalities. Four day later, on March 3, 2019, Echo
began swimming in a tight circle, stopped eating, began breathing rapidly and died. A necropsy revealed hemorrhage in
the neck and surrounding tissues, and his left rib torn was torn from its attachment. His death was due to trauma from a
conspecific.
Housing incompatible animals together can negatively impact their health and welfare and may cause serious injury and
even death. Marine mammals that are not compatible must not be housed in the same enclosure nor be housed near
other animals that cause them unreasonable stress, discomfort or interfere with their good health.
