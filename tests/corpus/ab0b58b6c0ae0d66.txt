TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Four adult dogs were noted during inspection to lack either a legible tatoo or acceptable identification tag. The
facility has decided to begin using tags, however has not placed tags on the dogs and has not assigned numbers to
each dog in the facility. Proper identification of each dog is important for tracking husbandry-related information for
each dog. Each adult dog at the facility must be identified and recorded in animal records as described in the
regulations.
