2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A Yorki identified as #103 "Butterfly" had matted fur along the her back. Matted fur pulls and separates from the
skin potentially causing pain and skin irritations and decreases the ability of the animal to regulate body
temperature. This dog should be groomed on a routine basis to prevent matted fur and for the comfort of the dog.
The dog was also observed with her tongue hanging out of mouth. On closer examination the dog was observed to
have no teeth. Under the mouth saliva was clumped into the fur. Lack of teeth can impact an animal’s ability to eat
normally and maintain appropriate body weight. Additionally the dog had a 1.5 inch irregular shaped mass under the
nipple region. This dog needs to be seen by the attending veterinarian in a timely manner to diagnose and provide
treatment options.
