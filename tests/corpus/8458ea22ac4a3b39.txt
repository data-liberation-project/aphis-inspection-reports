FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Bingo East enclosure housing 12 goats is a ribbed metal sheet attached to the left side of the fence near the
entrance. The metal sheet is bent with a sharp point protruding towards the animals. Failure to eliminate sharp
points in the enclosures could result in injury to the animals. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
