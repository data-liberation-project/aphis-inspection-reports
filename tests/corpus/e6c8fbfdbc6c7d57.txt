2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, female goat, Buttercup had an approximately 2cmX2cm raw, reddened, skin lesion located on the right
lower abdomen. There was a buildup of brownish, crusty material below the lesion with no active drainage
observed at time of inspection. The lesion was not noticed by the licensee or treated by the attending veterinarian.
During observation, this goat was active, eating, and did not actively attempt to rub or bother this area, and there
was no indication of pain, or parasites. Once the Inspector identified the condition of the goat, the licensee called
the attending veterinarian to schedule an examination. This goat should be evaluated by a veterinarian to assess
her health and to provide an appropriate treatment plan.
An improved system of evaluating and monitoring the animals must be in place to identify any health problems in a
timely manner. Continued care and rechecks as indicated on the veterinary records must be followed and
documented.

3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During inspection, the licensee informed the Inspector that the two Cavies acquired on 01-18-2017 had escaped
their primary enclosure about one hour after releasing them into the enclosure. The enclosure consisted of
approximately, 5 inch X6 inch spaced, wire field fencing and was approximately 8 feet in height. In the following
days the licensee noticed both Cavies in an open field outside of the facility and attempted to trap and recapture the
animals without success. The licensee stated that about one week after escape the remains of one Cavy was found
and one was still missing. An animal that escapes its enclosure can be preyed upon by wild animals outside of the facility. In addition this
species may not have the skill set to survive on its own outside of the facility. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures in the facility are of appropriate material, structurally sound and maintained in good repair to securely
contain all the animals.
Correct for all future inspections.
3.130
WATERING.
Water receptacles in the Camel pen and Zebra pen had a buildup of greenish-brown debris on the interior surfaces
of the receptacles. Additionally, the water was brownish colored. Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean
and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the animals are provided with clean, potable water, to minimize
disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate hydration. Water receptacles should be cleaned at a
frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
