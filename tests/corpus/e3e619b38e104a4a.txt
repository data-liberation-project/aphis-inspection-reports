are protruding into the first enclosure which could potentially injure the dogs. This section of wire needs to be
replaced for the safety of the dogs.
*** One wood beam in the 2nd to last enclosure in the main kennel area is coming down from the top mesh. This
beam needs to be replaced to keep the enclosure structurally sound and for the safety of the dogs.
