No covered animals present; no covered studies are in place or anticipated in the foreseeable future.
The definition of "animal" as covered by the Animal Welfare Act specifically excludes mice, rats, and birds bred for
research. (Animal Welfare Regulations Section 1.1)
If the only research underway or anticipated involves non-covered species, registration of this facility is not
necessary.
Discussed the facility's program and registration requirements with a facility representative.
