3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Upon entering the ferret building, there was one ferret loose on the ground that had escaped its enclosure. The
licensee retrieved the ferret and secured it safely. The wooden shelter box had shifted away from the enclosure
fencing leaving a gap that allowed the ferret to escape. The licensee addressed the issue by properly securing the
box to the enclosure during the inspection. Loose animals may result in harm, injury or death to the animal. Housing
facilities must be structurally sound to contain the animals and keep them protected from potential dangers.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
