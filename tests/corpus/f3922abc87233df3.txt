Facilities, general.
On the evening of October 13, 2021, 3 dwarf goats were predated and killed by a bear within their outdoor enclosure.
Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed that it was a bear and trapping attempts were made but unsuccessful. Following
the incident, the facility began keeping the animals inside the barn until welded wire sliding doors could be constructed for
the shelters in the outdoor pens. The goats and sheep at the facility are currently being housed in outdoor enclosures that
are surrounded by a 4-foot-high wood and wire fence and placed inside the updated shelters at night. No other deterrents
are being used at this time.
Failure to provide an enclosure that protects the animals from predation can lead to injury or death of the animals. The
outdoor housing facilities for the goats and other livestock must be structurally sound and constructed in a way that
protects the animals within from injury. A corrective plan with a reasonable timeline for completion must be developed and
initiated.
To be corrected by June 13th, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
