3.83 REPEAT
WATERING.
Multiple marmoset enclosures did not have clean drinking water available. The majority of water receptacles
contained dirty or cloudy water with debris and algae build up. Multiple kinkajou water containers were similarly
affected. Drinking dirty or contaminated water could cause illness in the animals. Water receptacles must be kept
clean and sanitized.
Records, the plan of veterinary care, and the primate environmental enhancement plan were not reviewed during
this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
