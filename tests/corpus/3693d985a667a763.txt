2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Two of the IACUC approved protocols for covered species have not been reviewed annually. The core guinea pig
protocol was approved on 11/17/14, with amendments for specific projects approved on 7/18/16 and 3/16/17, but no
annual review has been documented for this protocol. The core hamster protocol was approved on 3/23/15 with a
specific project amendment approved the same month, but no annual reviews have been documented for this
protocol. Facility shall ensure that reviews are appropriately done as determined by the IACUC, but not less than
annually for all covered species protocols.
Correct from this day forward.
Exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
