HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Currently a giraffe herd consisting of approximately 5 adult giraffes on the public viewing side of the exhibit is
contained by a wet/muddy moat surrounded by a ½ foot-wide cement wall. When constructed the moat was 5 feet
deep. Due to sedimentation, it may be approximately 3-4 feet in height now. The cement wall is flush on the public
viewing side and there is a 4 to 6 feet wide sloping grade on the animal side. There is a meandering adjacent
sidewalk available to the viewing public that is approximately 5-6 feet from the moat. A grass covered area
separates the public from the giraffe exhibit. During the inspection it was observed that 3 members of the public
walked onto this grass strip and approached the ½ foot-wide cement wall and stood on the wall surrounding the
moat. With the current design of the exhibit there is potential for contact between the public and the giraffe. During
public exhibition there must be sufficient distance and/or barriers between the public and the animals to assure the
safety of animals and the public. Correct by 14 August 2014

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lower metal square tubing of the threshold of the keeper's gate to the outside yard of the "new" colobus
enclosure is rusted. This rust has resulted in holes in the tubing and jagged edges that could injure the nonhuman
primates. All surfaces must be kept in good repair to be free from jagged edges. Correct by 16 August 2014.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On 10 July 2014 an unrestrained juvenile ring-tailed lemur was photographed perched on the head of an infant in a
car seat. This occurred in the lemur immersion exhibit in which the facility allows the public to have supervised
direct contact with the nonhuman primates. A facility representative stated that the facility protocol was not fully
followed on this date as this type of contact is not allowed. The car seat was part of a stroller, which is not allowed
into the exhibit per facility policy. The car seat portion containing the infant was removed and carried into the exhibit.The portable car seat, with baby toys attached, was placed on the ground. The attendant did not notice that the car
seat was on the ground or that the lemur was interacting with and sitting on the infant. This uncontrolled,
unsupervised interaction between the infant and the lemur resulted in risk of disease transmission, injury to the
public, and injury/stress of the animal. The facility must ensure that all nonhuman primates in public contact exhibits
are under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is
present. Correct by 14 August 2014.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
During a sample survey of approximately 30% of the perimeter fence along the south side of the park, numerous
holes/gaps between the lower edge of the fence and the ground were observed. These gaps ranged from 6"(cid:25)(cid:25) to
36"(cid:25)(cid:25) in size. There were also areas where the lower section of the fence was loose from the tension wire allowing
gaps. Also, there were 10 perimeter fence posts on the north side of the property, east of the entrance gate that
were leaning in which resulted in the fence sagging. Gaps and loose areas of fence may not keep other animals or
unauthorized persons out and facility animals contained in the event of an escape. The perimeter fence must be
constructed in a manner that restricts animals and unauthorized persons from going under it. All outdoor facilities
must be enclosed by a perimeter fence to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Correct by 16 August 2014.
