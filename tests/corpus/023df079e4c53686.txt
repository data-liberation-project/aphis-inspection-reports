ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult New Zealand White female rabbit located in pen number 525 has an area on the back of her neck that
demonstrates hair loss and portions of the denuded skin appears to be somewhat reddened and crusty. The animal
had not been observed by the care staff as needing attention, therefore the veterinarian was not contacted and no
care was provided to the animal.
A black adult female "B-9" rabbit singly housed in cage number B1 was found to have extensive hair loss on it's
face. There is no record of veterinary care having been provided for this animal.
Signs of hair loss and skin abnormalities in rabbits can be indicators of various disease conditions that can cause
discomfort, pain and distress in the animals.
These animals must be provided veterinary care in order to help assure proper diagnosis and treatment of any
conditions that may be contributing to the hair loss and or skin abnormalities present.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An approximately 5 week old New Zealand White rabbit housed in cage number 615 with it's mother and siblings
was found moribund,unresponsive to touch, laying on it's side. The inspectors requested that the licensee
immediately contact the attending veterinarian. The licensee removed the rabbit from the enclosure, isolated it and
contacted the attending veterinarian. However the rabbit died shortly thereafter. Licensee must assure there is
adequate daily observation of all animals in the facility in order to provide veterinary care when necessary.
Correct immediately.
3.50(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In building #2 the wire mesh on the bottom portion of the outer wall adjacent to the male breeder rabbit enclosures
is broken in numerous places creating gaps and holes in the mesh. The lack of structural strength of this enclosure
material does not allow it to adequately restrict the entrance of other animals into the rabbit facility and to prevent
the escape of any rabbit that may not be contained by it's primary enclosure. The owner must repair or replace the
damaged mesh in order to provide adequate protection for the rabbits in the building.
To be corrected by September 5, 2015.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A small number of cages in building # 2 are bowed up in the area adjacent to their attachment to the steel posts that
support them. This condition can potentially decrease the structural integrity of the cages and creates an uneven
surface for the rabbits to rest and move about on. The enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the
rabbits from injury, to contain them and to keep predators out. Owner must replace or repair these damaged
enclosures.
To be corrected by November 5, 2015.
3.54(b)
FEEDING.
A small number of feeders display caking of the feed along the walls of the containers and approximately 35% of the
feeders have excess rust present on them. Licensee has a schedule for cleaning out the feeders but not for
disinfecting and sanitizing them. Contaminated feed receptacles may contain disease causing organisms that may
affect the health and well being of the animals. Licensee must develop a schedule for disinfection and sanitization of
feeders at least once every two weeks.
To be corrected by October 5, 2015.
3.56(a)(3)
SANITATION.
Excessive amounts of animal excreta are present in the gutters underneath the rabbit cages in the facility,
especially in the smaller room in front portion of building #2. The presence of this waste material can harbor pests
and create unhealthy living conditions for the rabbits contained in the facility. Licensee must ensure there are
adequate measures in place to remove feces, urine and contaminated dirt and that the waste is properly dispose of
at least once each week.To be corrected by August 20, 2015.
3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
The owner has a schedule for scraping off the floor of the rabbit cages but no schedule for sanitizing them. Failure
to sanitize the primary enclosures may allow disease causing organisms to flourish and make the animals
susceptible to disease. Furthermore failure to sanitize may cause damage to skin and hair coats. Licensee must
establish a schedule to sanitize the cages at least every 30 days.
To be corrected by November 5, 2015.
3.56(d)
SANITATION.
Excessive numbers of insects were present in and around the rabbit facility, especially in the area of building
number 2 that houses the mothers and their offspring. The presence of insects such as flies aid in the transmission
of disease The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of insects associated with
the rabbit facility.
