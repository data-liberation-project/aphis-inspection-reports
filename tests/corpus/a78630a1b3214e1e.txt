ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-- The last recorded site visit by the attending veterinarian was in May of 2015. Good communication and
consultation between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form of a written program of veterinary care
and regularly scheduled visits to the premises are necessary for the health of the animals. The licensee must
schedule a site visit with the attending veterinarian affecting 26 dogs. The licensee must ensure that the program of
veterinary care is updated with current preventive practices to ensure that all animals are provided adequate
veterinary care. The program of veterinary care must be made available for review during inspections to ensure
adequate veterinary care is being provided.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-- "Monkey," a 10yr old male Chinese Crested had a thick, crusty, brown material covering his cheek teeth and
incisors. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth
and extending up into the gum line can be painful. It can impact the ability of the dog to eat, affecting the health and
well-being of the dog. Dental disease can be painful, lead to a decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered. The outcome of
this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that
all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
-- "Monkey" also had several abnormal masses of various sizes on his back and sides. The one on his back was the
largest mass measuring approximately a half inch in diameter. The attending veterinarian had not been contacted
and the dog had not been evaluated at the time of the inspection. These masses could continue to grow or become
open sores. A veterinarian needs to evaluate these masses to determine if treatment is required.

-There were two adult Dachshunds inside the primary enclosure that had toenails on the front feet that were very
long. Long toenails on the front two feet were estimated to be an inch in length. In addition, long toenails can
cause an alteration of gait, cause the animal pain and discomfort and can grow into the toe pad causing damage,lameness, and possible infection. Lack of toenail care on a regular basis can affect the health and well-being of that
dog.

2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
-- At the time of this inspection the Animal Care regional offices located in Ft. Collins, CO and Raleigh, NC had not
received an itinerary from the licensee prior to overnight travel. The lack of a required itinerary was also noted on
the inspection reports dated 01/05/2016, 06/21/2016, and 09/25/2015. The licensee didn't submit an itinerary for the
Santa Cruz County Fair in Watsonville, CA from Sept. 14-18 where Rockets K-9 Comets performed on 9/18/16 at
6pm and 230pm. The licensee also didn't submit an itinerary for the Fresno Spring Fair in Fresno, CA May 5-8th
2016 where the Fido 500 performed Thur-Fri 6 and 8pm and Sat-Sun 2,4,6, and 8pm. The licensee must submit an
itinerary to the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever the animals will be
exhibited at a location other than the approved site(s) and whenever travel extends overnight. The itinerary shall
contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of all animals intended for exhibition at any
location other than the approved site.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-- The inside of the 48ft travel trailer that housed 26 dogs and 2 people was filthy. The ammonia odor upon entering
the trailer was very strong. There was an excessive accumulation of hair and other debris surrounding all of the
kennels. The kennels themselves appeared not to have been thoroughly cleaned and sanitized in some time.
Inadequate cleaning of animal housing can increase the disease risks for those animals. Kennels and surrounding
housing must be cleaned and sanitized and contaminated material must be replaced often enough to prevent
accumulation of excreta, reduce disease hazards, and prevent odors and pests.
To be corrected by: 10/6/16.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
