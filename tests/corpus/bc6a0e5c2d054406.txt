Records
During the inspection the inspectors counted 23 adult dogs at the facility. According to the licensee(cid:25)s Dogs on Hand
Forms (APHIS 7005) the recorded number of dogs on hand is 11. The licensee needs to update his Dogs on Hand
form (APHIS 7005) to reflect the current number of dogs at the facility.
The licensee has recently downsized his adult dog population. According to the last full inspection conducted on 9
Feb 2015 there were 131 adult dogs. The licensee has provided the Record of Disposition of Dogs (APHIS 7006)
for 64 adult dogs. The disposition of 44 adult dogs is not known.
These forms must be used to maintain a current listing of the dogs at the facility and to facilitate the tracking of the
animals which leave the facility. The licensee needs to update his Dogs on Hand form (APHIS 7005) to accurately
reflect the animals currently at the facility. The licensee also needs to provide the Record of Disposition of Dogs
(APHIS 7006) for the missing 44 adult dogs.
