3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
Three primary enclosures each housing one dog has some wires protruding into the enclosure where the dogs come in
contact with the pointed ends of the wire. These pointed ends within the primary enclosure may cause painful injury to the
dogs. Remove/repair the loose protruding wire in the primary enclosures. Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.1(b)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility has extra uncleaned dog crates and supplies and some excess trash and equipment located throughout the
kennel. These extra items located within the kennel may produce biological hazards and hiding areas for pests. Remove
the excess items from the kennel so that only items necessary for the husbandry of the animals are located in the kennel.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The floor throughout the main kennel area and the grooming area has a residue of feed/excreta. Failing to completely
clean the floors of the main kennel and grooming areas may allow for biological hazards to form that may affect the health
and wellbeing of the animals. Eliminate the feed/excreta residue from the main kennel and grooming area floors and
maintain cleaned and sanitized main kennel and grooming area floors. Correct by: 10 December 2021.
