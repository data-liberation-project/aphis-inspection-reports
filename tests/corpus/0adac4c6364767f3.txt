3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Structure and protect the dogs from injury.
Inside the sheltered "Shih Tzu building", affecting 6 dogs, there is a 1 - 2 inch gap along the bottom of the wire
divider panel. The inspectors observed a dog from one enclosure extending both front legs into another enclosure.
This gap is large enough that the dogs could become injured or stuck. The licensee must repair this section of the
wire divider and ensure that all enclosures protect the dogs from injury.
The ceiling above two enclosures, affecting 4 dogs, on the west side of the sheltered building "A building" is partially
collapsed and is no longer structurally sound. A collapsed ceiling could injure the dogs. The licensee must repair
this section of the ceiling. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities for dogs must be designed and
constructed so that they are structurally sound and kept in good repair.
To be corrected by: February 24, 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
