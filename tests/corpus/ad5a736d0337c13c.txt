2.50(b)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* Six weaned dogs less than 16 weeks in age did not have official identification on them at time of inspection. The
dogs are being housed in sheltered housing. The licensee is using tags as the official identification. Official
identification is needed to ensure that each animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty, which helps to facilitate
the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all animals less than 16 weeks of age shall be identified by
an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo or a plastic-type collar acceptable to and approved by the
Administrator. Correct by 2/28/16.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* An excessive amount of excreta was accumulating on the flooring in four enclosures housing eight dogs. The
affected enclosure flooring is located in sheltered housing. This indicates unsanitary living condition exists that
could lead to potential disease or health risks. In addition, excessive excreta buildup reduces the available clean
surface area that the dogs have access to. The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from the primary
enclosure daily to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces, to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the
primary enclosures and to reduce diseased hazards, insects, pests and odors. Correct by 1/30/16.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 1/28/16 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
