Sanitation.
Throughout the hay storage shed, there were several fresh accumulations of avian feces on the floor. Upon entering the
building, approximately 10 pigeons were observed flying from the shed, and several broken eggshells were noted on the
floor. The facility stated that the two main doors to the shed remain open during the summer to allow for air circulation,
but there are no current pest control measures to deter the avian pests from entering the shed. Failure to maintain an
effective program to control avian pests can have a negative impact on the the health of the animals through the spread of
disease or contamination of animal areas and feed. The licensee must correct by implementing a safe and effective pest
control program in all food storage areas.
