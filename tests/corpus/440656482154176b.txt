ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:40 am on
15-Feb-18.
I arrived at the park and tried to make contact by phone. I waited in the parking lot for 45 minutes but did not receive
a call back so I left. An authorized person shall be made available to accompany on unannounced inspections.
