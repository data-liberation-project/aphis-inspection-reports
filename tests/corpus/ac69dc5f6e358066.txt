ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1000 am on
18-Aug-16.Contact was made with the 19 year old daughter of the licensee at the residence. As we were at the door
she contacted her parents, at which time she eventually walked away and came back stating she had to leave right
away to go to Springfield, Illinois to take over the 'calling out' for her father at their duck/dog race booth. When
asked if there would be any time to look quickly at the animals on the property, she advised she had to be there
before noon and was it over an hour drive, there was no time.
At this time we advised her that we do need to inspect the animals at the home facility, and that this will be an
attempted inspection. It should be noted that when we arrived at Springfield State Fair to inspect other vendors, the
daughter never did arrive, and the owners were conducting their business at the fair alone.
