Facilities, indoor.
In the indoor facility, Room 4 had windows on one end that shed light into approximately one fourth of the Sugar Glider
enclosures that were closest to the windows. There were lights on the ceiling that illuminated the top enclosures, yet the
bottom enclosures containing at least 20 Sugar Gliders, were dark. In Room 7, the ceiling lights were not working over the
back two rows of enclosures. This made the upper and lower enclosures of at least 34 Sugar Gliders and the fixtures
within the enclosures, impossible to inspect without extra lighting. Employees state that head lamps are used in dark
areas. Inspectors used flashlights in order to inspect these darkened areas.
Darkened areas within the facility, contribute to the possibility of failing to notice health issues with the animals, areas
needing cleaning or pest control issues.
The licensee must provide uniformly distributed and sufficient intensity lighting to these areas and ensure that all areas
are provided with appropriate lighting as required.

Facilities, indoor.
In Room 5, there was one drainage pipe at the end of the washdown that had standing water with food and other waste
material floating in the water.

Drainage systems that do not rapidly eliminate waste materials increase the risks of odors and the presence of pests that
can cause harm to the animals.
The licensee must repair this drain so that it rapidly removes excess water from the facility and ensure that all drains are
in proper working order as required.

Sanitation.
Throughout the indoor facility, there were at least six enclosures containing twelve Sugar Gliders that had brown and
black dried substances, appearing to be excreta and food, on the outer portion of the housing tubes. There were also at
least eight cages containing 17 Sugar Gliders in Room 4 that had hair and debris hanging from the bottom of the cages.
Excreta, hair and debris that is not removed from the primary enclosure increases the risks of illness to the animals by
attracting pests and providing a harboring place for the pests.
3.131(c) Direct

Sanitation.
Throughout the entire facility, mainly in Rooms 7 and 10, there were accumulations of dirt, grime, excreta, food waste,
pest waste and debris on washdowns, water pipes, drain pipes, racks and floors. Lack of cleaning in the buildings
increases the risks of illness to the animals by causing an unhealthy environment.
The licensee must ensure that all of the indoor facility are kept clean in accordance with prescribed husbandry practices
as required.

3.131(d) Direct Repeat

Sanitation.

Throughout the entire facility, roaches, mice, gnats and black worms were observed. Roaches were in the washdowns, in
the drain pipes and on the wire boxes that were attached to the back of the enclosures for support of the water line drain
pipe. One mouse was observed in Room 7 as it ran across the back of several enclosures and into a corner at the end of
the last enclosure. Another mouse was seen running behind the washdown in Room 5. Black worm were congregated in
several washdowns in wet areas. Gnats were observed at the back of the enclosures on the last three rows in Room 7.
There was ant poison and rodent poison on the floors.
Pests increase the risks of illness to the animals by being a vector of disease.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective pest control program as required.

Employees.
There were multiple non-compliant items during the inspection that directly affected the health and well being of the Sugar
Gliders. The facility had minimal employees as they have not been able to find personnel to work in the recent months.
The lack of employees and the large inventory of animals has created a situation to where adequate care is not being
provided for the Sugar Gliders.
The licensee must supply a sufficient number of adequately trained employees in order to meet compliance as required.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
