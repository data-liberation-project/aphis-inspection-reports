Watering.
The first 9 weanling enclosures in row 1, in house # 1, have a buildup of dirt and debris surrounding the water nipples and
holes the guinea pigs stick their heads out to drink. Failure to keep the water nipples clean and the area the guinea pigs
stick their heads out to drink can result in disease and health risks to the animals. Water receptacles must be sanitized
when dirty and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by November 2, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
