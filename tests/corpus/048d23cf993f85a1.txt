INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Report to the Institutional Official.
1. The IACUC did not update the reports to the Institutional Official at least once every six months as required per
this Section of the Regulations. The IACUC did complete the semi-annual reviews of the research facility's program
for humane care and use of animals and did complete the semi-annual inspections of the animal facilities on
10/15/13, 4/22/14, and 10/1/14. However, the IACUC has not prepared a report to the Institutional Official for any of
the semi-annual reviews that were completed on those 3 dates. The most recent semi-annual report prepared by
the IACUC that was submitted to the Institutional Official was dated 4/22/13 for the semi-annual evaluations
completed by the IACUC in April 2013.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall evaluate the program for humane care and use of animals and
inspect the animal facilities semi-annually and then submit a report to the Institutional Official. The reports shall be
updated at least once every six months upon completion of the required semi-annual evaluations and must contain
any minority views. In addition, the reports shall be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members and
shall be maintained by the research facility and made available to APHIS for inspection.
The IACUC needs to prepare reports for the semi-annual evaluations of the program for humane care and use of
animals and the semi-annual animal facility inspections that were conducted by the IACUC on 10/15/13, 4/22/14,
and 10/1/14 and the reports need to be submitted to the Institutional Official.
Correct by 4/10/15.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Continuing reviews of activities involving animals.
1. Pertaining to Protocol A-3: The IACUC did not conduct a continuing review of this animal use protocol at aninterval of at least annually as required per this Section. The protocol was initially reviewed and approved by the
IACUC on 1/16/13 and the next continuing review of the protocol was conducted by the IACUC on 4/22/14. This
represents an interval of 15 months between continuing reviews.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall conduct continuing reviews of animal use activities at
appropriate intervals as determined by the IACUC, but not less than annually. Regular continuing reviews of
approved animal use activities by the IACUC is important to ensure that all aspects of the animal use proposal
remain compliant with the requirements of the AWA Regulations.
