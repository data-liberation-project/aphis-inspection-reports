2.31(c)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
There were no reviews of the facility’s program of humane care and use of animals nor inspections of the facility’s animal
facilities since October 2020. There were also no other IACUC meeting minutes nor reports since October 2020.

It is essential that these reviews be completed on time in order to help ensure the humane care and use of animals at the
facility.

The IACUC’s activities must be conducted at least once every six months in order to ensure appropriate care and use of
research animals and to ensure facilities are compliant and appropriate for conducting animal research. This program
review and associated reports need to be made available to APHIS in order to help the inspector evaluate the program.

2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.


A male ten year old white, black and brown hound known as “Oliver” (ear number T1) was found with a moderate amount
of hard brown grey build-up and cream to tan colored spongy material at the gum line. The registrant had not identified
Oliver’s dental condition and therefore was not providing treatment. If left untreated, the abnormal build-up can cause
further damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. Dental conditions can become painful and may decrease the dog’s
ability to eat normally thus negatively impacting the overall health of the animal. There was also a hairless area on the
right hindlimb approximately 0.5 inches in diameter. Left untreated, this skin condition may worsen causing pain and
distress to the dog.

A ten year old white, black and brown hound known as “Baxter” (ear number T14) was seen with a hairless area
approximately 0.5 inches in diameter, on the left front limb, near the paw. The skin appeared moist and had a pinpoint red
spot. The skin surrounding the hairless region was brown in color. The registrant had not noticed and was not treating the
skin condition. Left untreated, this skin condition may worsen causing pain and distress to the dog. There was also hard
brown to grey build-up with receding gums. Dental conditions can become painful and may decrease the dog’s ability to
eat normally thus negatively impacting the overall health of the animal.

Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in animals with
conditions such as these listed here. A more complete method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in
order to assess their health, well-being and for timely communication with the attending veterinarian. The above described
dogs need to be evaluated by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
An open bag of dog food was not being kept in a lidded container in one of the animal areas.

Open supplies of food can be spoiled, contaminated, and/or infested with vermin, creating potentially hazardous situations
for dogs.

Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. All open supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination
and spoilage.

3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During the inspection, rodent droppings were observed in two food storage areas.

Rodent droppings and the presence of vermin can create a health hazard for animals at the facility.

An effective program for the control of mammals and other mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained
so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.

3.13

Veterinary care for dogs.
Records were not being kept current regarding identification of problems in animals alongside the dates and descriptions
of the problems, examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The
program of veterinary care does not include heartworm testing and fecal testing. A frequency to prevent and treat for un-
matted hair coats, overgrown toenails, eyes, ears, and teeth has not been listed and approved by the attending
veterinarian, and complete physical examinations were not being conducted not less than once every 12 months.

The lack of a complete program of veterinary care and lack of follow-through disallows assurance that the preventive care
and treatment is aligned with the veterinarian's authority and guidance. Not fully following the program of veterinary care
can create potentially negative medical situations for the dogs, such as the potential for diseases.

Each dealer, exhibitor, and research facility must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is
developed, documented in writing, and signed by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian must visit the
facility and examine each dog no less than every 12 months. Medical records for dogs must be kept, maintained, and
contain all veterinary requirements listed in 3.13. These include heartworm testing and results, fecal testing and results,
frequency to check and treat dogs hair coats, toenails, eyes, ears, skin and teeth. The records must also include the
veterinarians findings on the dogs’ annual exams, and all veterinary issues treated.
