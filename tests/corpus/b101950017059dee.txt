Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 pm on
19OCT2022.

Spoke to Mr. Lapp at facility. He couldn't accompany an inspection today as he is needed at work. Usually, his brother is
there to cover for him, but he is out of town. Mr. Lapp will update me weekly on his availability.
