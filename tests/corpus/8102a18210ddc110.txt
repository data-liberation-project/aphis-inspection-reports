2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
This licensee transported a lion cub under 28 days of age to this facility. The licensee reports that the cub was born on 28
June 2020. There are inconsistent dates listed on the supporting documentation for this transport. The Certificate of
Veterinary Inspection states a shipping date of 15 July 2020 (17 days of age). The APHIS 7020 form provided by the
licensee of origin shows a disposition date of 19 July 2020 (21 days of age). However, this licensee states that the
transport actually happened 24 July 2020. The lion cub would have been 26 days of age on 24 July 2020. Neonatal
nondomestic cats have special handing and husbandry needs and are placed in danger when they are exposed to
members of the public and/or stressful conditions, including transportation. Cubs under 4 weeks of age (28 days) do not
have a developed immune system, are susceptible to a wide variety of diseases including those of domestic cats, and
cannot thermoregulate. The licensee must ensure that handling of all animals be done as expeditiously and carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. To be corrected by 30 April 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
