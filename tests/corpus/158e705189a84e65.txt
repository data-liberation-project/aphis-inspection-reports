The daily observation record book for the lemurs describes several incidents where the lemurs have bitten or
scratched members of the public during interactive encounters . These occurred between 10/13/18 and 10/22/18.
The incident record book describes three separate incidents that occurred on 10/13/18. These involved a staff
member and two members of the public. One incident description states : " Lemur scratched son's arm and jumped
on head grabbing him aggressively and continued to jump on him after the incident ". Three of the six Lemurs used
in public encounters have bitten or scratched the public. This is an indication that the animals are not trained and
are not under direct control. Trained non human primates may be allowed physical contact with the public, but only
if they are under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times during the direct
contact. At time of this inspection the facility has not taken corrective action .
