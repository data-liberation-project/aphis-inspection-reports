3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the whelping facility, there were at least three enclosures that had flaking rust on the top portion of the doors
and on metal support brackets around the doorways.
***In the adult facility, the enclosures were constructed out of wood and non-coated wire. The wire on the left side of
the building was rusted and in at least two places, the rust had eaten completely through the wire leaving gaps in
the enclosure. Excessive rust cannot be cleaned and sanitized as required. It increases the risk for disease by
creating a harboring place for pests and disease hazards, can cause sharp edges that can injure the animals and
can cause damage to the structural strength of the enclosure. The licensee must remove, replace or repair these
areas and ensure that the entire facility is free of excessive rust as required.
To be corrected by May 15, 2018.
3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***In the interior portion of the adult housing facility there was one enclosure containing two adult dogs. on the left
side of the doorway leading to the outside run, there were two nail heads sticking out from the wall approximately
2". These nail heads were approximately 12"-14" off of the floor. The licensee stated that the nails were once used
to hold up a feeder.
***In the interior portion of the adult housing facility, the bottom portion of most of the enclosure gates have an
opening at the bottom that is covered w/1" x 2" non-coated, small gauge wire. One enclosure containing 2 adult
dogs had wire on the gate that was rusted completely through and the wires were protruding into the enclosure at
the same level as the dogs' faces. Sharp points and edges protruding into an enclosure create a potential injury for
the animals within the enclosure. The licensee must remove the nails and wire on the gate and assure that there are
no sharp points or edges in the primary enclosures as required.
To be corrected by April 26, 2018. This inspection began at 1428.
