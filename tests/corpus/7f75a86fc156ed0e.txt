3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* There is a perimeter fence around the enclosure housing the two camels. This perimeter fence measures at
different areas: 51 inches, 48 inches, 55 inches and 71 inches. In areas along the top of the fence, between the
posts, the top wire is sagging. The top wire of the perimeter fence is not fastened to the post in some areas. The
outdoor enclosure, housing the two camels, must have a perimeter fence at least six feet high (including all gates)
be a minimum distance of three feet from the primary enclosure fence, and not contain gaps for a person or animals
to go through or under the fence. As of the last inspection, this non-compliant item has not been corrected.
A perimeter fence will provide protection to the camels by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence also functions as a
secondary containment system for the camels in the facility. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high for
non-dangerous animals must be approved in writing by the APHIS administrator.
The 9-10 year old goat named "Romeo", cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on inspection dated 26-July-2016, had received
veterinary care.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).
This inspection will be sent by e-mail.
