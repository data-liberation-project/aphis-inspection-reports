2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There was one 60 ml bottle of Conzol 1%
with an expiration date of 02/2013. There was one 30 ml bottle of Equate restore tears with an expiration date of
04/2013. There was one 60 ml bottle of Bio Groom Anti itch gel with an expiration date on 10/2010. There was one
60 ml bottle of Priconazole Lotion 1 % with an expiration date of 11/2010. These medications were intermingled
with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of
expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does
not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired
drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure
that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 4/16/14.
2.75(a)(1)(6) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Official identification of seven dogs was not listed on the official USDA (APHIS form 7005) dog on hand sheets.
Records provide a source of information that can be used to identify every dog on the premise. Complete and
accurate records are needed to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability
to trace all dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at their facility.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Dug holes were observed in the dirt ground floor and under the enclosure fencing. One dog is in contact with
the affected areas which are located in outdoor housing. The holes were estimated to be one foot wide by six
inched deep. This affects the ability of enclosure fencing to contain the dog securely. It could lead to potential injury
affecting the safety and health of the dog. The licensee must keep facilities in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals securely. Correct by 4/16/14.3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The exterior masonite wall board cover on one outdoor shelter house has two holes along the bottom. Two dogs
are in contact with the affected surface area. Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis so those surfaces can
be readily cleaned and sanitized at all times or be replaced when worn. Correct by 4/16/14.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Feed sacks containing fecal waste was being stored next to an outdoor enclosure containing two dogs. This
creates a unsanitary condition and could lead to potential disease, contamination or health risks. The licensee must
provide for regular and frequent removal of animal waste for the health and well-being of the dogs. Correct by
4/9/14.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* There were no wind or rain breaks attached to the entrance of two outdoor shelter structures used by four dogs.
Lack of adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrance provide the dogs with little to no protection from the wind or
rain that could collect in the interior area of the shelter structure. In addition, the dogs could potentially experience
difficulty in conserving body heat or maintaining normal body temperatures. The licensee must ensure all outdoor
shelter structures be provided with a wind and rain break at the entrance for the health and well-being of the dogs.
* The facility inspection done on 4/2/14 & the exit briefing done on 4/3/14 were conducted with the licensee.
