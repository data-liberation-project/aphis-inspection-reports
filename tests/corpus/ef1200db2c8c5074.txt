Housing facilities, general.
*** There are extra crates and husbandry supplies stored behind the lemur enclosure that have collected excess dust and
debris. These items should be maintained in a separate area and the area behind the lemur clear of clutter to facilitate
cleaning of the area.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
*** The facility’s current plan to provide for environmental enhancement was written for the green monkey that is no longer
housed at the facility. There is no current plan developed and documented to address the psychological needs of the
Ring-tailed lemur at the facility who is single housed without access to any other non-human primate. This is a three-year-
old intact male who has started to show increased aggression towards staff when crating for cleaning purposes.
Individually housed nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear non-human primates of their own or compatible
species require special attention within this enrichment plan. A plan needs to be developed and in accordance with
current professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian for this animal’s health and psychological
wellbeing.

Facilities, general.
*** There is chicken wire used in the Geoffrey’s cat enclosure to cover larger gaps between the door and frame. This wire
is thin and at the bottom of the door is bending upwards creating sharp points into the enclosure. This section of wire
needs to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals.

*** The black rubber tub that is in the Coypu enclosure is in disrepair with holes in the side of the bucket that appear to
have been chewed. This bucket should be replaced for the safety of the animal and to keep items inside the enclosure in
good repair for the safety of the animal.

Space requirements.
*** The facility’s single housed Coypu is a semi aquatic subtropical rodent currently housed in an enclosure in the main
building that does not provide sufficient space for the animal to engage in species normal postural adjustment and social
behavior of burrowing, taking cover, or swimming. The animal is provided with a stainless-steel bowl filled with several
inches of water in which it accesses to defecate. The animal care staff has noticed this animal displays an increased
amount of pacing since moving it inside and has attributed it to lack of appropriate space. Abnormal behavior patterns
such as pacing can be an indicator of stress in an animal that does not have adequate space for normal postural
adjustments and social behavior. The licensee must ensure the enclosure space and design meet the social postural

adjustment needs of the species housed for its adequate freedom of movement.
