2.126(a)(4) Critical Repeat

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
Each dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials.

On the 18-November-2022, at 3:32p.m., the inspector was in the process of conducting a routine inspection. During the
inspection process the inspector was going to take pictures of a Non-compliant Item (N.C.I) concerning the “Program of
Veterinary Care”. This was the lack of instructions from the Attending Veterinarian (A.V.) specifically instructing the
“frequency” and “Sample size” of ecto, blood and internal parasites. The inspector was getting the camera out of the
camera bag to photograph or document this N.C.I. At this point, the licensee stated, you will not take pictures inside of
this building. The inspector stated photographs were apart of the inspection process to document a N.C.I. And, that
pictures had to be taken as a part of this process. The licensee stated you will not take any pictures in here. The
inspector said, since I cannot take photos are you refusing an inspection or are you done with the inspection. The
licensee said, if photos are part of the inspection, then we’re done.

Refusal of inspection to include taking photos as necessary interferes with APHIS’s ability to assure animal welfare. Each
dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect and
photograph the facilities, property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the

Act, the regulations and the standards in this subchapter; and to document, by the taking of photographs and other
means, conditions and areas of noncompliance

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
