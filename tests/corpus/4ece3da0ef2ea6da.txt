FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an opening in the bottom left corner of a rabbit cage which had loose wiring, leaving a gap in the
enclosure and exposing rabbits to wire ends. The wiring in the cage should be repaired and maintenance problems
should be identified and fixed in a timely manner to protect the animals from injury.

FEEDING.
Diet as observed during inspection contains a large percentage of carrots. While carrots have some nutritional
value, they do not provide sufficient nutritive value for the rabbits. Feeding excess amounts of one diet item can
result in preferential feeding, with the rabbits failing to consume the balanced rabbit pellets, which are necessary to
ensure normal daily requirements are met. Diet should be balanced to ensure animals are consuming sufficient
nutritive value.

FEEDING.
In a pen housing two sheep, there was a food receptacle which contained rotting, leafy greens. A system of
replacing uneaten food from the sheep pen in a timely manner must be implemented to ensure food is wholesome
and has adequate nutritive value to maintain animals in good health.

WATERING. Sheep enclosure: The size of the water receptacle is not adequate for the species housed. Water in the small
shallow dishes could heat up quickly, reducing potability. Additionally, under heat or stress conditions, the animals
could quickly consume the small amount of water available. There is no dedicated animal keeper in the area to
monitor consumption. Watering must be done in a way to ensure the health and comfort of the animals.

SANITATION.
In a pen housing two pigs, there was a buildup of excreta which created a bad odor and an increase in the amount
of flies in the area. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of the pig pen should be more
effective to prevent the buildup of excreta.
