2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A large number of hedgehogs throughout the hedgehog house were observed to have few to many small black moving
dots on their skin and on the walls of the plastic igloos within the enclosures that the licensee confirmed were mites.
These mites were not observed by the licensee or employees before the inspection and therefore had not been
addressed. The licensee stated he would treat them all immediately. Daily observation is essential to the health and well
being of the animals and without it injury, illness, pests and parasites can go unchecked and become an elevated problem
that can directly harm the animals in the facility. Correct by 1/13/22
3.77(f) Repeat

Sheltered housing facilities.
A section of wire Perimeter fence approximately 20 feet long was taken down temporarily sometime before the inspection.
There was also a section of wood fence in the front of the facility approximately 3 to 4 feet in length that was damaged
and exposed from prior weather events. Perimeter fencing is essential both to protect the animals housed within from
predators and scavengers, and to act as a secondary containment if a primary enclosure were to fail. Repair or replace all
perimeter fencing around the facility grounds.
3.81 Repeat

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.

There are primates housed both in groups and individually. However, the enrichment protocol from the attending
veterinarian only address primates housed in group settings, and does not address enrichment based on age or species.
There is no way to determine if the attending veterinarian knows primates are housed individually, or what additional
enrichment or enhancements may be required for their well being. A primate enrichment protocol must be created and
approved by the attending veterinarian or all primates must be housed in social group settings.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Enclosures containing 2 red coatimundis, and 2 albino coatimundis contained a tin roof structure in which multiple nail or
screw heads were observed coming down into the enclosure. There is at least one screw head that is accessible to the
albino coatimundis from a climbing branch directly below. This can pose a direct injury hazard to the animals within.
Repair, replace, or cover materials that can harm the enclosed animals.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
A section of wire Perimeter fence approximately 20 feet long was taken down temporarily at the time of the inspection.
There was also a section of wood fence in the front of the facility approximately 3 to 4 feet in length that was damaged
and exposed from weather events. Perimeter fencing is essential both to protect the animals housed within from predators
and scavengers, and to act as a secondary containment if a primary enclosure were to fail. Repair or replace all perimeter
fencing around the facility grounds.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
Multiple rodent enclosures contained an excessive accumulation of bedding material, excreta and seed throughout the
enclosures and tanks. Some of this buildup was observed to be several inches high. This can attract insects and vermin

and can contaminate food and water stores. Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to avoid
the excessive buildup of organic material.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
