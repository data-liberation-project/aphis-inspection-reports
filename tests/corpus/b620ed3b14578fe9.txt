Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
There were no certificates obtained for at least two dogs that were each purchased from unlicensed breeders stating that
they were not required to have a license. Without certification, there is an increased risk that unlicensed breeders may
circumvent regulatory requirements. The licensee must ensure that they do not obtain any dog from any person who is
not licensed without obtaining a certification that the animals were born and raised on that person’s premises and, if the
animals are for research purposes, that the person has sold fewer than 25 dogs and/or cats that year, or, if the animals
are for use as pets, that the person does not maintain more than four breeding female dogs and/or cats. To be corrected

Indoor housing facilities.
The interior walls and ceiling of the indoor housing facility had exposed pink insulation with a paper covering. Only one
wall was covered in a clear plastic film protecting the insulation and paper covering; the licensee said they had plans to
complete the project but no timeline. The licensee admitted that dogs were able to chew on the exposed insulation and
paper if the kennels were too close to the walls and thus had moved the kennels away from the walls about 6 inches. A
surface that is not impervious to moisture cannot be easily cleaned or sanitized. The licensee must ensure the walls and


floors of indoor housing facilities, and any other surfaces in contact with the animals, are impervious to moisture; the
ceilings of indoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture or be replaceable. To be corrected by: December 17,

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Within the sheltered building, the interior surfaces of the metal in/out access doors and the enclosure walls, at the level of
the dogs, had an accumulation of dirt and grime build-up. The licensee expressed difficulty in cleaning the wall surface
due to texture and material type. The licensee also stated that the in/out access doors had not been cleaned that day and
could not recall the last time they were cleaned. Surfaces with dirt/grime buildup can increase the risk of disease hazards
in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that used primary enclosures for dogs are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt and other disease hazards. To be corrected by: November
