INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are not always approved by the IACUC
before the changes occur. On July 8, 2016, a Sinclair pig underwent 2 CSF collections during a training session.
Although an amendment had been submitted, the IACUC approved training protocol, FY15-078 Training Protocol
for Procedures in Laboratory Swine, did not include approval for CSF collection. The amendment to include CSF
collection was not approved until after this incident.
Unapproved significant changes to the protocol could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal's
welfare at risk. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC
prior to implementing the changes.
Correct by 7/21/16.
2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***The IACUC did not conduct appropriate reviews of the animal activities for protocol FY14-132 to ensure that the
study personnel were following the approved IACUC protocol. The animal use activity involved non-human
primates.
The IACUC protocol states that the groups of animals will receive one of the following: Drug A; Drug A + B; or Drug
A + C.
According to the study protocol (not reviewed and approved by the IACUC) and animal dosing records, the group 3
animals received Drug A + Drug B + Drug C. This combination of drugs was not approved in the IACUC protocol
prior to dosing. An amendment has since been approved by the IACUC to include new dosing regiments. The
IACUC is required to conduct continuing review of all animal activities in order to ensure that they are conducted in
compliance with the approved protocol and to ensure that the animals do not experience any undue pain and
suffering. The IACUC must continue reviewing all activities involving animals, in order to ensure that all animal activities are
conducted as stated in the approved protocol and in compliance with these regulations.

2.38(f)(1) REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
***Handling of all animals was not done in a manner that did not cause trauma. On March 11, 2016, six guinea pigs
expired during transportation for study related activities. The animals were held in a rat microisolator enclosure
(used for transportation), for approximately 45-60 minutes before initiating transport to the exposure room.
Immediately upon leaving the animal room, study personnel noted the animals had expired. An IACUC investigation
revealed three contributing factors in this incident: the density of guinea pigs in the enclosure, duration they were
held in the enclosure, microisolator filter top was wet (may contribute to decreased air exchange within the
enclosure).
The facility has addressed the identified contributing factors, revised relevant SOP(cid:25)s and retrained staff. Handling of
all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
This was a focused inspection on facility records.
Inspection was conducted on 7/19/16 with the IACUC chair, Attending Veterinarian and the Director of Scientific
Support Services, along with APHIS personnel to include Dr. Aaron Rhyner and Dr. Tanya Tims.
Exit briefing was conducted on 7/20/16 with facility personnel along with APHIS personnel to include Dr. Aaron
Rhyner and Dr. Tanya Tims.
