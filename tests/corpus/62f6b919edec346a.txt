3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During the inspection it was noted that the wash-down areas had a heavy buildup of tan material. There was a
moderate amount of feces and urine present within the wash down area. This buildup is an indicator of dried urine
and feces that has built up over time. Improper cleaning and sanitization of the wash down contributes to the odor
and disease hazards within the facility. This facility must establish and maintain a routine for proper cleaning and
sanitation for the facility to include all wash downs.
