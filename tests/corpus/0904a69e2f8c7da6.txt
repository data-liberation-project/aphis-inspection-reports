SANITATION.
Enclosure # 23 had an accumulation of old, wet, moldy, hay/leaf mixture on the elevated resting surface. Upon
further inspection of this hay mixture, it was discovered that the underlying wooden surface was wet, spongy,
deteriorating, and no longer structurally sound to safety support the weight of this serval.
If this bedding is being used on this type of wooden surface, it shall be changed more frequently to prevent moisture
buildup, mold, and deterioration
