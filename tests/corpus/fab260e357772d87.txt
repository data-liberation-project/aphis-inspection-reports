2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In pen 6 there were 2 adult guinea pigs, one white and one brown and white, with swellings on the underside of the
neck which were roughly 1 x 2 inches in size. The facility representative stated he had observed the swellings but
had not contacted his attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care on file did not provide instructions
on the actions he should take if they were observed.
In pen 49 there was an adult brown and white guinea pig with a crusty area around the right eye and the hair around
the eye was moist. In pen 48 there was a brown juvenile that was holding the left eye partially closed and it was
mildly swollen. The facility representative stated he had not observed the eye issues in either guinea pig and had
not contacted the attending veterinarian.
Swellings in the neck and eye abnormalities can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall
health and well-being of the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to
seek proper diagnosis and treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and
possible spread to additional animals if the condition is contagious. The licensee must establish and maintain
programs of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing areas. There was an operable fan in
the larger room and closed windows present in both housing areas, but these methods were not sufficient to provide
adequate ventilation. Failure to provide fresh air can expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards. The
indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.

3.30WATERING.
The entire automatic watering system requires a thorough cleaning. The water supply lines, watering nipples, and
metal rings around access holes in enclosures have accumulations of debris, grime, dust and cobwebs. These
accumulations may expose the guinea pigs to potential bacteria and other health concerns. Inadequate cleaning
and sanitation of the automatic watering nipples, water supply lines, and surrounding area can result in
contamination of not only those guinea pigs in the enclosures but also other guinea pigs in the facility. Correct this
by keeping the water valves, water lines and the entire watering system clean to ensure the health and well-being of
the guinea pigs.

3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There were numerous cobwebs and dust on the walls, windows, and pens throughout both guinea pig rooms in the
indoor housing area. Failure to clean these areas can expose the guinea pigs to potential health hazards. The
indoor housing areas must be kept clean and in good repair to ensure the health of the animals.
