entered on the disposition column. Records of animals on hand, as well as acquisition and disposition records shall fully
and correctly disclose all the required information for all covered animals on the premises.

The new facility has temporary cages assembled with a 6 foot perimeter fence around the animals' enclosures. Cliff, an

from going through it and to act as secondary containment for the animals in the facility, unless approved in writing by the
Administrator.
