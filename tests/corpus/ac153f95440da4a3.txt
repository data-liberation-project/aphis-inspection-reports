2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On April 12, 2107 a juvenile bunny was noticed by store staff to have bloat and "wet tail." According to the medical
record the treatment plan was to "put wet tail meds in H2O every day. Needs cilantro and oats." However, there
were no notations in the record that these treatments were given. A veterinarian was not contacted about the rabbits
condition and it died on 4/17/2017. Improperly treated medical conditions can worsen and even result in death. The
licensee must ensure that sick and injured animals receive proper medical treatment under the supervision of a
veterinarian. Additionally, licensee shall ensure that all diagnosis and execution of any medical treatments are
documented.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Store Manager.
