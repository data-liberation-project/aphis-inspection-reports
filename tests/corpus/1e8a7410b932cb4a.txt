A male red poodle DOB 10-4-2009 (MC# 047363069) was observed to have a mild yellow to clear discharge in the
left eye. There was no swelling or redness associated with this discharge. This dog had a thin body condition with
a visible spine and hips and palpable ribs. The left upper incisor was fractured leaving only ¾ of tooth remaining in
the mouth. The gum line was pushed up away from the tooth exposing the root. The space between the fractured
tooth and upper canine tooth had a thickened red distended mass of gum tissue. The gum tissue in the entire mouth
was reddened and appeared swollen. A thick deposit of brown to grey tartar covered the top half of the left upper
canine tooth.
A female apricot poodle DOB 1-8-2010 (MC# 051836816) has a small round, pink mass between the toes of the
right front foot. The center of this mass is dark red in color. The animal also has two small round, pink masses
between the toes of her front left foot. One of the masses on the left foot has a dark red appearance in the center
and appears to have ruptured and small amount of discharge was observed on the hair surrounding this area. The
other mass on the left front foot appears as a dark color with darkest area located at the center of the mass.
A female white/yellow Chihuahua DOB 05-22-2010 (MC #042876886) has extremely long, overgrown toenails that
are starting to curve under with sharp points on all four feet. The left front foot had a small firm round pink mass in
the space between the toes.
A female poodle DOB 4-12-2009 (MC# 031115010) was observed to be lame non weight bearing on the left rear
leg. There is a round, red, wet draining ruptured mass approximately 0.5cm in diameter located in the space
between the toes of the left rear foot. The left front foot also has a round, pale pink firm mass of similar size in the
space between the toes. A third mass was identified in the right front foot that appeared smaller, darker, firmer and
not irritated. A small round wet draining pink mass was noted in the space between the toes of the left rear foot.
Two of the cheek teeth on the lower right jaw were loose when the inspector touched them. As well there are two
areas of bleeding of the gum line where the licensee had recently removed the teeth while performing dental care
within the last 4 days. There are some small areas of tartar on both the left and right cheek teeth remaining after
recent dental care had been performed. A female cream colored poodle DOB 4-13-15 (MC# 0A02276512) has a laceration on the right side of the neck.
The laceration was 1.5 inches in length exposing the tissue under the surface of the skin. There is a mild amount of
green, wet discharge along the left edge of the wound. The entire surface of the wound is coated with a creamy
white to tan discharge. The edges of the wound are also mildly reddened. The wound had been identified and
treated by the licensee with a topical dermal product however had not yet consulted with the veterinarian.
Poor dental health, lacerations, and foot masses could cause pain and discomfort to the dogs as well as lead to
further health complications. Poor body condition could be an indication of underlying health issues.
The above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and to develop an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
A female Chihuahua DOB 1-23-15 (MC# 020629075) has extremely long, overgrown toenails. The toenails have
become so long that they have begun to curl under.
A female chocolate/tan Chihuahua DOB 12-12-14 (0A02552969) has extremely long, overgrown toenails. The
toenails have become so long that they have begun to curl under.
Overgrown toenails can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as affect the dog's natural gait.
The licensee must develop an effective plan for toenail maintenance. The licensee must have the toenails of the
above listed Chihuahuas trimmed to an acceptable length and ensure that all of the dogs receive adequate toenail
maintenance at all times.
Female Chihuahua DOB 05-22-2010 (MC #042876886) must also receive toenail maintenance.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has no disposition records for three female Border Collies. The licensee does not know the identity or
address of the individuals who took each dog. A properly completed APHIS Form 7006 Record of Disposition of
Dogs and Cats is necessary to track the dogs to their new locations.
Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain forms which fully and correctly disclose all required information for all
dogs acquired and disposed of. The licensee must provide the name and address of the buyer and all other
information required by APHIS Form 7006 for every dog which is sold, exchanged, transferred or donated. Correction date: From this day forward.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
Within the "Small Breed" building there are at least two plastic self-feeders that have a greyish/blue mold growing
on the inside of them. There are six dogs with access to these feeders. The mold growing inside the feeders could
contaminate the food which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.
Self-feeders must be kept cleaned and sanitized and measures must be taken to ensure there is no molding,
deterioration, and caking of the feed. The licensee must clean and sanitize these feeders and ensure that all
feeders remain free of mold in order to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.
