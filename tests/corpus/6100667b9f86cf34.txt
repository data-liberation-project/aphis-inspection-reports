2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On inspection, a 16 month old male Dromedary camel named Bulla was found to be in need of veterinary care. The
camel(cid:25)s left rear leg had multiple cuts above the foot on the outside surface of the leg. The multiple cuts ranged in
size from approximately 0.5 to 3 inches and displayed hair loss in the areas of the wounds. Some of the cuts were
black in color while other cuts were pink to red in coloration. The camel was observed shifting its weight to the right
rear leg while also picking up the left rear leg periodically. The left hind leg appeared swollen compared to the right
hind leg. According to staff, the injury was being treated with a topical spray, but no documentation was available to
verify the treatment. A veterinarian had not been contacted about the injury to the camel leg because the licensee
stated he thought it was a minor cut and it didn(cid:25)t need veterinary involvement. The Program of Veterinary Care did
not have any listed medications or treatments for cuts, wounds, or any injuries. By not appropriately treating the
camel(cid:25)s injury not only is it causing pain and discomfort in the animal but also it exposes the animal to secondary
infections and further medical complications. This animal must be seen by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation
of examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained by the Licensee and made available for further
inspection by APHIS officials. In addition, the licensee must have frequent communication with his attending
veterinarian for all health issues within a timely manner. All medications and treatments must be approved, in
writing, by the attending veterinarian before use on any animal.
