3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1) There are several enclosures housing the tigers Onyx and Blizzard that have metal fencing that is rusted on the
bottom. These areas of fencing need to be replaced with new fencing. 2) The rear side of the enclosure housing the
cougar Czar has an area where the wire fencing is rusting. This area needs to be replaced with new fencing. 3)
There is a tree branch which grew in and out from the chain link fencing in at the rear center of the enclosure
housing the bear Cinnamon. If this tree branch was to fall over it could allow a large opening in the fencing. There
needs to be new fencing in this area to secure this enclosure. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall
be maintained in good repair and contain the animals.
