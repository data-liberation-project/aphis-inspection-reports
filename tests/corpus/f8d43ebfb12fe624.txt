2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Painful procedures as identified in the animal use protocol have not been included in the alternatives search. The
IACUC meeting minutes document a discussion regarding potentially painful procedures occurred, and that
methods to minimized pain and distress have been implemented. The protocol's alternative search, however, has
not been updated. The last documented alternative search conducted in 2014 did not include keywords which
reflect the potentially painful and/or distressful procedures as identified by the principal investigator and IACUC.
Animals may experience unnecessary pain or distress if viable alternatives are available. Alternatives to
procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals must be considered, the
principal investigator shall provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available.
