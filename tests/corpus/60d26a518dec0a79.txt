ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:10 am on
05/28/2015.
Normally late morning is best time for inspection. Today, however, a scheduled medical appointment makes
inspection impossible.
