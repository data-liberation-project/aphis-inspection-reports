2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female French Bulldog with microchip number 029 104 122 had an abnormal discharge from the anal area that
varied in color from tan to reddish brown to deep red in color. A small amount of blood was also observed in the
stools in this enclosure. The licensee stated that he had just given dewormer to this dog. There is no written
documentation noting observations or treatment provided to this dog by the licensee. No communication by the
licensee with the attending veterinarian has occurred regarding this dog and since the dog has not been diagnosed,
it is unclear if proper treatment is being administered by the licensee. If not properly treated, the condition could
worsen and result in other negative health effects. This dog must be examined by the attending veterinarian for
diagnosis and prescribed treatment. Documentation must be maintained by the licensee on any evaluations,
diagnosis and treatment provided.
3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces - General requirements.
Three enclosures in the small breeder building and two enclosures in the large breeder building housing a combined
total of 10 adult dogs had excessive chewing/scratching damage to the plastic supports within the enclosure. The
excessive chewing/scratching damage has caused grooves in the plastic leaving a rough surface that is allowing dirt
and debris to accumulate in the grooves. These surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, which could
affect the health of the animals by harboring bacteria and other disease hazards in the grooves. Replace or repair
chewed surfaces to reduce or eliminate these risks. Correct by 28 August 2014.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces - Cleaning.The upper portions of the breeder enclosures have a buildup of fur and dust on the enclosure wire and ledges. The
bungee cords securing the food receptacles to the enclosures also have a buildup of fur and dust on them. Several
of the doggie doors in the large breeder building have a dark brown organic matter buildup on the surfaces of the
doors. Inadequate cleaning of surfaces allows a buildup to occur, which increases risk of disease and does not
satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. Remove this buildup from upper portion of
enclosures, bungee cords and doggie doors and maintain all surfaces of housing facilities on a regular basis to
prevent an accumulation. Correct by 31 July 2014.
Dog #106800831 documented under 2.40(b)(2) on the previous inspection conducted on 20 February 2014 has
