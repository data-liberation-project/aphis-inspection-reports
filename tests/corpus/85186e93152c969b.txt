On closer observation, the inner middle pad on the left rear foot was reddened and swollen. There was a lesion in
the middle of this swollen pad that went the width of the swollen pad. The edges of the of the lesion had yellowish
skin around the edges. The licensee stated he noticed this dog limping a week or two ago. When asked if this dog
was receiving treatment the licensee replied "no" and also said had not contacted their veterinarian about this dog.
This dog is currently not receiving treatment and is currently showing signs of discomfort. This dog's condition could
be due to injury, infection and/or another veterinary medical condition which could be painful. The licensee must
have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and
an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
