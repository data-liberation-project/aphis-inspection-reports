2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
In the course of handling cotton rats in March 2014, two escaped and were captured using a net, they were noted to
be dead shortly after being returned to their enclosures. Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm. The facility adjusted their method of handling the cotton
rats to prevent escapes and did not have any incidents with the remaining animals.
This item has been addressed by the facility.
This was a focused inspection of the animal facility and animal records. An exit briefing was conducted with the
research associates.
