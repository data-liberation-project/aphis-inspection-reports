3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosures for the animals the floors and toilets have missing and chipped paint in some areas. Paint
is worn off of walls and window frames. There is bent hardware wire with sharp edges within reach of the animals
when they pass through a a chute that provides access to the outdoors enclosure. The chain-link fencing in the
patio door opening in Koko's enclosure is missing paint, and has some rust.
Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the
facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. All surfaces must be
maintained and/or replaced on a regualr basis. Items that are worn or potentially hazardous should be discarded.
Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces and items in the enclosure can impede cleaning, create hazards, and
otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.

3.82(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
In the kitchen there is a large freezer that contains human food, including chicken in ziploc bags dated 2012 and a
pork loin dated 2008. This freezer also contains food for the animals. In the kitchen there was a cutting board in
use that was heavily scored and discolored.
Food must be clean, wholesome, and palatable to the animals. Food for animals should be stored apart from
human food, outdated foodstuffs, or other potential contaminants. Cutting boards should be in good repair so that
they can be adequately cleaned and disinfected.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In a storage room adjoining the kitchen there is an excessive accumulation of discarded items and clutter, and there
was evidence of vermin infestation. Some food was also being stored in this room on shelves adjacent to chemical
products. Outside of this room, next to the kitchen, there were discarded items piled up that could provide
additional habitat for vermin.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and
in good repair in order to facilitate husbandry and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents,
pests, and vermin. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste, and discarded matter. Good
housekeeping practices help to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the storage room adjoining the kitchen there was evidence of rodent infestation, and an abundance of spider
webs. There was no evidence of an effective pest control program. The presence of such pests in the kitchen area
could result in contamination of foodstuffs, which could be hazardous to the health and well-being of the animals.
An effective program for control of spiders, rodents, and any other pests, should be established and maintained so
as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in the kitchen area, and
through out the animal facilites.
To be corrected by 4/11/14.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
