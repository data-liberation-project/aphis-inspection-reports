2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Puppy Identification
Four Aussie Cross puppies born on 5/7/14 and were sold on 7/7/14 were not provided any sort of identification.
Without proper identification such as a unique identification number or code, there is no way to properly track the
animals to verify disposition status. All animals must be properly identified in order to assure records are accurate
and true. Correct from this point on.
2.78(a)(1)
HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
Health certification and identification.
A disposition record (APHIS Form 7006) dated 7/7/14 for 4 puppies, another dated 7/20/14 for 1 puppy, and another
dated 6/17/14 for 1 puppy had no accompanying health certificate even though they were transported in commerce
over state lines by the seller.
Failure to have the puppies inspected within 10 days of transport may not ensure the dogs are healthy for transport
and free of any infectious disease which would endanger the animal(s) or other animals or endanger public health.
Obtain valid health certificates and transport the dog(s) within 10 days of the date the health certificate states the
dog(s) were inspected by the licensed veterinarian to ensure the health certificate adequately reflects the health
status of the dog(s). Correct from this point on.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces--(1) General requirements.
The bottom edge of the metal siding inside the three occupied north shed enclosures housing two dogs in each hasareas of excessive rust.
Surfaces with excessive rust cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, which may increase disease hazards or affect
structural strength leading to injury of the animals. Replace, cover or repair rusted surfaces to ensure structural
strength and cleaning and sanitizing of the surfaces. Correct by January 29, 2015.
3.3(e)(1)(3)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Surfaces.
The new wood construction in the north shed enclosures and the whelping building enclosures are not impervious to
moisture. This includes the bare wood around the dog access doorways, the front wood support along the bottom in
the whelping enclosures as well as new bare wood on the enclosure walls and gates. Additionally, there are
concrete pavers used to keep the dog doors shut for the winter that were also not impervious to moisture. The north
shed enclosures housed a total of 6 dogs and the whelping enclosures housed a combined 9 adult dogs and 17
puppies.
Surfaces not impervious to moisture cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and may harbor disease hazards that
could affect the health of the dogs. These surfaces must be made impervious to moisture or covered with
impervious materials to reduce these risks. Correct by March 29, 2015.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
One outdoor enclosure housing 2 dogs, and 2 sheltered enclosures housing a total of 4 dogs had more than a day's
worth of feces present.
Failure to remove excreta daily from primary enclosures could increase disease hazards, pests and odors and lead
to soiling of the animals. Remove the feces from these enclosures and maintain daily removal of excreta in all
enclosures to reduce these risks and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles.
There was a dark brown buildup on the walls and shelter structures for two outdoor enclosures housing two GermanShepherds each. A similar buildup was present on the lower half of the interior walls for the enclosure housing two
German Shepherds in the north shed.
Failure to clean and disinfect enclosures at least once every two weeks increases disease hazards and
accumulation of dirt, debris and excreta. Clean and disinfect all enclosures to reduce these risks and maintain all
primary enclosures on a sanitation schedule of at least once every two weeks.
3.30 DIRECT
WATERING.
Two outdoor enclosures housing a total of 4 dogs and 1 sheltered enclosure housing 2 dogs had watering
receptacles with water that was completely frozen. In the outdoor enclosure housing 2 dogs, 1 dog was observed
biting and tugging at the receptacle. The licensee was advised to give the animals fresh water, but he refused,
stating that the animals were watered every evening by pouring fresh water directly on top of the frozen water.
Frozen water can cause teeth to crack or break, can lower core body temperature, and does not provide for an
adequate source of hydration for the animals. Animals must be provided clean, potable, and non frozen water at
least twice per day for one half hour at a time in order to give the animals every opportunity to receive adequate
hydration. Correct by December 30, 2014
