FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an outdoor pen housing a serval and two domestic cats, there is a horizontal shade structure/resting surface
composed of a wooden top with a metal support post. Paint is peeling in multiple places on this wooden top, and
several areas of wood are sunken and appear to be decomposing. This could potentially result in injury if an animal
where to jump onto the surface. Facilities must be maintained in good repair to maintain good husbandry standards
and protect the enclosed animals.
