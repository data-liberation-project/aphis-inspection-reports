***Mice are present in the gorilla and orangutan enclosures in the Ape House as well as in animal enclosures within
the Small Mammal House. Mice have been an ongoing problem in these two buildings and measures have been
taken to decrease the population.However, over time those measure have not been effective in controlling the
population. An effective and safe program for controlling mammalian pests should be in place. An effective pest
control program for mice must be established and maintained to protect the health of the animals housed within the
buildings. Correct by June 30, 2016.
NOTE: A comprehensive pest control program for the Ape House and the Small Mammal House has been
developed and portions of the plan have been implemented.
