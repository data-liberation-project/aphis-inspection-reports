FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
One enclosure housing an African Porcupine has smaller mesh attached to the section of fencing shared with an
adjacent enclosure. The edge of the mesh in the corner by the wall has sharp points present that are protruding
outward. Another enclosure housing two African Porcupines has nail heads exposed and protruding outward at the
level of the animals from the right side wall when facing the enclosure. Both of these areas have physical hazards
that could result in injury to the animals. The licensee must repair these areas to protect the animals from injury and
ensure facilities are maintained in good repair. Correct by 7 April 2015.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
The top fencing and ceiling in the majority of the animal enclosures had an overabundance of cobwebs and dust
present. The buildup of cobwebs allows for easier accumulation of debris such as dust and sawdust shaving
particles, which hinders husbandry practices and increases risk of fire due to their flammable nature. Remove
cobwebs and dust and maintain on a more frequent basis to prevent such an accumulation, to facilitate prescribed
husbandry practices and to protect the safety of the animals. Correct by 7 April 2015.
