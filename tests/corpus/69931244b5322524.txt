Facilities, general.
The primary goat pen has sections of fencing that are in disrepair. There are several wood planks in which one end is
detached from the fence post and touching the ground. One section of board fencing, near the front hay feeder, is tied
together with a heavy twine due to a couple of cracked boards. This section is also slightly bent inward. Primary
enclosure should be kept in good repair and constructed in a manner that will ensure structural strength. The fencing must
be adequately repaired or replaced to ensure the goats will remain contained in the pen and to prevent injury. Correct by
