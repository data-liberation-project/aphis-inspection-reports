3.80(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***Two of the indoor primate shelters in the barn are no longer sanitizable because the concrete floors are
excessively worn underneath the feeders and are pitted to the extent that standing water is left after hosing. Lack of
proper sanitizing and drying contributes to odor problems, and detracts from disease control and the general health
and well-being of the animals.
The floors must be repaired or replaced.
