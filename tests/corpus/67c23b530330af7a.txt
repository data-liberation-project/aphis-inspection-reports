ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this two day inspection, an aoudad was noticed the first day, before noon, as being only partially weight
bearing lame. The next day no one had gone into the safari to check on this animal before an inspection drive
through after noon. The second day the aoudad is totally non-weight bearing lame. This animal needs to be
examined by the veterinarian and treated as needed.
In the drive through area of the park a black pot belly pig came up to the car. It has long upper tusks and the left
one has grown long and curved into the left cheek area penetrating the skin and leaving a red raw lesion. This
animal needs to be treated to remove the long tusk and prevent further wounding of the area and possible infection.
Veterinary care needs to be provided to injured animals. The Attending Veterinarian was called during this
inspection.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this two day inspection, a limping aoudad was observed both days and a black pot belly pig was observed
with an overgrown left tusk digging into its cheek leaving a wound. No one has observed or noticed this animal and
monitored the growth of the tusk. Because of lack of daily observation of all animals, this animal is suffering from
lack of proper veterinary care. The facility shall ensure that there is daily observation of all animals to assess their
health and well-being and that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to convey problems of
animal health, behavior and well-being to the attending veterinarian.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two Savannah cats are housed in an outdoor enclosure. There are two small plastic round domed shelter
structures with a large opening at the front of the enclosure. One shelter is missing a wind/rain break and thesecond shelter has a wind/rain break that is hanging off to the side providing no protection. The weather this winter
has been cold, wet, snowy, and windy. The temperature forecast for the rest of the week could drop as low as the
teens at night. Lack of wind and rain protection makes it more likely for the cats to become hypothermic. The shelter
structures must be provided with wind and rain breaks at the entrance. The inspectors noted that the wind/rain
break has not been corrected.
3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two Savannah cats housed in an outdoor enclosure have two small domed shelter structures. Each shelter has a
fleece bed in it. There is no additional bedding present to provide insulation and protection against the cold. The
temperature at midday today is 35 degrees F. The temperature forecast is predicted to be as low as the teens thru
the rest of the week. To provide protection from the cold, shelters must contain clean dry bedding material if the
temperature is below 50 degrees F. and additional clean dry bedding if temperatures are 35 degrees F or lower.
The inspectors noted that there was not any additional bedding in the cat enclosures.
The previous non-compliant items for 2.40 (b) (2) from January 28, 2014 inspection have been corrected.
This is a focused inspection of the animals.
Exit interview was conducted with Facility Representative.
