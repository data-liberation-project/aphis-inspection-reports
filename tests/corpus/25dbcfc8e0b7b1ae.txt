MISCELLANEOUS.
On 11-9-15, a technician working in the biocontainment area found a dead guinea pig on the floor of the autoclave.
The technician had checked and loaded a used cage rack into the autoclave and ran it about one hour previous to
finding the dead guinea pig upon opening the autoclave. The guinea pig was presumed to have been killed by the
cycling of the autoclave. Ensure that animal racks are empty and/or no loose guinea pigs are in the autoclave prior
to running it. The facility has adjusted its cage and autoclave checking procedures to help ensure that this will not
happen again.
