3.76(c) REPEAT
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Animal areas must be provided a regular diurnal lighting cycle of either natural or artificial light. Lighting must be
uniformly diffused throughout animal facilities and provide sufficient illumination to aid in maintaining good
housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, adequate inspection of animals, and for the well-being of the animals.
- The lemurs had recently been moved in an indoor enclosure due to the drop in temperature over night. However,
there is inadequate lighting in this area. This could potentially stress the animals, and possibly lead to related
health problems as well. The facility must ensure that the animals have a diurnal lighting cycle, with uniformly
diffused lighting.
3.80(a)(2)(5) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The three lemurs were being temporarily housed indoors in a wire dog crate. There was not adequate space for the
animals to remain clean and dry. During the inspection the animals were moved to their normal outdoor enclosure.
All three lemurs had wet tails and fecal material smeared in their fur concentrated primarily on their hind quarters.
Upon being released into their normal outdoor enclosure one lemur immediately started grooming its tail and soiled
hind quarters. An animal that cannot escape or avoid contamination from excrement and other waste is at
increased risk of skin infection and disease spread. The licensee must ensure that these primates have sufficient
enclosure space to remain clean and dry.
To be corrected immediately.
This was a focused inspection on direct non-compliant items from inspection conducted 1 May, 2014.The Jacob sheep was seen by the attending veterinarian on 5 May 2014. This animal is thin and needs frequent
monitoring to observe body condition and horn growth.
The facility has added an enrichment item to the enclosure and has acquired an enrichment plan but has not fully
implemented.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative. Licensee has requested all inspection reports be
emailed.
