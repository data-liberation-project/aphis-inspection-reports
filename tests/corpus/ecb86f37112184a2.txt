ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The institution had unexpected animal deaths (at both the Food Animal Research Facility and Agricultural
Research) which were recognized, reported and had corrective actions taken prior to this inspection. A review of
records for sheep under protocol 15-0603 revealed that during a three week period in 2015, eleven animals died or
were euthanized prior to the intended completion of the protocol. A variety of gaps were noted in the completeness
of the records including necropsy results, treatment details, and animal updates.The deaths were reported to the
IACUC and the protocol suspended pending determination of the cause. The attending veterinarian was involved
and made recommendations to the Principal Investigator (PI). The next round of animals used had five animals
dead or euthanized. The facility has now added additional personnel including a dedicated Veterinarian and
Veterinary Technician to assure complete oversight. Adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care in
accordance with current established veterinary medical and nursing procedures is critical to identifying problems
early and finding resolutions that maintain the health of the animals. Correct by assuring that the changes made to
personnel and procedures maximize the benefit to the animals. Facility corrections were in place at the time of
inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, IACUC Chair, OLAR director and ORIC staff.
