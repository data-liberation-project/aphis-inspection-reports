Minimum age requirements.
One puppy born on March 15, 2020 and eight puppies born on March 27, 2020 were sold and transported to another
breeder at 55 days of age. Puppies younger than 8 weeks of age are more susceptible to stresses that occur from
travelling and being placed into a new facility. Their immune systems are more susceptible to becoming compromised
which could cause them to become sick and even die. The licensee must not sell any more puppies under 8 weeks of
age to other breeders. Correct from this day forward.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was an excessive amount of feces in the outdoor enclosures, underneath the outdoor enclosures, and also
underneath the puppy enclosures inside the building. When asked when the enclosures were last cleaned he couldn't say
for sure when they were last cleaned, but it definitely hasn't been in the past week. When asked when the area
underneath the outdoor enclosures was last cleaned, he looked at his notebook and showed me they were last cleaned in
May. Not properly cleaning the enclosures and allowing an excessive amount of feces accumulation underneath the
enclosures can attract pests and disease. Excreta must be removed from the primary enclosures daily. Excreta
underneath the enclosures must be removed as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of feces. Correct by
12/22/21.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
