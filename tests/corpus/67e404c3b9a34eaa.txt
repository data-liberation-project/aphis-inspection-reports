Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC-approved protocol does not include any written assurance that the activities do not unnecessarily duplicate
previous experiments. The IACUC shall determine during the review of proposed animal use activities or significant
changes in ongoing activities that the principal investigator has provided written assurance that the activities do not
unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments. This requirement ensures that the animals under study do not experience
research activities that are unnecessarily duplicative. The IACUC needs to address this deficiency and needs to ensure
that all approved protocols contain a written assurance regarding unnecessary duplication. Correct by August 28, 2022.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC-approved protocol does not provide an adequate rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals
to be used. The protocol simply states that “this amount was required for an adequate sample size for statistical analysis”.
No references, statistics or calculations were included to back up this assertion. When asked, the facility representative
did not provide documentation or an explanation of how a statistical test was used to determine the number of animals for
this specific protocol. It is important for protocols to include an adequate explanation for the number of animals requested
so that the IACUC can review it and determine if the number requested is appropriate for the proposed work. Failure to


provide and review this detail can result in an excess of animals used which goes against the Animal Welfare Act’s aim to
minimize animal pain and distress. The registrant must ensure that all protocols contain not only a rationale for involving
animals and the appropriateness of the species, but also the rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals
to be used. Correct by August 28, 2022.
2.31(e)(4)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC-approved protocol states a general goal for the study but does not provide a detailed description of how the
study will be conducted. A description of procedures is needed to allow the IACUC to thoroughly review the proposal and
determine that the proposed activities will avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals. The protocol
must be updated to include a complete description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to the
animals will be minimized whenever possible, to safeguard the well-being of the animals. Correct by August 28, 2022.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The following animals have been evaluated by the AV but the conditions have not improved and some have worsened.
There hasn't been any follow-up examination or treatment instructions given by the AV for their current conditions. A
Redbone Coonhound (Microchip # 98102003968162 ) is thin in appearance. When viewed from the back and side, the
ribs, backbone and hip bones were visible. In addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent waist were observed. Per the
IACUC representative, the AV found worms in May and treated the animals. He also ordered that the animal be given
double feedings. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted about the animal not
showing any improvements or gains from double feedings. The loss of body weight could be an indication this dog is not
receiving adequate nutrition or it could be internal problems. This can affect the ability of this dog to gain or maintain it's
body weight.



A yellow male Labrador Retriever ( Microchip # 985112004242042) had dropped hips and struggled to stand. He had a
prostrated stance and appeared weak. He had pressure sores from laying down on his elbows and legs. The IACUC
representative stated that in May the animal presented as "doing fine" at his last examination but his condition had
severely declined in the last 3 weeks. In this time he has been having difficulty ambulating and getting out of it's own urine
and feces. The IACUC representative stated that his quality of life has drastically changed. At the time of the inspection
the facility had not consulted with the AV on recent developments nor was there any follow-up examination to assess his
current state for a new treatment plan.

A black female Labrador Retriever's (Microchip # 956000004042894 ) ears were thickened extending into the ear canal.
The facility stated that she has always had this condition and they were instructed to clean the ears, which wasn't noted in
the medical records. The process has been ongoing but the facility has not consulted the AV on the next step.

The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be made available to
ensure that adequate veterinary care is received.
3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
In the feed storage rooms for kennel buildings 1 and 3 there were rolled up bags of leftover food from the testing with tape
sealing them closed. The representative explained that the food could be used to feed the dogs in between testing. The
bags were not in leakproof containers. All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with
tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. Correct by August 5, 2022
3.13(b)(2)



Veterinary care for dogs.
The medical records were incomplete, not including the current ailments of 6 dogs at the facility. There were 3 redbone
coonhounds (Microchip # 956000012460063) (Microchip # 956000012058935) that were underweight with one redbone (
Microchip # 981020039681862) specifically not showing any improvements or gains since the AV instructed the facility to
double feed. There weren't any notes on the condition or instructions from the AV referencing the animal's condition. A
yellow male Labrador Retriever ( Microchip # 985112004242042) has been having difficulty ambulating. Per the IACUC
representative, the animal was evaluated in November for not getting up and was diagnosed and treated at that time by
the AV. The medical records did not reflect the examination and treatment of that visit. The animal was reevaluated in
May and was doing fine but his health has recently declined in the past 3 weeks. A black female Labrador Retriever's
(Microchip # 956000004042894) ears were thickened. Per the IACUC representative, the process has been ongoing and
has not been documented in the medical records. The facility stated that she has always had this condition and they were
instructed to clean the ears, which also wasn't stated in the records. A chocolate female Labrador Retriever's (Microchip #
) ears had excessive debris and the facility was instructed to wash them but it wasn't documented in the records.

The facility hasn't thoroughly documented the conditions, treatment by the AV or follow-up instructions in the medical
records for the six adult dogs at the time of inspection. Maintaining medical records on any abnormal condition observed
on any dog at the premise is essential to always have on hand. Medical records give a detailed description on when the
abnormal condition was first observed, and any correspondence done by the licensee with the attending veterinarian. It
will contain any diagnosis made by the attending veterinarian and any treatment recommended by the attending
veterinarian. Medical records on all dogs and puppies being kept at the facility are very essential and must be made
available to the inspector upon request during the facility inspection. The facility shall maintain medical records if a
problem is identified (such as a disease, injury, or illness), the date and a description of the problem, examination


findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed, when appropriate. Correct by
August 8, 2022.
