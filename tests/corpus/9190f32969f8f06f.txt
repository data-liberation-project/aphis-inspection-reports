Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
In March 2020 two dogs on study were found dead in their enclosures by laboratory technicians. In review of the incident,
USDA noted that these two dogs were identified during weekend observations by a laboratory technician to have
gastrointestinal issues which included diarrhea and blood in the feces. The laboratory technician who observed these
conditions did not report them to the veterinary staff. The research facility must ensure a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication allows for timely and accurate information on problems of animal health noted by laboratory staff
is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

This item has been corrected and addressed by the IACUC by multiple measures, to include retraining of the involved
research staff.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
In February 2020, cat experienced extensive burns, while on study, on parts of the ventrum and axilla due to an
unapproved heating pad used by the principal investigator during a lengthy anesthetic procedure. The burns in the
axillary area resulted in abscesses which required veterinary care and treatment. Handling of animals must be done


expeditiously and carefully in a manner that does not cause physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.

This item has been corrected and addressed by the IACUC by multiple measures, to include retraining of the involved
research staff.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
