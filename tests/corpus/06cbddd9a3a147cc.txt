ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
*The dog and cat parasite control program as listed and outlined on the written program of veterinary care and the
facility animal health program (SOP) states that deworming will occur twice yearly. Medical records document
annual deworming and personnel confirm only yearly deworming is conducted for dogs and cats.
*The parasite control program included in the written program of veterinary care also requires annual fecal testing of
a representative sampling of dogs and cats. Facility personnel indicated that this fecal testing is not being
conducted.
To ensure adequate veterinary care and appropriate intestinal parasite control, including diagnosis, treatment and
prevention, the facility should follow the program of veterinary care as directed by the attending veterinarian. Failure
to follow the directed program could result in delayed diagnosis and complications from undetected and prolonged
intestinal parasite infection in the animals.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
An adult, male brown and black short haired cat identified with animal number 1934 was noted to have alopecia
covering approximately 30 % of the top and sides of the torso. The visible skin was red, inflamed and appeared
crusted in some areas. Facility personnel stated the hair loss had been identified in this animal but the condition of
the skin had not. Medical records for this cat did not identify hair loss, a compromised skin condition or treatment for
these abnormalities.
Skin conditions can cause discomfort to the animal and concurrent infection may be present. The registrant should
establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care, including the use of appropriate methods to prevent,
diagnose and control diseases and injuries. The facility must ensure that procedures are implemented for injured orsick animals to promptly receive appropriate veterinary treatment.
Correct by: The facility corrected this non-compliant item during the inspection by consulting with the attending
veterinarian and administering appropriate treatment.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the vice president.
