2.33(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The records reviewed showed that one bottle of Ketaset (lot number 440835) expired 03/15 and was used to sedate
squirrel monkeys prior to survival procedures. The facility had noted this issue during routine internal inspections.
This week, the same vial was noted to be labeled "expired" but was stored with all the other in-date drugs. The
Ketaset was used on nine different dates in April and May 2015 on a total of five monkeys. Expired drugs may no
longer be effective and the use of expired drugs is not considered acceptable veterinary practice. Ensure that all
drugs used for survival procedures are within date and that all expired drugs are labeled as "expired" and are kept
segregated from other drugs. Correct by Jun 30, 2015.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Review of IACUC records showed that there was a problem with a transport cage used to move dogs from the
housing area to a procedure lab within the same building. On May 1, 2014 a dog recovering from anesthesia was
being transported back to the housing area from the lab when the door of the cage opened on its own and the dog
slid from the transport cage onto the ground. The dog was evaluated immediately after the incident and no injuries
were noted. Discussions with lab researchers and review of records showed that it was known beforehand by some
of the lab personnel that there were problems with the door latching mechanism not latching securely. The person
doing the transport on this date however was apparently unaware of this problem. The facility shall ensure from this
day forward that all facilities used to house dogs including during transport protect the animals from injury and
contain the animals securely. Corrections have since been made to this transport cage to ensure that the door is
secure during transport-corrected.
Inspection conducted June 8-12, 2015.
Exit conducted with Attending Veterinarian, IACUC Chair and Vice-Chair and other facility personnel.
