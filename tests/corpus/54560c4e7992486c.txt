RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of acquisition for one 5 month old male bobcat and two raccoon babies which were recently acquired
by the zoo are incomplete. The two documents which were provided at the time of the inspection for the bobcat
were the treatment sheet and invoice for a fecal examination done by the attending veterinarian on 4/7/15. The one
document which was provided for the two raccoon babies (sex and age unknown) was a slip of paper with the first
name of the NM Game & Fish officer and a street address in Ruidoso, NM.
Detailed and accurate recordkeeping for the acquisition, disposition, and transport of the bobcat and two
raccoons are necessary to assure humane care and transport of these animals. All exhibitors shall make, keep,
and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose how all animals in their control are acquired,
disposed, and transported while in their possession. To be corrected by: July 3, 2015.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the hoof stock run where two deer are shifted during exhibit yard maintenance, there is an eight foot section
of chain link divider fencing which is no longer securely attached to the posts. This section of fencing has become
partially unfurled from the remaining attachment and is twisted and laying on the ground. This twisted roll of chain
link fencing is a potential hazard to the two deer which are housed here because a leg could become trapped in this
roll of fencing material. This section of divider fencing must be repaired or removed to prevent injury to the two deer.

In the off exhibit holding area for one capybara and two muntjac, there is a 4 inch vertical gap between a fence post
and the adjacent building. This vertical gap in the outdoor enclosure fencing is an area where the two muntjac and
capybara could potentially become injured or escape. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: June
19, 2015.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. A six foot section of the perimeter fence along the hoof stock walkway has a decorative metal top rail which has
become detached at two locations, allowing it to swivel inwards along the top of the wall. There are multiple cracks
between the concrete block in the area below this section of decorative top rail. The unsecured decorative top rail
and cracked section of the perimeter fence is an area where unauthorized persons could potentially gain access to
the zoo animals. The decorative top rail must be reattached and the concrete block repaired in order for the
perimeter fence to function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility and keep unauthorized
individuals out. To be corrected by: July 3, 2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
In the zoo veterinary hospital, there was mouse fecal material inside two laboratory cabinets where cleaning
supplies are being stored. The interior animal holding area doors had evidence of mice chewing the core of the
door panels as seen by small piles of Styrofoam like material laying on the floor adjacent to these door panels.
Rodents can be a potential source of disease transmission to the two coatimundi and one bobcat housed in this
area of the veterinary hospital.
In the bear/cougar off exhibit holding area, there was evidence of mice chewing inside the core of the exterior
building doors as seen by small piles of Styrofoam like material laying on the floor adjacent to these door panels.
Rodents can be a potential source of disease transmission to the two cougars and two bears housed in this
building.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained. To be corrected by: June 19, 2015.

Inspection and exit briefing were conducted on June 3 & 4, 2015 with the zoo director.
