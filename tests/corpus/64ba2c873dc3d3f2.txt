***There was one sheep in need of veterinary care that was seen limping in the far back pasture. This sheep was
noticeably lame on its left front foot, with a pronounced head bob and ungainly gait. This animal needs to be
examined and treated by a veterinarian no later than close of business August 19, 2015.
The following animals were identified to be in need of veterinary care as indirect non-compliant items:
***Three goats, two in the petting zoo area and one that was on the roof, all of which had approximately golf
ball-sized round swellings in the shoulder region; one black-and-white goat had hair loss over the area. These
swellings could be evidence of an infectious condition, and these three animals need to be examined and treated by
a veterinarian. The veterinarian should also provide guidance to the facility on how to prevent the spread of
infection to other animals if that is the case.
***One goat in the far back pasture had a very swollen udder, a quarter-sized laceration on the udder, and was thin
with some hair loss. The son of the licensee indicated she had been weaned recently and was probably an older
goat. This animal is in need of veterinary care due to the overall unthriftiness of her appearance, as well as the
possibility of an infection in her udder.
Correct by having all of these animals examined and treated by a veterinarian, as well as continuing to provide
adequate veterinary care for all the animals at the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Five animals were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection including three goats with masses on
the bases of their necks near the points of their shoulders, a goat with swollen udders and a wound on her udder,
and a limping sheep. Although the facility currently maintains logs of daily observations, only one black and whitegoat with a mass had been identified by the licensee. The other 4 animals were identified by USDA inspectors
during this routine inspection and were not observed by the facility. All licensees must establish and maintain an
adequate program of veterinary care which includes daily observations of all animals to assess their health and
well-being. Additionally, a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian (AV) is
required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are
conveyed to the AV. The number of animals that were exhibiting medical problems that the facility failed to identify
indicates that the methods of daily observation for the animals at this facility are not adequate at this time. Correct
by ensuring that adequate daily observations are conducted and that information is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian as required.
Correct from this day forward

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***During this inspection, several young goats were found to be recently de-horned. When questioned about which
personnel perform these de-hornings, the son of the licensee stated that these are done by the facility personnel.
When asked if there is written veterinary guidance for this procedure, he also said that there is none. Failure for the
facility to maintain a written Program of Veterinary Care that includes guidance for procedures does not ensure
adequate care for the animals on hand. Written guidance is required to ensure that the attending veterinarian is
aware of those procedures to be performed by the licensee and that this guidance satisfies current accepted
veterinary standards. Correct this by contacting your attending veterinarian and updating the Program of Veterinary
Care to include written guidance for these procedures.
Correct by: Before any additional de-horning procedures by facility personnel and not later than August 30, 2015.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Several primary enclosures in the petting zoo had broken wires with sharp edges protruding into the animal
areas. These sharp edges pose a risk of injury to the animals contained therein. There were also several
enclosures consisting of loose wire paneling that bowed out when the animals leaned against it. Additionally, the
enclosures along the west side of the barn have chain link that is curling outward, leaving a gap between the bottom
corners of chain link and the ground. This gap is large enough that an animal could get a foot entrapped in the
chain link and cause itself injury. Enclosures with sharp protrusions and which are not maintained in good repair or
of sufficient structural strength to contain the animals poses a risk of escape or injury to the animals housed therein.
Correct by ensuring that the facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animalsand prevent them from injury.
Correct by: August 30, 2015.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In one of the pastures on the west side of the facility there were at least two baby goat carcasses in varying
states of decomposition, along with some fetal membrane material, that were found near a drainage tunnel opening.
It was unclear whether these were stillborn babies born in situ and abandoned there, or whether they were placed
there by an employee checking the pasture. Decomposing carcasses, especially near a drainage ditch, can
contaminate the soil and plants in the pasture and cause a risk of disease to the other animals grazing there. The
dead tissues can also attract vermin and pests, which bring another risk of disease to those animals. Correct by
ensuring that proper provisions are made for the removal and disposal of all waste materials, including dead
animals, and that these provisions comply with applicable regulations relating to pollution control and the protection
of the environment.
Correct by: close of business August 18, 2015.
3.127
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** There is no shelter for one pasture containing at least 18 goats. These goats are housed in an open pasture
with longer grasses and weeds. Although these longer grasses do give the goats areas to bed down, it does not
provide adequate shelter from wind, rain, and sunlight. Formal shelter structures must be provided for these
animals that will protect the animals from the sun and weather. Correct this by providing shelter to these animals.

WATERING.
***There is a pasture containing 2 goats along with several ducks, geese, and chickens. There is a single large
water tub that is providing water for all of the animals therein. This tub is emptied and cleaned out every 2 weeks.
On inspection today, the water was muddy and full of feathers due to the ducks using it for bathing. This is not
sufficiently clean and sanitary to serve as a receptacle for drinking water for the goats. Unsanitary drinking water
poses a risk of disease, and the animals may choose not to drink the water and become dehydrated. Correct by
cleaning and sanitizing water receptacles as often as necessary for all regulated animals.
Correct by: August 21, 2015.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
*** The goats at this facility have access to the metal roof on a pole building. There is also a shade structure built
on the roof of the building that the goats can also access. Both the floor of the shade structure and the roof are
excessively dirty and require cleaning. There is feces scattered over the majority of the roof and caked in areas
where there are boards attached to the roof. Excessive feces is also present on the floor of the shade structure.
Two puddles of an unidentified whitish liquid were found on the floor of the shade structure. This unidentified liquid
may have been milk or another substance. If it were from an infectious source, a thorough sanitization of this area
is required to avoid potential transmission of disease hazards to other animals. Correct this by cleaning and
sanitizing this area.
