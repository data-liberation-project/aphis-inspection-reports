Watering.
A majority of the primary enclosures have open water bowls which are contaminated with fecal material and bedding.
Additionally, several of the water bowls have areas of chew damage making it difficult to clean and sanitize the
receptacles properly. Failure to clean water containers and provide potable water can lead to the spread of disease and
create a reluctance to drink. Open containers used for dispensing water to guinea pigs shall be placed in or attached to
the primary enclosure as to minimize contamination from excreta. The water receptacles must be cleaned, sanitized, and
maintained in a way which will minimize contamination with feces and bedding.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and the licensee.
