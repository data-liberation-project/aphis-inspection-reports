2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Semi annual reports submitted to the Institutional Official (IO) by the IACUC contain deficiencies identified during
the program review and facility inspection, but do not include correction plans with dates. Without a method or
system for documenting each correction, deficiencies may be forgotten and go uncorrected. This may result in
negative impacts on animal welfare. If program or facility deficiencies are noted, the IO reports must contain a
reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
