FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The old fencing around the goat and cattle enclosure has become worn and torn. There are numerous sharp
points where the wire has broken or been cut at a level where the animals may come in contact with it and become
injured. There is a secondary fence that has been overlayed on the old fencing to prevent escapes but because the
older fencing is loose and not fully attached to the new fence it creates a gap that may allow the goats to become
trapped. The older fence should be repaired or replaced to protect the animals. Affects 10. Correct by June 13,

SANITATION.
***The raised housing structure for the goats has excessive accumulation (1 - 2 inches) of waste material on the
wooden floor. The shed structure in the enclosure for the cows has excess accumulation of waste material and the
ground is very muddy. Excessive accumulations of waste material can create an environment that attracts insects,
and increases the risk of spreading parasites and disease. The enclosures shall be cleaned at a frequency that will
minimize the accumulation thereby protecting the health and well-being of the animals. Affects 10. Correct by May
