PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Between 4 and 4:30 pm, we observed Alaska ticket agents at the passenger terminal accept 2 dogs for shipment.
We observed the first dog being accepted with no non compliant items identified.
During the acceptance of the second animal for shipping on flight 233 to Seattle-Tacoma, the dog was too big for
the 200 series airline compliant primary enclosure. While standing, the dogs head was higher than the crate, and
the dog could not sit comfortably in the crate. The length of the crate was also marginal for the length of the dog,
and the water and food dishes fixed to the inside of the door contributed to the lack of space. Primary enclosures
used to transport live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained in the primary
enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural
position. We notified the ticketing agent that the crate was too small for the dog, and her supervisor joined the
discussion.
Cargo shipping area was also observed releasing animals from shipment.
