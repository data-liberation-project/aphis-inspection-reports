NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
AeroMexico transported an animal to SFO on 5/4/14, but had not notified USDA APHIS Animal Care that its
registration should include SFO as one of its sites.
Registrants are required to notify USDA APHIS Animal Care by registered mail within 10 days of any changes in
their operations related to Animal Welfare Act covered activities. All sites where covered activities occur should be
reported to USDA APHIS Animal Care so that inspections can occur, so as to promote adherence to the Animal
Welfare Act regulations in order to safeguard the health and well-being of transported animals.

MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
AeroMexico Flight 662, arriving in the U.S. on 5/4/14; a Beagle puppy that was six weeks of age was checked and
transported by the carrier in cargo. The acceptance of this underage dog for transport was detected by federal
authorities reviewing quarantine requirements upon entry into the United States. USDA APHIS Animal Care
contacted the owner of the puppy, who confirmed that the puppy was checked as baggage at the ticket counter in
Guadalajara, and retrieved at baggage claim at San Francisco International Airport.
Dogs must be at least eight weeks old to be accepted for transportation by carriers. Transporting underage dogs
and cats can be hazardous to their health, as they are less resistant to heat, cold, thirst, and fasting, and generally
require closer monitoring to ensure their well-being.
Steps should be taken to ensure that only dogs and cats eight weeks or older are accepted for transport as cargo by
the carrier.
To be corrected from this time forward.An exit interview was conducted with cargo office staff for AeroMexico at SFO.
