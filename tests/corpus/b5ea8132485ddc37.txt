2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:40 pm - 3:12
pm on 30-JUL-18.
I knocked on the house door, honked my car horn, left a message on the licensee's phone with no response, and
left a "Sorry we missed you" flier on the front door.
