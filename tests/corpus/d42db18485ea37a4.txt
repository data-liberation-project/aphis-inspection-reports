INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The spring 2016 semi-annual inspection and program review was conducted in April and May. The report to the
Institutional Official (IO) was written October 20, 2016. The IACUC must report to the IO at least once every six
months.
While the semiannual inspection and program review was done on time, the report was very late. The IO, being
ultimately responsible for the facility's compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, must be kept informed of all of the
findings of the IACUC's review in a timely manner.
This was corrected by the IACUC before the time of inspection by identifying the situation and the reasons for it, and
acknowledging the need to prevent recurrence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
