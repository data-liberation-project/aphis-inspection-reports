***The facility is performing procedures on animals that has not been reviewed and approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee (IACUC).
On 4/4/14, a male canine (animal 10006), underwent an IACUC approved procedure. Before the animal was
euthanized, an additional procedure (performed while the animal was anesthetized), which was not reviewed and
approved by the IACUC, took place. The procedure used carotid access, to track and deploy a surgical device in a
pre-measured ilio-femoral region.
On 5/28/14 animal 1576, underwent an IACUC approved procedure. Before the animal was euthanized, an
additional procedure (performed while the animal was anesthetized), which was not reviewed and approved by the
IACUC, took place. The procedure used carotid access to place and pass a 14 Fr long sheath into the descending
aorta.
The facility stated that the additional procedures were used for practicing surgical techniques for upcoming studies.
The facility requires the principle investigator or study director to fill out a form requesting the additional procedure,
but the request is not reviewed and approved by the IACUC. The facility stated they are currently creating a process
to include IACUC review and approval of all additional procedures.
Unapproved activities or significant changes to ongoing activities could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and
put the animal's welfare at risk. Proposed activities or significant changes to ongoing activities must be reviewed
and approved by the IACUC to ensure the proper care and use of animals.
To be corrected by 7/18/14.
