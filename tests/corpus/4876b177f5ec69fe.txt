2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) has been improved but remains incomplete. The PVC lists incorrect
information or lacks information and requires updating in the following categories: Attending Veterinarian contact
information, veterinary protocols for African crested porcupines, lemurs, javelinas and pot belly pigs, and a
description of veterinary emergency coverage if the primary veterinarian is unavailable. An incomplete PVC can
lead to a lack of provision of adequate veterinary care to the animals. The PVC with a part-time attending
veterinarian shall include an up-to-date, currently in-use written program of veterinary care.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** During this inspection, two animals were noted in need of veterinary evaluation. No records or documentation
were available for review regarding observations or treatments administered for either animal.
One adult female giraffe named Mary had overgrown, misshapen rear inside claws.
One young lamb in the walk-through petting area was noted to have the following symptoms of potential illness: left
eye continually closed, abnormal outstretched head/neck posture, reluctance to move, and evidence of diarrhea
soiling on rear legs.
Untreated veterinary medical problems can lead to pain and distress to the animals and may progress to having
serious consequences if remaining untreated. All veterinary observations, diagnoses and treatments should be
documented in writing to allow all employees to know the status of and treatment required for the animals and for
the veterinarians to ensure adequate care is provided. These two animals need to be evaluated as described in the
written program of veterinary care and a diagnosis and treatment plan need to be ascertained and documented.
***In the current PVC, succinylcholine remains listed as the sole agent used for capture, transport, and chemical
restraint for procedures such as exams and lameness treatment for all hoofstock species (except Blackbuck and
Nilgai). Bottles of succinylcholine were present at the facility but the AV and staff indicate that it has not been usedsince the last inspection. Instead, the facility AV is evaluating BAM as a potential replacement for succinylcholine.
Four animals have been successfully immobilized using BAM since the last inspection. The PVC needs to be
updated to reflect the immobilization protocols in use and ensure that these protocols are consistent with currently
accepted professional standards of adequate veterinary care.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has started working on updating the records of animals on hand since the last inspection; however, the
records of acquisition, disposition and animals on-hand are still not complete. The pot belly pigs and deer species
young born this year have not yet been recorded. A baby camel was noted as being sold on 7-10-17 but there were
no records available that showed to whom the baby camel was sold or when/where it was transported. Accurate
record keeping is necessary to adequately identify species and animals present to provide for their care and to allow
legal and medical tracing of the animals. Per this section, every dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or
forms which fully and correctly disclose the detailed information contained in this section.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is permitted to walk directly up to the primary enclosures containing several species of animals including
goats, sheep, zebu cattle, llama, and camels. There are no barriers present at the walk through area animal
enclosures to discourage public contact with/petting of the animals and the guests can feed food sold at the entry
gate. As the inspectors were driving into the park, a man and a young boy were seen petting the camels through the
enclosure fence. No other members of the public were noted in the walk thru area during this inspection; however,
no attendant or employee was seen either. The licensee must ensure that during periods of public exhibition
animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so
as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these
animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present to ensure the safety of both the public
and the animals.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Guests are permitted to drive through a section of the facility in their cars or they can ride on a horse drawn wagon
(employee present as driver/tour guide). During this inspection multiple visitors were driving themselves through the
park in their own van or car. During the inspectors' drive through the park, one horse drawn wagon and oneemployee on an ATV were the only employees noted in the inspectors' field of view. The employee driving the
wagon was focused on the horses in addition to answering questions from the visitors on the wagon. The employee
on the ATV was riding quickly past a couple of vehicles and appeared to be on a fast track to somewhere else. The
employee was not noted to be observing the public's interactions with the animals. The drive through park appeared
to be operating in the same manner as during previous inspections. No attendants were present when people were
noted feeding the animals, petting the animals, climbing out of sunroofs to feed the giraffes and when large animals
completely placed their heads within the vehicles. Allowing guests to have public contact with the animals from
vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or
distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by providing a knowledgeable, responsible, and readily
identifiable employee or attendant present at all times of public contact with the animals.
This facility inspection was conducted with undersigned facility representative. The records inspection was
conducted with undersigned facility representative, a second facility representative and the attending veterinarian.
Inspection of the aoudads and conversation with the attending veterinarian about the aoudads and deer cited on
the last inspection indicate that they have received required veterinary care.
Exit interview conducted with undersigned facility representative.
