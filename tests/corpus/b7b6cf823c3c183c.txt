SANITATION.
A fifty gallon livestock trough being used as an enclosure to house ten ferrets has an excessive accumulation of
feces at one end of the enclosure. Due to the number of animals in the enclosure, it is not possible for the animals
to avoid this area and therefore they are being contaminated by the fecal waste. Fecal contamination of the animals
can irritate and infect the skin and be a source of intestinal diseases. The litter in the enclosure is excessively
soaked by urine. There is a strong ammonia odor coming from the enclosure. The inspectors nose was irritated by
this odor when he lowered his head towards the top of the enclosure to inspect it. The ammonia in the air in the
enclosure can irritate the eyes and airways of the ferrets causing discomfort to the animals and making them
susceptible to respiratory and eye infections. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odors.
