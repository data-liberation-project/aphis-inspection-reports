2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10 am on
06/15/2016.
Spoke to Mr. Fisher. A delivery of fertilizer was expected soon which would require his assistance for a few hours.
Due to the unpredictable nature of running the farm, no optimal hours of inspection are available at this time. Mr.
Fisher will call weekly with availability.
