FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The pasture housing the goats and cow has wire fencing that does not contain the goats. During this inspection
numerous goats were escaping out of the enclosure at the bottom due to the wide openings.
The fencing must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The current shelter for the goats and cow does not provide adequate protection from the rain all at one time. The
shelter does not provide protection from the cold during the winter months and wind, especially for the baby goats.
During this inspection the adult cow walked under the shelter and the goats moved due to the lack of space
available. Shelter shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort
to such animals. It was discussed that several cement culverts could be added to the enclosures for adequate
shelter from inclement weather.

contamination to maintain all animals in good health.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY.
