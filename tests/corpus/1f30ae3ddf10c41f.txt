Use of Appropriate Methods.
Excessive weed/grass overgrowth throughout the grounds, stagnant water collected in various containers with
numerous insects swimming in the water and a lack of a pest control plan for flies and mosquitos are contributing to
six dogs being directly impacted by flies. The dogs have varying degrees of irritation to their ears including
scabbing, dried blood and/or open bloody sores. These bites can be painful and could lead to more serious health
issues for the dogs. Some of the dogs were observed shaking their heads to get the flies off. The two American
Eskimos noted below were rubbing against the cyclone fencing in an attempt to get them off of their ears. All of the
dogs noted below had flies actively biting their ears during the inspection.
***A female German Shepherd (microchip #029323117) had flies on both ears and approximately a quarter of the
top surface of the left ear towards the tip was bloody and did not have fur.
***A male German Shepherd (microchip #029319868), a male German Shepherd (#0A01564058), a female
German Shepherd (#0A01394871) and a male American Eskimo (#0A01533038) all had flies actively biting the tips
of both ears.
***A female American Eskimo (microchip #7F7A242A15) had flies on both ears with blood present on the right ear.
Failure to prevent or treat injuries relating to fly bites directly impacts the comfort of the animals and increases the
risk of more serious health issues from these pest bites. The above listed dogs must receive veterinary care and an
effective plan for treating and preventing injuries from fly bites must be implemented to ensure the health and
well-being of the dogs. Correct by 24 June 2014.
Once a pest control problem was identified by the inspectors during the inspection, the licensee used a product
called Manna Pro Equine Fly & Mosquito Repellent on areas of the dogs which are being irritated by flies and
insects. The licensee is spraying this product directly on open wounds and sores around the animal(cid:25)s faces. The
directions specifically state that it is harmful if absorbed through the skin and it does not indicate on the label that it
is safe for domestic animals. The written program of veterinary care plan approved by the attending veterinarian
does not specify instructions on how to eradicate pests on or around animals. An external parasite plan must be
created and followed using only products or chemicals approved by a veterinarian in order to promote good
husbandry practices and for the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by 24 June 2014.Additionally, a female American Eskimo (microchip #7F7A242A15) had a dime-sized area of dry skin with no fur just
below the wrist joint on the right paw. The licensee was unaware of this health issue and therefore no veterinary
care was provided. Failure to provide veterinary care can lead to discomfort or more serious health effects. This dog
must be evaluated by an attending veterinarian for diagnosis and prescribed treatment, if necessary. Documentation
must be maintained by the licensee on any evaluations, diagnosis and treatment provided. Correct by 27 June
2014.

***A female American Eskimo (microchip #7F7A242A15) had flies on both ears with blood present on the right ear.
This animal also had a swollen, hairless lump on her front paw. The licensee stated she had no knowledge of when
or how this happened.
Failure to conduct adequate daily observation leads to health issues not being identified and being promptly
addressed. This could result in discomfort to the animals and increases the risk of more serious health issues from
these identified health concerns. The above listed dogs must receive veterinary care and adequate daily
observation must be conducted to ensure that health concerns are identified in a timely manner and to provide for
the overall health and well-being of the dogs. Correct by 24 June 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General requirements.There are a few areas throughout the facility that still have sharp points.
***There are still two enclosures with a large sharp hook attached to posts at eye level to the dogs housed within.
This was located in the two sheltered portions of the enclosures just south of the north shed. One dog was housed
in each enclosure.
***The outdoor enclosure just south of the whelping building now housing 2 German Shepherds, still contains the
homemade dog house that acts as the sole shelter from the elements. Multiple sharp screw heads are still present
protruding out of each wall inside the shelter so that the shelter cannot safely be used.
***The sheltered portion of the enclosure just south of the north shed housing one Springer Spaniel still has an
unraveled area of cyclone fencing at the bottom of the gate.
Sharp points present physical hazards that could injure the dogs. Repair, remove or replace these sharp points or
edges to prevent injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
The southern enclosure housing 2 American Eskimos and the indoor/outdoor enclosure housing 1 German
Shepherd and 1 Springer Spaniel had more than a day's worth of feces present.

Failure to remove excreta daily from primary enclosures could increase disease hazards, pests and odors and lead
to soiling of the animals. Remove the feces from these enclosures and maintain daily removal of excreta in all
enclosures to reduce these risks and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises
There was an overgrowth of weeds and grass throughout the outdoor kennel areas. Some of this overgrowth was
at least chest high. There was an excessive accumulation of flying insects noted at and around the facility during
this inspection and several animals noted in this inspection report were directly affected in a negative way because
of these insects.
Failure to control weeds has increased pest problems and is hindering cleaning practices. Control weeds to facilitate
cleaning of the premises and to assist in pest control. Correct by 01 July 20143.11(d) DIRECT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control
The excessive buildup of excreta in some of the enclosures is attracting flies. There was a large presence of flies
and mosquitos throughout the indoor and outdoor areas of the facility. There were several areas of standing water
including a grey wheel barrel, a bucket of rain water, and a large round container of water that the licensee stated
was for the geese on the property, that were inundated with small wiggling and swimming insects and insect larva.
Several dogs are noted on this report as being directly impacted by the flies. The dogs have varying degrees of
irritation to their ears including scabbing, dried blood and/or open bloody sores. These bites can be painful and
could lead to more serious health issues for the dogs. Some of the dogs were observed shaking their heads or
rubbing against fencing to get the flies off. In addition, the flies may contaminate the food or spread disease by
landing on excreta followed by landing on the food.
Failure to provide and practice a pest control plan that addresses flies and parasites is directly impacting the
animals and may spread disease or contaminate the food. Develop and maintain a pest control plan for the flies to
ensure the health and well-being of the dogs. Correct by 27 June 2014.
