HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a heavy accumulation of brown to black matter adhered to the inside washdown of the large adult/whelping
building. In addition, the outside washdown of this building has a large amount of feces and brown to black matter
adhered to the washdown. The feces and organic matter are contributing to the odor within the facility and can
attract unwanted pests and insects. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. The Licensee must have a routine for
cleaning for the facility to include all washdowns.

3.11(b)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is one enclosure of the small adult building that has chew damage around the frame of the door that has
caused raw wood to be exposed and no longer allows for cleaning. In addition, there are 4 resting surfaces, 4
enclosure dividers and 2 whelping box dividers in the large adult/whelping building with an excessive amount of
chew damage. The areas with chew damage have a heavy accumulation of dark matter adhered to the area of
chew damage or have allowed raw wood to be exposed and no longer allow for proper cleaning of the surface.
Surfaces that do not allow for proper cleaning can expose the animals to disease hazards. All surfaces with chew
damage must be replaced, repaired or resurfaced to allow proper cleaning and sanitization of the primary enclosure.
