FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The insulated container used for a shelter structure for 3 black bears had a portion of the wall damaged, leaving two
holes approximately 4 inches square with insulation material exposed. This material can be accessed and ingested
by the bears and the damage to the wall poses a risk to its structural strength.
The housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fence.
The perimeter fence for the outdoor housing facilities for 5 brown bears and 3 black bears does not meet the
requirements for dangerous animal facilities:
--There is no perimeter fence along the west side of the facility behind the brown bear enclosure extending to the
northwest area behind the black bear enclosure.
--There is fencing on the northwest side that is contiguous with the black bear enclosure fencing (<3 feet from the
enclosure) and then an 8 foot chain link fence with barbed wire at the top begins again near the keeper access gate
(<3 feet for approximately 1 foot, then >3 feet after access gate), extending to north-northwest corner. There are
several areas along the bottom of this stretch of perimeter fence where there are gaps >6-8 inches high, which
would not restrict animals from entering the facility.
--No perimeter fence is present between the north-northwest area of the facility but an 8 foot high perimeter fence
topped with barbed wire begins again at the east side of the facility (public access gate area) extending to the south
which has an 8 foot high fence topped with barbed wire.
Having a perimeter fence that is incomplete, damaged, or that is not at least 3 feet from outdoor primary enclosures
housing bears cannot restrict animals or unwanted persons from entering the facility and prevent them from cominginto contact with the bears or be able to act as a secondary containment should any of the captive bears escape
from their enclosures.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to
bears and fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the
Administrator.
