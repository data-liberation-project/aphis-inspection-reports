Sec. 2.40 Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors). (b)(2)
**** During the inspection heard puppy whining and looked into enclosure and seen the left front leg missing fur and
the mother was grooming the puppy. The puppy number is 2016-69 a cavalier/poodle mix. I asked licensee to pull
the puppy out of pen to better observe the puppy, that is when I saw the rear paws missing fur and the affected
areas are red and a cream colored puss like material observed in the affected areas. Licensee said the mom killed
the other puppy and asked if its time to retire the mom. Told licensee that puppy must be taken to the attending
veterinarian today. The excessive grooming behavior that mother is doing is harming the puppy health and well
being. Daily observation of all animals in the facility to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries
when needed and or stop them from getting worse.
Licensee called while I was writing report to tell me that the vet had euthanized the puppy.
