ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:45 pm on
21-Feb-18.
The inspector arrived at the facility at 3:45 pm and knocked on the door to the house, called the phone number and
left a message. The inspector waited 30 minutes and then left the facility. The licensee called the inspector later
that evening and suggested that the inspector should have called her cell phone, but the inspector had looked for
any additional phone numbers in the customer's file and was unable to find any.
