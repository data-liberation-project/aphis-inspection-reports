ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I arrived at the facility at approximately 11:50 am. I called the President and got the answering machine. I left a
message that I was at the facility to conduct an inspection. The President called me back to say she and the
Director of Animal Care were unable to do an inspection at that time. I let her know it would be an attempted
inspection and I left the premises at 12:00 pm. A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials
during the inspection process at 11:50 am on 06/18/2014. A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
