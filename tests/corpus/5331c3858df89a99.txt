HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An approximately 8 inch X 6 inch section of ceiling material directly outside the capuchins(cid:25)' primary enclosure was
torn exposing insulation material. A capuchin was observed reaching and grasping this area of the ceiling through
the fencing of the enclosure. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that
they are structurally sound for the species housed in them, and they must be kept in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to ensure their well-being. A system of maintenance and repair must be in place.
