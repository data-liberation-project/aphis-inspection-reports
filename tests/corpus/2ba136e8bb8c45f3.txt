2.126(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 10:30a.m. on 05/22/19.
Upon arrival, I knocked on the door and an unidentified man answered. I identified us as being from the UDSA and
asked for the licensee. The licensee came to the door and I said hello and told her that we were there to do an
inspection. The licensee indicated that she would not allow the police officer that was accompanying the inspection
team to go back to the animal area. I asked if she was refusing the inspection. At that time she stated that " You can
go back there but not the officer." I explained that "the officer must accompany us today". The licensee then
refused inspection and again stated that " You can go back there but not the officer." The USDA APHIS AC
inspectors left the premises without conducting an inspection.
