At 12:15PM USDA officials arrived at the premises to conduct a routine inspection. The licensee stated that the facility
was closed for the winter and that USDA officials would not be allowed to conduct an inspection until the facility was open
for business on March 1st. USDA officials explained that the facility must allow USDA inspections to occur during the
winter months, and reminded the licensee that this issue had been discussed at length last year. The licensee stated that
he was not open for business and that an inspection would not be allowed today. USDA officials stated that this would be
documented as a refusal of inspection which is a serious issue. The licensee stated that it wasn't a refusal because the
facility wasn't open for business. USDA officials explained that business hours must occur each week. The licensee
reiterated that no inspection would be allowed until March 1st.

This exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
