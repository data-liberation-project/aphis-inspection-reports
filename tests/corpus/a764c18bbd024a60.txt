RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently the licensee has not been keeping detailed records of the puppies born to the regulated animals in a
manner that would allow for traceability utilizing a puppy ID number or any other identification system.
Proper puppy records are important for traceability and management of the regulated animals and their offspring.
The licensee musk keep records that include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or
under his or her control. The records should include a puppy ID number or name for proper identification of that
animal and from which female it was born from.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Currently the indoor and outdoor cement floors in the primary enclosures of the regulated animals are not sealed
and are not impervious to moisture. The floors are cement and the inside wall has a portion of cement block that is
not sealed or impervious to moisture.
Any surface that is not impervious to moisture can not be cleaned and sanitized properly according to the AWA
regulations and standards. The porous surfaces can hold dirt, grime and bacteria that can not be sanitized properly.

All floor and wall areas in contact with the animals that are made of a hard material such as wire, wood, metal, or
concrete must be impervious to moisture. All cement surfaces must be sealed to allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization.
