3.129 REPEAT
FEEDING.
*** The facility is currently raising two tiger cubs that are approximately 6 weeks old. The cubs are currently on KMR
formula with some additional turkey baby food. The facility does not have a diet plan to transition them to solid foods
over the next few months. Tiger cubs are at high risk for developing vitamin and calcium deficiency problems like
metabolic bone disease if not given an appropriate diet at this critical time period. An approved diet plan by the
attending vet needs to be implemented for their health and well- being.
This was a focused inspection on the two tiger cubs.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
