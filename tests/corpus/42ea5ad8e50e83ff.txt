FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. The front side of the upper pig enclosure has missing aluminum ties on some of the lower
chain-link supports. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Additional ties need to be installed on the front side of the upper
pig fence to prevent injury to the animals and to contain the animals securely. Correct by May 6, 2017.
