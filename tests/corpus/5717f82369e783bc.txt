2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There was one container of Pyrantel Pamote Solution with an expiration date of 07/2015 and one 250 ml
container of Vetericyn VF with an expiration date of 11/2014. Both medications were intermingled with other
products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The effectiveness of the
dosage level and expected results could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated if these medications
are administrated past the recorded expiration date. In addition, the usage of expired medications on regulated
animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice. The licensee must ensure that all medications
used at the facility have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 12/18/15.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 12/3/15 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
