INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and reviewed during the
inspection did not contain written assurance from the principal investigator that the activities do not unnecessarily
duplicate previous experiments.
Without such assurance from the principal investigator, the IACUC cannot assure that the use of animals or the
procedures conducted thereon are novel and necessary to obtain new information.
The principal investigators on all currently approved protocols must provide such written assurance to the IACUC.
Further, future protocols must include such assurance prior to approval by the IACUC.
Correct by: August 26, 2016 for current protocols and from today forward for future protocols.
This inspection was conducted Veterinary Medical Officers Drs. Pamela Smith and Michael A. Schnell.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
