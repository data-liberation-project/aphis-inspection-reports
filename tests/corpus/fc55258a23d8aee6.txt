3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In Building 9, the sides of an enclosure with two adult hound dogs were made of wire and were rusted to the point
that they were severely pitted. Excessive rust does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization and can result in
unstable enclosures. The licensee must ensure that any surfaces that come in contact with the dogs are free of
excessive rust.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The concrete floors inside most of the buildings had a layer of a yellowish-brown algae-like substance on them. The
facility representative stated that bleach is the method of sanitization used. However, when questioned further, it
became apparant that the facility was using a bleach solution that was only about half the strength recommended by
the bleach manufacturer. Improper sanitization methods will not provide proper disinfection and will not destroy
microorganisms that can be harmful to the health of the animals. The licensee must ensure that a proper
sanitization method is used to reduce disease hazards on all hard surfaces.

The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and with a facility representative.
