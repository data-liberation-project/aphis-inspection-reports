3.6(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure made of wood containing two dogs has not been sealed. This doesn't allow for the enclosure to be
easily sanitized. The enclosure must either be sealed or the walls and floors need to be replaced with a material
that can be readily sanitized. Correct by 8/23/17.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A feeder for two dogs had grime built up on the inside of it. It appeared it had not been cleaned in some time. I
asked the licensee how often the feeders are sanitized and he said they were last done in the spring. Not sanitizing
the feeders every two weeks doesn't ensure that the various types of germs (such as viruses, bacteria, parasites,
etc.) have been killed. All feeders must be sanitized every two weeks or more often as necessary. Correct by
8/23/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
