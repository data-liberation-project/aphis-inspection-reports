3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(1) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: The two guinea pig enclosures housing two
guinea pigs each have an excessive accumulation of excreta. More feces are visible than the bedding material.
Animals standing in fecal material are potentially exposed to bacteria and parasites. The licensee must ensure that
the guinea pig enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks and cleaned often enough to prevent an
accumulation of excreta. Correct by June 30, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility president.
