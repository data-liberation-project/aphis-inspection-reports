3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several dead flies/insects were observed laying on the floor inside the main walk-in freezer located at the facility's
food storage building/commissary. The majority of the dead insects were lying in close proximity to the latch door
seal. Due to ice accumulation (condensation) in the walls and door latch area the freezer's door could not be
properly closed with an adequate seal; insects gained access into the freezer through a 1/2 inch gap at the door's
seal. Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration,
molding, or contamination by vermin. Also, facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from disease and medical conditions related to food contamination. The licensee
needs to repair or replace the defective freezer's seal as soon as possible to avoid any potential health hazards to
all regulated animals at the premises.
