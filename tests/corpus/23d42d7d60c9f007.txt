2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**It was noted during today's inspection that "King" (microchip # #0006CEBC44) appeared to have lost more weight
since the last inspection on April 28, 2017. The flank area appears more sunken in appearance, in addition to
"King" being more depressed and listless. "King" was not interested when offered food nor was he willing to move
when his name was called or prodded to move by the facility manager. Although "King" has been seen by the
attending veterinarian, no diagnostic tests have been performed, however, Vetra Mega Probiotics and VetOne
PancrePlus has been given which does not seem to be an effective treatment.
**Continued lack of appropriate veterinary care leads to pain and suffering in animals. Attending veterinarian must
reassess King’s condition and the current treatment to determine if further measures need to be taken.
