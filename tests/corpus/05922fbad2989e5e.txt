SANITATION.
The weeds around the cougar enclosure have become excessive due to recent heavy rains. Weeds were knee
high and above around the animal's enclosure between the enclosures and the perimeter fence. These weeds can
become a haven for pests and vermin. Weeds must be cut down and then controlled to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry.
