PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection there were sharp points and broken wires in the dividers between the dogs in 5 exterior
enclosures of the sheltered building, to the east, and the enclosures were on the east side of the building. All of the
broken wire in the dividers and sharp points seen were in contact with the dogs. Some of the wire dividers were
also loose from the bottom wire and some broken wires were on the bottom enclosure wire.
The applicant must replace or repair the broken or loose wire throughout the entire facility and in every enclosure to
prevent the potential for injury to the dogs.
