Veterinary care for dogs.
There was not a written Program of Veterinary Care for Dogs (PVC) signed by the Attending Veterinarian available for
review at the time of the inspection that addressed each of the requirements for the adequate veterinary care for dogs that
are outlined in the AWA.

Per this Section, each research facility must develop a written Program of Veterinary Care for Dogs signed by the
Attending Veterinarian. The PVC must include details for the following topics for the adequate veterinary care of the
dogs: complete physical examination; vaccinations; sampling and treatment of parasites; and preventative care and
treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, and teeth
unless otherwise required by a research protocol approved by the IACUC at the research facility. Correct by 8/8/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 7/7/22 with facility representatives.
