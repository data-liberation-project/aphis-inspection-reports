3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An indoor/outdoor enclosure housing three dogs has a large, rough edged hole in the interior wall of the enclosure
next to the access door. The hole is in the interior wall only, with a solid exterior wall behind it. This hole can be
reached by the dogs, and poses a potential threat of injury and/or limb entrapment. Licensee must relocate the
dogs to an appropriate enclosure, and ensure the wall is properly repaired before returning animals to the affected
enclosure.
Corrected on the spot.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
