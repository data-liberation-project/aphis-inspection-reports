HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of wood shavings being used for the Cotton-Top Tamarin and Ring-Tailed Lemur bedding and an open
box of wood wool being used for Orangutan bedding are not being stored in a tightly covered, leakproof container.
Open and unprotected supplies of food and bedding are at risk of spoilage and contamination by vermin/pests. The
licensee must ensure that only the food and bedding currently being used may be kept in animal areas, and when
not in actual use, open food and bedding supplies must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to
prevent spoilage and contamination. This was corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
