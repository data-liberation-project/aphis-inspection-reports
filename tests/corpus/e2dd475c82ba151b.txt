2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Over the past year, several of the Alpaca's have been euthanized by the licensee because he diagnosed the
animals with Meningeal worm. He stated that he was aware of the signs of the brain worm paralysis and that over
the course of a few days the animals would decline rapidly. The license did not convey this information to the
attending veterinarian prior to euthanasia. Per this regulation and because the licensee has a consultant agreement
with the attending vet, there must be a method of direct and frequent communication so timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health and well-being is conveyed. This needs to be addressed and this method
of communication put into place for the overall health of the animals at the facility.
*** Currently one ring tail lemur has a section of hair on the tail at the base of the body that is soaked with urine and
looks matted. According to the licensee this lemur has had this issue before where she urinates on herself and after
a while the behavior stops and her tail looks normal again. This is an abnormal behavior for lemurs to urinate on
themselves and could indicate a health or behavioral problem. This issue needs to be conveyed to the attending vet
or a vet that has specialized experience with non human primates for its health and well being.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** The lights over the spider monkey enclosure were out at the time of the inspection and it was very dark in their
area. These lights need to be replaced to provide the animals with a diurnal light cycle for their health and well
being.

3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The lemurs housed indoors have very limited enrichment or cage complexity in their enclosures. There is onlyone shelf and a rope for cage complexity on one side of the enclosure. The other side of the enclosure has little
complexity. In addition the foraging opportunities are limited to hay which is thrown on top of the enclosure and
some food scattered on the ground.
*** The spider monkey enclosure also needs to have additional cage complexity added to the enclosure. There is
one shelf and one rope hanging for two monkeys. There is no other increased cage complexity including objects to
manipulate or food foraging opportunities other than hay on the top of the enclosure. These monkeys should have
additional complexity to promote brachiation throughout the enclosure and not just on the chain link mesh.
These enclosures need to be addressed and additional enrichment options given for the psychological health of the
animals taking into consideration the animals are housed indoors for 5-6 months of the year.

3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The non human primates were recently moved into their indoor housing for the winter months. The enclosures
had not been cleaned and sanitized since they were moved last spring and as a result there was a build up of grime
and debris along the bars and chain link. These enclosures must be sanitized at regular intervals for the health of
the animals and to reduce disease hazards. In addition several sections of the enclosures are showing signs of rust.
Once the area becomes rusted it can no longer be effectively sanitized, so this rust needs to be removed and
sealed to facilitate cleaning of the enclosures.
