Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were several animals observed with health conditions requiring consultation and treatment by a veterinarian.
The brown alpaca observed on the inspection on 3/2/22 with an abnormal left eye was observed to still have thick white
discharge in the left eye. The licensee began treating the eye with sodium chloride ophthalmic ointment without the
guidance of a veterinarian. The ointment being used was expired (expiration date 2/2021.)
The bobcat that had been observed on the inspection on 3/2/22 was not observed to be limping on today's inspection.
However, the licensee did not consult a veterinarian or administer any treatments when the animal was seen limping.
The spiny mouse observed on the inspection on 3/2/22 with a wound on the right hind leg had been separated and was
being treated with Animax (antibiotic/anti-inflammatory ointment) but the licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian.
The second spiny mouse observed with a tail wound on the inspection on 3/2/22 had not been examined by a
veterinarian. The licensee stated she had not observed the injury in this animal and was not administering any treatment.
The degu observed with an injury on the back above its tail on the inspection on 3/2/22 was separated and was being
treated with Animax ointment but the licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian.
Health conditions such as abnormal eyes, skin wounds, and lameness can cause pain and distress and worsen if not
treated appropriately in consultation with a veterinarian.


The licensee must ensure that daily observations are being performed and that a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is in place so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.

Space requirements.
The facility has degus and spiny mice housed in enclosures that do not provide the animals the ability to get away from
more aggressive or dominant animals. There are no visual barriers and there were animals observed with wounds.
Inadequate space can result in injuries and fighting which can cause pain and distress in the animals.
The facility must have enclosures that are constructed and maintained to provide sufficient space to prevent overcrowding
that leads to fighting and injuries in the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
