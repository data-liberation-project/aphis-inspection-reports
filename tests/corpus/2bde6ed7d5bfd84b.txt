ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:45am and
10:55am on 13-Jun-17.
Attempts to make contact with the licensee were initially done at 9:45 am by knocking on the licensee's door,
honking the vehicle's horn, calling listed facility contact numbers and leaving voicemails and waiting for 30 minutes
in the licensee's driveway. At 10:55 am upon return to the facility, inspectors spoke to two individuals who relayed
that neither the licensee nor any facility representatives would be available to walk inspectors through an inspection
for the rest of the day.
