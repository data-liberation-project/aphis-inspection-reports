MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on20-JUN-17 at 12:00.
On June 20, 2017 the USDA inspector attempted to reach the IACUC Administrator upon arrival to the facility and
received information from the security desk at St. Elizabeth Hospital that the company has been closed since
August 2015. The USDA inspector emailed Genesys representatives and the emails were sent back as invalid
addresses.
This inspection and exit interview could not be conducted since the facility is no longer there.
