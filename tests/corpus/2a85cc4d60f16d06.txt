ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Pomeranian "Scooter" (microchip #0A01687778) has a severe amount of a brown to gray thick
accumulation of tartar on the left and right cheek teeth. The gums along the bottom edge of the affected teeth were
red, swollen and irritated.
A male tan colored Chihuahua "Caesar" has moderate accumulation of tartar on all molars. The gums along the
edge of the back cheek teeth were red and swollen. The left front foot had a small round red draining lesion in the
space between the toes.
A female Dachshund "Reba" (microchip #057-561-007) has an extremely severe accumulation of gray to brown
dental tartar and hair and/or debris on all outer surfaces of the teeth. There is a creamy white discharge along the
gum line of all the upper teeth. The gums were swollen and very red with areas of erosion. The gum line above the
left upper incisor and canine was severely eroded such that a space between the jaw and tooth was visible. A firm
swelling about 2-3cm in size was felt under the skin under the jaw on the left side of the neck. The right rear foot
had a toenail that had curved under to touch the foot pad.
Dental and foot conditions such as these can be painful or distressful to the animal and can lead to further health
complications. The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate and effective treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at
all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the south side of the small dog building there are wire panels separating the enclosures. Two of those wire
panels are rusted and broken at the bottom near the flooring. The broken areas have sharp points that protrude
downward into the enclosure. Sharp points present an injury hazard to the animals. All cages must be constructedso they have no sharp points or edges that can injure the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The metal food bucket for the male Labrador has an excessive buildup of brown food debris and grime coating the
interior surface.
The three outdoor portions of the enclosures housing three adult dogs contain an excessive amount of feces. In
one enclosure the feces has become impacted and smeared into the floor. In the enclosure housing the male
Labrador there is a large pile of feces in the center of the floor and multiple smaller piles around it. In the final
enclosure there are feces scattered across the flooring. The licensee stated that she removes the feces daily.
In the small breed dog building there are two enclosures, containing four dogs, that have dirt, hair, mineral and
feces buildup along the bottoms of the walls and beneath the access door. One enclosure has dried feces and hair
compacted onto the center of the flooring. The metal access doors in two enclosures, containing four dogs, have an
excessive buildup of dark colored dirt and grime coating the surface. Buildup of feces, dirt, grime, hair, and food
debris can increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles must be sanitized at least once every two weeks or as
often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards. The
licensee must clean and sanitize all the affected enclosures and the food bucket. The licensee must ensure that all
surfaces of primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized to support the health and well-being of the animals.
