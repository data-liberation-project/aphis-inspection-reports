2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
Several animal enclosures do not have sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing
public. Two enclosures (fox and adult dingos) do not have a barrier between the public and the animals other than the
enclosure fence. Other enclosures (wolves/wolfdogs, coatimundis and serval) have insufficient barriers. The barrier
consists of a single rope. The ropes can easily be stepped over or pushed aside (are loose and low) or do not encompass
the enclosure (people can just walk around the barrier). No attendant is on duty at these enclosures. Sufficient distance
and/or barriers are required to assure the safety of the animals and the public. The facility shall assure that during public
exhibition there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public. Correct by
1/19/23.
2.134(a)

Contingency planning.
The facility has not yet developed and documented a contingency plan for the animals in the event of an emergency or
disaster which could reasonably be anticipated. The facility does have a Safety Plan in place for people and a plan for
Animal Escapes. A contingency plan is necessary to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing


and care of the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. The facility shall develop and document a contingency
plan to provide for the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. Correct by 11/30/22.
