2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian had not been on site or otherwise seen the sheep and goats in over one year. Also, the
written Program of Veterinary Care had not been reviewed by the exhibitor and the veterinarian in many years.
It is the responsibility of the exhibitor to employ an attending veterinarian, with whom a written program of veterinary
care should be reviewed at least annually. The exhibitor should ensure that the attending veterinarian makes and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises, at least once a year, or as any problems arise. Failure to engage an
attending veterinarian in the care and husbandry decisions about the animals could be detrimental to their
well-being.
To be corrected by 8/1/14.
2.131(b)(1) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A ram had wool so overgrown that it touched the ground. The wool was matted, and impeded the animal's gait,
made it difficult to assess the animal's body condition, put the animal at risk of discomfort, skin problems, and
overheating.
Exhibitors should provide proper husbandry, and ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully
as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical
harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected immediately.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The sheep and goats were located in an enclosure that does not provide adequate shade. Average temperaturesfor the coming week were around 90 degrees Farenheit, and sunny. When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or
discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept
outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight. Although there were some trees present around the perimeter
of the enclosure, they did not provide reliable shade at all times of the day.
To be corrected immediately.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In the sheep and goat enclosure there was a substantial accumulation of dry feces, to the point that there was no
section of ground larger than three inches which was ot covered by fecal pellets. The facility representative stated
that the feces had not been removed for several weeks.
Feces should be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein, and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. A large accumulation of dried fecal
material, such as in this case, could present a significant disease and oder hazard in the event of rain.
To be corrected by 7/5/14.
An exit interview was conducted with the exhibitor.
