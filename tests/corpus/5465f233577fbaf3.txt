ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Poodle # 90011800377240 had lesions on the front and back of the upper right rear leg. Both the front
and back lesions were approximately 1.5 inch x .75 inch. The lesions on the front of the leg appeared to have
multiple small lesions covering this area. These lesions were scabbed over. The lesion on the back of the leg, the
edges of the lesion were black with the center being red and tacky, After pointing out the dog, the licensee stated
they had clipped the hair and treated the dog with Vetericyn spray but didn't remember when. When asked if this
was documented, licensee said it was in their treatment book. The licensee also stated they haven't recently been
treating the dog because the wounds were scabbed over and healed, and the breeding male must have rubbed
against the lesion, since she's in heat. This dog had not been examined by a veterinarian, the only documentation
at the facility of any treatment given to the dog, on their documentation in the last month they had "treated 1 poodle"
on 11/27. This dog’s conditions could be due to injury, infection or other veterinary medical conditions. The licensee
must consult a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment
plans are developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and provide it to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
