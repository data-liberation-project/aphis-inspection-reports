Outdoor housing facilities.
The left side of the vervet enclosure that faces the main public path does not have a public barrier. A barrier is required
between the public and nonhuman primates to restrict physical contact. A barrier must be installed at least 3 feet from the
vervet monkey enclosure to ensure the public does not contact the monkeys.
