PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two enclosures, measuring 3 feet by 2 feet and providing 6 feet of space housed two rabbits weighing over 4
kilograms, based on weights recorded the week before inspection in the animal records. Each rabbit weighing
greater than 4 Kg is required to have 4 square feet of space. Adequate floor space in primary enclosures is
essential in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the rabbits. Overcrowding can result in stress, disease,
and injury. During the inspection, the rabbits were moved to enclosures providing sufficient space.
Corrected during inspection.
Exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
