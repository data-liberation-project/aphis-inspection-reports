2.32(c)(3) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
A PI self-reported to the Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM) the deaths of two GPs post-procedure. The PI
requested DCM veterinary review. The DVM veterinarian determined the anesthetic monitoring was inadequate.
Training and instruction of personnel in the proper use of anesthetics must be provided to minimize risk of adverse
events.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection. The DCM evaluated the procedures and made recommendations
for improvement which were successfully implemented.
3.28(a) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An adverse event was reported in the July 2017 IACUC minutes. A 4 month old guinea pig injured its leg in the
perforated floor of newly-purchased bedding-free caging. It was thought to have gotten its foot caught in a corner
hole, which was slightly larger than the other holes in the flooring. The animal failed to respond to treatment and
was euthanized. Bedding-free flooring must allow waste to drop through, but protect feet and legs from injury. This
was corrected quickly after the incident, prior to the time of inspection. The study was concluded shortly after this
incident without further cases. The cage floors have since been replaced with solid-bottom flooring with bedding.
Another incident was reported in the October 2017 IACUC minutes. A guinea pig was injured when its leg got
trapped in a damaged igloo. The animal was euthanized when it did not respond to treatment. Husbandry staff had
not removed the damaged item as per policy. Items in the enclosure must be replaced when damaged to protect
from injury. This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by retraining the staff on evaluating enrichment items
for safety.
3.83
WATERING. The female marmosets were found without water on a Saturday morning. It was determined that when they were
returned to their home enclosure the previous afternoon, the IACUC-approved protocol for providing water was not
followed, and they were without water overnight. They were given water; the animals displayed no ill effects.
Animals must be given water as required by the IACUC-approved research protocol to ensure their health and
comfort.
This was corrected immediately by giving the animals water as per protocol. The situation was reviewed by the
IACUC prior to the time of inspection; laboratory staff was counseled regarding ensuring the protocol is strictly
followed.
3.130
WATERING.
A surgery was postponed due to a miscommunication in a lab that resulted in a ferret going without water for
approximately 24 hours. The Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM) veterinarian was notified; the ferret
recovered fully with no ill effects.
Water must be provided as often as necessary to ensure the health and comfort of the animal. This animal is under
an IACUC-approved protocol describing how and when water is to be provided, but the miscommunication resulted
in deviation from the protocol's requirements.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection. The lab personnel reviewed and revised their communication
procedures to minimize the possibility of recurrence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted on 7/17-19/2018 with facility personnel. A follow-up
communication was conducted by telephone on 7/26/2018.
