Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During the review of paperwork and records it was noted that there were no acquisition records for ferrets.

Appropriate documentation of acquired regulated animals is essential for proper identification, tracing forward and trace
back of the animals.

The licensee must correctly document records of acquisition for all regulated animals, including animals born on the
premises, and assure that all records are kept as required. To be corrected by October 8, 2021.
2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On August 19, 2021, a member of the public entered an area housing a young skunk. There were no employees or
attendants present at the time. The member of the public reached into a 75-gallon glass tank to pet the skunk and was
bitten on the hand.

People who are bitten by animals may suffer from pain, discomfort, or infection. Animals who bite humans may be injured


or stressed if the person is startled and hits, drops, grabs, or pushes the animal.

The licensee must ensure that animals are housed in enclosures which provide adequate distance or barriers between
the animal and the public to assure the safety of animals and the public. To be corrected by October 8, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
