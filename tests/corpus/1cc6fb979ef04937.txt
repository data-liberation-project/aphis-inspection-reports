CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Bird droppings were observed accumulating on top of the wood frame boards located above the enclosure pens.
The affected areas are located in the outdoor barn housing 63 dogs. The facility has no current effective pest
prevention program in place. No means to control or eliminate the birds were viewed during the inspection. Lack of
an effective program that controls birds can create unsanitary conditions and lead to potential health risks. Bird
feces may contain pathogens that could adversely impact animal health. The licensee must establish an effective
program of bird control for the health and well-being of the dogs. Correct by 5/2/19.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 4/18/19 were conducted with the licensee.
