ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs were observed to have dental problems that need to be evaluated for treatment by a veterinarian:
-Male Maltese "Rex" microchip 044-010-078 had upper back teeth (molars and/or premolars) that were loose to the
touch, were covered in hard dark material and had a bad odor coming from his mouth.
-Female poodle "Pearl" microchip 102-287-298 had hair stuck in between her lower front teeth (incisors) and gums.
Close evaluation revealed these teeth were loose to the touch.
Bad odors from the mouth, loose teeth to the touch, material between the gums and teeth and teeth covered in a
hard dark material are all signs of dental problems. Dental problems can be painful and can affect the overall health
of the affected dog. Ensure these two dogs are evaluated and treated by a veterinarian. ***Correct by May 2, 2015.
