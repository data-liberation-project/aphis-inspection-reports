Handling of animals.
On February 10, 2022, Wind Rose Aviation transported 8 Sphynx breed cats, born on October 6, 2021, according to the
documentation, to JFK on flight 7W7007 / AWB: 461-0003 2395.
On February 10, the temperature in Kiev, Ukraine was 37 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature at JFK, upon arrival at
3.59 am on February 11, 2022, was 39 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the registered handler, upon offloading from the
plane, one of the 8 Sphynx cats was noted to be dead. The deceased cat was in a crate with another cat that was wearing
its sweater. The deceased cat's sweater was in the crate and no longer on its body. The surviving cat was treated for
dehydration then released. According to handlers, there was an approximate 1 ½ -hour delay in the ability to offload the
cats.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age,
species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.

The crate containing the DOA cat did not have live animal labels anywhere on the crate nor did it have arrows indicating
the upright position. Live animal labels are necessary to indicate that live animals are present and the arrows to indicate
the upright position to protect the animals from harm.

Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it is clearly marked on top and on one or more sides with
the words “Live Animals,” in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct
upright position of the primary enclosure.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
