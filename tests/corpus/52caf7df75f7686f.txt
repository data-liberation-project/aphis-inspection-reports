FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Along the west side of the enclosure housing 3 adult Bobcats is exposed ground fencing that is usually covered with
dirt. The fencing has holes large enough for the feet to get caught and could potentially cause injuries to the
animals. Maintain all housing facilities so that they are structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
