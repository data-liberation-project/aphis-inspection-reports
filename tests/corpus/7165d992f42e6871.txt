ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
There was bottle of injectable sodium bicarbonate with an expiration date of April 2016 and a bottle of injectable
atropine with an expiration date of 3/16. Both of these expired medications were stored with other medications
currently in use and are therefore considered in use as well. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs,
fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not
constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs
are administrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The applicant must
ensure that all medications used are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary
practices. To be corrected by 20 May 2106.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility's Attending Veterinarian and Margaret A Shaver,
VMO in attendance.
