CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the Small Mammal House where there are multiple indoor exhibits, there were 2 live cockroaches observed in an
enclosure housing one common marmoset and one bettong. Behind the scenes of these exhibits, where food and
other animals are housed, there were many dead cockroaches and other bugs along the floor.
Pest control measures must be maintained to prevent the harborage of pests, i.e. insects. Effective pest control
measures must be identified and implemented to eliminate breeding and living areas for the cockroaches to
minimize exposure to pathogens that may cause illness. An effective program for control of insects must be
established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by
pests in animal areas.
