2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several IACUC approved protocols reviewed during this inspection did not include a complete description of the use
of animals.
*Protocols ETCR-16-0177 and ETCR-15-0167 included a minor surgical procedure. An appendix attached to each
protocol discussed general surgery principles to be followed but neither the protocol nor the appendix stated the
surgical procedure clearly and in detail. In addition there were no details of what anesthetic drugs were to be used,
how the animal was to be monitored during the surgery and what pre and post surgical procedures were to be
followed. Pain/discomfort relief measures were not stated clearly and in detail.
*Protocol ETCR-16-0177 discusses blood draws and blood volumes related to experimental procedures in the
protocol. An experimental timeline table shows these experimental blood draws but then also shows additional
blood draws for blood testing. These additional blood draws are not described in the protocol by timing or volume of
blood to be drawn.
*Protocol 16-0173 discussed euthanasia and gives the drug, dose and route for administration of the euthanasia
drug. The procedure description states that xylazine or acepromazine will be given prior to the euthanasia drug but
no dosages or routes of administration are noted.
A protocol must be complete in order to allow the IACUC to fully understand the procedures and uses the animals
will be undergoing so that the IACUC can adequately review a protocol to ensure that the protocol meets regulatory
guidelines. A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed
use of the animals. Correct from this day forward.
Exit conducted with undersigned IACUC chair.
