2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There were two dogs at the facility with matted fur. A brown female Poodle (# 0A02127518) had mats present
throughout its haircoat, including along the chest, legs and under the tail. Fecal material was observed matted in
the fur under the dog's tail. A white female Poodle (#0A01693137) also had mats present throughout its haircoat,
inlcuding along the chest, back legs and face. Some of these mats were also thick and closely adhered to the skin.
Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure these dogs are
groomed and must establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
*Note - The male Poodle (#051*832*613) and the male Maltese (109*838*262) which were previously identified with
veterinary care concerns during the inspection conducted on October 1, 2014 have been addressed.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements. (2) (i)
***There are thin sheets of a metal material surrounding the entrances to the shelter units for the outside
enclosures. Some of the corners of the metal sheets were buried under the gravel at the ground and some of the
corners were exposed. The corners that were exposed were either rounded or sharp and pointed. At least one of
the sharp corners of a metal sheet located near the ground was slightly bent outward at the entrance of a shelter
unit and was at a level where the dogs could easily come in contact with it. The sharp and pointed corners increase
the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed and maintained
so that they do not have any sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs and cats.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
No regulated activity can be conducted from this new site until it is in compliance.
