2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Female white and tan Chihuahua (MC# 0A0224678) had a thin body condition as evidenced by the prominent
and
visible hips, ribs and vertebrae. The licensee stated that the drop in body condition had just recently happened. At
time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted. Failure to maintain a good body weight can
indicate many medical problems including but not limited to parasites, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases and
dental problems. Licensee must maintain programs of veterinary care for all animals on the premises. Licensee
must have this dog seen by a veterinarian and document the follow-up care as directed by the veterinarian.
****Female red and white Boston Terrier (MC# 0A0227479) has two large lumps located between the back legs
behind the last two mammary glands. These lumps are about one and half inches diameter. The licensee stated
they were soft and squishy and have been present for several weeks. The dog has not been evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian. The lumps could indicate a serious condition. The dog needs to be evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.
The licensee shall keep documentation of the diagnosis, treatment and outcome.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
