3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inside the whelping building the first enclosure, containing one adult female and nine puppies, has an excessive
number of flies located on the puppies, on the dog food and on the enclosure walls. The second enclosure,
containing one adult female, has a wasp nest next to the access door. At the time of the inspection there are no
methods in place for the control of flies and wasps. The flies could cause contamination of the food source and
contact with wasps could have a negative impact on the health of the adult dogs and puppies.
An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs, and birds and mammals that are
pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas. The licensee must establish effective methods for controlling flies and
wasps in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
