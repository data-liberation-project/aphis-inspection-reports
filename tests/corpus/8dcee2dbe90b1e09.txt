2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At time of inspection a female Silky Terrier (Microchip number 932 001000632273) was noted to be listless in her
enclosure. Upon closer examination, the dog had a rectal temperature of 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit. A normal canine
temperature generally ranges from 101 to 102.5. It was noted that watery stool was coming from the dog's rectum
while taking the temperature. The dog had black gums, so the assessment for paleness could not be determined.
However, the gums were dry and tacky. The hydration status of the dog was assessed by tenting the skin to see if
the normal retraction was detected. However, the dog had long hair and an accurate assessment could not be
determined. The dog laid minimally responsive for the entire examination. At that time, the inspection was stopped
for the licensee to seek veterinary attention for the dog immediately.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection the whelping room had a very strong odor. The ventilation fan was not activated and the
licensee had to move an elevated enclosure to plug the fan in. It is unknown when the fan was last activated to
provide ventilation. The routine cleaning of the whelping room had not been conducted for the day. Ventilation must
be provided when animals are present to minimize odor. To promote the health and well-being of the animals
housed indoors, the licensee shall implement a proactive ventilation regimen to minimize odors.
