ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An inspection was attempted at the licensee's home site at 11:51 am on 12/08/2016. An adult (not a representative
of the licensee) at that location stated that the licensee was out of town exhibiting his animals. Inspector had left a
message by phone that he was at the home site for an inspection. At time of this inspection, no current itinerary
has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care that accounts for this travel. In the case of traveling exhibitors,
itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two days prior to any overnight travel.
The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended
for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site.
To be corrected by submission of an itinerary for all future travel in which regulated activities will be conducted.
This was an attempted inspection and exit interview was not conducted with the owner (attempted to contact by
phone- left message)
