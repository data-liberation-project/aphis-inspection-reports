ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:55pm on
15-AUG-17.
I arrived at the house at 1:55pm and knocked repeatedly at the door I called out, no one answered. I then went up
to the kennel knocked on the door and called out again. I called the phone number and left a message stating my
name, phone number, current time and that I wished to preform an inspection. I waited until 2:30pm and left.
