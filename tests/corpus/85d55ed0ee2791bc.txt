2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The following animals were cited on the Jan-13-2016 inspection report and were not examined by a veterinarian:
***A female, adult brown and white gobex (Ibex x domestic goat cross) walked with an abnormal gait. On today's
inspection the gobex still walked with a slightly abnormal gait and still has long hooves. The hooves on both front
legs were excessively long, to the point that they were curling causing the toes to rotate up and out and the heel to
drop. The licensee stated the animal had been pregnant, so they had waited to trim the hooves. Failure to
appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of
the facility s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate
hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
*** The right eye of adult male coati mundi appeared abnormal. On today's inspection, approximately half of the iris,
in the right eye, had a milky-white, thickened opaque area. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems
including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing.
Furthermore, not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting the health and well-being of the animal and has
the potential for injury.
***The camel calf has an abnormal swelling on its left hind hock. The swelling and condition of this animal has not
changed since the Jan-13-2016 inspection. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis,
treatment and re-evaluation can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
***The male ferret has generalized alopecia. Although some hair has regrown, the area from the shoulders to the
hips on the animals back is still hairless. Alopecia is often an indicator of disease. It can result from numerous
causes including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the
diagnosis and treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
***A newborn (24 hrs. old) male lamb appeared weak and was wheezing during the Jan 13-2016 inspection. The
lamb appeared normal during today's inspection. The licensee stated she suspected the animal had aspirated
during feeding and that had caused its wheezing and weakness. Failure to contact the attending veterinarianregarding the diagnosis and treatment of weak and sick animals can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong
suffering of the animal.
The licensee stated she has called the veterinarian several times regarding the above animals, but they were never
examined, as described in the Jan-13-2016 inspection report.
***On today's inspection, one black goat was noted to have an abnormal swelling of its left knee. The animal
caretaker stated he first noticed the hard swelling a couple of days ago. The caretaker stated he told the facility
owner about the knee and to contact the veterinarian. The facility owner stated she did not know about the goat's
condition and has not contacted the veterinarian regarding this animal. Swelling is an indicator of disease and can
often be painful. It can result from numerous causes including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact
the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and
prolong suffering of the animal.
The licensee must have all of the above mentioned animals (coati, camel calf, ferret, lamb, goats) examined by a
veterinarian, to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome
of this consultation must be provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the
veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian,
any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal
health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***Although there were no public members present during the inspection, the facility has been open to the public
since the Jan-13-2016 inspection. The facility has made no changes in the number of attendants present during
periods the facility is open to the public. The licensee stated to the VMO that there is no plan or provision in place
for an adequate number of attendants to oversee public contact with the animals. The licensee stated they would
use the two employees as attendants when the public is present. These employees would also be responsible for
the husbandry and daily care of all the animals at the facility. The VMO stated to the licensee that this would still be
inadequate as the employees would need to oversee the public contact, thus the husbandry and daily care would go
unfinished.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
***Three enclosures (4 camels, 10 sheep, 8 goats) still had dirty water receptacles or water receptacles that were
excessively rusted to the point they leak excessively and cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Water
receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the animals are providedwith clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate hydration. Water
receptacles should be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
***There were several bees noted to be surrounding the waterer in the camel enclosure housing two animals. Pests
can cause harm to the animals and can contaminate feed and water. The licensee must establish and maintain an
effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in all animal areas.
To be corrected by 3/10/16.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility has made no changes in the number of employees that care for the animals since the Jan-13-2016
inspection. During today(cid:25)s inspection, the two employees were present and involved in the daily husbandry and
facility maintenance. The licensee stated to the VMO that there is no plan or provision in place for an adequate
number of employees to maintain the professional husbandry standards described in the regulations and standards.
Additional, the facility has no plan for when employees call in sick, do not show up or have days off. The licensee
has also stated on previous inspections to the VMO that the facility will never be in compliance, as they do not have
the funds or resources to increase their staffing levels. During today(cid:25)s inspection, several animals were identified as
still needing veterinary examination and care. Additionally the facility has been cited (repeats) for waterers needing
repair or replacement and pest control.
Facilities are required to utilize a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional
husbandry standards described in the regulations and standards to ensure that the animals are kept in appropriately
maintained, sanitary facilities and receive appropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding, watering, and care.
The licensee must evaluate the current work load and staffing level and ensure that a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees are utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices
described in the regulations and standards.
The inspection was conducted with the animal caretaker.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility owner.
