2.8(h)
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The licensee moved several weeks ago without notifying the Regional Office of a change in address; therefore, an
inspection could not be performed. Notification of a change in address to the Regional Office within 10 days of the
change is necessary so that inspections of the animals can be conducted. The licensee must notify the Regional
Office of her new address as soon as possible.
2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at about 11:00
am and 2:00 pm on 06/02/2016.
Person that answered the door stated that the licensee no longer lived at this address, that the licensee had moved
to a different town several weeks earlier, and that no regulated animals were at the current address. A voicemail
message was left.
