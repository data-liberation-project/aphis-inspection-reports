2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
* The facility had reports of semi-annual inspections and reviews conducted in September of 2013 and September
of 2014 but none in-between. According to several IACUC members, the committee conducted a semi-annual
facility inspection and program review in the Spring of 2014. However, the facility was unable to produce written
documentation of those evaluations at the time of inspection. There was also no evidence that the Instituional
Official received a report of the Spring 2014 evaluations. Documentation of semi-annual inspections and reviews is
required for APHIS officials to ensure that IACUCs are appropriately evaluating the care, treatment, housing, and
use of animals at their facilities.
** The registrant must ensure that the IACUC prepares reports for all future semi-annual evaluations and submits
them to the Institutional Official. Furthermore, the registrant must ensure those reports are made available to
APHIS officials during inspections.
*** To be corrected by: 20 February 2015
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. A second exit interview
(specifically for IACUC members who were unavailable the day of inspection) is scheduled for 17 February 2015.
