3.125 REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an enclosure housing a single red kangaroo, sections of the enclosure fence is in poor condition with numerous
broken boards and numerous sharp points exposed to the enclosed animal. The smaller shelter doorway has
exposed metal rods on one side of the opening. The condition of this fence and shelter is a source of potential injury
to the animal, and could also allow escape from the enclosure. The fence needs to be repaired and maintained in
good condition. All sharp points exposed to the animal must be removed.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative, ODAFF law enforcement, and two USDA APHIS
AC VMOs.
