Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility has not updated the records since the last inspection with the exception of creating disposition records for
hedgehogs and sugar gliders sold. The current records do not contain the required information for the new exhibit animals
(one African Crested porcupine and two rabbits) or the two prairie dogs born since the last inspection. In addition, the
records did not account for the disposition information for the 16 rabbits and 7 prairie dogs on exhibit in 2019 but no
longer at the facility.
Complete and accurate acquisition and disposition records must be kept to allow for accurate identification of the animals
and to allow for medical and legal tracing. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and correctly
include all the required acquisition and disposition information. This information must include the name and address of the
person from whom the animals were acquired, the USDA license number of the person if licensed or the vehicle license
number and state and driver's license number and state if not licensed, the name and address of the person to whom and
animal was sold/give, the date of acquisition or disposition, the species of animal and the number of animals involved.

Facilities, general.


The enclosure housing the pigs is in need of repair. There are two holes under the fence between the pig and emu
enclosures that are large enough to allow an unwanted animal the size of a raccoon to enter the pig enclosure. In addition
a small tree and another plant have grown through and into the fencing along the drive to the facility and are in need of
trimming.
The fencing of the pig enclosure needs to be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the pigs from
injury and to contain the pigs.
Correct by 5/15/2021.

Facilities, outdoor.
No changes to the perimeter or enclosure fencing have occurred since the last inspection. The facility has not applied for
a variance. The facility exhibits the following species outdoors: prairie dogs, cavy and an African Crested porcupine. The
outdoor housing facilities for the prairie dogs and African Crested porcupine are enclosed by fencing acting as a perimeter
fence but it is not six feet high. The cavy are not fully enclosed within a complete perimeter fence as required.
A perimeter fence protects the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility and also functions as a secondary containment system for the
animals. The facility shall ensure that the outdoor housing facilities are enclosed by a perimeter fence at least six feet high
and more than three feet in distance from the primary enclosures or apply for written approval for fencing that does not
meet those requirements.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
