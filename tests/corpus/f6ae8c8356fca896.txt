3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an accumulation of used lumber, old gates, pieces of white PVC pipe and other discarded items leaning
against the outside of the adult dog building. Presence of such items on the grounds surrounding and in contact with
the animal housing structures could result in deterioration of the buildings' protective outer-covering. Such
conditions could also create areas where rodents and other pests would likely live and reproduce. Premises must
be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, and discarded matter in order to promote the general cleanliness of the
facility and to prevent pest infestation.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
