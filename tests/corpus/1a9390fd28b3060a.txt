2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Several expired or improperly labeled medications were found during the inspection:
**A box of Bordetella bronchiseptica Intranasal vaccines, which expired 05 Aug 2013, were found in the refrigerator
with the current supply of vaccines and other refrigerated medications.
**A syringe that had been labeled with pen with what appeared to be "Buprenorphine" didn't have an expiration date
or was so difficult to read that it could not be determined.
**Two bottles of hydrogen peroxide were found to be expired as of 08/2014.
**A bottle of injectable Banamine (exp. 7/2014) was comingled with current medications in the lock box in the large
animal barn and the Drug Expiration Monthly Check Form on this box showed it checked by a veterinarian on
8/21/14 and 9/2/14.
**The refrigerated drug supply in the large animal barn had an unlabeled syringe with a pink fluid, a box of Tetanus
Antitoxin vials that expired 15 Jul 2014, Intervet Equine Vaccination vial (exp. 15 Aug 2014), and 2 vials of Tetanus
Toxoid (1 exp. 23 Aug 14, 1 exp 19 Jul 14). The Drug Expiration Monthly Check Form for this refrigerator had not
been marked as being checked since 5/14.
The facility has a program to check drug stores for medical materials that are expired to remove them from current
drug storage but does not appear to be adequate to detect and remove expired medical materials from drug
storage areas to prevent their use which would not be an appropriate method to prevent, control, and treat diseases
and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain and distress
due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.
Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include:
the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A 5 month old kitten named Pebbles, ID# 83-4-395, had been diagnosed with a broken leg on 9/6/2014. A
diagnosis of a proximal tibial fracture near the growth plate was made and pain medications were given under the
direction of a Veterinary Instructor at the time of diagnosis. The kitten had been separated from her enclosure
mates and was on "cage rest" in a hospital that had no elevated resting platform as required under the housing
standards (3.6 (b)(4)). No documentation had been made at the time of this inspection on 9/10/2014 regarding a
plan for management or treatment of this kitten which should have included directions from a veterinarian regarding
housing enclosure restrictions, pain management duration, and plan for re-evaluation to determine course of healing
and use in teaching activities. The pain medication had been changed on 9/5/2014 but it could not be determined if
this was directed by a veterinarian as the treatment sheet was signed only by the Program Co-Directors. The
Program Co-Director had requested documentation from the Attending Veterinarian and other Veterinary Instructors
involved in the evaluation of this kitten but nothing was available at the time of this inspection. The electronic
medical records have been updated as of 9/11/2014 to reflect veterinary input but this was not documented at the
time of the inspection.
In order to ensure that animal's requiring veterinary care are receiving appropriate and timely treatment, especially
in the case of painful conditions like a bone fracture, records documenting the diagnosis and treatment plan, which
includes any specific needs to reduce pain and prevent further injury, shall be created, updated, and maintained so
APHIS and any other personnel involved in the care for these animal's can know what is being done and what the
expectations are for recovery and/or follow-up care.
A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems
of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by 9/16/2014.
3.6(a)(2)(10) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A Basenji-mix dog named Hudson, ID# 982000362183995, was noted by the APHIS AC VMO to be holding his left
hind foot up while in his primary enclosure. The dog was removed from the enclosure for examination and the left
hind foot was found to be swollen and pink when compared to the right hind foot. The dog would bear weight on the
foot but frequently held it up in the air and seemed tender when the foot was touched. No one had noted this
problem before the APHIS AC VMO had identified the problem. The slatted floor in the primary enclosure had gapsthat were wide enough to allow the toes of this dog and another adjacent Boston terrier dog's toes to pass down into
the gaps, posing a risk of injury to the toes and feet.
The facility does have rubber mats that can be placed in the primary enclosures to protect the dog's feet but had not
put mats in these two enclosures. Hudson's left hind foot appears to have been injured by the gaps in the slatted
floor.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they:have floors that are constructed in a manner
that protects the dogs' and cats' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow
the dogs' and cats' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.
To be corrected by 9/16/2014.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure housing 1 horse and 1 goat used for teaching had several wires with sharp ends protruding
into the enclosure, posing a risk of injury to the animals.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
Corrected during the inspection.
Inspection conducted with facility representatives on 9/10/2014. Exit interview conducted on site with facility
representatives on 9/16/2014.
