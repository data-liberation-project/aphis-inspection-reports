ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee sedated two animals using expired medications. The licensee sedated a black buck on 8-27-18 and
an elk on 9-1-18 using an expired BAM kit. Both of the animals did recover from sedation, however; the facility's
veterinarian indicated she didn't approve of the use of expired medications to sedate the animals. The use of
expired medications could be dangerous to the animals and people handling the animals.
Assure all medications are not expired and approved by the veterinarian prior to their use.
To be corrected: From this day forward.

PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
The licensee purchased a camel from an unlicensed source. The licensee was educated about purchasing camels
from unlicensed sources during the previous inspection on 7-26-18. This was documented on the teachable
moment worksheet dated 7-26-18. Since the last inspection, the licensee purchased another camel from an
unlicensed source and sold it to another licensee. Purchasing animals from unlicensed sources does not allow for
inspection to ensure their health and well-being at those sources.
Assure that animals are not obtained from unlicensed sources that are required to be licensed.
To be corrected: From this day forward.
This inspection was conducted with the licensee. A thorough verbal exit briefing was conducted with the licensee
on 10-5-18.
