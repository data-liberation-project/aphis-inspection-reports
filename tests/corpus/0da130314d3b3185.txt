2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- Camels saddled and available for rides were being tethered in an area of direct sunlight with no available shade.
At the time of inspection the ambient temperature was 93 degrees F. In warm, sunny environmental conditions
animals being exhibited or used for public rides should be provided adequate shade to help protect against
discomfort and overheating.
Corrected on the spot.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- In the petting zoo area, an enclosure holding 4 camels was open to the public. There were no public barriers, and
no readily identifiable attendants in the area. Numerous members of the public were observed feeding and
contacting the enclosed camels. This is a situation that poses risks to the camels and to the members of the public.
During periods of public contact with regulated animals, there must be a knowledgeable and readily identifiable
attendant present. This serves to help protect animals and public.
Correct from this point forward.
