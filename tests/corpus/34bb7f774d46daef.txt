1. At the time of this inspection it was noted that the 2 calves had crusty lesions around their eyes, on their ears,
and on their necks. There was also hairloss around these lesions. To ensure the health of these calves, and the
general public, these calves will need to be seen by the attending vet. All treatments will need to be documented.
