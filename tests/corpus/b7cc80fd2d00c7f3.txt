2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The owner of the kennel at this location was licensed as a Class A dealer from February 19, 2009 through March 1,
2013. The license was cancelled by the Department due to failure to renew by the owner. A search of Health
Certificates records in 2014 revealed the potential shipping of puppies from this location.
Animal Care staff met with the owner at the kennel on June 18, 2014. During that meeting the owner stated that he
had been selling and shipping puppies in sight unseen transactions. At that meeting, he stated that he now knew
and understood the regulations requiring a license in order to sell puppies in that manner and further stated that he
would no longer ship puppies or do sight unseen transactions. He also stated that if, in the future he decided to
resume shipping, he would apply for a license.
A recent search of records of animals shipped through South Bend Airport revealed the shipping of at least 6
animals between March 2016 and February 2017 from this kennel.
The number of adult female dogs (approximately 120 -130) on site is greater than the limit to be considered exempt
from the licensing requirements.
The sale and shipment of animals from a facility with more than 4 females requires a valid license.
Failure to be licensed results in a lack of oversight on the kennel operation by the Department. The Department is
responsible for ensuring that all animals are raised and sold in a manner that maintains their health and safety.
Immediately cease and desist the shipment of animals and the sale of any animal sight unseen until a valid license
has been issued by the Department.
An application was given to the kennel owner during this site visit.
The completed application should be mailed to USDA APHIS Animal Care Eastern Regional office, 920 Main
Campus Drive, Suite 200, Raleigh, NC 27606. Contact the office at (919) 855-7100 with any questions. Additional Inspectors
