ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1320 on
31-Jul-17. Records were available at the office, however we needed to inspect the animals and the licensee
reported scheduled obligations for the day that would not allow him to accompany us to the facility for an inspection.
End of report.
