FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence located just before the entrance surrounding the tiger, leopard, and other animal enclosures
needs to be secured to the ground. During the inspection I was able to easily lift the bottom of the wire fencing.
Perimeter fences must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that
it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
