Section 3.75 (c)(1)(i) Surfaces
**** The white cage that has the two Tamarin non human primates has white paint missing in areas and the metal is
rusting and starting to pit. The rust inhibits the ability of the surface to be cleansed and sanitized properly. It also
compromises the integrity of the enclosure. All enclosures must be free of excessive rust to ensure the required
cleaning and santization can be done. Free of excessive ensures that structral integrity is not not compromised.
Licensee has a second cage that he can swap the Tamarins in to after it has been cleaned and sanitized.
