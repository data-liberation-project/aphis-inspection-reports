ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shih tzu (“Mercury”, microchip # A02333001) has an emaciated body condition. A physical inspection of
the dog revealed the hips, backbone, ribs and shoulder blades are prominent and easily felt beneath the hair coat
and there is little to no body fat and muscle covering the animal. Although the dog has a long hair coat, the
inspector was able to visibly see the dog’s poor body condition while she was standing in her enclosure. This dog is
currently nursing six puppies. The dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for her body condition.
Female Poodle (microchip #036-010-303) has an emaciated body condition. A physical inspection of the dog
revealed the hips, backbone, ribs and shoulder blades are prominent and easily felt beneath the hair coat and there
is little body fat and muscle covering the animal. The dog appears depressed and lethargic and has not been
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for her body condition.
An emaciated body condition could be an indicator of a serious underlying health issue. These dogs must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment plan.
Correction date: Both dogs were transported to a licensed veterinarian at the time of the inspection.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least four enclosures, housing a total of four adult dogs and approximately 18 puppies, the heat lamps are
placed at the level of the dogs and do not have any guards to stop the dogs from touching the glass bulbs. Without
the protective guards, the dogs can come into direct contact with the glass bulb which could cause burns or injuries.

Housing facilities for dogs must be designed so that they protect the animals from injury. The licensee must remove
the glass bulbs from within the enclosures or cover the bulbs with a protective guard in order to ensure the animals
cannot come into direct contact with the bulbs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogsat all times.
Correction date: The heat lamps were removed from all enclosures at the time of the inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In at least five enclosures, housing approximately twenty-three puppies, the feet and legs of the puppies are
passing through the wire flooring. Openings in flooring that are large enough for feet and legs to pass through could
result in entrapment or injury to the puppy.
Enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs’ feet and legs from injury and
does not allow the dogs’ feet to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the flooring in a
manner that does not allow the feet and legs of the puppies to pass through any openings. The licensee must
ensure that the flooring in the enclosures is safe for the dogs at all times.
