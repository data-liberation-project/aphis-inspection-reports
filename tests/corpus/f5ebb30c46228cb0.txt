3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor enclosure for the Francois Langurs and the Siamangs there is a high metal support beam with rust /
corrosion and peeling paint. In the Chimpanzee indoor enclosure, there is missing and chipping paint, or other
surface material, on the floor and wall.
All surfaces in the housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be kept in good repair and maintained or replaced
on a regular basis, in order to facilitate adequate cleaning and disinfection, and to protect the animals from harm.
Peeling paint and corrosion presents an ingestion risk, and impede cleaning and disinfection.
To be corrected by July 1, 2015.
This was a focused inspection on:
- Handling of animals related to all electric and hydraulic gates in enclosures;
- All primates.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
