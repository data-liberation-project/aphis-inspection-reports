ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:00 am on
02-Feb-17.
** I arrived at the facility at 10:00 am. I called the facility at 10:58 am. The owner's wife came out to talk to me and
stated that she and her husband were unable to conduct an inspection at that time. I left the premises at 11:20 am.
