ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Lhasa (microchip #0A02043314, "Nelson's Dreamin Jeanie") has excessive matting of the hair coat. Large
matts are located across the top of the dog's back and are beginning to become tight against the skin. The dog also
has clumps of matted hair down the length of the right hind leg. Rope-like matts are hanging from under the right
ear and the ends of the matts have a hard, brown, dirt-like material attached to them.
Male Bichon (microchip #0A02067567, "Nelson's Perfect Pierre") has excessive matting of the hair coat on both
hind legs and along the belly. Large clumps of matted hair are running down the length of the entire right leg and
they are becoming tight against the skin. A majority of the rest of the matts are nickel to dime size clumps and
nearly all the matted hair has a hard, brown, dirt-like material attached to them. There are clumps of matted hair
attached to the topside of the feet. Rope-like matts of hair are also located on the legs, ears, and tail of the dog.
Female Bichon (microchip #0A02342870, "Nelson's Classy Casey" has excessive matting of the hair coat. The
matts are located along the length of both hind legs and along the body. The clumps of matted hair along the hind
legs have become tight against the skin and rope-like matts are found throughout the hair coat.
Male Shih tzu (microchip #020-523-263, "Mach") has excessive matting of the hair coat. Large clumps of matted
hair are located along the length of both hind legs, across the back and along the body. These matts have become
tight against the skin. Large clumps of matted hair are also located on the top side of all four feet. The clump of
matted hair on the left hind foot was so large that it has engulfed the foot and made it difficult for the inspector to
find the dog's toes and toenails.
Matted hair coats can cause pain and discomfort to the dog. The above listed dogs must have the matted hair
removed from their coats. The licensee must establish an effective plan for hair coat maintenance to ensure that all
dogs remain free of matted hair at all times.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.An outdoor enclosure located on the southeast side, has a welded wire panel on the front end that allows two adult
Golden Retrievers to push their head and neck through the openings. The potential for injury or death exists if the
dogs get their head or other part of their body stuck in the openings.
Housing facilities for the dogs must be designed and constructed so they protect the animals from injury, contain the
animals securely and restrict other animals from entering. The licensee must alter the wire panel in a manner that
does not allow the dogs to stick their heads and necks through any openings. The licensee must ensure that the
enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
To be corrected by: April, 18, 2017.
3.1(c)(1)(ii) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several sharp wire points protruding inside the outdoor enclosures and located where adult Golden
Retriever dogs can come in contact with them.
-Northwest enclosure containing one adult Golden Retriever has a sharp wire point where it is fastened to the metal
post.
-West-center enclosure containing one adult Golden Retriever has a sharp wire point protruding inside near the
southwest corner.
-Southeast enclosure containing one adult Golden Retriever has a sharp wire point located near the northwest
corner.
Housing facilities for dogs must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The licensee
must remove the sharp points from the dog enclosures in order to eliminate the injury risk towards the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that all housing facilities remain safe for the dogs at all times.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are four plastic buckets used as water receptacles for the Golden retrievers. The dogs have excessively
chewed and damaged the top edge of each of the water buckets. There are five Golden retrievers with access to
these damaged water buckets.
In one outdoor enclosure, containing two adult Golden retrievers, the wooden floor of the shelter has been damaged
by the dogs. The end of one wooden floor board has been broken and chewed leaving the dirt flooring under the
shelter exposed. The damage to the wooden floor board and the plastic water buckets does not allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization of these surfaces to occur and could increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must
be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the damaged wood floor board and plastic water
buckets or alter them in a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces to occur. The licensee
must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are maintained and kept in good repair.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two outdoor housing areas located on the southeast side have two shelters with damaged wind and rain breaks.
The flaps being used on the entrance of the shelters have been excessively chewed and the material is beginning to
fray. There are also areas where the flaps have been torn off and are missing.
As a result, there are large openings in the front of the shelters that do not provide three adult Golden Retrievers
with adequate protection from adverse weather conditions. Lack of wind and rain breaks does not ensure protection
from the direct effect of wind, rain and snow.
The licensee must repair or replace the damaged wind and rain breaks.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
One enclosure, containing two Golden retrievers, has a buildup of old and fresh feces. The licensee stated that the
last time the feces were removed from the enclosure was two weeks ago. The buildup of feces could increase the
risk of disease towards the dogs.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily in order to prevent soiling of the dogs, and
to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. The licensee must remove the feces from this enclosure and
ensure that excreta is removed from all enclosures daily.
To be corrected by: At the time of the inspection the inspectors instructed the licensee that the feces must be
removed from the enclosures every day.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.In at least one outdoor enclosure, containing two Golden retrievers, there is a thick buildup of dirt and grime on the
interior walls of the shelter. The buildup of dirt and grime could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures for dogs must be sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to
prevent the buildup of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The licensee must remove the
buildup of dirt from the interior surfaces of the shelter. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain free of the
buildup of dirt and grime in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
Male Shih tzu (microchip #020-523-263, "Mach") cited on the previous inspection report has been evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and
