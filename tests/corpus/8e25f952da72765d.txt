INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Significant changes were made to an activity using a regulated species without Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) approval. Two unapproved changes were made to activities using hamsters under protocol
14988.
A student was added to the protocol on the 2015 renewal to perform memory tests on hamsters. Although approved
only to perform these behavioral assessments, the student acted as surgeon on at least seven procedures, without
IACUC approval. According to surgery records at least four of the animals did not survive the surgery.
According to the protocol analgesics were to be administered to hamsters undergoing surgical procedures.
Carprofen was to be administered before surgery and again every 24 hours for four days as well as buprenorphine
before surgery, however according to animal records no analgesics were administered to the animals. Additionally,
the investigator stated that no analgesics were being administered when questioned during the inspection.
Significant changes in the care and use of animals in ongoing activities may adversely affect animal well-being. The
IACUC should review proposed significant changes to activities involving animals prior to the implementation of the
activities.
Correct immediately.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Incorrect anesthetic dosages for hamster surgeries under protocol 14988 were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) during the 2015 protocol renewal process. According to facility veterinary staff
the incorrect dosages (1.4 mg/kg ketamine and 0.28 mg/kg xylazine) were significantly below dosages needed to
adequately anesthetize the animals. According to the facility formulary, hamster ketamine dosages ranging from
100 to 200 mg/kg and xylazine at 10 mg/kg.The use of inappropriate dosages of anesthetics may adversely affect the wellbeing of animals. It is the
responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to the animals be performed with appropriate sedatives, analgesics, or anesthetics.
Correct immediately.
2.31(d)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not adequately review animal activities being
performed under protocol 14988. The protocol was approved for up to 500 hamsters, including hamsters
undergoing cranial surgery and a group of animals receiving no treatment for a potentially painful or distressful
procedure. A number of unexpected mortalities associated with surgeries and a person acting as surgeon without
IACUC approval were found during a review of records associated with this protocol.
Adequate IACUC review of animal use is necessary to ensure that activities involving animals are being conducted
in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. The IACUC should make certain that all activities relating to the care
and use of animals receive adequate oversight.

2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 14988 does not contain an adequate rationale for the number of hamsters to be used in the activity.
The rationale provided in the 04/09/2015 protocol renewal describes the need for 15 animals in each group but does
not provide any explanation as to why eight groups are needed for each of the three parts of the activity. The
protocol also adds up to 140 additional animals in case of "setbacks" but does not provide any rationale for the
number of animals in that group. In an 8/20/2015 protocol revision the number of animals to be used is the same
(up to 500 total), but the rationale for the extra 140 animals includes training new staff and testing new equipment
with no explanation as to why the same number of animals could be used for these new activities in addition to
covering for (cid:28)setbacks(cid:29). The explanation for how they calculated the need for 140 additional hamsters is notadequately explained.
The IACUC is responsible for ensuring that appropriate numbers of animals are used in each approved activity. In
order to perform this function the IACUC must know both how many animals are needed for an activity and why that
number of animals is needed. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that each activity involving animals
contains and adequate rationale for the number of animals being used.

ANNUAL REPORT.
The 2014 Annual Report of Research Facility did not reflect the fact that 48 hamsters should have been placed in
Category E. According to the report no animals were included in Category E, however during protocol review it was
determined that some hamsters being used under protocol 14988 were incorrectly placed in Category C.
The failure to appropriately report animal use could negatively impact the ability of APHIS inspectors to monitor
animal use. The facility should ensure that details regarding animal use are accurately portrayed in their Annual
Report.

An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
