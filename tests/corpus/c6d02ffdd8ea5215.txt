Facilities, general.
Three enclosures have damage that are in need of repair to protect the animals from injury. The goat pen directly
adjacent to the barn has a large hole in the wood panel on the fence gate. The hole is approximately 6-7" long and 5" tall
with jagged wood edges. The sheep pen behind the animal care office building has a top fence board next to the gate
which has cracked and splintered and is no longer connected to the supporting wood post. In the elk pasture, the large
black plastic feed pan has several cracks and a hole about 4" in diameter at one end. There is also an section of mesh
fencing under the boardwalk with a hole large enough for a limb, face, or antler to get caught in. Enclosures with cracks,
holes, or sharp edges can lead to animal entrapment and injury. Correct by 5 August 2022 by ensuring that all housing
facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

Facilities, outdoor.
The two largest goat pens do not have adequate shade for all animals within the enclosure. Ten goats are occupying one
large pen because the shelter structure was compromised in their second pen. In the currently occupied pen, there are
two shade structures, each one capable of about three goats fitting under at one time. Due to the larger number of
animals and limited shade structures in the functional enclosure, there is not enough shelter from direct sunlight available


to all animals. Animals require shelter from direct sunlight in order to regulate their body temperature and avoid heat
stress or stroke. Correct by 12 July 2022 by ensuring all animals have access to shade from direct sunlight.
