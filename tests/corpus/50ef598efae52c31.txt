SANITATION.
Around the facility grounds there is an accumulation of items that are not in use; plastic containers, unused fencing
and building materials, tarps, unused kennels, and items to be discarded. The presence of these items creates
clutter that impedes housekeeping, and could provide habitat for vermin, which could negatively impact the health
and well-being of the animals. The grounds should be maintained clean and free of debris so as to accommodate
good husbandry practices.
To be corrected by 6/28/15.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee's representative on site, and with the licensee himself via
telephone.
