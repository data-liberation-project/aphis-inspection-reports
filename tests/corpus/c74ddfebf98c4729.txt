At the time of inspection the entrance to the barn housing the 2 giraffes was viewed to be lower in height than the
giraffes neck height causing the giraffes to have to lower their heads to pass thru.
The shortened height of the door causing the giraffes to lower their heads does not provide an adequate facility
or protect the animals from injury.
Facility needs to insure the height of the entrance to the giraffe barn is adequate so the giraffes do not have to lower
their heads
