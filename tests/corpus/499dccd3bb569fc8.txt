2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals are in need of additional veterinary care:
***At least 1 of the 3 sika deer have excessively long hooves on the front feet. This animal is also limping, favoring
the right rear. Another animal seems to have stiff joints in the front. All of these animals are receiving treatment for
chronic joint pain; however, the long hooves can offset the natural positioning and balance of the limbs and may be
contributing to the gait abnormalities noted in these animals.
*** Two coati have excessive hair loss, red and mottled skin, a thickened appearance to the skin, and were
observed itching their skin. The most recent veterinary record documenting this condition is January 2016. Since
that time, they have been treated according to the veterinarian's instructions; however, the treatments that these
animals are currently receiving does not appear to be alleviating the condition, and further investigation is warranted
to diagnose the underlying cause or find alternative treatments to improve symptoms for these animals.
The licensee must ensure all animals are receiving appropriate veterinary care, including methods to diagnose,
treat, and prevent diseases and injuries. These animals must be examined by the veterinarian and treated
accordingly.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the vice president.
