Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
From April 30 - May 5, 2021, there was a failure of the equipment that controls the light cycle in a housing room
containing rabbits, resulting in continuous illumination for a week. Excessive illumination can have a variety of impacts on
animal health and well being. Research facility staff also report instances of loss of temperature control in the vivarium.

These issues were not identified on subsequent semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official, which were prepared and
submitted on June 11th, 2021, and January 5th, 2022. In order for the Institutional Official to be able to discharge their
responsibilities under the AWA, semi-annual reports to the IO must contain a description of the nature and extent of a
facility's adherence to this subchapter, must identify specifically any departures from provisions of this subchapter, and
must state the reasons for any departure.

To be corrected by July 1st, 2022.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).


Protocol #2020-06-13 contains a procedure description for intravitreal injections. Two amendments to add specific study
compounds to be administered by intravitreal injection, A2 and AMD#3, had also been reviewed and approved by the
IACUC. Neither the original protocol nor the amendments contain a written narrative description of the methods and
sources used to determine that alternatives were not available for this procedure.

The IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has considered alternatives to those procedures that may cause
more than momentary pain or distress and that the principal investigator has provided a written narrative description of the
methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available.

The IACUC must ensure that all protocols approved with potentially painful or distressful procedures are in compliance
with this section. Correct by June 1st, 2022.
2.32(b)

Personnel qualifications.
The USDA inspector observed research staff conducting an unapproved procedure, directed by the principal investigator,
on April 27, 2022. The principal investigator and research staff failed to follow the IACUC approved protocol when animals
were observed in pain and distress on April 27, 2022. According to research and vivarium staff, they are uncertain of the
methods whereby deficiencies in animal care and treatment are reported. The facility did not ensure that personnel
involved in the animal care, treatment, and use were qualified to perform those activities.

Per this Section, it shall be the responsibility of a research facility to review personnel qualifications with sufficient
frequency to fulfill the research facility's responsibilities under this section and 2.31.

2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
A study procedure on an IACUC approved protocol involves the use of specialized equipment on anesthetized rabbits in a
darkroom. To conduct the procedure, an animal is placed on a platform and the device hood (which weighs approximately
5lb) is lowered to cover the animal's head. When the hood is lowered, there is a gap between the device hood and the
platform through which the animal's neck and body extends. The specialized equipment, including the hood, is used to
conduct studies on both rodents and rabbits. When in the fully closed position, the gap between the platform and the hood
is approximately 1.5-2". The manufacturer of the equipment sells a device that adjusts the resting height of the hood to
increase the gap by several inches to accommodate the larger body size of rabbits.

When this procedure was conducted on a cohort of 18 rabbits on July 13th, 2021, the equipment was not configured to
accommodate rabbits. 3 rabbits died acutely and in sequence while being handled in the device. After these adverse
events, the investigator continued the study on the remainder of the cohort.

Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort.

The research facility voluntarily reported this incident on discovery and had instituted corrective measures at the time of
this inspection, including the purchase and implementation of the device to adjust the equipment for rabbit use. To remain
corrected from May 2nd, 2022.



This is a continuation of the report for the focused inspection conducted April 27-28, 2022 and contains the remaining
non-compliances found during the inspection.

This inspection was conducted with the Vivarium Manager and IACUC Chair on April 27-28, 2022. The exit interview were
conducted with the Vivarium Manager, the IACUC Chair, and research staff on May 2, 2022.
