3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A section of wire fencing separating two small pigs is in disrepair. Baling twine used to attach fence panels to posts
is unattached at one post, hanging from the fence panels which are pushed out of place. A plastic doorway flap on
an igloo shelter in one of the pig enclosures is torn and mostly detached from the door frame.
Foreign material such as baling twine and pieces of plastic can adversely impact animal health and well being.
Baling twine and plastic may be ingested causing illness. Animals may become injured when twine becomes caught
on or between teeth, or tangled around legs or hooves. Animals may also be injured by moving fence panels.
