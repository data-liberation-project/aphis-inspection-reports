ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:30 on
22-NOV-16.The licensee's wife was home but was unable to accompany inspection; she contacted the licensee at
work to see if he could come home early, but he was not available to do so. The licensee's wife indicated to the
inspector alternate times and contact methods to optimize inspection times.
Licensees must ensure a responsible, knowledgeable adult is available for inspections during regular business
hours. Correct from this time forward.
