SANITATION.
In the sheep pen area, 10 sheep in two pens are soiled from fecal material exposure. There is a moderate
accumulation of fecal material in two of the sheep enclosures. Although the facility is following a regular cleaning
schedule, more frequent cleaning of the enclosure is needed. A system to ensure that the animals are not soiled
needs to be instituted.
Excreta should be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
