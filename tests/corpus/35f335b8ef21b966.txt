ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 on
13-Apr-17.The licensee's wife was home but was unavailable to accompany an inspection at that time. She
indicated optimal hours for future inspections.
Lack of availability renders the regulatory process impossible. The licensee must ensure there is a responsible,
knowledgeable facility representative available for inspection during normal business hours. Correct from this time
forward.
