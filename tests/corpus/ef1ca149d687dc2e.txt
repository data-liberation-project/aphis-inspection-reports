3.6(a)(2)(iii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On Monday, August 2, 2021, the Animal Care Supervisor of the facility sent an email regarding an escape incident
involving a 6 year old male black/gray wolfdog named, “Tsume (tag #268),” a new rescue who arrived at the facility on
July 29, 2021. The escape occurred sometime after the evening rounds at 4:30 pm on July 31, 2021 and the morning
rounds at 8:00 am on August 1, 2021 The wolfdog escaped his enclosure by digging down to the dig guard and pulling it
away from the fencing allowing him to squeeze through the small opening he created. The animal’s tracks were followed
to one of the outer perimeter gates where he was able to squeeze underneath to escape the facility completely. Facility
staff did a thorough search inside the perimeter, then proceeded to search around the areas near the sanctuary. Local
officials and residents had been notified of the escape. The staff responded to all sightings; however, the exact location of
the wolfdog is not known, and the facility has been unable to recover the animal. Since the incident the facility has added
a bar to the perimeter gate so it cannot be pushed outward and filled in the ground with dirt where it eroded. The
enclosure where the animal escaped from is not being utilized at this time. The facility will add new reinforced dig guards,
and the hole filled before another animal is allowed into the enclosure. Animals escaping from primary enclosures are
more vulnerable to harm from surrounding predatory animals and further injury when they are not safely contained.
Corrected before time of inspection.


This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Animal Care Supervisor and Executive Director.
