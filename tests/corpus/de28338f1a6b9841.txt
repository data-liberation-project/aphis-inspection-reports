FACILITIES, INDOOR.
(c) Lighting.
There is inadequate lighting for the kangaroo, goat, chinchilla, and hedgehog. These animals are housed indoors
with artificial lighting. The lighting was inadequate for full inspection of the chinchilla and the hedgehog. The
kangaroo and the goat need more lighting because they are species that normally would receive a large amount of
sunlight if they were housed in a natural setting. The licensee shall provide ample lighting by natural and/or artificial
means of the quality, distribution, and duration appropriate for the species involved and to permit inspection and
cleaning.
TO BE CORRECTED BY OCTOBER 1, 2015.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
