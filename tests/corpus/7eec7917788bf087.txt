2.31(d)(1)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol M2000123 includes a surgery that involves making a 2 inch incision in the subscapular region of a non-human
primate to implant a scientific device which is connected via a subcutaneous tunnel to another implanted device in a
different area of the body. The written description of the alternative search conducted by the investigator did not address
this potentially painful (surgical) procedure.
An alternative search is required for all procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the
animals to ensure that alternatives that could reduce animal pain and distress are identified.
In order to approve proposed activities on protocol M2000123 the IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator
has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals
and has provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources used. Correct by 12/1/21.
2.33(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
A 14 year old bonnet macaque (#52) was observed on 9/28/21 by the inspector resting in an unusual position. When
asked, the clinical veterinarian stated that the macaque was recovering from procedures. Review of medical and surgical
records showed that the macaque had undergone surgery (cranial) on 9/23/21 and had sutures removed on 9/28/21. The


pre-procedure record included a notation of the observation of "reduced range of motion in jaw-approximately 4 cm from
incisor to incisor". The medical record did not include any notations regarding the observation/any jaw issues and none of
the facility veterinarians were notified by the laboratory/surgical staff about this observation. The macaque was re-
inspected on 9/29/21 and seemed much improved-no licking or abnormal resting positions were noted.
Timely and accurate information on abnormalities of animal health, behavior and well-being identified by non-veterinarian
staff must be conveyed to a veterinarian in order for the animal to be appropriately evaluated and any conditions, if
present, to be diagnosed and treated.
The facility must have in place a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian/designee by the person
accomplishing the daily observation of animals.

This inspection was conducted with DAC and OAWA representatives.
The exit interview was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian/DAC Director, OAWA Director, and DAC Associate
Director and other OAWA representatives virtually.
