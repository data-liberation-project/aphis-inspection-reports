2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
Prince, an 11-year-old male snow leopard, was temporarily shifted to the back shift alleyway during a routine shifting of
the other cats through the front shifting alleyway. When the animal trainer returned to shift Prince back into his enclosure,
it was identified that Prince was missing two-thirds of his tail and the missing part was located in the adjacent snow
leopard’s enclosure. It is thought that the adjacent snow leopard made contact through a surface drain port (that allows for
the rapid elimination of the water into the alleyway) and removed his tail. The animal trainer did not follow the established
protocols for this procedure which led to this incident. Employees must follow the established handling protocols to
prevent injuries to the animals.
Prince was taken to the attending veterinarian and has recovered.

To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
