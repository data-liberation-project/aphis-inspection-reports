ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are 3 Mastiffs, Brindle (M) #9, Fawn (F)#24 and Brown (F) #7 that appear underweight. The worst affected is
#9, however all 3 have protruding hip bones, with all ribs showing and concave appearance in the muscle on the
hind quarters, and bony shoulder bones. #7 has a 2 inch hard lump on her left hind quarter that has not been
observed.
There is a Mastiff/Akita puppy (F) #15-030 approximately 5 weeks of age that has cloudy structures in both eyes,
with the left eye being almost completely covered, and the right eye with the lower section of the eye being cloudy.
Until the inspection none of these conditions had been observed by the licensee, so diagnosis or treatment had not
been conducted and a veterinarian had not been contacted.
Undiagnosed and treated health issues can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animals.
The licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the affected animals.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are three Mastiffs; Brindle (M) #9, Brown (F) #7 and Fawn (F) #24 that appear to be underweight in body
condition. The male #9 appears to be the worst of the 3 in regards to the protrusion of the hip bones and shoulders,
as well as each individual rib be visible, and the concave indentations of the hind quarters, due to no muscle or fat
build up. The other two mastiffs also show protruding hip bones and visibility of every rib bone, but to a lesserdegree. There is no buildup of fat or muscle on these 3 Mastiffs. This condition had not been noticed by the licensee
until the inspection.
There is a hard round lump on the left hind quarter, approximately 2 inches in diameter on the female Mastiff #7 that
is very hard under the skin. It had not been noticed until the inspection.
There is a Mastiff/Akita puppy (F) #15-030 that has cloudy circles in both eyes. It is unclear if it is an ulcer or other
internal issue with the eye, however both eyes have it. The cloudiness is almost complete in the left eye, and just
starting in the lower portion of the right eye. This issue had not been observed until the inspection.
Any health issue that is left un-noticed and un-treated can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the animal.
Unobserved issues can cause a treatable condition to become chronic and more painful if left untreated as soon as
the issue is identified.
The licensee must be thorough in their daily observations of all regulated animals and be vigilant in identifying any
health related issue on every animal.

COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
There are two female Akitas in Pen #2 (Blk/wht (F)) and Pen #3 (Brown/wht/blk (F)) that had gotten into a fight
through the fence that divides the two primary enclosures. Both animals received injuries to the face and the female
in Pen #3 had injuries to her right front foot that prevented her from being able to walk on it. The female in Pen #2 is
known to be very aggressive towards other females, and has had problems with fighting in the past, however she is
currently housed in a run between 4 other dogs, and the fence had large enough holes(3x5inches) that they are
able to cause damage to each other. The dogs appeared to have just gotten into a fight before the inspection and
was not observed until the owner arrived home. The dogs had been in good condition in the morning when they left
for work. The female in Pen#2 was still trying to get at the female in Pen #3 and causing stress for that animal.
Housing an aggressive dog in an enclosure where they can have contact of any kind with other dogs can be a
source of stress and injuries for the neighboring animals. It is important that the aggressive dogs are housed
separately and in pens that prevent them from agitating and being able to have any physical contact with other
dogs.
The licensee must move the aggressive dog to an enclosure where she can not agitate or attack and have
aggressive physical contact with any other dogs in the facility. To be corrected: Immediately
The licensee moved this female by the end of the inspection

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently the facility is spot cleaned daily, however the licensee is only sanitizing once per month. There is a buildup
of brown grime on the outside of several shelter boxes around the doorways.
The lack of sanitization of the facility can cause there to be a buildup of bacteria and be a possible source of
disease and potential health hazards.
The licensee must sanitize according to the AWA regulations and standards of at least once every 2 weeks or as
often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime in the areas where the regulated animals come in to
contact.
