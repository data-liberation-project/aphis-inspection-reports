3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
*** There are two enclosures where the wood beams at the top of the enclosure are excessively chewed and splintered.
These same enclosures have paint flaking off the metal doors which is exposing some rust on the door. The chewed
wood and rusted area of the door are no longer impervious to moisture. These surfaces must be maintained in good
repair or replaced when needed so that surfaces in contact with the dogs are able to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
