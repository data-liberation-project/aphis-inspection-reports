2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses microchips placed under the dog’s skin as its form of official identification for dogs over 16 weeks of age.
There were 7 dogs over the age of 16 weeks that were being identified by the official number that was assigned to them
at birth on a cage card. The dogs included 2 Shih Tzu’s born 9-December-2021, 1 Chihuahua born 24-January-2022, 1
Dachshund born 25-January-2022 and 3 Shih Tzu’s born 24-December-2021. Cage cards are not an acceptable form of
official identification for dogs over 16 weeks of age. An acceptable form of official identification (listed below) is necessary
for APHIS officials to positively identify animals for inspection and to properly trace their movements.

All live dogs over the age of 16 weeks shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by
a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must
place a microchip under the dog’s skin of the 7 dogs listed above or apply one of the other forms of identification. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs have the correct type of official form of identification at all times.

The dogs had microchips placed under the skin by the end of the inspection.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.

The facility uses cage cards as the official form of identification for puppies under 16 weeks of age. The cage card for a
litter of 3 Pomeranian puppies born 24-April-2022 could not be located at the time of inspection. Acquisition information is
necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during inspection or that are under treatment and
to properly trace their movements.

The facility shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of documentation which fully and correctly disclose all
information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or
under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records
shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The facility must
record the acquisition information on an approved document for all puppies. The facility must ensure all required
information is properly and accurately documented at all times.

A cage card for this litter was made at the time of inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
Two outdoor enclosures housing a total of 5 adult dogs had igloo dog houses as their shelters. The entrance of the igloo
dog houses have been heavily chewed on by the dogs.

Surfaces that have been chewed on cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized to prevent disease hazards to the dogs. The
surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they are able to be readily cleaned and sanitized.

To be corrected by: 9-June-2022.

3.7(c)

Compatible grouping.
There were two groups of dogs housed together that included 1 dog under 4 months of age being housed with several
adult dogs that were not their dam or foster dam. Three Yorkshire Terriers that were 12 weeks old (date of birth 1-March-
2022) were housed with a 17 week old Chihuahua (DOB 24-January-2022) and a 24 week old Pomeranian (DOB 6-
December-2021). A Poodle that was 15 weeks old (DOB 4-February-2022) was housed with a 17 week old Dachshund
(DOB 25-January-2022) and two 23 week old Pomeranians (DOB 9-December-2021). Housing puppies with adult dogs
that are not their dam or foster dam may result in injuries due to compatibility problems.

Puppies under 4 months of age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs other than their
dams or foster dams. The puppies mentioned above must be either housed with other puppies under 4 months of age or
less or their dam or foster dam.

The facility representative moved the puppies into the proper compatible groups at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
