2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not adequately address all health topics for all species held by the
licensee. The only recommendations on the current PVC are for annual vaccination for clostridial diseases in the
hoofed stock and sampling/treating for parasites every 6 months in the hoofed stock. The individual requirements
between the different types of hoofed stock are not addressed and there are no recommendations at all for the
porcupine.
A few examples of additional things that should be addressed in the PVC are:
The reindeer: According to current industry standards reindeer require a unique diet not normally fed to sheep,
goats, and cattle. The PVC should address the diet for the reindeer. This reindeer travels between Arkansas and
Texas. Cervids require special testing for interstate movement. The PVC should address the schedule for this
testing.

The porcupine: preventative health recommendations and diet need to be addressed for this animal.
Diets for all additional animals need to be evaluated.
This is not an all-inclusive list. Any additional species specific or general recommendations the attending
veterinarian feels would benefit this collection of animals should be included. The PVC should indicate that the
attending veterinarian has a basis knowledge of all species at the facility.

To be corrected immediately.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
