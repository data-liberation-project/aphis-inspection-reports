HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On inspection, the chain link fencing between the outdoor runs of the kennel was determined to be in disrepair with
numerous sharp wire ends protruding inside the enclosure. Seven of the chain link fences used in between the
outdoor runs had multiple areas of numerous loose wires that had become unraveled and were protruding inside the
run. The ends of the wires were sharp to the touch and easily cut through an exam glove. The chain link fencing for
three fence-lines had such significant deterioration that the dogs inside the runs could and did cross in between
individual runs. Adult Siberian Huskies were observed crouching down and tunneling through the fence to the
adjacent run. No cuts or injuries were observed on any of the animals. The licensee has been transiting the kennel
from chain link fencing to a stronger metal fencing and has both the fencing and materials to replace the disrepair
fences. Sharp points or jagged edges could cause injury and pain to an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to
break off and be eaten. Additionally, compatible housing may not be able to be maintained if animals are crossing
over into separate runs. All housing surfaces of the facility must be free of all sharp points, edges, and must contain
the animals in the separate runs. Monitor all wire fences to ensure loose wires are removed and could not harm
any animals. Corrected at time of inspection.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor kennel has an excessive accumulation of feces under the outdoor runs. There was a layer of feces and
other waste that was approximately 3 to 4 inches high from the ground directly underneath the entire length of the
kennel runs. Several runs had feces approximately 2 to 3 inches from the flooring of the kennel runs. The licensee
stated he had not removed any feces or waste from underneath the adult dog runs for about 4 years. There was no
obvious odor or significant amount of pest observed on inspection. It was overcast and cool with a moderate
breeze. Accumulation of feces and other waste prevents proper sanitation and odor control. Furthermore, the
accumulation of waste encourages flies and other pest to live and grow near the animals. Remove all accumulated
feces and waste from under the kennel and routinely remove all excreta to prevent an excessive accumulation of
feces. Correct by: 9/26/2014
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
