CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently there is a large buildup of dirt, grime and old food on the platform surfaces, wire and climbing PVC piping
located in both primates primary enclosures. The floor and food bowls also have a buildup of debris that have not
been cleaned adequately per the AWA regulations.
The buildup of old food, excrete and grime can be a health hazard to the animals by providing an environment for
bacteria to grow and come in contact with the regulated animals.
Indoor primary enclosures, and food and water receptacles must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as
often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, food waste, excreta, or disease
hazard. The licensee must thoroughly clean and sanitize the primary enclosures, inside and outside on the fencing;
anywhere the animals come in contact.
