HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Exercise yard: Chicken wire with sharp, pointed ends was loosely wrapped around the bottoms of two wooden
posts located within the exercise yard and in areas of contact of the dogs. Dogs could possibly become trapped in
loose wiring or become injured from sharp, protruding wire ends.
All animal areas must be kept in good repair and free of sharp, protruding points in order to protect the animals from
injury or entrapment and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.
