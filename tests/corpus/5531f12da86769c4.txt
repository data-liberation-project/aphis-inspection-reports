Contingency planning.
There was no written contingency plan available for review.
Failure to document a written contingency plan can result in being unprepared for incidents that may affect the animals.
Facilities must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment,
transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster.

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height, during the inspection, there were 9
guinea pigs observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times
and does not allow them to escape.
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.


There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens and
hanging from the sides of the pens.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
