2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female ferret with ear tag #9002 in the left ear was noted to have a growth on the right lower eyelid and a
moderate amount of brown debris accumulated around the mass and the upper eyelid. The eye itself appeared
normal and there did not appear to be reddening of the conjunctiva (membranes surrounding the eye). When this
was pointed out to the licensee he stated he was unaware of the condition and the facility did not have record
identifying this issue or referring it to the attending veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Failure to properly
identify ocular conditions such as this can delay treatment and may lead to worsening of the condition. Additionally,
records of treatments and veterinarian recommendations are necessary to ensure good communication between all
staff when individual animals are undergoing care or have chronic conditions requiring monitoring. Correct by
ensuring that this animal is examined by the Attending Veterinarian and that records of the recommendations are
maintained for review by APHIS Officials upon request. The facility must also ensure that records of diagnosis and
treatment for any future animals identified are available to inspectors upon request.
