2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
At the time of inspection, none of the dogs could be identified by an acceptable means on the animal, only by name and
confirming with the licensee or facility representative.
Without a means to positively identify individual animals, acquisition, disposition, inventory and medical records cannot be
associated with their respective animals. Being able to tell which animals are mentioned in the records is important to
determine if the animals are being used in accordance with the Animal Welfare Regulations and receiving adequate
veterinary care. The licensee must ensure that all live dogs and cats held on the premises, purchased, or otherwise
acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of, or removed from the premises for delivery or to any person for use as a pet, shall
be identified by a microchip or an official tag of the type described in Section 2.51. The tag affixed to the animal’s neck by
means of a collar made of material generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a means of identifying their pet dogs
or cats, or shall be identified by a distinctive and legible marking acceptable to and approved by the Administrator.
TO BE CORRECTED BY DECEMBER 1, 2021.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


At the time of inspection, there were incomplete records of inventory, acquisition and disposition of both adults and
puppies.
Complete records containing the information required in Section 2.75 for animals disposed of or acquired for use in
regulated activities are necessary to accurately track animal movement and to facilitate the inspection process. The
licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information
concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under
his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The
records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

3.1(b)

Housing facilities, general.
***There is a wooden shelter structure in the backyard to which three adult Doberman pinchers have access, which is
cluttered with discarded materials including tarps and miscellaneous plastic parts.
***The outdoor run on the far left (adjacent to the run housing “Lemonie,” and “Moe,” has a gate that appears to be broken
and contains discarded materials and what appears to be a broken children’s toy house.
***Furniture and children’s toys are stored in the area housing two cats and food for all of the animals at the facility.
Clutter and storage of items unnecessary for proper husbandry makes cleaning difficult and can provide harbor for insects
and vermin that can cause injury or illness to the animals. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities and areas
used for storing animal food or bedding are free of accumulations of trash, waste material, junk, weeds and other
discarded materials, so that animal areas inside of housing facilities are kept neat and free of clutter (including equipment,
furniture and stored material that is not necessary for proper husbandry practices).
TO BE CORRECTED BY NOVEMBER 15, 2021.


3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
Cleaning chemicals are stored on shelving used for food storage for dogs, cats, chinchillas and hedgehogs.
Storing food in close proximity to chemicals poses a risk for contamination that could cause animal illness or death. The
licensee must assure that supplies of food and bedding are stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage,
contamination and vermin infestation, and that toxic substances, even if required for normal husbandry practices, are not
kept in food storage and preparation areas.
TO BE CORRECTED BY NOVEMBER 12, 2021.
3.4(b)(1) Critical

Outdoor housing facilities.
In the outdoor enclosures there is inadequate/inappropriate shelter from the cold and heat.
***There are no structures that can be considered acceptable shelters provided to the three adult Doberman pinschers,
“Doobie”, “Scarlet” and “Zula”: There is one wooden box structure in disrepair without an attached, stable roof. The
facility representative stated that the tarp and other items placed on top of the shelter serve as the roof of the structure.
The structure also has a dirt floor and is not large enough to accommodate all three of the dogs at one time. The space
under the building to which these three Doberman pinschers have access also has a dirt floor, and so also does not meet
the definition of a suitable structure.
***One shelter structure provided in the outdoor enclosure housing the three Yorkshire terriers, “Maggie”, “Maddie” and
“Toby” is a plastic kennel, with a large crack along its top near the front, which will allow moisture and cold air inside.
***One of the shelter structures in the run occupied by the dogs “Tot” and “Falcore” is chewed at the entrance, creating a
gap that will allow cold air and moisture inside.
Adequate shelter is a basic necessity. Inadequate shelter and protection from the elements can result in a failure to


maintain a normal body temperature, illness or even death. The licensee must ensure that the dogs have shelter
structures in outdoor housing enclosures that have a roof, four sides, and a floor and that must provide the dogs with
adequate protection and shelter form the cold and heat.
TO BE CORRECTED BY NOVEMBER 21, 2020.
3.4(b)(2)

Outdoor housing facilities.
In three of the runs housing the dogs, “Maddie,” “Maggie,” “Toby,” “Moe,” “Lemonie,” “Red,” and “Tim,” there are no trees,
coverings or structures to provide a separate area of shade (aside from the kennel shelters) that is large enough to shade
all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun.
Failure to provide adequate shade can result in overheating or even death. The licensee must ensure that animals have
access to at least one separate area of shade (aside from the kennel shelters) within outdoor enclosures to protect all
animals in the space from the direct rays of the sun.
TO BE CORRECTED BY NOVEMBER 20, 2021.
3.4(b)(3) Critical

Outdoor housing facilities.
Nine dogs (all but the three Doberman pinschers) are group-housed in runs, each with one to two plastic kennels. The
kennels have no rain/wind break at the entrance, or have dirty, cloth curtains at the entrance that cannot serve as
effective rain/wind breaks. Failure to provide effective wind/rain breaks at the entrance of shelters could allow the animals
to become wet and cold, which causes discomfort to the animals and could lead to illness or death. The licensee must
provide shelters in outdoor facilities that are equipped with a wind break and rain break at the entrance that will keep the
animals and their bedding dry.
TO BE CORRECTED BY NOVEMBER 20, 2021.


3.8

Exercise for dogs.
At the time of inspection, there is no written, veterinarian-approved plan for exercise of dogs in place or documented.
Dogs require opportunity for exercise for their health and well-being.
The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. In
addition, the plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian. The plan must include written standard procedures to
be followed in providing the opportunity for exercise, and it must be made available to APHIS upon request. The plan, at
a minimum, must comply with each part of Section 3.8 in the Animal Welfare Regulations.
TO BE COMPLETED BY NOVEMBER 17, 2021.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
At the time of inspection, there are incomplete or no veterinary medical records for the dogs available for APHIS
inspection.
Without medical records, it cannot be determined if the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary preventative care or other
necessary veterinary care for illness or injury. The licensee must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the
records available for APHIS inspection. The records must comply with the Animal Welfare Regulations as required in
Section 3.13(b) and retained as described in Section 3.13(c).
TO BE CORRECTED BY NOVEMBER 17, 2021.
