2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the 4:30pm circus performance involving zebras and camels I observed the prodding devices the handler
used for these animals. After the performance, close evaluation of the prodding devices revealed that one device
was an electronic cattle prod. Use of an electronic cattle prod for zebras and camels is not an accepted handling
method and can cause the animals unnecessary discomfort and behavioral stress. The licensee must ensure that
the use of an electronic cattle prod is discontinued.
Correct immediately.
