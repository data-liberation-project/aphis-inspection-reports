OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The wooden walls of the outdoor housing facility have a dry, jagged appearance. When asked when these surfaces
were last sealed, the facility representative replied last fall. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be made impervious to moisture. Correct
by 7 Oct. 2016.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The surfaces of two wooden shelters in the whelping building are soiled with a brownish-coating covering a large
percentage of the floors and walls.
The sides of three wooden shelters in the outdoor housing facility are soiled from the dogs urinating on them.
There is an accumulation of bird feces on the concrete floors in many of the dog runs on the east end of the north
set of enclosures.
Surfaces that are not cleaned and sanitized may contribute to an increase in disease transmission as well as can
soil and contaminate the dogs in the enclosures. All surfaces must be cleaned and sanitized per paragraph
3.11(b)(3) at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food
waste, excreta and other disease hazards. Correct by 14 Sept. 2016.
