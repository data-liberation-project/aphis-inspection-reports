ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15am
-12:00pm on 18-Jan-17.
When we arrived we rang the door bell and knocked on the front door. We also called out from the fence to see if
someone was working in the animal area. We called on the phone and left messages. We returned to the facility
from 1:30pm - 2:15pm and repeated the same process.
