2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A Tahr goat was observed to be lame during inspection. The goat carried the front left leg when running but was able to
use the limb when standing still. The licensee had not observed the lameness until this inspection. The licensee
contacted the attending veterinarian (AV) during the inspection and a treatment plan was implemented. Per the
regulations, each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the
use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Corrected during inspection.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Acquisition records for one large acquisition for 63 animals were not available for review by the inspector during this
inspection. Disposition records for 26 animals were not available for review during inspection. Missing records can put
the animals' health at risk due to the inability to track the transport and location of animals. Per the regulations, each
dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the items contained in (b)(1)(i-vii)
for all animals acquired or disposed by the dealer.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
