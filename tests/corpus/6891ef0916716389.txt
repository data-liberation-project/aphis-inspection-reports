2.40(b)(3)
Dog with Microchip number 1221389 was noticed to have blood on her hind legs. Upon further examination, there
was blood and a thick yellow/green discharge noticed coming from her vulva. The Licensee stated that he had
noticed this periodically since she whelped her puppies on 12/3/2018 however; he had not contacted or consulted
with his veterinarian. In talking with the facilities Attending Veterinarian, he stated that he would generally like to be
consulted on abnormalities, such as this, when they are noticed. In addition, he stated that in the event that he had
been contacted prior to my inspection, he probably would have instructed a treatment verbally over the phone or
asked that the dog be brought in for examination. Failure to communicate with a licensed veterinarian on health
issues that are not covered by the Program of Vet Care can delay or deny animals with proper veterinarian care.
The Licensee must have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The small breed enclosures use raised slatted flooring. All of the enclosures on the adult side of the facility on the
inside portion of the building have an excessive accumulation of hair, feces, food waste and other organic material
built up under the enclosures. In addition, about 50% of them have the same build up along the wire mesh walls
inside and outside of the enclosures. The improper cleaning is contributing to the odor within the facility. The
Licensee must ensure that the primary enclosure and the areas under the primary enclosure are cleaned as often
as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces, food waste, hair and other organic materials to
prevent soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects and odors within the facility.
