REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
On October 26, 2016, during a federal multi-agency (CDC-MQS, CBP and USDA-APHIS) operational inspection of
shipments from DHL Aviation Americas/Vesecar International, a consignee named Mr. Jesus Canoura was
identified as conducting USDA unlicensed activity as an intermediate handler of animals. The named consignee
was scheduled to receive a shipment from Venezuela of forty-three (43) dogs for re-distribution to another party
and/or resale; one (1) adult and forty two (42) puppies. Each intermediate handler, not required to be licensed
under section 3 of the Act and the regulations of this subchapter, needs to register with the Secretary of Agriculture
by completing and filing a properly executed form which will be furnished, upon request, by the AC Regional
Director. The registration form should be filed with the AC Regional Director for the State in which the registrant has
his or her principal place of business, and shall be updated every 3 years by the completion and filing of a new
registration form which will be provided by the AC Regional Director. Also, this inspector will mail a license
application packet on this day.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT OBTAINING A VALID USDA LICENSE.
This inspection was conducted with members of the multi-agency team. No exit interview was conducted.
