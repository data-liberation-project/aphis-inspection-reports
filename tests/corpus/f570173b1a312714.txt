ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- A female French bulldog named "Maxine" had spots of hair loss and red, inflamed skin on her feet, legs, and at the
base of her tail. Her skin was very dry and flaky, and she was noted scratching various locations several times
during the inspection. She also had a watery discharge from both eyes, and crusting present particularly around the
left eye. The facility representative stated that this was a long term condition which had been treated numerous
times in the past. However, Maxine is not currently being treated and has not been seen by a veterinarian within
the past 4 months. Skin conditions can be irritating and painful, and may result in secondary infections and wounds
if left untreated. Maxine must be seen by a licensed veterinarian within 5 days, and treated appropriately. The
licensee must maintain a record of treatment and make that record available as needed to APHIS inspectors.
- A male dog named "Choco" had heavy accumulation of dental tartar on multiple teeth. The upper gums were red
and swollen over the premolars and molars. No teeth were loose but there appears to be some loss of the upper
gum line along the affected teeth. Dental conditions can be extremely painful and may have a significant impact on
the health and well being of the affected animal. Choco must be seen by a licensed veterinarian within 5 days, and
treated appropriately. The licensee must maintain a record of treatment and make that record available as needed
to APHIS inspectors.
- A female dog "Charity" had numerous thick hair mats on the back, legs, flanks, and tail base. The skin underneath
these mats appears normal at this time. Hair mats are a source of discomfort and can affect temperature
regulation. They may also eventually adhere to the underlying skin and lead to areas of infection. This dog needs
her hair coat clipped within 5 days. If there are any indications of skin infection or irritation after the mats are
removed, the dog must be treated appropriately by a licensed veterinarian.
- A female Chihuahua named "Bluebell" had excessively long toenails on all four feet. Multiple nails were starting to
curve, and appeared to affect her posture and gait. Excessively long nails can be a source of discomfort to the
affected animal. Bluebell must have her nails trimmed to an appropriate length within 5 days, and nail care
maintained properly from this point forward.3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the smaller building housing the French bulldogs, the wooden doorway of the shelter in the first run is off the
hinges and leaning against the adjacent wall. This is a source of potential injury if the door was to fall on the
enclosed animals. It also prevents the shelter area from providing any kind of adequate protection from the
elements. The door must be repaired or replaced immediately.
- On the south side of the larger building the first outdoor run has a loose, curled section of wire fencing which runs
the length of the main fence separating the first and second runs. This curled section of fencing is buried in the
ground and the top end is approximately at mid-height to the main fence. This curled length of fencing is a potential
source of entrapment and injury to the enclosed animals. It must be secured or trimmed to ensure the health and
welfare of the animals.
- On the south side of the larger building, the last two runs have multiple sections of wire protruding from the
ground. This was apparently once buried lengths of fencing designed to prevent digging. However, this material is
broken in several spots and is a source of potential injury to the animals. These sections of wire must be removed
or repaired to protect the dogs. The last run also has a jumbled accumulation of concrete blocks, wire panels, and
other pieces of construction material scattered in front of the indoor/outdoor access door. This is a hazardous area
which the dogs are forced to navigate any time they enter or exit this access door. The licensee must clean this
area up, remove any unnecessary debris, and ensure this ground is safe for the animals to travel through.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The entire indoor area of the large sheltered building is in need of more cleaning. Numerous kennels have an
excessive accumulation of grime, dirt, debris and hair on the floors and walls of the runs. Dirty living areas are
unsanitary, and increase the risk of contamination to the enclosed animals. The licensee must clean all surfaces
that come in contact with the animals, and must maintain them in appropriate condition from this point forward.
- The raised row of "puppy boxes" in the middle of the room have walls and frames composed of PVC pipe and
sheets covered by mesh wire. These walls and pipes are covered with an accumulation of brown dirt and grime.
These boxes are used to house older animals, as well as dams nursing puppies. All of these animals are, by
nature, at higher risk of disease. Constant exposure to contaminated surfaces poses a danger to these animals.
The licensee must clean these areas, and must keep them clean from this point forward.Correct by 23 April 2016
3.10
WATERING.
- In the inside portion of the main sheltered building, water is provided by automatic "lixit" type water lines. At least
three of these lixits have an excessive accumulation of dirt, grime, and cobwebs on and around the water pipes.
Dirty and contaminated water sources may have a negative impact on the health and welfare of the animals. All
dogs must be provided potable water, and the receptacles or means of providing water must be cleaned and
sanitized appropriately. The licensee must ensure all water sources are thoroughly cleaned and maintained from
this point forward.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- The majority of kennels throughout the facility have an excessive accumulation of feces on the ground, particularly
in the outdoor runs. There is both old and new fecal material present. This is a source of contamination to the
animals, and is also an attractant for flies and other pests which may provide a risk to the health of the dogs. The
licensee must clean these runs, and must remove fecal material and other waste at least daily from this point
forward.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- In the interior area of the sheltered building, rodent control is being accomplished through poison blocks left out for
the rodents. However, the location of these blocks of poison pose a potential hazard to the enclosed dogs. Pieces
of poison are nailed to wooden ledges which are located directly over the indoor shelter areas of several runs.
Dogs are fed and watered in these indoor sections, and these are their areas to shelter from inclement weather.
There is potential for pieces of this poison bait to fall into the area below and then be consumed by the dogs.
Poison blocks are also being used on top of the raised center row of enclosures. These enclosures house elderly
dogs, as well as dams with nursing puppies. The poison blocks on top of these enclosures are in plastic cans with
openings carved in the sides. There is a risk of poison spilling out of these containers and possibly entering kennels
under or adjacent. The facility must develop a safer method of rodent control. The existing bait stations must be
removed immediately. In the long term, the bait must either be located and secured in a more appropriate way, or
an alternative method of pest control developed. The facility can consult with their attending veterinarian or a pest
control company if further guidance is needed.Correct by: 3 May 2016
