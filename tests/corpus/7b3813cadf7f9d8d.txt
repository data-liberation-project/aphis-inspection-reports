PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Minimum requirements for primary enclosures
The licensee has vinyl coated wire flooring in the indoor housing units. The openings in the flooring of
the enclosures of the puppy area are 1 inch by 1 inch and the flooring in the adult area go from 1 inch by 1 inch to 2
inches by 2 inches. Feet and legs of many of the adult Boston Terriers in 2 inch by 2 inch floor enclosures could
have easily fallen through this floor, as the gaps were larger than the animals feet. Yorkies, Pomeranians, and
Boston Terrier puppies on the 1 inch by 1 inch flooring were seen falling through the gaps in the floor. Enclosure
material that is inappropriate for the animals housed within can injure them and is not a good husbandry practice.
The licensee must ensure that all flooring in all enclosures are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet
and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any
openings in the floor.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures
In the main adult dog area, the white PVC piping that frames the top of the black wire enclosures has a layer of hair
and wood shaving dust. The licensee claims that these areas are cleaned at least twice yearly. Surfaces that are
not cleaned and sanitized in a timely manner can be a cause of odor, can attract insects or vermin, and can harbor
disease or mold. Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often
as necessary to promote good husbandry practices.
