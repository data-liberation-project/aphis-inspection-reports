Outdoor housing facilities.
The outdoor enclosure for the lemur does not have the required 6’ perimeter fence. This fence serves to protect the lemur
by restricting unauthorized access of humans and animals. It prevents physical contact of the lemur by these
unauthorized animals or humans. Construct a perimeter fence 6’ in height at least 3’ from the lemur’s primary enclosure. It
should be constructed to keep animals from going through or under it.

Facilities, outdoor.
Two enclosures each housing two foxes do not have the required perimeter fence. These primary enclosures need a 6’
perimeter fence at least 3’ from the primary enclosure fence. It should serve to keep unauthorized persons and animals
from going through it or under it and having contact with the foxes. It should serve as a secondary containment system
for the foxes. Construct a 6’ perimeter fence for these enclosures at least 3’ from the primary enclosures.
