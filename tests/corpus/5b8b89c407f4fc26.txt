FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The divider panel between the male and two female african crested porcupines' enclosures had a hole in it with a
wood panel over it. A wire point was sticking in towards the male's side of the enclosure. Personnel reported that
the male made the hole this morning and got in with the females. Sharp points exposed to animals and holes in
enclosures that allow animals to get in with other animals at uncontrolled times can lead to injuries. To prevent
animal injury, ensure enclosures do not have sharp points and are maintained secure so that animals cannot
escape or get in with other animals.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
1. The northeast portion of the camel enclosure is lacking a perimeter fence. The facility has removed and erected
several new animal enclosure fences and perimeter fences since the last inspection. As a result, an eighty-eight
foot section of the camel enclosure no longer has a perimeter fence. Additionally, the northeastern most portion of
the perimeter fence contains a three foot gap. In both areas, this could allow the public to walk directly to the camel
enclosure fencing and contact the animal. Perimeter fences prevent unsupervised contact between the public and
the animals.
Assure that the camel enclosure is surrounded by a continuous perimeter fence. The fence must be at least six feet
tall and three feet away from the animal enclosure.

2. An eight foot section of perimeter fence adjacent to the Canadian lynx enclosure is in disrepair. The top of the
wire fence has been stretched and is now curled toward the ground. Damaged perimeter fences could potentially
allow unauthorized persons and wild animals to gain access to the animals.
Repair or replace the affected section of perimeter fence.To be corrected: 3-11-17
3. A portion of the perimeter fence surrounding the wolf enclosure is in disrepair. Two sections (eight feet wide and
ten feet tall) of the southwest perimeter fence have wires that were mangled causing the top of the fence to curl
down towards the ground. Damaged perimeter fences could potentially allow unauthorized persons and wild
animals to gain access to the animals.
Repair or replace the affected sections of fence.
