2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** An adult male coatimundi, Cody, was observed to be non-weight bearing on his right rear leg. When asked, the
licensee stated this animal was having climbing issues 2-3 years ago and was taken off exhibit due to possible
arthritic issues. This animal has not been recently evaluated by a veterinarian and the condition may have
progressed. Lameness can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical
conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the health and well-being of the animal.

***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, had hair loss with red and inflamed skin on the knuckles of all four feet. This
animal was cited for this problem on the inspection report dated February 16, 2018. It is the APHIS inspector’s
opinion that the skin appears to be more red and inflamed than what was observed during the inspection on
February 6, 2018. The most recent veterinary exam occurred on February 11, 2018. The attending veterinarian
recommended in his documentation to commence a regiment of medication that will continue for 2-3 months. To
date this animal has not received this medication. A facility representative stated that he had noticed the animal’s
condition getting worse and continues to itch at his feet. The fox also had excessively long nails that needed to be
trimmed.

***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS
inspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing on this limb. The
most recent veterinary exam occurred on May 27, 2017. The attending veterinarian recommended in his
documentation that 1) more diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2)
if the facility representatives do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the
animal. Currently, this animal is off exhibit but still has not received proper veterinary care for the further diagnostic
workup and treatment of his lameness. To date, the licensee has not followed the veterinary recommendations.
***A male, adult Ibex hybrid, walked with an abnormal gate. The hooves on all legs were excessively long, to the
point that they were curling causing the toes to rotate up and out and the heel to drop. Failure to appropriately
maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s
program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail
care in a timely manner.
In addition, a few months ago the licensee wrapped this animals legs because they were bowing out and the wraps
were left on for too long and got wet, this caused open wounds on the legs, which are currently healing.

The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility. The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plans for the problems cited above. From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all
animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the
program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of animals on hand were not up to date at the time of inspection. The licensee presented the APHIS
Form 7019 as his record of animals on hand. The count of the number of goats (including the Ibex hybrids) and
sheep on the premises did not match the number recorded on APHIS Form 7019, which had a lower number
recorded. Correct records are necessary to facilitate the inspection process and track animal movement. Records
must be maintained that fully disclose the acquisition and disposition of animals whether purchased, owned, held,
born on premises, or leased. They shall include the age or birth date of the animals, their acquisition date, the name
and address of the person from whom the animals were obtained or to whom they are sold, the number of animals,
species, USDA license number or registration (if licensed). A record of the animals on hand shall be created,
maintained and made available for review during USDA inspections.
This was a focused inspection on the veterinary care issues for animals observed on previous inspections.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives on February 20, 2018 and
another verbal exit interview was conducted on February 22, 2018.
