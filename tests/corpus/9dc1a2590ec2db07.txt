2.1(a)(1) Repeat

Requirements and application.
This facility is conducting regulated activity without a USDA license. The facility is open to the public for exhibition of the
animals. There are several areas within the facility that allow the public to have direct access to animal enclosures and/or
the animals within the enclosures. There are approximately 73 animals that have been identified during today's inspection
that would require a USDA license for exhibition.
Failure to obtain required licensing with the USDA can lead to a lack of oversight of Animal Welfare.
No person shall operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale, without a valid license.

No regulated activity, to include the exhibition of regulated animals, can be conducted until a USDA license has been
obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
