open wound on the front of his neck. Licensee stated that the dog has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.

has not been evaluated by a veterinarian. Growths in the eye can cause irritation and discomfort to the dog. Both

plan is developed. Diagnosis and treatment must be documented and available to inspector upon request.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In both the whelping and non-whelping areas of the barn, the metal bars of the enclosures have had their paint
removed by the dogs and are now rusting. Rusting causes pitting and flaking of the metal which does not allow for
proper sanitization of the bars. The metal bars need to be replaced or altered in a manner that allows for proper
cleaning and sanitization every two weeks.
