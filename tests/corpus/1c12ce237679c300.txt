ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 115pm on
12/11/2014.
Messages were left on the licensees' voicemail advising him I was there for an inspection and would be in the area
for approximately one hour. While waiting at the gate I called out to the licensee and continued to try calling. After
25 minutes I left the driveway and stayed in the area for an hour in case the licensee returned and could do the
inspection. There was no response. The message requested any days or times that would be best for conducting
inspections to be advised.
