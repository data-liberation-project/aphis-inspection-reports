SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the area of the 1975 building that houses the basset hound, the outdoor portion of the dog enclosures has been
enclosed and the roof is supported by wooden beams. The walls of the dog enclosures are also connected to these
beams. In at least four enclosures, containing a total of 12 dogs, the wooden beams have been chewed by the
dogs. This damage has caused the wood to no longer be impervious to moisture. The wooden beams need to be
replaced or altered in a manner that makes them impervious to moisture.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the area of the 1975 building that houses large breed dogs, the fronts of the enclosures are made of wire panels.
On at least five enclosures, housing a total of eight adult dogs and five puppies, the wire panels are coated in an
excessive amount of dog hair and dirt. This coating of hair and dirt does not allow for the wire panels to be properly
sanitized which can lead to disease hazards towards the dogs. The wire panels must be cleaned as often as
necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt and hair and to ensure proper sanitization of these panels can occur
every two weeks.
In the same area of the 1975 building, the access doors of each enclosure, housing approximately 11 adult dogs,
have a buildup of dirt and grime on them. The buildup of dirt and grime can lead to disease hazards towards the
dogs. The access doors must be cleaned and sanitized every two weeks, or as often as necessary, in order to
prevent the buildup of dirt and grime and eliminate disease hazards.
