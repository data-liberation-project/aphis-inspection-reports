CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Four rabbits used for public viewing at the pet store were found to be housed with a wallaby. The licensee stated
that this was a recent move to give the wallaby company.
For the rabbit'(cid:25)s health and well-being, they are not to be housed in the same primary enclosure with other species
(due to the high potential for injury in rabbits as well as disease transmission). The facility is to implement a
program to ensure that rabbits are not housed with any other species.
