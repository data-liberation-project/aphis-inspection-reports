3.30 REPEAT
WATERING.
There were accumulations of brown debris and excreta below the automatic water valves in the 28 enclosures on
the right side of the building. These accumulations around the water valves exposes the guinea pigs to potential
disease hazards with bacterial, fungi, and parasites. Water receptacles such as automatic water delivery lines and
drain lines must be cleaned and sanitized whenever dirty, and sanitized at least once every two weeks. Inadequate
cleaning of the automatic water valves and drain lines can result in contamination of the guinea pigs in the same
enclosure. Licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water valves and drain lines free from
contamination and are properly sanitized when dirty.
Remains uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
