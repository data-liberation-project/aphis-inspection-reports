Handling of animals.
**October 2020 during a pumpkin patch event, a parent and child breached a 2nd access gate to the macaque enclosures
resulting in the young child being bitten by one of the macaques. An additional chain lock has subsequently been added
to the access gates in order to prevent unauthorized access to animal enclosures. Sufficient barriers and distance
between the animals and general public must be in place and secure so as to assure the safety of animals and the public
while preventing unauthorized access to the animal enclosures.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
**An excessive amount of flies and bees were found around the food containers in the outside animal enclosures. The
inside kitchen area had five fly strips, however, they were full of flies and needed to be replaced. An effective pest
control program must be established and monitored routinely in order to reduce pest contamination in the animal areas in
addition to promoting the health and well being of the animals.
