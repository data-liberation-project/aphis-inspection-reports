Time and method of identification.
At least 7 adult dogs were seen to not have tags; the licensee stated that 4 of those have tags but the tags were left
where the dogs were at for breeding and 3 of the dogs have new tags that recently arrived but collars have not been
made. Proper identification is important for animal husbandry purposes and is required under the Animal Welfare
regulations. Ensure each adult dog has proper identification. ***Correct by 3/21/2022.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Seven outdoor enclosure areas for adult dogs and one indoor enclosure area by the southwest wall had areas of dog
waste that had been there more than one day. Lack of daily spot cleaning causes dog waste to buildup and could cause
unhealthy conditions for dogs to live in. Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily so that
the areas dogs can touch are maintained clean. Ensure to include the outdoor floors and all areas of the dogs enclosures
in the required daily spot cleaning of dog areas. ***Correct by 3/8/2022.
