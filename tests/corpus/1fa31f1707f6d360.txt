2.33 (b) (2) Attending Veterinarian and Adequate Veterinary Care
--The facility is not always using appropriate methods to control the crash cart drug inventory used to treat health
issues. Expired medications (Furosemide injectible with expiration date of 2/2014 and Sodium Bicarbonate
injectible with expiration date of 4/2014) were observed ready for use in the emergency crash cart and were not
labeled as expired or segregated from in date drugs. Use of outdated drugs in an emergency situation could lead to
an unexpected negative outcome and could harm the animal. The facility shall ensure there are adequate
procedures in place to manage the medicine inventory, including the crash cart medications, and avoid the potential
use of expired medications in an emergency situation.
The two vials of outdated injectible medication were corrected during the inspection by labeling as "expired" and
removing from the crash cart. A program of adequate drug inventory control that includes the crash cart is to be in
place by 5-23-14.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with IACUC Chair.
