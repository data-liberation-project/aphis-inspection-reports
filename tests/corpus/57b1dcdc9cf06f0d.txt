2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
During a routine feline neuter procedure on April 24th, 2019, a veterinary technician student incorrectly connected an
anesthesia circuit to the patient. This error was discovered during the procedure and the presiding veterinarian
immediately stopped and assessed the patient. The procedure and anesthesia were stopped, and CPR was administered;
however, the patient never regained consciousness. An investigation of the incident by the IACUC found that the exhaust
from the non-rebreathing system was connected to the gas exhaust outlet on the machine instead of the exhaust
cannister. There was essentially no outlet for the exhaust gases. The IACUC Administrator stated that this incident was
the first feline death due to student negligence since the program's inception. The facility reviewed the incident and added
the following corrective actions to any procedure involving anesthesia. Prior to leak checking anesthesia machines,
students will be required to connect audible pressure alarms to all anesthesia circuits for every anesthetic procedure and
ensure that they are working properly. Following the mandatory leak checks, and prior to attaching the patient, students
will attach an artificial lung to the anesthetic circuit and turn on the oxygen and vaporizer to further ensure that pop off
valves are open, circuits are correctly connected, and the artificial lung does not receive over pressure. Additionally, the
program has instituted a clinical probation status for students whose negligence severely compromise an animal’s
welfare. The student will receive a clinical probation letter in their academic file. A second letter will trigger an academic


board meeting for further actions up to and including expulsion from the academic program.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
physical harm or unnecessary trauma.
The facility’s corrective actions had already been identified and established by the date of this inspection. No further
corrective actions needed at this time.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
While reviewing facility IACUC records, it was noted that the IACUC met in May 2019 and then again in February 2020.
The regulations require that the IACUC meets a minimum of every six months to review the facility’s program for humane
care and use of animals. Regular reviews are necessary to ensure IACUC oversight of the program and to ensure the
welfare of the animals being used by the facility.

While reviewing facility IACUC records, it was noted that the IACUC met in May 2019 and again in February 2020 to
conduct facility inspections. The regulations require that the IACUC meets a minimum of every six months to inspect all
the facility’s animal use areas including housing and study areas. Animal facility inspections by the IACUC ensures
optimal animal welfare by identifying, prioritizing, and making plans for correcting areas which may be harmful to the
health and well-being of the animals.
