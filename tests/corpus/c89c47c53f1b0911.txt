INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Protocols A & B: Minimally invasive procedures are performed on guinea pigs or ferrets that require anesthesia to
prevent distress and/or pain. However, a search to determine if there are alternatives for such procedures were not
conducted.
The principal investigator should consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary pain or
distress and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives
were not available. The protocols must be amended to include a search that indicates alternatives to the procedures
are not available. Correct by July 30, 2015

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** The Peromyscus mice are housed in open top cages in a room with air conditioning. However, there is a strong
urine smell in the room.

To minimize strong odors, the room should be provided with fresh air or an effective method to move the air should
be implemented. Measures must be taken to adequately ventilate the room for the health and comfort of the
animals. Correct by July 9, 2015.
NOTE: Cages are scheduled to be changed the next day.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
