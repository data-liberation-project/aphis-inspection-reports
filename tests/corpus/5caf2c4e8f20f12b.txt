2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, the licensee did not have an attending veterinarian. An attending veterinarian is important
to ensure that the animals at the facility receive adequate veterinary care. The facility shall employ an attending
veterinarian for the facility. In the case of a part time veterinarian, a written program of veterinary care shall be
maintained by the facility.

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The facility did not use appropriate means to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries of two
rabbits with medical issues.
Three white rabbits were being housed in a single enclosure. One of the rabbits had a raised, circular area of hair
loss on its head, between the eyes, that was 2cm in diameter. The visible skin was pink/red in color with dried blood
and purulent discharge on the surface. A second rabbit in the enclosure had swelling on the head, above the right
eye and the visible skin appeared pink in color with dry, rough crust on the surface.
The facility received these rabbits together approximately three days ago and they were placed in the same primary
enclosure. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible and should not be housed with other
animals that interfere with their health or cause them discomfort. The licensee informed the two Veterinary Medical
Officers that these animals’ conditions had not been noticed by the staff and that no veterinarian had been
contacted regarding the wounds.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead
to prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care health problems. The facility must use appropriatemethods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
After the inspection, the facility separated the two rabbits that had wounds.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In a metal tub enclosure housing six ferrets, dried feces and debris were around on the lower walls and floor of the
tub. Excreta should be removed from the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards. It is necessary to maintain a clean enclosure and
sanitize it when soiled in order to reduce contamination and reduce the risk of disease to the animals.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
In the facility, there were many flies around the animal enclosures. These insects can contaminate food and
potentially transmit bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can have a negative impact on the health and well-being of
the animals. There needs to be an effective program for control of insects and other pests where the animals are
being housed to prevent the spread of disease and maintain the animals’ overall health and well-being.
