2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This was a search inspection.
The owner has applied for a license to conduct regulated activity, but has failed to follow through on obtaining a
license. Specifically, he has not followed through on conducting the prelicense phone call with me (which was
scheduled 18 days ago) so he can move to the next step of scheduling the first prelicense inspection. I stopped by
the owner's facility to see what happened. He stated he was too busy to make the phone call. When questioned
the owner stated that he has 32-33 dogs, approximately 30 of which are breeding females. The licensee is shipping
his puppies to an individual/facility that is acting as a pet store. He stated his last shipment was approximately three
weeks ago and consisted of six puppies.
I conducted a search on the owner on 12/19/19. He was conducting regulated activity at that time and I made him
aware that he was conducting regulated activity without a license and that he would need to be licensed in order to
continue to conduct regulated activity.
Conducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that
APHIS officials can assess the care of the animals. The owner must either cease regulated activity or obtain a
license from the USDA to continue conducting regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act.
No regulated activity may be conducted until USDA license is obtained.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
End of report.
