2.31(b)(3)(ii) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Between Oct. 2017 and Mar. 2019 the IACUC held ten meetings. An unaffiliated member was not present for seven
of those meetings. In addition, an unaffiliated member was not involved in any of the semi-annual facility inspections
and program reviews conducted by IACUC members during these months. In addition, one unaffiliated member
resigned and the facility had no unaffiliated member until a new one was appointed approximately three months
later. The lack of participation of an unaffiliated IACUC member in IACUC meetings and semi-annuals means that
there is a lack of general community interest being represented on the committee regarding proper care and
treatment of animals at the facility. The IACUC, when conducting business required under the Animal Welfare Act,
shall include at least one member unaffiliated with the facility.
This inspection was conducted with veterinary technicians.
This exit interview was conducted with undersigned IACUC veterinarian.
