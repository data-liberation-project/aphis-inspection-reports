3.1(d)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Currently there is not an adequate light source that can illuminate the indoor area over the whelping pens in the
center of the facility or the covered whelping boxes on the left side of the barn. The barn that holds the 3 Bulldogs
and 1 Shar Pei does not have enough light through the windows to illuminate the enclosures in cloudy or dark
conditions. In order to conduct a thorough inspection and be able to see inside of the enclosures and look at the
animals a flashlight and lantern needed to be used. The left side of the barn with the covered whelping boxes was in
complete darkness by 430pm and is kept that way on days when it is cloudy. There is not much of a diurnal cycle
allowed in that section of the barn with no light source.
Improper lighting can cause the licensee to miss any health issues on the regulated animals that develop, especially
if the condition is small or subtle in appearance in the early stages. The lack of full illumination of the primary
enclosures can result in improper cleaning and sanitization due to the dirty surfaces not being seen in the dim and
partial lighting of lanterns or headlamps. Maintenance issues can also be missed with limited lighting in the facility.
The licensee must provide enough illumination in all of the enclosures , in both barns that will allow for complete
thoroughness in cleaning, sanitization and maintenance of the enclosures, as well as provide the ability to visually
observe all animals completely for any health issues.

3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are five 2 door dog houses in five runs that house 13 dogs each that do not have any doors or flaps on the
entry area that would provide a wind or rain break for the animals. While the houses are not facing the wind, there
does need to be some sort of windbreak at the doors to prevent wind or rain from entering the housing, and protect
the animals from drafts and weather.
The lack of a proper wind break at the entrance of the dog houses can cause wind, rain and other weather issues tomake contact with the dogs and cause unnecessary discomfort or problems keeping the temperatures regulated
during extreme cold weather conditions.
The licensee needs to provide some sort of wind and rain break at the entrances of the dog houses.

3.6(c)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are 5 Beagle females with nursing puppies (6-9 per litter) that are in primary enclosures that are too small in
height by at least 6 inches. There is a German Shepard female(39 inches) with 6 puppies that is housed in an
enclosure of 24 sq. ft. that does not have 6 inches of space above her head, the female is let out twice per day for
an hour for exercise. The 5 Beagles and 1 Shepard can not sit in a normal position with their heads up due to the
ceiling of the enclosures being too small, the dogs need to keep their heads down between their shoulders then
they walk or sit on their hip or their heads rub on the roof of the boxes.
Insufficient spacing and exercise room for the animals can cause behavioral and physical stresses on the animals,
which can lead to health issues and possible compatibility issues between the puppies and the females. Small
spacing with so many animals can also increase the chance of disease or stress related issues .
The licensee must provide enclosures that are high enough to provide at least 6 inches of space above the heads of
the dogs to allow them to sit, stand and turn around in normal postural movements.
