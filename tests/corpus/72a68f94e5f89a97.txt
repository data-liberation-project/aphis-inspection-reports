2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a Maltese female #60 noted to have excessive drooling at the front of the mouth. The cheek teeth on the
right side of her upper jaw are heavily caked with a brownish concretion, and one tooth is noticeably loose. The
gums in this region are swollen and dark in color.
Dental disease can be a painful condition that may lead to other infections, trouble eating, and weight loss. This
dog needs to be examined and treated by a veterinarian for dental disease. Record of the examination and
treatment, as well as any further instructions provided by the veterinarian on a dental health maintenance program,
must be kept and made available for APHIS officials on future inspection.
