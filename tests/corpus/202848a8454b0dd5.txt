2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two male zebras escaped from their primary enclosure during dismantling of the zebra(cid:25)s primary enclosure for
departure from Philadelphia, PA. The zebras were being led individually by licensee and caretaker when the wind
blew a shavings bag up startling the zebras. The handlers lost control of the zebras and the startled zebras fled.
The owner stated that the first zebra was captured in approximately 40 mins located across the street. The second
zebra was captured almost 2 miles away after approximately 2 hours from time of escape. The younger male zebra
had 2 small skin abrasions over both front leg joints (approximately 1 inch). No members of the public or employees
were injured during this incident. Licensee attempted to consult a veterinarian in Philadelphia, PA., however was
unable find a veterinarian to examine zebras. When arriving in Charlotte, NC, licensee was able to find a
veterinarian to examine zebras. This veterinarian stated the zebra had minor abrasions and recommended no
treatment.
It is important for handlers to maintain control of dangerous animals at all times to prevent injury to the zebras and
the public. Procedures need to be put in place to adequately maintain control of zebras at all times. The licensee
has added a 10 ft. high perimeter fence surrounding the zebra's primary enclosure for additional security purposes.
Correct from this day forward.
Inspection was conducted at Metrolina Tradeshow Expo in Charlotte, NC.
