Sanitation.
There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens. The
licensee reported the facility was in the process of being cleaning as it was their cleaning day.
The lack of sanitation and presence debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and may contribute
to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.

Watering.
In approximately 25% of the pens (first 2 rows housing 561 guinea pigs), there was a buildup of bedding, fecal material,
debris, and wet greenish material around the nipples of the automatic waterers. The facility was about to perform their
weekly cleaning on the day of the inspection.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.


Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.

Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 58.5 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. There was one heater
located in the corner of the facility. The licensee stated he believed the health of the animals was better at lower
temperatures (closer to 55 degrees F).
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. An adult brown guinea pig in pen 40 housed with 21 other guinea
pigs was observed with a 2 cm area of hair loss and crusty skin on the right side of the bridge of the nose. The licensee
had not observed the condition and had not contacted his attending veterinarian. The Program of Veterinary Care on file
from the attending veterinarian addressed the condition and provided treatment options but the licensee had not
administered any treatments.
Hair loss can be a sign of infectious disease that can worsen or spread to other animals if not treated.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending


veterinarian to evaluate the animal and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
