RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of animals sold were not accurate. Records indicated animals were sold retail by an employee to
individuals. Animals were actually sold wholesale to one person, and then resold to individuals. The person who
pays the licensee for the animals must be identified as the buyer. This needs to occur for several reasons. First so
that USDA can track all covered activity the animals are subjected to. Second so that the licensee is not mistakenly
blamed for problems with the animals once they leave the licensee'(cid:25)s control.
To be corrected immediately.
