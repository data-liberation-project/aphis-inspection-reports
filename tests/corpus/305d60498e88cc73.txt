3.137(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The driver's side of the trailer where the black bear is housed for exhibit and transport has a hole rusted through the
wheel well by the floor. We looked at this area from the outside and could see that the hole does leave a weak area
where the bear might reach the tire. The area around the hole had excessive rust and was peeling. This rusted
hole is a weak area were the bear could push through the wall and injure himself while in transit. The licensee
explained the design of the trailer will allow the bear to be divided away from this hole for the trip home. Ensure
animals do not have access to this area during transit and repair all rust-affected areas prior to transport/exhibit use.
