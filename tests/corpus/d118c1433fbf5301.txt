Sanitation.
There is an excess of clutter inside of the building housing the animals. The clutter (old equipment - vehicle batteries,
empty tanks, metal, bags, wires, wood,etc that are not in use) located in close proximity to the primary enclosures, on top
of covered enclosures and behind them. Clutter increases areas that may harbor pests. The clutter also interferes with
access to the animal enclosures thereby inhibiting good husbandry practices.
The area and cabinets where the medications,, topicals and herbal treatments are stored is also cluttered with empty
bottles, expired items, containers and utensils. Some items are sticky which may attract flies and other pests. The area
shall be cleaned and items of no use discarded or removed to decrease the clutter and allow cleaning.
To be corrected by November 22, 2021.
