ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Inspectors arrived at the facility gate at 11:10 a.m. on July 23, 2015. Approximately five minutes later, the inspectors
were met at the gate by a facility representative who stated she was informed by the licensee to not allow the
entrance for one of the inspectors. Inspectors stated to facility representative that refusal to allow entrance to any
inspector would be a refusal of inspection and would be cited. Inspectors asked the facility representative
specifically if she was refusing to allow for inspection. She stated yes she was refusing to allow for inspection.
Inspectors then asked facility representative to contact licensee via cell phone. The licensee was then asked via
cell phone if she was refusing to allow for inspection, and her answer was yes she was refusing to allow inspection.
Inspectors again stated that refusal to allow entrance by any inspector is a refusal of inspection and would be cited.
Failure to provide APHIS officials with access for inspection upon request interferes with the ability of the officials to
protect the welfare of the animals and prevents the Secretary from fulfilling the obligation to enforce the Animal
Welfare Act.
The licensee must provide access for inspection when requested by APHIS Officials.
To be corrected for all future inspections.
This was a team inspection by Tyler Fields, VMO and Jeffrey Lee, VMO.
Additional Inspectors
