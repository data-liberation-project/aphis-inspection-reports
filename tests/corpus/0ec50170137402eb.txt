2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care does not give guidance on proper use of medications. The program lists the use of
pyrantel for de-worming but does not explain the proper use of the medication. The medication bottle did not have a
prescription label which would explain the proper use of the medication either. Proper guidance for handling
medication and parasite control is required to be documented in the program of veterinary care.
Contact the veterinarian and have the program of veterinary care updated to include the dose, concentration of the
medication and proper handling of the medication.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outside portion of the primary enclosure is made up of a tender foot type panel. The panels are only supported
underneath along the length of the panel. This causes a sagging of the panels where two meet along the width.
The sag produces a significant gap between the panels where a leg can get caught and the dog could get injured.
The sag in the panels also causes a bouncy area when the dogs run around on it. An unstable floor with a gap can
easily cause discomfort for he dogs and may lead to injury.
The floor needs to be repaired so that there is no gap and the floor does not bounce when the dogs are on it.
