2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
On August 17, 2020 the Principal Investigator (PI) and lab staff on protocol M1900083 used four guinea pigs for intubation
and ventilator testing. The PI did not communicate the date, time or nature of the procedures to either the facility
veterinary staff or surgical research training personnel in advance as required by the IACUC in the approved protocol. The
ventilator testing was not successful, and the animals were not fully anesthetized. All four animals died immediately to
within minutes. The PI did not report these unexpected deaths to the veterinary staff or the IACUC. A veterinary
technician manager who became aware of the issues the next day while the PI anesthetized and attempted to intubate
another guinea pig reported the issues. The IACUC completed a lengthy investigation and determined that the animals
experienced undue pain and/or distress during the procedure to test the ventilator.
The guinea pigs in this instance were handled by the PI without the oversight intended by the IACUC. The handling was
not done as carefully as possible and caused undue pain and/or distress to the guinea pigs. All animal handling including
study manipulations and immobilizations must be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.
The IACUC suspended the protocol on Aug. 26, 2020.
Corrected prior to this inspection.


3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
An accumulation of fecal material, some of it dried, was noted on hard surfaces that the squirrel monkeys come in contact
with inside their enclosures. It was especially noted on the hard PVC type hiding tubes and other enrichment devices. A
review of the cleaning and sanitation schedules and log sheets indicated that daily cleaning of the enclosure trays was
occurring but the hard surfaces within the enclosures were routinely cleaned as part of the regular weekly full cage
cleaning/sanitization.
Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily to prevent accumulation of
excreta or disease hazards.

The exit interview was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, the IACUC chair and other facility representatives.
