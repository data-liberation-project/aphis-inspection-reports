3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
The bottom pole of an enclosure's divider is rusted and broken in the outside portion where two dogs are housed (third
enclosure from the east wall). The broken area has rough and sharp edges that the dogs could contact. These edges
could cause injury. Ensure surfaces are maintained free from sharp and rough edges.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The office area (where a male yorkie has access to) and the food storage closet are in need of regular cleaning. The
office area had old dog waste and the food storage area had broken feed and bedding bags and clutter on the floor.
These conditions could create areas for pests and vermin to live in and breed and are not sanitary. Ensure that buildings
and grounds areas are kept clean and in good repair for the health of the dogs.
