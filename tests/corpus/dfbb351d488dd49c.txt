Contingency planning.
The facility has not completed their contingency plan in full. The plan does not outline specific tasks that need to be
carried out for emergency responses on site. An outlined plan is necessary to prepare for unexpected disasters or events,
as well as a detailed strategy to address instructions for, but not limited to: animal evacuation, sheltering-in-place, and
backup provisions for husbandry and food/watering supplies, sanitation, and ventilation. The facility shall develop and
document an appropriate contingency plan available for review upon USDA inspections.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class B” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by February 19th, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the
license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License
Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
