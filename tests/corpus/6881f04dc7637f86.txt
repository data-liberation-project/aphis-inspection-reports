2.31(e)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Approved protocol #220161106-EM does not contain adequate information to determine if a complete description of
euthanasia methods has been included. Current industry standards and guidelines require that a complete animal
euthanasia process include confirmation of death prior to disposal of the body. The facility protocol and related
standard operating procedures contain little relevant criteria for confirmation of death following euthanasia.
Discussion with facility personnel indicate criteria may not be uniformly standardized at the facility.
Prior to protocol approval the IACUC must determine that an activity involving animals contains a complete
description of euthanasia methods, processes and animal use. Correct by: May 1, 2017

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
The facility does not have a formal training program in place that instructs personnel of reporting method options
whereby any deficiencies in animal care and treatment or protocol deviations can be communicated to the IACUC.
Any alleged deficiencies must be brought to the attention of the IACUC and eventually reach the IACUC Chair so
that the IACUC can fulfill the required function of reviewing and investigating animal welfare concerns as described
under 2.31(c)(4).
Current institutional policies and communication pathways that can be followed by employees to bring animal
welfare concerns to the IACUC should be reviewed, modified as needed and implemented. Training and guidance
in these procedures should be provided for all facility employees. Correct by: May 19, 2017.This inspection included review of IACUC related documents, functions, protocols, facility standard operating
procedures and programs.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the AV, IACUC Chair and other IACUC members.
