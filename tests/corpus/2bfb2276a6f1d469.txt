ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A red fox "Moon" was observed to be squinting in both eyes. This condition has occurred in the past and was
treated for allergies under veterinary supervision.
The Animal Care & Medical Director (who is not a veterinarian) prescribed a course of treatment without consulting
with the attending veterinarian. While this condition may visually appear to be similar to that in the past, this may
not be the case in this instance. In many ocular conditions squinting of the eyelids is common. The attending
veterinarian shall be consulted, and the veterinarian shall be the one to prescribe any medications based upon a
physical exam or consultation with the keepers.
Correct immediately.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
"Fonzi" a rhesus macaque is singly housed and cannot see other primates. The current enrichment plan does not
provide sufficient detail to the special attention for his social needs. The plan for this primate has not yet been
approved by the attending veterinarian.
The environment enhancement plan must include specific provisions to address the social needs of nonhuman
primates of species known to exist in social groups in nature. Such specific provisions must be in accordance with
currently accepted professional standards, as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as
directed by the attending veterinarian.
