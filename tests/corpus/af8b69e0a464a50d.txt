*** A Yorki # 026094583 has dry flaky skin and hair loss on the back. The licensee was not aware of this until the
dog was pulled and looked at by the inspector. Daily observations need to be done and the animals handled so that
conditions like hair loss and dry skin can be noticed and the condition conveyed to the attending veterinarian for
diagnosis and potential treatment.
*** A Pekinese # 003269807 has a cornea abrasion on the right eye and the left eye was closed with some pus
coming from the eye. The licensee did not notice this condition and has not conveyed this condition to the vet for
treatment. Cornea issues can be painful to the animal and active areas of pus indicate infection in the other eye.
This animal needs to be seen by the attending vet for proper diagnosis and treatment. Animals need to be
observed daily and these conditions conveyed to the attending vet for effective and timely medical care.
