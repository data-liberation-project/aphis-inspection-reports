2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care does not accurately reflect the facility's parasite control program. Ivomec is
listed for use in the ectoparasite and blood parasite sections of the program of veterinary care. The facility
representative stated that Ivomec is no longer being used. It has also been longer than one year since the
attending veterinarian visited the premise. The last recorded site visit was on April 20, 2016.
Good consultation between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form of a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premise are necessary for the health of the animals. Failure to have
complete and accurate written program of veterinary care does not ensure that the dogs are receiving veterinary
care consistent with currently accepted veterinary practices. The program must be amended to reflect practices of
the facility. It shall include product dosage, route of administration, concentration of active ingredient, the frequency
of use, testing to be completed, and the frequency in which testing shall be done. The licensee must also schedule
a site visit with the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by: May 9, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative, Elizabeth Meek, DVM, Heather
Cole, SACS and Corbin Ranslem, ACI.
