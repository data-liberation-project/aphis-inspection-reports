2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee has not been recording puppy births on the facility's record of dogs on hand (APHIS Form 7005) or by
cage card. Not having the puppies recorded on either the 7005 forms or by cage card does not ensure for the
proper identification and tracking of the puppies born at the facility. All puppies born at the facility need to be
recorded by either cage card or on the facility's record of dogs on hand. Correct by: July 25, 2014.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two outdoor housing enclosures have floors that only cover approximately one-half of the enclosure. Lack of
complete floors does not provide adequate protection from inclement weather conditions. The floors in the outside
enclosures must cover the entire inside surface area. Correct by: July 31, 2014.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The inside walls of the outdoor housing enclosure housing the poodle and two golden retrievers have surfaces that
are not impervious to moisture. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can hold water, urine and other
materials that can cause odor. Also, these surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized and can present a
disease hazard. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be made impervious to moisture. Correct by: July 31,
2014.
