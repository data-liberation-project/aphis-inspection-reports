FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In some areas the chain link fence has been damaged or rolled up in a way that creates a hazard for the animals
and has the potential to cause injury. The Okapi yards have several areas of chain link damage, especially in the
upper yard.
In Tiger bedroom #4, there is damaged insulation around a pipe near the ceiling. The bench below the pipe that the
animal used to reach the insulation has been removed, but the insulation is still damaged and no longer in good
repair. A work order was submitted in Sep, 2016 and it was identified on an IACUC inspection in March, 2017.
Facilities must be structurally sound, constructed with material that is an appropriate strength for the animals
involved and shall be maintained in good repair.
Exit interview conducted with facility personnel on 25 May, 2017.
