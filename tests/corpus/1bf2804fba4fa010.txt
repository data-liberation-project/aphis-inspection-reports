2.75(b)(1)(vii)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility's disposition records were incomplete. The sales slips do not include the number of guinea pigs sold. Failure
to include the number of guinea pigs sold can make it difficult to track animals and to document changes in the animal
inventory. The licensee must maintain sale records that include the number of guinea pigs sold in each shipment. Correct
