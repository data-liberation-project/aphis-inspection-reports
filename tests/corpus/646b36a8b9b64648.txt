In Pen #1, there is a Male brown/white guinea pig(Teddy Bear) that has thinning and missing hair over the back half
of his body. There are several scabs, and patches of missing hair on his back and on the outside of his back legs.
The majority of the guinea pigs in this pen of 14 have chewed ears, or injuries with scabs and with red patches. It
appears there is a problem with an aggressive biting guinea pig that is injuring the majority of these animals. In Pen
#3 there is a Female white/albino guinea pig(Teddy Bear) that also has thinning and missing hair over 90% of her
body. She has red sores on her back and sides that are up to 1 inch in diameter.
In a birthing cage there is a Female brown/white (Teddy Bear) guinea pig that has multiple red and raw skin
abrasions on both sides above her rib cage and on her back end that are approximately 1 inch in diameter. There is
an open sore area that appears to have a yellow/white puss like material in the center that is approximately 1/2 inch
in diameter and in the vulva area.
To this date none of these injuries have been treated or a veterinarian contacted.
It is imperative that any injuries or illnesses are diagnosed and treated as soon as they appear in order to decrease
the unnecessary pain and discomfort to the animals.
The licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the animals. All animals must be
treated as soon as a health issue is discovered.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The majority of the guinea pigs in pen #1, and several in pens #2, #4 and #6 have chewed ears, or injuries with
scabs and with red patches on their ears. In Pen #3 there is a Female white/albino guinea pig(Teddy Bear) that also
has thinning and missing hair over 90% of her body. She has red sores on her back and sides that are up to 1 inchin diameter.
In a birthing cage there is a Female brown/white (Teddy Bear) guinea pig that has multiple red and raw skin
abrasions on both sides above her rib cage and on her back end that are approximately 1 inch in diameter. There is
an open sore area that appears to have a yellow/white puss like material in the center that is approximately 1/2 inch
in diameter and in the vulva area. While the owner did observe the red sores he had not noticed the open sore by
the vulva area. There are 140 guinea pigs that are penned in large enclosures, however the daily observations are
lacking as if evident by the numerous ear injuries, skin and open sores that multiple animals are acquiring.
There must be thorough daily observations of all regulated animals in order to locate any health issues or injuries
that may occur, in order to provide immediate treatment or isolation if necessary.
The licensee must increase their daily observations to include all regulated animals in order to provide prompt
health care and treatments.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently there are no acquisition records or inventory of the 140 guinea pigs at the facility. The inventory or
acquisition records of the 87 rabbits is incomplete with new acquisitions not added, and the dates for those that
have been sold or died not reported on their record. There are multiple rabbit records with missing litter information.
There are no records at all for any guinea pig litters current or past.
Complete and accurate records are necessary for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must update the inventory/acquisition records for the rabbits, and fill out an inventory/acquisition
record to include all of the guinea pigs. There must be complete records of the offspring born at the facility by both
the rabbits and guinea pigs.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no copies of any records of sale with the licensee for any rabbits since May of 2016, and there are no
records of any guinea pigs sold at all.There must be a copy of the records of acquisition and disposition for all regulated animals for proper management
and traceability.
The licensee must keep complete and accurate records of sale of the regulated animals, and give one copy to the
the buyer with each shipment and one copy for his own records. The records must include all of the required
information listed in AWA 2.75(b)(1) Records, dealers and exhibitors.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Currently there are guinea pigs being housed in a barn that has a temperature of 42 degrees F inside, with an
outside temperature of 37 deg F. The temperatures for the past week and current week have been in the 30s/upper
20s during the day, and down to 15 Deg F at night. The indoor temperature for guinea pigs is not to be below 60
degrees F. All of the 6 primary enclosures that held 14 to 30 guinea pigs, consisted of all of the animals huddled
together against the wall in a line or in a pile. The animals were not seen exploring their enclosure which has a lot of
room, instead all of the animals were touching and huddled together along the wall and in the corner.
Extreme cold temperatures can cause the guinea pigs to become hypothermic and suffer from discomfort and
possible health issues or death if they were to get too cold.
The licensee must provide enough heat in the guinea pig area to provide a minimum temperature of 60 degrees F
and to not exceed 85 degrees F.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There are 6 guinea pig primary enclosures approximately 4ft x 4ft that are located on a dirt/lime floor, covered with
bedding material that contain over 130 guinea pigs.
All surfaces that come in contact with guinea pigs need to be impervious to moisture and able to be sanitized in
order to prevent possible disease and other health issues.
The licensee must provide a sealed surface for the floor that can be sanitized, or make enclosures out of materials
that are impervious to moisture and can be sanitized. A dirt floor inside of a barn can not be sanitized according to
AWA regulations/standards.To be corrected by: January 15, 2017

CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
There is a compatibility issue in Pen #1, #2, #4 and #6 where there are multiple guinea pigs with chewed, torn or
injured ears. There are at least 3 females that show injuries of scrapes and sores over a large percentage of their
bodies. While the enclosures do appear large enough for the number of animals, there are some animals that are
aggressively injuring other animals in the pens.
It is important that all animals are put in compatible groups in order to prevent stress fighting or injuries caused by
aggressive animals. Any aggressive animals should be removed from the group living or put in conditions where
there is no risk of injury to the other regulated animals.
The licensee must figure out which guinea pigs are causing the injuries and house them away from the animals they
are attacking. There must only be groups of guinea pigs housed together that are compatible and do not cause
harm to one another, by causing scratches or chewing on ears.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The area where the rabbits are located does not have enough light to be able to conduct an inspection and see all
of the rabbits at the far end of isles. While there are 3 bulbs, there needs to be at least 2 more to light up the end of
the isles to be able to see the flooring and rabbits clearly. During the inspection the licensees head lamp needed to
be used in order to conduct the inspection and to check on the cleaning of the cages.It is the time of year where it
starts to get dark by 530 pm and in the winter time chores are done more often in low light conditions, and there is
not enough light to do a proper job without another light source being added.
Improper lighting can lead to poor cleaning or possible health conditions not being observed.
The licensee must provide more lighting to the barn that allows for all of the rabbits primary enclosures to be
observed without requiring a head lamp or flashlight.
