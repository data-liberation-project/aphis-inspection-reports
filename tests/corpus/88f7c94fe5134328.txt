ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Upon review of records, it was noted that a juvenile male elk (#WJLD) was thin (63.5 kg, 128.8 lbs) and in poor
body condition. The animal's condition had not been reported, nor did the animal receive veterinary care in a timely
manner. This contributed to the death of the animal. It is the responsibility of the licensee to maintain programs of
veterinary care that utilize appropriate methods to prevent, control, treat, and diagnose diseases and injuries in
order to promote the health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The pasture fence is in disrepair. A section of the pasture fence, constructed of cyclone wire, has become
unattached from the base post. The unattached section, approximately two feet wide, is located approximately
twenty feet east of the north gate. This has left a gap between the ground and the bottom of the fence. Wild
animals and unauthorized people could potentially enter the elk pasture through this gap.
Repair or replace this and any of the fences that are in disrepair.
