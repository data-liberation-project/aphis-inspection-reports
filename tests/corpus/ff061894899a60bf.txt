2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care can not be found for review to assure it is being followed. The contracted
Attending Veterinarian and the licensee need to complete another written vet care program describing what
veterinary care is provided to the animals and by whom. A form was provided during this inspection. To be
corrected by 4-25-14.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A camel was obtained since the last inspection and was placed in a separate pasture. The fence on the far side
and the road side of the enclosure is made of 8" X 8" wire livestock fencing which is old and rusting. On the one
side strands of barb wire were placed over this fence. The rusted fence has holes in some areas, and has multiple
broken wires which are protruding into the enclosure. This could potentially harm the camel. The fence needs to be
repaired or replaced. Nails were protruding from posts and boards in the enclosure with 6 pigs. These were
removed during the inspection.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The 6 pigs are in an enclosure where the only shelter from inclement weather is a large piece of wood propped
against the wire fence. The area under the enclosure is not high enough or large enough for all of the pigs to have
shelter, nor do the open sides provide protection from wind and rain. More shelter needs to be provided for the
pigs. The shelters for the camel and the hoofstock (zebra in one enclosure, and 1 pig, 1 alpaca, 5 goats, 9 sheep,
1 zebu, 1 watusi in a separate enclosure) do not contain any bedding. The temperatures have remained cold at
night with temperatures this week falling near freezing. During periods of cold weather all animals need to be
provided bedding to protect the animals from the cold dirt ground.
To be corrected by 3-26-14.
3.130WATERING.
The water in the receptacle for the 1 alpaca, 1 pig, 1 zebu, 1 watusi, 5 goats, and 9 sheep was totally brown. The
water bottle for the kinkajou was empty and when the owner filled it he drank for over 3 minutes. Clean water
needs to be provided often enough to provide for the health of the animals and must be available often enough to
prevent thirst. To be corrected by 3-26-14.
