PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The 23 rabbits are in enclosures on the floor with wire tops. There are 15-18 parakeets that are free flying over the
top of all of the rabbit enclosures. The parakeets defecate in the rabbit enclosures and there is feces on top of the
automatic rabbit feeders.
Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to enable the rabbits to remain dry and clean.
Remove the parakeets, contain the parakeets in a separate enclosure or put solid surfaces on the top of the rabbit
enclosures to prevent the rabbit enclosures and feed from being contaminated with bird feces. A barrier must be
provides to prevent disease transmission from the bird feces to the rabbits and so that the rabbits can remain clean.
