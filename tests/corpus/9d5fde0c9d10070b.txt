Facilities, outdoor.
One of the shelters for the 3 wolves has standing water in it. Per representatives two wolves share a larger den-type
shelter and the third uses another shelter in the back that can't be seen from the viewing area and the one with puddles in


it is rarely used by any of the wolves. Standing water in a shelter makes it so it cannot be used for animals. Ensure that
each shelter is accessible and has adequate drainage for the wolves so that if a wolf can't share a shelter with the others
they each have access to dry sheltered areas.
