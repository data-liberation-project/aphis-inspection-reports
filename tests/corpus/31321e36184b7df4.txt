3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Excessive hair and fecal material are present in all of the rabbit enclosures. The accumulation of feces increases
the likelihood of disease transmission. Rabbit cages must be kept reasonably free of feces, hair, and other debris
by frequent cleaning. A method of rabbit enclosure sanitation must be established and maintained to assure the
health and well-being of all animals. To be corrected by: November 14, 2016.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor pig enclosure, there are sharp edges on the metal siding around the animal door. The sharp edges
around this opening could potentially injure the four pigs housed in this enclosure. The metal edges around this
animal doorway must be repaired to prevent injury to the animals.
In the outdoor goat enclosure, there are numerous boards laying on the ground. These boards appear to have
detached from a wooden animal shelter. The nails on these boards could injure the animals housed in this
enclosure. In addition to the boards laying on the ground, there is a piece of plywood laying on top of two wooden
animal shelters which is broken and could injure any goat climbing on top of it. All of the wooden animal shelters
(and the plywood board on top) in this enclosure must be repaired or replaced.
On the outside of the welded wire pig enclosure fencing, there is a layer of chicken wire attached at ground level.
The chicken wire is curling upwards into the adjacent goat pen and could injure the animals housed in that
enclosure. The curling chicken wire must be repaired or replaced in order to protect the health and well-being of the
all the animals.
In the outdoor goat enclosure, there are several tarps secured to the outside of adjacent animal enclosures which
have become severely frayed. The strings of tarp material hanging down into the goat pen could be ingested by the
animals housed in the enclosure. The frayed tarps must be repaired or replaced in order to protect the health and
well being of the all the animals.3.130
WATERING.
The water trough for the goat and llama enclosure has a large buildup of green fibrous material (algae) floating on
the surface of the water. All water receptacles must be kept clean in order to provide a supply of potable water to
the animals at all times. Cleaning and sanitation of the water receptacles for all animals must be done as often as
necessary to prevent the buildup of algae. To be corrected by: November 14, 2016.
3.131
SANITATION.
Wire mesh prairie dog cages with an excessive buildup of hay and fecal material were stacked on top of each other.
There was no barrier between cages to prevent fecal material from falling through the wire mesh into the bottom
cage. The build-up of feces and other debris in these prairie dog enclosures increases the risk of disease
transmission. A system of more frequent cleaning must be established and maintained in order to assure the health
and well-being of the prairie dogs housed in these enclosures. To be corrected by: November 14, 2016.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
