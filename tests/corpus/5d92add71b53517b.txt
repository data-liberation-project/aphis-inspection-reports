2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Privately owned vehicles are allowed in the drive through section of The Farm. When animals were present, vehicle
traffic became congested, becoming a mix of animals and cars. Only one attendant was present to keep traffic
moving and to ensure the public followed the drive through rules. Inspectors observed approximately seven people
driving through the park in a pick-up truck. Some of the individuals were riding in the bed of the truck. When the
truck got to the giraffe enclosure, one man was observed to stand up from the bed of the truck and used the giraffe
fence to climb on the edge of the bed of the truck. Thus, allowing him to lean on the giraffe enclosure and take
pictures. People were observed feeding and then trying to pet the animals. The facility does have cameras
observing the giraffe enclosure. However, no readily identifiable attendant was present within a reasonable amount
of time to correct the issue.
The facility provides a pelleted feed for customers to feed to the animals throughout their visit. During the drive
through section, unidentified food items were observed thrown out a car window. The animals ate the unapproved
food.
In the walk through portion of The Farm, one Boer goat was observed to get its head stuck in the fence during
public feeding. Upon discovery, one USDA inspector had to walk to find assistance because no readily identifiable
attendant was available. It took approximately 5-8 minutes until 2 facility staff arrived. It then took another
approximately 5-8 minutes to get the animal freed.
Lack of an attendant during public contact may lead to human and/or animal stress and injury. A responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact.
