FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the zoo commissary freezer, there is a large buildup of ice on the outside of the stored boxes of meat. This
accumulation of ice on the stored food products in the freezer could damage the protective packaging and lead to
dehydration and oxidation of the food, lessening the nutritional value. All food products must be storied in facilities
that protect against deterioration. The cause of the ice build-up in the freezer must be repaired, and all food
supplies inspected to assure that they are free of contamination. To be corrected by: August 1, 2017.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the eland outdoor exhibit area, there is a large hole (approximately 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, 2 feet deep) next to
the concrete block enclosure wall. This hole appears to be due to a water drainage problem in the animal enclosure
and the surrounding area on the outside of this concrete block wall. The three eland housed in this pen could
potentially be injured if they stepped into this hole in their outdoor enclosure. A suitable method must be provided to
rapidly eliminate excess water in this area. The source of the drainage problem in this area must be determined
and a method to rapidly eliminate the water developed and implemented. To be corrected by: September 30, 2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
