2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One adult male Shih Tzu named Benji (microchip number 052 285 616 ) has matted hair on its back, belly,
hindquarters, and rear legs covering approximately 60 percent of its body. The matted hair is balled and is tightly
adhered to the skin. Matted hair can trap dirt, debris, moisture and foster skin infections which could cause
potential pain and discomfort. It could hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. Matted hair does
not maintain the same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and
establish an effective program for coat maintenance for the health and well-being of these dogs.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 11/7/16 were conducted with the licensee.
* The exit briefing done on 11/8/16 were conducted with the licensee.
