3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
A section of the fence is leaning on the back side of the enclosure and was damaged in a storm a few months ago. In
addition, due to heavy rains there is erosion of the ground which is creating large gaps at the base of the fence in one
area. These gaps and the fence needs to be addressed to keep the enclosure structurally sound for the safety and
containment of the animals.
