3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Several areas in the facility have not been cleaned adequately:

***Most of the enclosures housing large dogs had areas of brown waxy organic material present on the walls which could
be scraped away when attempted.

***Roughly half of the self-feeders had a similar brown organic buildup along the underside of the projecting rim where the
feed is stored.

*** Roughly half of the primary enclosures had cobwebs present between the bars along the fronts of the cages, as well
as a small amount hanging from the ceiling. Additionally, there was dusty build-up along the tops of the inner cages and
along the water lines.

Inadequate cleaning can lead to adverse health effects of the animals. Correct by cleaning all surfaces of the housing


facility, including inside and outside of primary enclosures, areas above and below enclosures and any other adjacent
areas as often as necessary to prevent accumulations that may cause health risks to the animals.
3.6(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
In one enclosure housing 2 adult dalmatians and 1 adult Bernese mountain dog there is an area which has not been
maintained in good repair. One wall had an area of excessive chew damage approximately 2' by 3' which exposed the
dogs to jagged edges of the PVC boards. Jagged edges are potentially injurious to the animals and enclosures must be
maintained in good repair to ensure their wellbeing. Correct by ensuring all surfaces within the primary enclosures are
kept in good repair.
