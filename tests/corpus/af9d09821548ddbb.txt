2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult male white alpaca "Ice Cube" is noticed to be thin. He is alert and active but his backbone, hips and ribs are
readily visible. Licensee stated that the animal had not been dewormed since May 2021 and the written Program of
Veterinary Care indicates that animals will be dewormed monthly and have fecal checks done three times a year. Weight
loss in an animal can be due to a variety of underlying health issues that can ultimately affect their welfare. The licensee
had not noticed that the animal was thin. The condition of this animal needs to be discussed with the attending
veterinarian and proper treatment provided. Direct and frequent communication on problems of health should be
conveyed in a timely manner to the attending veterinarian to ensure the well-being of the animals.
