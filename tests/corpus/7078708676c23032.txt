Feeding.
9 rabbits were housed in an enclosure with 3 empty bowls and no food or water. The inspector ask the licensee to place
food into the enclosure. Immediately when one bowl was filled with carrots, 7 rabbits tightly crowded around the bowl,
pushing each other out of the way, eating the carrots very rapidly. The licensee stated that the rabbits were fed at least
once a day, as well as receiving food during public encounters; however, the facility was closed that day to the public.
When physically palpated, the rabbits were determined to be in good body condition. Rabbits have digestive systems that
benefit from the frequent intake of food and fiber. Rabbits that experience prolonged periods of time without access to
food can suffer from serious and life-threatening digestive problems, in addition to hunger, weight loss, and discomfort.
Rabbits were provided with carrots at the time of the inspection, which provided some nutrition, but this is not adequate
for the number of rabbits in the enclosure. Correct by providing an adequate amount of an appropriate diet as determined
by your Attending Veterinarian for all rabbits in the enclosure beginning October 1st, 2020.
3.58(a)

Classification and separation.
One adult rabbit was housed in a primary enclosure containing 3 lemurs, 4 coatis, over 10 birds, and one cavi. While the
rabbit appeared to be healthy at the time of inspection, rabbits have specialized dietary, environmental, and behavioral


needs which can be negatively affected by the presence of other species of animals in their enclosure. Correct by October
2nd, 2020, by housing the rabbit in an enclosure that does not contain any other species of animals.
3.77(f)

Sheltered housing facilities.
Three adult ring-tailed lemurs were housed in a sheltered enclosure. The enclosure is located on a property that is
surrounded by a perimeter fence that is 55 inches tall (4.58 feet tall). A perimeter fence is required to prevent
unauthorized entry of people and animals which could steal, injure, sicken, harass, or kill the captive animals. Lemurs and
other non-dangerous non-human primates housed in sheltered facilities require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around the
outdoor section of their enclosure. The fence must be at least 3-feet away from enclosures or buildings. Correct by
constructing a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence of sufficient strength to prevent entry of unauthorized people or animals (the size
of raccoons, skunks, or dogs), and that is at least 3-feet away from other enclosures or structures. Alternatively, a
variance may be requested in writing from the APHIS Administrator. Correct by November 13th, 2020.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
Three adult foxes, four adult red kangaroos, and four adult African crested porcupines were housed in various outdoor
enclosures. The enclosures are located on a property that is surrounded by a perimeter fence that is 55 inches tall (4.58
feet tall). A perimeter fence is required to prevent unauthorized entry of people and animals which could steal, injure,
sicken, harass, or kill the captive animals. Non-dangerous exotic animals such as these, housed in outdoor facilities,
require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around their enclosure. The fence must be at least 3-feet away from any enclosures
or buildings. Correct by constructing a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence of sufficient strength to prevent entry of unauthorized
people or animals (the size of raccoons, skunks, or dogs), and that is at least 3-feet away from any enclosures or


structures. Alternatively, a variance may be requested in writing from the APHIS Administrator. Correct by November
13th, 2020.

Health certification and identification.
The licensee transported 4 nonhuman primates (2 adult red ruff lemurs, 1 adult female pig-tailed macaque, and 1 adult
female rhesus macaque) into the state of Mississippi without first obtaining health certificates. The licensee purchased the
2 macaques at an auction out of state and transported them to his facility in Mississippi without obtaining health
certificates prior to transport. Two red ruff lemurs are on loan from a USDA-licensed facility in Texas and were transported
by the licensee into Mississippi without obtaining health certificates in the 10 days prior to transport. Medical examination
of animals and issuance of health certificates prior to transport protects animals by ensuring that they are healthy enough
to travel, and will not transmit disease to other animals. Correct on October 1st, 2020, by obtaining veterinary examination
and health certificates within 10 days before the transport of non-human primates in commerce.
3.78(d)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two adult female macaques are housed in an outdoor facility which is surrounded by a perimeter fence that is 55 inches
tall (4.58 feet tall). A perimeter fence is required to prevent unauthorized entry of people and animals which could steal,
injure, sicken, harass, or kill the captive animals. Macaques and other non-dangerous non-human primates housed in
outdoor facilities require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around their enclosure. The fence must be at least 3-feet away from
enclosures or buildings. Correct by constructing a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence of sufficient strength to prevent entry of
unauthorized people or animals, and that is at least 3-feet away from other enclosures or structures. Alternatively, a
variance may be requested in writing from the regional office. Correct by November 13th, 2020.
2.75(b)(1)



Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee did not have disposition records for two animals that were sold in the last 12 months: one adult marmoset
and one adult Bactrian/hybrid camel. Recordkeeping is important for animal welfare because it increases traceability of
animals, allows for the recognition of lost or missing animals, and aids in the investigation of missing or stolen animals.
Correct by October 30th, 2020 by completing animal disposition records for all animals who were sold, donated, or died in
the last 12 months.
3.77(a)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The sheltered enclosure housing 3 adult lemurs did not have a means of heating or cooling the indoor part of the
enclosure. The licensee stated that he planned to use an oil heater to provide heat in the indoor part of the enclosure
when the weather was colder. Nonhuman primates subjected to temperature extremes may suffer from discomfort,
dehydration, or heat stress. The indoor part of a sheltered facility for nonhuman primates is required to a means of
heating and cooling the indoor area to maintain ambient temperatures between 45- and 85- degrees Fahrenheit. Correct
by providing a means of climate control in the indoor area of the sheltered lemur enclosure. Correct by October 30, 2020.
3.78(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The outdoor enclosure housing 2 adult female macaques did not have appropriate shelter from the cold. The enclosure
contained a plastic tub with no lid, turned on its side, as a shelter. There was no source of heat. Nonhuman primates
subjected to temperature extremes may suffer from discomfort, dehydration, or heat stress. Outdoor enclosures for
nonhuman primates are required provide shelter from the elements, including a heat source when ambient temperatures
fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Correct by providing a source of heat for the outdoor enclosure housing the macaques,


adequate to provide heat to both animals, when temperatures fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Correct by October 30,
2020.
3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
There was a pile of fecal material on the floor of the indoor section of the sheltered enclosure housing 3 ring-tailed lemurs.
The pile of the fecal material was approximately 1 foot by 1 foot in size. There were flies around the fecal material and
ants on the floor of the enclosure. The licensee stated that the floor was cleaned once a week. Accumulation of feces in
the enclosure can cause animals to become soiled, can create disease hazards, and can attract insects and other pests.
Correct on October 1st, 2020, by removing excreta from the indoor part of the sheltered enclosure daily.

This is a continuation of the report of the routine inspection started on September 29th, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
