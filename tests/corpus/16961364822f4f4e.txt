ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care is incomplete. Although the licensee appears to be addressing the vet care
needs for the wolf dogs, steer, and camel, however the written program of vet care does not state what program to
follow. The parasite control section only states monthly and bi monthly, nothing else. It does not state what
products to use for parasite prevention or fleas, ticks and mites. The written PVC does not address any
vaccinations or any other treatment required for the steer and camels if any. There are no preventive measures
stated on the written PVC for heart worm for the wolf dogs. The licensee states she is given ivermectin every two
months for parasite control, however there is no proof this is being provided. The licensee is using cattle strength
ivermectin for parasite control, however there is no written documentation on the PVC, showing the amount used for
these animals. The attending veterinarian needs to state how often he is to visit the facility and what vet care
needs to be provided for these animals to ensure an appropriate vet care plan is being provided and followed.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The transport trailer that houses the steer is not large enough to turn about freely and to make normal postural
adjustments. I observed the steers back side and nose have contact with the metal enclosure. The steers horns
also had contact with the enclosure numerous times while he was standing still. Continuous contact with the steers
body parts may cause skin problems or possible injury due to his horns getting caught in the opening of the
enclosure. This steer needs to be able to travel comfortably, without having contact with this enclosure.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The camel did not have sufficient space for social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement during this
inspection. The camel was tethered to the transport trailer during this inspection. The section of rope was
approximately 3 feet in length, no giving the camel enough space for social adjustments with adequate freedom of
movement. I observed the camel lay its its own excreta due to lack of space provided. I also observed one of the
horses attempt to kick the camel, not allowing the camel enough space to prevent a potential injury.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The enclosure that houses the steer in the transport trailer is not large enough for animal to turn around freely and
to make normal postural adjustments. I observed the steers back side and nose have contact with the metal
enclosure. The steers horns also had contact with the enclosure numerous times while he was standing still.
Continuous contact with the steers body parts may cause skin problems or possible injury due to his horns getting
caught in the opening of the enclosure. This steer needs to be able to travel comfortably, without having contact
with this enclosure.
