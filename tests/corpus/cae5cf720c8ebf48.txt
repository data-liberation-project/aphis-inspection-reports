2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daisy is a 20 month old tiger at the facility. APHIS inspectors first noticed that she was having balance issues in
September 2016. At that time inspectors were shown records that indicated that the attending veterinarian had
diagnosed otitis externa and otitis media on September 26, 2016. This diagnosis was done without immobilization
of the tiger. The veterinarian had treated Daisy for a jaw abscess earlier in the summer of 2016. He assumed the
ataxia was due to infection traveling from the jaw and infecting her middle and outer ear. Daisy has been off and on
combinations of antibiotics and steroids since that time. Daisy’s condition was noted to be much worse on an
APHIS inspection on November 9, 2016. In response to the inspection report, Daisy was immobilized for an
examination and blood collection. Blood work was not remarkable and Daisy was again treated for an inner ear
infection. The attending veterinarian noted no obvious jaw or ear issues on the physical examination done at this
time. (This was relayed to Animal Care’s big cat specialist in a phone conversation that took place on March 29,
2017.) There can be other diagnoses which can be the cause of Daisy’s symptoms, toxoplasmosis being highly
likely. This information has been shared with the attending veterinarian on at least two occasions. The latest time
was a phone conversation between Animal Care’s big cat specialist and the attending veterinarian for the facility on
March 29, 2017. Despite this information, a toxoplasmosis titer has never been done for Daisy and Daisy has never
been treated with an antibiotic effective against toxoplasmosis at a high enough dose and for a long enough
duration to be effective against the infection. Records reviewed on today’s inspection showed that since the time of
the last inspection on March 20, 2017, Daisy has been on various doses of prednisone and prednisone in
combination with Baytril. Daisy is currently on daily prednisone. The lack of a diagnosis and effective treatment is
causing the continued suffering of the tiger. A knowledgeable, expert veterinarian who specializes in exotic
medicine (with training in big cat medicine) must be consulted. Results of this consultation must be documented
and records must be available for APHIS review at the time of the next inspection.
3.129(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
There are two approximately 2 year old Syrian brown bears at the facility. These two bears have rough, dull looking
hair coats, are thin and appear undersized for their age. A recent meal for the bears consisted of: approximately 10gallons of apples, pears and carrots, 2 pounds of cheese and 2 to 3 gallons of cake trimmings. Based on our
discussions with the CEO of the facility, APHIS inspectors think that a diet poor in nutritional content may be
responsible for the appearance of these bears. These bears are still young and growing. Inadequate diet at this
point in their life will lead to lifelong complications. This can result in a lifetime of unnecessary suffering for these
bears. A diet plan must be developed for these bears. It should be written plan and it must be approved by the
attending veterinarian. All items to be fed to the bears must be specified in the plan. Amounts and combinations of
food items must be specified in enough detail so it is possible to determine if the meal is nutritionally adequate.
Frequency of daily feedings and approximate feeding times must be documented in the feeding plan. Meals should
be documented with time of day and all items and amounts fed noted. This documentation must be available for
review by APHIS officials. Special consideration must be given to calcium level in the diet as these bears are not
fully grown and require more calcium in their diet than an adult bear. Inadequate calcium levels could lead to
conditions such as metabolic bone disease which would cause pain and suffering for these bears.
This inspection report documents APHIS findings for the tiger known as Daisy and the Syrian brown bears noted as
being under review by APHIS officials on the inspection report delivered on 4-27-17.
Exit interview conducted with the facility CEO on 5-2-17.
