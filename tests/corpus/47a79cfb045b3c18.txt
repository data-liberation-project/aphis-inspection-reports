2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Only one disposition form was presented for inspection since last inspection despite a two page difference in the
inventory. Acquisition and disposition records are necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in
regulated activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation.
The exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose all the required
information concerning animals that are acquired, transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
