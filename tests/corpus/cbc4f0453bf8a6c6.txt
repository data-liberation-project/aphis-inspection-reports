PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Transport enclosures housing hamsters and guinea pigs did have adequate rims or other devices on the exterior of
the outside walls to provide a minimum air circulation space of .75 inches. The lid of the transport enclosures only
provided .25 inches of ventilation space on the sides. Transport enclosures for hamsters and guinea pigs must have
projecting rims or other devices on the exterior of the outside walls which provide a minimum air circulation space of
.75 inches between the transport enclosure and any adjacent cargo wall.
Failure to provide a circulation space of at least .75 inches on the sides of transport enclosures could put animals at
risk of overheating or having reduced air circulation. Carriers and intermediate handlers must not transport animals
unless there are adequate projecting rims or other devices that provide at least .75 inches of air circulation on the
exterior of the outside walls of the animal transport container (see air waybill # 006 LAX 78985222).
