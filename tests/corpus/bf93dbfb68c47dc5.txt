FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the goat and sheep enclosure the wire fencing had many broken wires. In one place which was accessible to the
animals, there was an opening large enough that the animals could attempt to stick their heads into it. The wire
ends could cause injury, and the opening poses a risk of entanglement.

The enclosure should be structurally sound and maintained so as to be free of hazards. The facility should institute
a system of regular review and maintenance of all animal enclosures to ensure that they are safe and secure.
Hazards should be minimized immediately, pending more permanent repairs.
To be corrected by 9/1/2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
