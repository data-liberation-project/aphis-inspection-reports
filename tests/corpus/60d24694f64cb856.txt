3.6(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
*** Two enclosures have sections of wire that are broken creating gaps between enclosures with sharp edges pointing
inward. These sections of wire must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the dogs.

*** Multiple enclosures have wire coated flooring where the plastic coating is coming off the wire, exposing some thinner
wire strands. These coated floors must be maintained in good repair to keep the enclosure structurally sound and to
protect the dogs feet from injury.
