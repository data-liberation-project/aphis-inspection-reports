2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.31 e 4
At the time of inspection protocol 2014-013 was reviewed. The protocol involves surgery in rabbits and indicates
the use of buprenorphine with carprofen. A review of the medical records indicates not all the rabbits received the
carprofen. In addition the protocol mentions fentanyl may be used, a review of records shows not all animals show
the administration of fentanyl with no documentation of whether the animal needed the additional analgesia.
Facility needs to ensure the protocol and records reflect the analgesia that was approved by the IACUC and if
amendments are submitted they are followed.
