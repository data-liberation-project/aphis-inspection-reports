ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were two dogs at the facility with dental conditions.
*An approximately 8 year old male long haired black and tan Dachshund, "Snake Eyes" (#041*036*545) had some
teeth that appeared to be missing and a heavy buildup of tan to brown to greyish material on the majority of the
teeth that were present. The gums over both upper canine teeth were red and inflamed and had receded. The
buildup of material on the teeth had a rough and cobblestone appearance.
*An approximately 7 year old male red and white wire haired Dachshund, "Mr. Whiskers" (OBOF092262) had his
tongue hanging out of the right side of his mouth. On closer observation, the dog had some teeth that appeared
worn down and some teeth with a heavy buildup of tan to brown to dark grey material. The gums over both upper
canine teeth were red and inflamed with some recession present.
According to written documentation from the licensee, the last dental procedure performed on these dogs had been
by a veterinarian on July 22, 2014. The current abnormal build-up of material on these dogs' teeth can cause
damage to the gum tissues and tooth structures. These conditions could negatively impact these dogs' ability to eat
normally and their overall well-being. The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in
order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed.
The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the
animals at the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times. To

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (3) Cleaning.
*Most of the enclosures on the outdoor portion of the sheltered building contained greater than a day's worth of
fecal
material. In most of the enclosures, it appeared that the amount of fecal material present made it difficult for
the animals to avoid walking in it. According to the licensee, the outdoor portions of the enclosures were last
cleaned on Monday evening. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily andsanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease
hazards. The licensee must remove the accumulated fecal material from these enclosures and ensure that all
excreta is removed daily from primary enclosures to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures,
and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. To be corrected by: January 27, 2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
