CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
On 1/1/2015, a 2 year old shepherd-husky cross male dog arrived at the passenger terminal in Portland from
Orlando via Atlanta. The dog was already out of his crate and was leashed and standing with his owner. The dog
was obviously too large for the crate he had just exited.
The crate measured 30" long x 18" wide x 27" high, outside measure. The top of the dog's head, when he was
seated in a fairly relaxed position, was approximately 32" from the floor.
A primary enclosure (crate, in this case) must be large enough that the animal contained in it has enough space to
turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position. This was not possible for
this dog.
Correct by ensuring that dogs and cats are only accepted for transport in primary enclosures that meet the
requirements in Section 3.14 of the regulations from now on.
The situation was discussed with the baggage area agent and the shift supervisor at the time of the inspection. The
inspection included the passenger terminal and the cargo office of the airline.
