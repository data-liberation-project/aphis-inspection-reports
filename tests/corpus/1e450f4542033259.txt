ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 a.m. on
05/19/2015.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door. I also called the contact number and made contact with the
licensee. He was unable to return at that time but did provide more optimal hours for inspection.
End of report.
