Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 995 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of
adults, weanlings, or newborns present for the last few months.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Facilities, indoor.
There were 2 guinea pig pens that had side walls made of bare wood not sealed or painted.
Unsealed floors and surfaces are difficult to clean and sanitize, which can lead to disease hazards for the guinea pigs.
Interior building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can be readily


cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.

Primary enclosures.
There were 2 guinea pig pens that did not provide the required amount of floor space. There were 123 and 100 weanling
guinea pigs each housed in pens that measured 46 by 108 inches or 4,968 square inches of floor space. Each weanling
requires a minimum of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required to house these weanlings is 7,380 and
6,000 square inches respectively. There cannot be more than 82 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure
measuring 46 by 108 inches.
Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.
