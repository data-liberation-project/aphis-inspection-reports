3.106(b)(3)
WATER QUALITY.
The reagent for the free chlorine test has not been obtained, so the free chlorine concentrations for the manatee
pools have not been performed for the past year. There were also several days within the past year where the total
chlorine concentrations for the pools were not recorded. Additionally, some of the total chlorine concentrations that
were reviewed were being recorded inaccurately.
Water samples shall be taken & tested daily for any additives (chlorine). All test results shall be recorded
accurately.
