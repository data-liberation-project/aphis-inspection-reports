3.53(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**The mat covering the wire mesh flooring in two rabbit enclosures was saturated with urine and dirty wood
shavings. The rabbits have to walk through the wood shavings in order to access the water bowl. The rabbits do
not have a clean surface to lay on or walk through to access food and water. The floor coverings should be
maintained in a manner to allow the rabbits to be clean and dry while in the enclosure.
