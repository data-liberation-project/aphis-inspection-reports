Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian diagnosed caseous lymphadenitis (CL) in the goat herd. The attending veterinarian wrote a
protocol for the treatment and management of this disease for the licensee to follow. The attending veterinarian stated
that the licensee is not following this protocol.

Each exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

The attending veterinarian must be given appropriate authority to oversee all aspects of adequate veterinary care. All
attending veterinarian instructions must be followed to ensure the goats are treated and managed to maintain proper
health and mitigate transfer of the disease to non-infected animals.

2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

There is an intact, male Lamancha goat with hair loss on its back and shoulders. The skin on the Lamancha goat
appears to be dry, and thickened. There is an intact, male Saanen goat with hair loss on its back and sides. The Saanen
goat also drags its back toes and has an abnormal gate. The condition of these animals has not been reported to the
attending veterinarian.

Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being must be completed. These daily observation of
animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided that there is a mechanism of
direct and frequent communication and timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-
being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

At any time daily observations are completed by someone other than the attending veterinarian, problems of animal
health and behavior must be promptly communicated to the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian must be
made aware of any health or behavior problems to provide a diagnosis and treatment plan to prevent disease progression
or discomfort to the animal.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee did not have a record of animals on hand available for inspection.

Every exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or

otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her
possession or under his or her control.

Records of Animals on Hand must be made available for inspection. Records must be kept to trace and track animal
movement, track unusual or high mortality rates, and assure that all animals held are accounted for.

3.56(b)(1)

Sanitation.
There is a large buildup of urine scale on the urine guards in one of the rabbit enclosures. The urine scale is thick, dried,
and yellow/white.

Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(3) of
this section.

Urine buildup on the urine guards prevents the proper sanitization of the enclosure. The urine scale must be removed to
allow for proper sanitization of the rabbit enclosure to prevent disease, and odor.

3.125(a)

Facilities, general.

The intact, male, Boer goat has a board that makes up one side of its enclosure that has a very large hole in it. The hole
measures approximately 18" by 18".

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

This board must be replaced, or repaired to prevent the goat from getting a horn, or a foot caught in the hole and causing
injury.

3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The shelter for the Holstein cow has had the front portion of its roof removed to allow the cow access to the shelter. The
roof line was too low prior to the removal. The shelter has an accumulation of approximately two feet of straw and
manure pack. The cow can no longer fit under the roof of the shelter.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

An appropriate shelter with a roof must be provided to this cow to offer it shelter from rain, snow, and wind.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.

There is an excessive amount of straw and manure pack in the Holstein cows shelter. The manure pack is approximately
2' high. The manure pack is preventing the cow from using its shelter due to the low height of the shelter.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

The manure pack must be removed to allow the cow access to its shelter, to prevent contamination of the animal, to
minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors.
