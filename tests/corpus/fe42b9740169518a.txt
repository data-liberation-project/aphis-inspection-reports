3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection the perimeter fence for the facility was found to be out of compliance with section 3.127 (d).
A gate in the perimeter fence in the expansion construction zone was found inoperable and left open and
unattended. There were several gaps or openings at various locations under the perimeter fence or its gates that
measured from four to nine inches. Additionally, there are regularly-spaced “wildlife corridor” openings in the fence
at ground level that measure seven inches in height by up to thirteen inches in width, and the inspector had
previously been told that these openings would be sealed, but they remain open as of the time of inspection. The
entire perimeter fence was not examined at the time of this inspection, as it was observed that the problems
identified at the last inspection remained uncorrected. Regardless, to be clear, the standards must be met for the
entire perimeter fence.
The fence should prevent people and animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing
secondary containment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The fence should consistently
meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. Failure to meet the standards specified in 3.127 (d)
could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility. Gates in the fence should remain closed if
unattended. The fence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described
here. Gaps that could allow animals to pass under the fence should be closed. If “wildlife corridor” openings in the
fence are required by another regulatory agency, then a variance must be attained from the USDA / APHIS / Animal
Care Administrator in order to allow for this deviation from the requirements.
This inspection was conducted on 12/5/17 with the facility representative, and inspectors Smith and Rosendale.
An exit interview was conducted on 12/8/17 with facility representatives, and Dr. Smith.Additional Inspectors
