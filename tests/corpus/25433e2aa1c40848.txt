Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One female bobcat housed in the outdoor enclosure was very thin with an unthrifty hair coat and was displaying
significantly abnormal behavior. She did not want to move but when forced to stand up had a very unsteady appearance,
an easily noticeable head tilt, full body tremble/tick, and her front right leg appeared to be malformed. When asked about
this animal, the licensee stated he had not noticed any abnormalities since the last time he observed the animal two days
ago.
One male bobcat housed inside appeared significantly thinner than the female bobcat in the same enclosure. The hips,
spine, both scapula and ribs were clearly visible from outside the enclosure. The licensee stated he has always had
trouble keeping weight on this bobcat and has tested his feces for parasites multiple times.
One female otter did not want to move when outside of its shelter box. When forced to move, she appeared unstable on
her hind-end. The licensee stated she had an episode this past year that they believe was a stroke and since then she
has not been able to swim or move around normally.
Failure to provide appropriate methods to diagnose and treat diseases can cause unnecessary distress and discomfort to
the animals. Correct by contacting your attending veterinarian and following all treatment recommendations including
continued communication on the status of these animals until an examination can be performed. Correct by 5pm on June
9, 2021.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records of animals on-hand have been updated since the last inspection but still do not accurately represent the
animals observed during today’s inspection. Specifically:
13 adult racoons on hand, 14 adult racoons on inventory
9 racoon offspring on hand from 2 litters, 0 racoon offspring on inventory
2 skunks on hand, 4 skunks on inventory
2 cougars on hand, 0 cougars on inventory
Incomplete or inaccurate records, including failure to document offspring born on premise, makes animal tracking difficult
to impossible and is especially important in the event of a disease outbreak. Correct by maintaining accurate records.

Watering.
Water receptacles located in the primary enclosures of the racoons, bears, skunks, otter, bobcats and wolf were soiled
with a build up of fecal material, grime and food particles. Unsanitary water receptacles can cause disease and health
risks to the animals. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.
Correct by Monday June 15, 2021.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
Several enclosures are in need of cleaning:
**One enclosure housing two racoons contains a flat metal pan with an excessive build-up of grime and fecal material.
**Four additional outdoor enclosures housing 8 racoons still have an accumulation of fecal material and spent bedding on
the floors and within the shelter boxes.
**The pools in the river otter and bear enclosures contained black water, where you could not visualize more than a few

inches into the water. The licensee stated these pools have not been drained or cleaned since last fall.
Failure to maintain clean enclosures for the animals exposes them to increased disease hazards and puts their health at
risk. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining all animal enclosures, including pools contained in those enclosures.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The indoor area of the main building housing tigers, cougars, raccoons, skunks, and bobcats is also used for food
preparation and has an office area. The building inside of the bear secondary containment fence is also being used for
storage. These areas require cleaning, removal of unused items, and general reorganization. There are many items not
currently being used for animal husbandry that need to either be discarded or placed in a suitable storage area. Dust, dirt,
trash, and cobwebs are accumulating throughout these areas which makes normal husbandry practices more difficult and
does not satisfy accepted cleanliness standards. Correct this by cleaning and reorganizing these areas.
