PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On 1-5-14, a male Diana monkey made contact with a lion in an adjacent exhibit through the barrier fence in the
separation moat. The monkey lost the lower half of its arm to the lion, and the arm had to be amputated at the
shoulder. This primate has lived in this enclosure since July, 2009 and was only observed entering the moat on two
occasions that first year, and none since that time until this incident. The enclosure was not adequate to prevent
the primate from being injured.
The facility has corrected this citation by placing hot wires at the edge of the primate side of the moat, hardware
cloth mesh over the moat fence on the primates side, and electifying the new secondary separation fence on the
lions side. Measures are also in place to report and take actions if animals go into the moat.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
