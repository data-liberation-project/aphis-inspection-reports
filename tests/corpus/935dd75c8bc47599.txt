Housing facilities, general.
The elevated resting box for the squirrel monkey was had large diagonal cracks along two sides resulting in insecurity of
the floor of the box. Cracks that weaken the box present a risk for entrapment of digits, which could result in injury, and
also weaken the integrity of the box, which could mean the animal does not want to use the resting box for shelter,
potentially resulting in stress on the animal. The licensee must ensure that housing is in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
