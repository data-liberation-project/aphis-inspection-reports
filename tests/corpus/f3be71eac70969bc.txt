2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The rear quarter of a white, male sheep was unshorn. The wool in this area was matted with some fecal pellets and debris
stuck to it. The overgrown haircoat did not appear to affect movement or postural adjustments or cause visible discomfort
or stress at time of inspection. Unshorn, overgrown hair coats may lead to stress, discomfort and medical issues in sheep
if not appropriately addressed.
The hind hooves of the same sheep and at least 1 goat were overgrown. The overgrowth of hooves may cause the
animal discomfort and lead to injuries or lameness if not appropriately addressed.
The facility must establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes timely scheduling of hoof
trimming and care and shearing when needed.

Facilities, general.
A goat was observed jumping out of his enclosure into a rabbit pen at time of inspection. Animal care attendants were
present and immediately returned the goat to his pen. Neither goat or rabbits were injured during this incident. Animal
enclosures should be constructed as appropriate for the animals involved, to contain the animals within, and to protect
them from injury.
