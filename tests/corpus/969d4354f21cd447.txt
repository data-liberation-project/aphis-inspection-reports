ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 on
30-Jul-19.Upon arrival, I knocked on the door and called the phone number listed. The licensee was not able to
come to the facility in a timely manner for the inspection process.
This is the first attempted inspection.
