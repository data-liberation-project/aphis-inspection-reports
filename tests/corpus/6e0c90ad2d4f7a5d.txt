Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male brown and black guinea pig housed with 4 other guinea pigs has an area of hairloss and scaly skin near the
corner of the left eye. Per the facility representative, the hairloss was noted upon arrival to the facility, however the
attending veterinarian has not been consulted about the condition.

Problems that are not communicated in a timely manner to the attending veterinarian can lead to poor health and poor
animal welfare, and conditions that are contagious can be spread to other animals in the facility.

Direct and timely communication of animal health problems must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian to ensure the
health and well-being of the animal.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).


A male grey chinchilla has an area of hairloss with mildly red and scaly skin at the base of the left ear. Per the facility
representative, the hairloss was not seen and therefore the attending veterinarian has not been consulted about the
condition.

Unobserved health problems can cause pain and distress and can become more serious when they are not treated, and
contagious conditions can affect other animals in the facility. Animals must be observed daily to assess their health and
well-being and all concerns must be timely and accurately communicated to the attending veterinarian.

Sanitation.
The floor of the checkout area and in front of the opossum enclosure is cluttered with trash and debris. In front of the coati
enclosure, there is trash, cardboard boxes, and other items blocking access to the enclosure. The front room adjacent to
the checkout area is cluttered with toys, trash, and other items.

Accumulations of dirt, trash, and other debris and clutter can be a disease hazard to animals, can create noxious odors,
and can be a breeding ground for vermin. Excessive clutter can hinder husbandry practices and make it difficult to clean
and monitor for the presence of vermin.

Trash should be placed in designated areas, the premises kept clean, and clutter minimized.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
