2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The licensee was unable to provide inspectors with a copy of the facility's current Program of Veterinary Care
(PVC) during the inspection. Three animals at the facility have veterinary medical problems that have not been
adequately addressed. A written Program of Veterinary Care is required when veterinarians are employed on a
part-time basis in order to ensure that animals receive adequate veterinary care. The licensee must develop and
document a Program of Veterinary Care in consultation with their current attending veterinarian. This Program of
Veterinary Care must be provided to inspectors upon inspection.
To be corrected from this date forward.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*Two adult female dromedary camels named Camelle and Cleo are too thin. The camels'(cid:25) ribs can be seen even
through the wool on their sides. The hip bones on both animals are prominent, and there is a concave appearance
between the hips and the ribcage up to the back of and under the hump. In addition, the camels'(cid:25) humps are small.
The camels'(cid:25) vertebrae can be seen from the base of the tail to the back of the hump when viewing them from the
rear. The shoulders and necks have reduced muscle mass as indicated by the prominent shoulder bones and
concave appearance to the sides of their necks.
**An adult black and white male Nubian goat named Romeo is also too thin. He has extremely prominent hip bones
and a very concave appearance between the hips and ribcage all the way to the spine when viewed from any
direction. The vertebrae are very prominent from the shoulder blades to the base of the tail.
A thin body condition can be an indication of poor nutrition or other health problems.
The licensee must consult with a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and to develop and follow a treatment plan. The
licensee must document the veterinarian's findings, the treatment plan that is followed, and have the records on thepremises and available to the inspector upon request.
To be corrected by September 21, 2015.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The primary enclosure fence, for the two camels, one sheep and a goat is sagging in areas between the posts.
The mesh wire was rolled over from the top and tangled together in areas. The smooth wire is not tight and sagging
between the posts. The fencing is not securely fastened along the top to the posts. The fencing is not in good
repair and is not maintained. As of the last inspection, this non-compliant item has not been corrected. This could
allow for the animals to escape or get tangled in the wire from escaping, resulting in possible injury. All outdoor
facilities for the animals must be maintained and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain
the animals.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Several large round bales are stored next the animals'(cid:25) enclosure and are ready for feeding. The large bales are
exposed to the elements. Several bales are stored directly on the ground. There are tall weeds growing around the
bales approximately one to four feet tall. The majority of the hay is deteriorated and moldy. A vine plant is growing
out of one of the bales indicating the hay has deteriorated.
Molded and deteriorated hay can affect the wholesome nutritional value of the hay. This hay can affect the health of
one goat, one sheep and two dromedary camels.
The licensee must provide adequate storage for the hay to prevent deterioration and molding. This will ensure the
hay is wholesome and preserve the hay'(cid:25)s nutritional value.
To be corrected by September 25, 2015.
3.127(d) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* There is no perimeter fence around the enclosure housing the two camels. The outdoor enclosure, housing the
camels, must have a perimeter fence at least six feet high and a minimum distance of three feet from the primary
enclosure fence. As of the last inspection, this non-compliant item has not been corrected. A perimeter fence will
provide protection to the camels by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence can function as a secondary containment
system for the camels in the facility.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
* In the paddock where the two dromedary camels, one Nubian goat, and one sheep are kept, the only food that is
available to them is one large round bale of hay. When asked about grain or other feed, the licensee stated that
they also eat sweet feed and an herbivore 18 pelleted feed. There was none of this grain available to the animals at
the time of inspection. The licensee stated that the feed is only bought one bag at a time, and it was taken to the
second site for the animals that had already been transported there. There is no grass in the paddock for grazing.
The only vegetation present is a ground-cover type of plant that covers approximately ten to fifteen percent of the
paddock, and any corn plants the camels can manage to reach from the cornfield that is several feet away from the
enclosure fence. The hay bale that is present is damp to the touch, dark brown, deteriorated, and moldy when
looking in various parts of the bale under the surface.
Contaminated food is of poor to no nutritional value to the animals and can affect their health and well-being, can
cause poor body condition, sickness and even death.
The licensee shall provide food that is wholesome, palatable, free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and
nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In the paddock housing one goat, two camels, and one sheep there are two large piles of manure approximately
four to five feet high and at least six to seven feet across.
Excess manure in the enclosures can attract pests and can cause disease hazards and odors.The licensee must remove the excess excreta as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
To be corrected by September 21, 2015
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
*Around much of the primary fence there is an excessive growth of weeds and brush. Some of this vegetation is up
to five feet tall and the growth is too thick to effectively inspect the condition of the entire perimeter of the primary
fence.
An excessive growth of vegetation prevents the effective inspection of the primary fence to find areas in need of
repairs to prevent injury to the animals and to contain them. It also provides breeding areas for pests and vermin.
*In several areas of the paddock, there are several strands of bale twine on the ground.
The bale twine can be ingested by the animals or they could get entangled in it causing injury.
*Two metal livestock hay feeders are tipped over on their sides. These feeders have metal bars in which the
animals can get hooves, horns or legs stuck.
Any structures or debris in which the animals can get any part of their body entangled or stuck can cause serious
injury to the animals.
The licensee must trim the excess vegetation around the enclosure fence to allow the inspection of the fence and to
prevent breeding areas for pests and vermin. All premises (building and grounds) must be kept clean and in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
