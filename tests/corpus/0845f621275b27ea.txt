3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Many surfaces such as the walls, ceiling, and cyclone fencing in the sheltered enclosures that housed 1 Springer
Spaniel and 2 German Shepherds, as well as concrete surfaces housing American Eskimos had waste and debris
accumulation greater than one day. There was a prevalent accumulation of insects throughout the facility and in
some areas, negative odors were present. Areas that are not spot cleaned daily can cause negative odors, insect
infestation, and food and water supplies. Spot clean all surfaces that come in contact with animals daily using
methods provided in 3.11 (b)(3).

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal.
There was a large blue bucket sitting in front of an enclosure housing 2 dogs that had animal excreta inside it that
had not been properly disposed of. According to the licensee, the waste has been there for more than 24 hours.
Two adjacent enclosures, one housing a Springer Spaniel and one housing two German Shepherds, had an
excessive accumulation of animal waste in the outdoor portion of the enclosures. The area had an abundance of
flying insects that were landing on the animals and waste during the inspection. Improper cleaning practices can
cause contamination of food and water supplies, infestation of insects and vermin, and unpleasant odors. Animal
waste must be picked up in a timely manner and properly disposed of in order to provide a safe and healthy
environment for the animals.

3.6(a)(2)(1) DIRECT REPEATPRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General requirements.
There are a few areas throughout the facility that still have sharp points. The sheltered portion in the enclosure
housing one male Springer Spaniel still has a large sharp hook attached to a post at eye level to the dog and
unraveled cyclone fencing at the bottom of the gate. The outdoor enclosure just south of the whelping building
housing 2 German Shepherds still contains the homemade dog house that acts as the sole shelter from the
elements. Although some of the sharp points have been addressed, there are still two sharp screw heads protruding
out of the walls inside the shelter so that the shelter cannot safely be used. This same enclosure also has cyclone
fencing that is unraveled. Sharp points present physical hazards that could injure the dogs. Repair, remove or
replace these sharp points or edges to prevent injury.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
The two enclosures just south of the north shed contain more than a day's worth of feces. One enclosure housed
two German Shepherds and the other housed one Springer Spaniel. The Springer Spaniel had numerous flies
around its head and ears. Failure to remove excreta daily from primary enclosures could increase disease hazards,
pests and odors and lead to soiling of the animals. Remove the feces from these enclosures and maintain daily
removal of excreta in all enclosures to reduce these risks and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises
There continues to be an overgrowth of weeds and grass throughout various areas of the outdoor kennel area.
There are also areas close to or against some enclosures that have soiled and unused enclosure material such as
whelping boxes, and a container of animal waste that have not been disposed of. There was an excessive
accumulation of flying insects noted throughout the facility during this inspection with several animals being directly
affected in a negative way because of these insects. Failure to control weeds and keep the area free of
unnecessary clutter has increased pest problems and is hindering cleaning practices. Control weeds and keep
areas around enclosures and animals free of unnecessary overgrowth or materials to facilitate cleaning of the
premises and to assist in pest control.
3.11(d) DIRECT REPEATCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control
There was a large presence of flies and other flying insects throughout the sheltered and outdoor areas of the
facility. Several dogs are being directly impacted by the flies and had numerous flies on their head and ears.
Although the licensee has a protocol from the attending veterinarian on how to deal with the dogs themselves
regarding repelling flies, there is no pest control plan in place for controlling fly populations throughout the premises.
Several factors are contributing to an overabundance of flies including a buildup of excreta in two of the enclosures,
a waste bucket with excreta in close proximity to occupied enclosures and overgrown vegetation throughout the
housing areas. Flies may contaminate the food or spread disease by landing on excreta followed by landing on the
food. Failure to provide and practice a pest control plan that addresses flies and parasites is directly impacting the
animals and may spread disease or contaminate the food. Develop and maintain a pest control plan for the flies to
ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.
This was a focused inspection to address noncompliances documented on the previous inspection dated 23 June
2014.
Dog #'s 029323117, 029319868, 0A01564058, 0A01394871, 0A01533038 and 7F7A242A15 documented under
2.40(b)(2) on the previous inspection dated 23 June 2014 have been addressed.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
