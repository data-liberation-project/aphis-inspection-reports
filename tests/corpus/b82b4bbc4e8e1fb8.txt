2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
***This was a second search inspection, as the owner of the establishment has animals on exhibit to the public. On
8/29/14, the APHIS VMO from a public area, observed 1 long-horn steer on exhibit at the establishment. Neither the
owner or the manager were available at the time. APHIS VMO contacted the manager via telephone on 9/2/14.
An initial search inspection was conducted on 7/8/14 with the establishment's owner, manager and APHIS VMO. At
that time, it was determined and informed to the owner, that a valid USDA license was required for public exhibition
of animals. The owner has since submitted an application, which was returned due to incompleteness, but does not
currently have a valid USDA license.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale, except persons
who are exempted from the licensing requirements under section 2.1 (a)(3), must have a valid license.
Acquire an exhibitors license if you wish to continue to exhibit animals to the public.
Exit briefing conducted via telephone with manager.
Conducting regulated activities without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
