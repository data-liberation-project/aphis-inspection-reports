Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC did not review the research facility’s program for humane care and use of animals at least once every six
months as required. The IACUC reviewed the Program on 4/19/22 but the next Program review was performed by the
IACUC 9 months later on 1/18/23.

Per this Section, the IACUC acts as an agent of the research facility to assess the animal program, facilities, and
procedures. With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC shall review the research facility’s program for
humane care and use of animals at least once every six months. The semi-annual review of the Program is important to
determine the status of the animal use program at the institution. Correct from this date 2/8/23 forward for all future semi-
annual reviews of the Program.
2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official (IO) were reviewed; the most recent update to the semi-annual report
submitted to the IO was dated 5/4/22. Although the IACUC has completed the next semi-annual reviews of the Program
and animal facilities, the Committee has not updated their semi-annual report to the IO. As of the date of this inspection, it


has been nine months since the IACUC updated the semi-annual report to the IO.

Per this Section, one of the functions of the IACUC is to prepare reports of the Committee’s semi-annual evaluations of
the program for animal use and its inspection of the facilities; the semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official shall be
updated at least once every six months upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations. This process ensures
that the Institutional Official is kept informed of the status of both the animal use program and the research facilities. The
IACUC needs to prepare the semi-annual report for the Committee’s last evaluations of the program and facilities and
submit the report to the IO. Correct by 3/14/23.
2.38(l)(3)

Miscellaneous.
Although the research facility has developed and there is a Contingency Plan in place to provide for the humane handling,
treatment, and care of the research animals in the event of an emergency or disaster, training of all personnel regarding
their roles and responsibilities as outlined in the Plan has not taken place.

Per this Section, a research facility must provide training for their personnel regarding their roles and responsibilities as
outlined in the Contingency Plan. Training of personnel on the provisions of the facility’s Contingency Plan ensures all
employees are familiar with the Plan and the animals receive proper care during emergency situations. Correct by
3/14/23.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representative.
