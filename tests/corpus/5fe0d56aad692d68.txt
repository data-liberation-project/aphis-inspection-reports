HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ceiling in the indoor enclosure for the lemurs is constructed of drywall. This material cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized. In addition, there is deterioration/staining present along the drywall seam in the center of the ceiling.
Appropriate surfaces in an animal housing facility promote good husbandry and disease control efforts. The
licensee plans to install suitable panels on the ceiling.
