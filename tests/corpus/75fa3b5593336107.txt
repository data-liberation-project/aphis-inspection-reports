2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, the licensee did not have complete records of acquisition for the current inventory of animals on
the property. For example, three Asian Otters did not have a record of acquisition available for review. Acquisition and
disposition records are required so that animals being used in regulated activities can be accurately tracked to ensure
their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation. Licensees shall maintain accurate and up-to-date
acquisition and disposition records for any animal acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under
his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of by the licensee.
3.75(e)

Housing facilities, general.
Within the feed storage room, there was one open bag of monkey biscuits that was not stored in a leak proof container
with a tightly fitting lid. Open food bags that are left outside of a container are susceptible to contamination by pests and
deterioration to the elements (i.e. humidity, heat, moisture). Open food bags must be kept in leakproof containers with
tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.
3.84(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


An igloo shelter within an enclosure housing one male rhesus macaque contained an excessive amount of feces build up.
Excess build-up of feces may attract pests and poses a disease hazard for the animal contained therein. Primary
enclosures must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta,
or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
An enclosure housing two raccoons had a 4x4 wooden beam that had deteriorated to approximately 50% of its mass at
the bottom portion. The raccoons were also digging a hole around the affected portion of the beam. The jagged edges of
the wood pose an injury hazard to the animals contained therein; furthermore, the dirt hole poses a possible access point
into the adjoining enclosure allowing for unauthorized access between the animals contained and the neighboring
animals.
Additionally, a male camel was being housed in an area that contained fence equipment, an assortment of motorized
vehicles and other construction equipment. Access to these areas and items pose a risk of injury to the camel contained
therein. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
