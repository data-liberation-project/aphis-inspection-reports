Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
At approximately 9:20am on June 15th, 2022, a mouse was observed at the front of its enclosure with an abnormal right
eye and facial skin irritation. The eye was protruding and the surface of the eye had a cloudy appearance. The skin
around the eyes and muzzle appeared thickened with areas of redness, crusting, and patchy hair loss. The animal was
observed to stay in one place within the enclosure and scratched at its face frequently during inspection. Morning health
checks had been completed at 7:20am, but this animal was not noted in the room records and the cage was not flagged
for veterinary review. Based on clinical presentation, this condition is not expected to have occurred since the health
check two hours prior to inspection; the daily observation conducted did not identify this problem of animal health. In
conducting daily observations, all animals must be assessed for problems of animal health and well-being that require
veterinary care.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institutional Official, the Attending Veterinarian, and additional
facility representatives.
