Space requirements.
The facility had large pigs housed in four primary enclosure pens. One of these pens contained eight pigs in a pen
providing 99 square feet of floor space. This enclosure is too small for the eight animals it contains. These pigs are not
able to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Provide more space for these
animals.
