2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:45 P.M. on
18-JAN-17.
The inspector knocked on the door and had no answer. He then called the number on file which does not have a
voicemail set-up, so no message was left. The inspector waited 30 minutes in front of the facility before leaving.
