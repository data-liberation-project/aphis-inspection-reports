FEEDING.
A large container of prepared food is stored on the bottom shelf of a large refrigerator. The upper shelves hold
various laboratory chemicals, including specimens in formalin-filled jars.
Food must not be stored below chemicals which may potentially spill and contaminate the food. The large
refrigerator is next to a small refrigerator which is labeled for bat food. The labeled refrigerator contains smaller
prepared food containers. Since there is a refrigerator designated for bat food storage, the bat food should be
stored there and not with potentially hazardous chemicals.
