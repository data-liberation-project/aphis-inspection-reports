2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There were no sale records maintained since the previous inspection report. Sale records listing the name and address of
the buyer, the date of sale, the number and species of animals are required for regulatory purposes. Failure to keep and
maintain sale records makes it difficult to track changes in the number of guinea pigs, document changes in ownership,
and to adequately assess the animal care program. License must keep and maintain copies of sale records with the
required information. Correct by November 5, 2021.
3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The right 2nd rack, 4th enclosure down has rusty, broken, and protruding wire on the front side by the automatic
waterer/drainpipe. Enclosure is housing 9 adult guinea pigs and and 1 offspring.

The right 2nd rack, 5th enclosure down has rusty, protruding wire, and large gaps between wire and automatic
waterer/drainpipe on the front side. Enclosure is housing 11 adult guinea pigs and 6 offspring.

Enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to prevent injury to guinea pigs, contain the animals
securely, and constructed of materials which are substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. Rusty wire can not be

adequately cleaned and sanitized. Broken, protruding, and large gaps or holes in wire can result in injury to guinea pigs
and allow animals to escape enclosures. Licensee must ensure that enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in
good repair. Correct by November 15, 2021.
