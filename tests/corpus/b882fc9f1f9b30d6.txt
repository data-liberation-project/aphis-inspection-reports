3.6(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
There are two enclosures in holding room # 4, in need of repair. One enclosure housing 2 Boston terriers and an adjacent
enclosure housing 1 Boston terrier have chewed plastic on the wall partition and a gap with chewed edges on the lower
part of this partition. The gap is approximately 6 inches in height by 15 inches long. The gap could allow dogs to fight and
become injured between the two enclosures. Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair to prevent injury and
to contain the dogs securely. The wall partition must be repaired or replaced so that dogs do not ingest chewed plastic
pieces or become injured from the gap between the enclosures. Correct by June 30, 2021.

This inspection was conducted with the licensee and the exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
