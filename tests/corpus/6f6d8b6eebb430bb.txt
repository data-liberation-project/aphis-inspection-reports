ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a female, approximately one year old, brindle and white English Bulldog ("Miss Charlie" - No ID) with
cloudy eyes. There is a pale yellow to green discharge and crusting on the left eyelid. The white of both eyes is
severely reddened. This same animal was documented on the December 4, 2013 inspection report. The animal was
evaluated by a veterinarian and prescribed treatment. The facility representative states this animal has not improved
with treatment and has not been re-evaluated by a veterinarian. The representative states the dog requires daily,
life-long treatment. Treatment is documented for this dog within the month of December 2013, but there is no other
documentation showing the dog has received the prescribed treatment since December.
Eye abnormalities can be a sign of a serious medical condition and can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort.
The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
This dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian by 5:00 pm on April 9th, 2014
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There is one brindle and white, approximately one year old, female English Bulldog ("Miss Charlie") with No ID
available to the inspector. The facility representative states that all animals have been ID'd but could not produce ID
information for this animal. Individual identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be
known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements. All live dogs on the premises must be officially
identified with a tag, tattoo or microchip and this identification information must be made available to the inspector.3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure; construction.
Within the "big dog kennel", the ceiling is not in good repair. The ceiling has two layers and the top layer is falling
apart. In some of the areas it is complete gone, but in other areas it has become detached from the wooden ceiling
and is partially hanging down from the ceiling. There are nine dogs in this portion of the facility. This ceiling is not in
good repair and if parts of the ceiling fell down into the animal enclosure it could cause illness or injury to the
animals. Housing facilities must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair and they must protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by: June 7, 2014

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces
Within the "Little Dog House" there are at least two enclosures with feeders that are severely chewed and/or worn
with dust, dirt, and/or hair stuck in the chewed and worn areas. There are two dogs in these enclosures.
Within the "Whelping building" there is one feeder that is severely chewed and/or worn with dust, dirt and/or hair
stuck to the chewed and worn areas. There is one dog in this enclosure.
The wind and rain flaps on all but one of the shelters within the "Big Dog House" are severely chewed, worn, frayed
and/or dirty. Within this same building, there are three pens with chewed and/or worn wood on the inside walls of
the enclosure. There is dust, dirt, and/or hair stuck to most of the chewed and/or worn areas. There are nine dogs in
these enclosures.
Within the outdoor run, containing one dog, there is chewed and/or worn wood on the threshold of the shelter. There
is dust, dirt, and/or hair stuck to the chewed and/or worn area.

Severely chewed and/or worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards
for the dogs. All chewed, worn and/or soiled surfaces and objects within the facility must be repaired or replaced.3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Within seven of the outdoor runs of the "little dog house" there is a build-up of feces and/or urine scattered
throughout the run. Within all of the indoor runs, there is some degree of a build-up of feces, dirt, dust, hair and/or
grime on the floors and/or walls within the enclosures. The amount of feces, dirt, and/or grime build-up varies from
very little in a few enclosures, to a thin layer covering nearly the entire floor and walls of one enclosure. There are at
least two enclosures with a build-up of hair, dust, and/or dirt on the chain-link fences that make up the enclosure
walls. There are twelve dogs in the affected enclosures.
Within six of the indoor runs in the "big dog house", there is a build-up of bird feces, dust, dirt, and/or grime on the
walls within the enclosures. There are two pens that have a build-up of feces on the floor within the sheltered
portion of these enclosures. The feces is compacted, mixed with old straw and spread throughout the floor and
within the corners of these enclosures. There are nine dogs in the affected enclosures.
Failure to properly clean and sanitize primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. Hard surfaces
with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks in
order to prevent an accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control.
Within six of the indoor runs in the "big dog kennel" there is an excessive accumulation of bird feces within the
enclosures. A bird nest is sitting just above one enclosure. The facility representative states they have a continuous
problem with birds within the facility. There are nine dogs in this portion of the facility.
Within the "green and tan kennel" there are an excessive number of mouse droppings on the floor of the facility. The
majority of the mouse droppings surround an unused heater on the West end of the building. There are also
droppings on the window sill above one enclosure and within an unused food bowl sitting just outside of one
enclosure. There are nine dogs in this portion of the facility. Pests can lead to disease hazards for the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of pests, including
birds and rodents, shall be established and maintained at the facility so as to promote the health and well-being of
the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
