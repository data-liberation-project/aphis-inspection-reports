ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1. During this inspection it was noted that the alpacas were in need of attention. Three of the 4 alpacas had
excessively long toe nails. The all brown alpaca had all 4 toes that were long and curling inward. The other brown
alpaca had a front, left foot with nails curling inward. The brown/ grey alpaca also had all 4 feet that had nails curled
inward. To ensure that this does not affect the gait of these animals, these toe nails will need to be addressed.

health and comfort, these animals will need to be sheared.
