3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
In the outdoor portion of a sheltered building, there was an enclosure housing two adult Dachshunds with flooring in
disrepair. There was a wooden floorboard that had become separated and positioned underneath its support structure
instead of on top of it. This dislocated board had a space between it and the adjacent boards which created gaps that
were at least a foot long and a few inches tall on each side of it. The partially unsecured floorboard extended into an
adjacent enclosure, housing three adult dogs, where the board was observed to be more mobile than the rest of the
flooring when the dogs walked on it. The floorboard had decreased security and the gaps were large enough for the dogs'
feet and/or legs to pass through, which could increase the risk of injury. The licensee must ensure, at all times, that all
animal housing facilities are kept in good repair, and that they protect the animals from injury, contain the animals
securely, and restrict other animals from entering. To be corrected by: November 5, 2022.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There were numerous flies and gnat-like insects observed within the indoor portion of the sheltered facility. Most of the
flies and gnat-like insects were observed around a drain located in the middle of the whelping room, near enclosures
housing weaned puppies, and around a sink/counter area. The licensee was currently using fly bait products, however,


these products were not effective for the control of the insects at the entire facility. Insects can carry diseases and pose
potential health hazards to the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective protocol for the
control of insects and other pests to reduce disease hazards. To be corrected by: November 10, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
