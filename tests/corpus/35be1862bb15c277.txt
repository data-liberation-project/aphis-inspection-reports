Handling of animals.
The two stand-alone rabbit enclosures outside of the barn do not have a barrier fence to prevent the public from having
direct contact with the rabbits During exhibition, a barrier fence helps to protect the animals from harm and the public
from injury. A barrier fence must be constructed of sufficient distance from the primary enclosures and in a manner that
will assure the safety of the rabbits and the general viewing public. Correct by May 10, 2021.
