HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The food is not stored in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation. The food
bins located in the food storage closet did not have the lids secured. There were sacks of unopened dog food
located directly on the floor in a storage room that contained numerous boxes.
Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. The bags must be stored off the floor and away from the walls and the food bins must have lids secured
to prevent contamination and deterioration of the food's nutritive value to maximize healthy nutritive absorption for
the dogs and/or puppies. The doors to the feed room and closet should always be secured when not in use to keep
unwanted insects, rodents, and raccoons from entry and subsequent contamination of the food.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
