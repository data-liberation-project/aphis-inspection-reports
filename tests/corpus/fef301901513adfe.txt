No animals were present at the time of inspection.
No non-compliant items were identified during this inspection.

The inspection and the exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
Note: There are cracks in the floor of the wet lab/teaching area that need to be repaired before animals are used in
the area. Surfaces need to be non-porous and able to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Also, improved pest control
measures need to be implemented before the facility is used for animals - there have been wild birds accessing the
main animal area, and there are dead flies on the floor of the surgery room.
