3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lower portion in one section of the fence for the goat/pig enclosure is still not secured and is pliable & pushed
inwards. This poses a risk of entrapment to these animals if they should get their feet or heads/snouts entrapped.
This portion of the fence shall be secured along the bottom to prevent movement and entrapment.
The entry door for the skunk "Baby Boo" is pushed out at the bottom corner and a gap of approximately four inches
exists. This door needs to be addressed so that it closes securely and doesn't allow other animals to enter or the
skunk to escape.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The bear's swimming tank is excessively dirty and needs to be cleaned out and fresh water provided.
