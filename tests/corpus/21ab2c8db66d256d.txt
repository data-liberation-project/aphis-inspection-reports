PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
1. The ring tailed lemurs are currently being housed in the house for the winter. The small wire mesh on the ceiling
has detached in the front, left corner. The last time they were inspected, while being housed in this enclosure
(4/9/14) this mesh was detaching from the back, left corner. Due to the fact that they can gain access to the rafters,
and the top of the enclosure, this mesh will need to be repaired or replaced with a more permanent material.
2. Due to the fact that the small wire mesh on the ceiling of the ring tail lemur enclosure is detached, a yellow
electrical cord is hanging freely into the enclosure. There is also a yellow electrical cord and a light switch box that
are exposed to the lemurs. These will need to be addressed to ensure that the animals are not injured.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The top of the fox enclosure has recently been removed due to an accumulation of snow. Due to the fact that foxcan climb this enclosure should have a top so that the animal will be securely contained.
*** To Be Corrected By: January 26, 2015
2. The camel enclosure is in need of repair. The 5th post, on the right side, has chain link fence attached to ¾ of the
post. However, the top ¼ has detached from the post and is now loose. This will need to be repaired to ensure the
integrity of the fence.
*** To Be Corrected By: January 26, 2015
3. The icy substrate around the base of the camel tub will need to be addressed. This accumulation of ice poses a
danger to the animals. All enclosures need to be maintained to ensure the safety of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a small room at the end of the barn that is being used to store perishables and frozen meat products. This
room is constructed of wood walls. However, there are a few gaps where the floor and walls do not meet. To ensure
that this room remains free from pests, these areas will need to be sealed

SANITATION.
On the previous inspection (9/9/14) it was noted that there was evidence of mammalian pests present in the
macaque and baboon enclosures. At the time of this inspection rats were seen exiting the holes from under the
cement slab of the brown bear enclosure. An effective pest control plan will need to be established.
