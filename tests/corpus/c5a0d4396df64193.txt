2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The program of veterinary care states monthly preventative for ectoparasites will be used on wild and exotic animals
including felids and canids. A discussion with the licensee revealed that he is not administering any monthly prevention.
He stated he has ivermectin on hand but when asked how to use it, he did know how to properly administer the
medication. After a discussion with the attending veterinarian, the expectation is that the licensee will apply Frontline
monthly. Each exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

2.132(d)

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
Upon record review, an acquisition form and health certificate were present for the purchase of a single male coyote. After
a discussion with the licensee, it was determined that the seller did not possess a USDA license to sell wild and exotic
animals. No exhibitor shall knowingly obtain any dog, cat, or other animal from any person who is required to be licensed
but does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.
