2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male, black and white Shih Tzu (ID number 10) has severely cloudy eyes. Closer examination revealed a
brownish crusty material around the right eye and a yellowish mucus covering nearly the entire surface of the right
eye. The surface of the left eye also has a mildly brown discoloration with blood vessels present on the surface of
the eye. The white of both eyes is mildly reddened.
This dog also has a severe build-up of a thick, yellow/tan material encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth
and about half of the surface of the canines and front teeth. The majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot
be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the yellow/tan material. All of the gums are severely red and swollen
and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth. The hair surrounding the mouth is mildly wet due to the dogs
excessive drooling.
This dog had been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian on August 27, 2015 for poor eye health. The veterinarian
had prescribed Vetropolycin and the licensee stated that they had been putting it in the dog's eyes once a day but
were no longer using it. The tube of Vetropolycin that was shown to the inspectors was half full.
One female, grey and white shih tzu (ID number 30) has a severe build-up of a thick, grey/tan material encasing all
of the upper and lower cheek teeth and nearly half of the surface of the canines and front teeth. The majority of the
surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the grey/tan material. All of the
gums are severely red and swollen and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth. In many areas of the
mouth, there is a creamy discharge present along the gum-line. The hair surrounding the mouth is severely wet due
to the dogs excessive drooling.
Dental and eye conditions such as these can be painful and/or distressful to the animal and may lead to further
health complications. Both animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,
including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times. Exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Heather Cole, VMO and the facility representative
