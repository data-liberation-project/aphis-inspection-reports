***An adult female brown and white Shih Tzu with microchip number 074783527 has a buildup of a hard greyish
brown material that is adhered to most of the surfaces of the teeth. The top left molar next to the cheek teeth has a
very thick buildup of this material, approximately the size of a pea.
Dental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, can lead to the development of other health problems, and
can affect the well-being of the animal.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and provide the
inspector the documentation of this visit upon request by January 28, 2015.

*** An adult female fawn Pekingese with microchip number 069074294 has toenails that are too long.
Toenails that are too long can affect the dog's gait, be uncomfortable or painful, and could cause its feet to be
caught in the flooring and could injure the animal.
The licensee must ensure that as part of a program of veterinary care, dogs are groomed and toenails are trimmed.
All animals must be given proper veterinary care at all times.
*** The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) needs a few more details. For ectoparasites, the product needs to be
listed. For intestinal parasites, the dosage for both pups and adults needs to be included.

preventative care is being administered accurately and with the knowledge and direction of the attending
veterinarian.
The applicant must consult with the attending veterinarian to complete the program of veterinary care accurately
and completely and to reflect the veterinary care needed for all the animals in the facility.*The adult male cream and grey Lhasa Apso with microchip number 101595513 cited on the previous report dated
