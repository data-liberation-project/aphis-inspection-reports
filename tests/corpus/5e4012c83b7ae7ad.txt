3.75(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- An enclosure in the walk through area containing two red ruffed lemurs has a metal shelter with several rusted
holes in the wall. This is an inadequate shelter, and is a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals. This
shelter must be repaired or replaced.
- In the drive through area of the park an enclosure housing two black and white lemurs has a metal panel on the
side of the cage with several rusted holes. These panels are on the outside of the cage wall, but within reach of the
lemurs. The panel must be repaired or replaced.
Surfaces in contact with the primates must be free of excessive rust and sharp edges. The facility must maintain
metal surfaces in good condition.

3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an accumulation of waste and food on the ground in a corner of an enclosure housing two black and
white lemurs. There were numerous winged insects on and around this accumulation of waste. Accumulated waste
is an attractant for pests and insects, and is a potential source of contamination to the enclosed animals.
This area must be cleaned by the facility, and cleaned as often as needed in the future.
3.78(b) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In an enclosure in the drive through area housing a single vervet, the shelter box was located on the ground. The
shelter itself contained a pool of water which appeared to cover the entire floor of the shelter. A shelter filled with
water does not provide protection from the elements and may cause distress to the animal. The facility must ensure
that adequate shelters are provided for all animals.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were structures that were not being maintained.
- In the goat pen area of the petting zoo, there was a loose wire panel and a loose wooden timber on the ground.
This is a potential source of entrapment for the animals. The lower metal edge of one shelter was peeled back,
exposing a sharp edge.
- The barn in the first hippo pasture has a broken panel on the front, and flashing on the back that has peeled away
from the structure. Sharp edges are a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals.
- A gate for the second hippo pen has lost numerous sections of wire, leaving multiple exposed points.
All structures must be maintained in good repair to help protect the enclosed animals.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacles in two big cat enclosures contained discolored water. Water in both receptacles had a green
tint and one receptacle had a floating green mass present. Green water indicates that the receptacles are not
cleaned or sanitized often enough. Fresh potable water must be accessible to the animals as often as needed for
the health and comfort of the animal. Licensee shall implement a proactive regimen to clean and sanitize the water
receptacles as often as necessary so as to provide potable water.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
