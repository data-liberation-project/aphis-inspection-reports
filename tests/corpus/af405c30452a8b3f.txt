Housing facilities, general.
One of the wooden disc-shaped swings in the outdoor gibbon enclosure was noted to be in disrepair. The bottom edge
near the hanging rope attachment of the wooden disc had deteriorated and an approximate 6” portion of the wood was
gone.

Per this Section of the Regulations, furniture-type fixtures or objects in animal housing that are made of materials that
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, including perches, shelves, and swings, must be removed or replaced when
worn. The damaged area of the wooden swing also has the potential to cause an injury to the animals.

Facilities, general.
There were multiple areas of peeling and/or flaking paint noted on the walls above the saltwater pool in the indoor housing
area for the harbor seal.

Per this Section of the Regulations, indoor housing facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and


maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Peeling paint in animal housing can impact the health of the
animal should the paint be ingested as well as interfere with effective sanitation of surfaces.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The following structural issues were noted during the inspection of the animal facilities.

*Adaptation Building: The ceiling in the left back corner of the river otter indoor enclosure had sustained water damage
from a prior roof leak. The paint on that area of the ceiling was peeling and the exposed underlying surface of the ceiling
had a dark brown to black colored stain.
*Alley Holding: There was a crack in the painted concrete floor of the juvenile 9 banded armadillo enclosure. The paint
was lifting up and/or peeling from the surface of the concrete floor along the crack.
*Wallaby Shed: The four ceiling-mounted light fixtures in the ceiling of the indoor wallaby enclosure did not have
protective covers and the fluorescent light bulbs of each fixture were exposed.

Per this Section of the Regulations, indoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair.
Peeling paint in animal housing can impact the health of the animal should the paint be ingested as well as interfere with
effective sanitation and uncovered light bulbs can become damaged resulting in possible injury from the broken glass.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Adaptation Building: There was an excessive number of cobwebs noted in the spaces below the ceiling of the river otter

Per this Section of the Regulations, animal housing areas shall be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry
practices and to maintain the housekeeping of the housing areas. Cobwebs in animal areas collect hair and/or other
debris and impact the cleanliness of the enclosures.
