HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During inspection it was brought to my attention that a male Brown-headed spider monkey named JR was injured
on May 21, 2016. The monkey appeared to have gotten his hand stuck on the shift door. Three of the fingers had
to be surgically removed due to the injury. An enclosure that is not structurally sound for the species of monkey
contained within the enclosure allows for the possibility of injuries to occur to the animals within that enclosure. The
enclosure must be fixed so that hazards that could cause injury to the monkeys within the enclosure are eliminated.
Correct by 10/21/16.
Note: The enclosure was under construction at the time of inspection. The licensee has made adjustments to the
enclosure containing the Brown-headed spider monkeys to eliminate possible hazards that could potentially cause
injury to the animals within that enclosure in the future.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
