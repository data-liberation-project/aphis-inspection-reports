Handling of animals.
During this inspection we observed two Sloth encounters. The newly hired employee conducted an encounter with a
couple and then with a family of four. During the encounters we noticed that the public was allowed to interact with the
sloth while the employee was approximately 5' away and had no means of ensuring minimal risk of harm to the sloth and
the public while conducted the public interaction. Lack of sufficient control poses a risk of harm to the animals and the
public during public interactions.

Watering.
At the time of this inspection, it was noted that the rabbits did not have food or water in their enclosure. In speaking with
the staff, we were informed that they get fed at night, but water is always provided to them in the large black tubs. We

asked them to fill the large black tub. The grey rabbit did not show any interest in the water. However, the black rabbit
immediately went to the tub and drank for 1.5 minutes. Water needs to be provided to these animals on a daily basis to
ensure their health and well-being.

Sanitation.
The otter enclosure, and the area around their den box, had an accumulation of feces, shells, small fish and debris
present, and there was an unpleasant strong odor noted when standing next to the enclosure and den box. It was
apparent that the enclosure had not been cleaned yet today. All enclosures need to be cleaned to minimize disease
hazards and to reduce odors.

Sanitation.
At the time of this inspection there were 2 bags of vermiculite and a flat, metal scale within the sloth enclosure. These
items were to the left of the bench and the door on the left side of the enclosure. This sloth had direct access to these
items if he chose to come down from his perches. The enclosures shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from
injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. The animal enclosures are only for the animals, all supplies
and occasionally used equipment need to be stored elsewhere.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
During this inspection it was noted that there was a large population of fruit flies present. They were seen in animal
enclosures, and especially in the food prep / kitchen area. Fly strips were in place but they were very full. However, there

was still an excessive number of flies present on the walls, counters, knife and cutting board, and on food containers. A
safe and effective pest control program shall be established and maintained.
