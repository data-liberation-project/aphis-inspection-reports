2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- According to veterinary records dated 27 May 2015, a porcupine was found dead in its enclosure by facility
personnel. The record states that the animal was in a fight and killed the other porcupine in the enclosure 5 days
prior. When questioned about this animal, facility employees stated that no one knew the animal was ill.
The veterinary necropsy report states that the animal was off food the day before and found dead the next morning.
On the necropsy report the veterinarian "opened the abdominal cavity and found a large amount of free fluid with
dark blood and a rancid odor. A large section of the small intestine was a dark purple color, there was a perforated
section, looked like a sharp quill or splinter penetrated the gut." The death of this animal was a management failure.
There was a failure to provide a safe environment for the porcupine that was killed. However, the most serious
failure was that no facility employees noted the condition of the surviving animal. The facility(cid:25)'s failure to notice the
condition put this animal in a position where he could not survive the physical demands from the injuries sustained
from the fight with its enclosure mate 5 days prior. Animals must be observed on a daily basis by individuals with
sufficient training and knowledge to properly assess the health and condition of the animal. There must also be a
mechanism of direct communication with the attending veterinarian to report any problems noted by facility
personnel. The facility must take steps to ensure all animals are observed daily and assessed properly.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
- There was no hay present in the Jacob's sheep enclosure. The facility representative stated that the hay had
been removed approximately two days earlier. He stated that "some" alfalfa hay had been given to the animals but
there was none present at the time of the inspection. In the past, the facility was directed to ensure that all grazing
animals had access to clean hay at all times. The Jacob's sheep have heavy wool coats, making it difficult to
assess body condition without actually capturing the animals. In order to help ensure they are getting enough feed,
these animals must be provided access to free choice hay at all times. The facility must consult their attending
veterinarian to ensure that the correct type of hay is being given to the animals. There is a written feeding plan
provided by the facility's attending veterinarian. If the facility chooses to deviate from this written plan, it must be
approved in writing by the attending veterinarian.Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative and two APHIS VMOs.
