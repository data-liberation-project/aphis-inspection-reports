3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces in dog enclosures must be free of excessive rust. Excessive rust prevents good cleaning, sanitization, and
affects structural strength. Both the new and old kennels have areas of the flooring that has excessive rust; these
areas cannot be cleaned and sanitized effectively. Some of the steel flooring in the old kennel has areas where the
rust is so excessive that the flooring is missing, making the structural strength in these areas inadequate and could
be a safety hazard for dogs. The owner must repair or replace these areas. The owner needs to more closely
monitor the areas where rust could be a problem. This can help the safety and good health for the dogs. Correct
by 07-26-2015.
3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces of enclosures that house dogs must be free of sharp points that could injure dogs. A partition wire in the
new kennel has sharp points where the wire is broken, also an area of the steel flooring in the old kennel has sharp
points where flooring is rusted away, and a wire door on an enclosure in the old kennel has broken wires with sharp
points. The owner must repair or replace these areas of sharp point, which can be a safety hazard for dogs. The
owner needs to put into place a maintenance program that closely monitors all enclosures that contain dogs and
repair areas with sharps before they happen.. This will help the good health and safety of dogs. The owner must
correct these areas of sharp points by 07-03-15.3.6(a)(2)(12) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An outside section of the rusted steel flooring in the old kennel has flooring that is less than 1/8 (9guage). This area
of the steel flooring is rusted down to small strands of flooring. The owner must repair or replace that area of the
flooring to help ensure dogs can move around comfortable and be injury free.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures must be done daily and more often when needed. At least three of the enclosures
have feces that dogs have to walk around or through. Removing excessive accumulations of feces helps reduce
disease hazards and help dogs to be in a healthier environment. The owner must go through all enclosures more
often to help ensure that enclosures are clean and that dogs are in a healthier and disease free environment. The
owner must correct this by 06-27-15.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
