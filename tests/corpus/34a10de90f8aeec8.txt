FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
The enclosure housing three mountain lions - Turbo, Tilly, and Shawnee - has a wood spool that is falling apart and
is no longer structurally sound.
The enclosure housing two bison and one steer has a section of fence paneling that is used as an auxillary feeding
corral within the enclosure that is bent and is not being kept in good repair.
The wood spool and the fence paneling need to be repaired or replaced to promote the structural strength and to
maintain the facility in good repair.
