PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is a Flemish giant rabbit housed in an 14.5 inch high enclosure which does not allow the animal to hold her
head up in a normal manner. Rabbit enclosures must be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient
space for the animal to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. The Flemish giant
rabbit must be provided with a larger enclosure that provides the animal with adequate head height so she can
make normal postural adjustments without touching the top of the enclosure.
