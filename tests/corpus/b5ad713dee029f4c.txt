2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Beagle (m/c# 9000085000931569) with 1 puppy was observed to have a dull, coarse hair coat and on closer
observation, she was somewhat thin, with an abdominal tuck. Her mucous membranes were slightly pale. These signs
can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. This dog must be evaluated by a
veterinarian within 3 days of this inspection, to know with certainty the problem and the correct treatment. Documentation
of the evaluation, recommended treatment and delivered treatments must be available to APHIS officials.

Housing facilities, general.
In the outdoor enclosures, the shelters are large wooden shelters that have a shared wall for 2 enclosures. Twelve of
the shelters had excessively chewed walls around the door and the shared walls of the shelters. Dogs from 1 enclosure
were able to easily get into the next enclosure. Failure to maintain enclosures can allow for gaps, unstable structures, or
loose panels which can result in injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals. Facilities shall be maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury and contain them.


Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in
good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from
entering.
