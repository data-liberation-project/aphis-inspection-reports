FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of bedding was sitting on the top of a plastic receptacle in the back storage room. Sitting inside a
plastic tub in the back storage room is an open bag of kitten food that is being fed to the ferrets. There is potential
for vermin to get into the open bag of food and bedding allowing them to become contaminated. The contaminated
bedding and food could potentially cause disease or illness to the animals.
Ensure that all food and bedding are stored adequately to protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin.
