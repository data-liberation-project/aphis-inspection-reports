ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) updated 9 October 2015 did not include a complete description of the
dosages and methods of administration for all medications being used. The facility owner indicated that he used
Pyrantel, Fenbendazole, and Ivermectin routinely but only Pyrantel was mentioned by name in the PVC and it did
not have specific dosage information. Correct by establishing and maintaining programs of adequate veterinary care
that include: The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. These
appropriate methods must include instructions for preparing medications such as Ivermectin, dosages appropriate
for the species, Route of administration, and duration or frequency of administration. Correct By: 30 November 2015
An exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
