2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Wheaton #110 has an excessive amount of saliva pooling on the hair of the lower jaw. Closer inspection of the
mouth revealed poor dental health. The second upper left incisor is broken and is a dark color of brown. The upper
cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are coated in a thick tan colored material. The boarder of the gum tissue of the
teeth is moderately reddened. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to further health
issues.

Female Boston #11 has an emaciated body condition. Inspection of the dog revealed that the backbone, ribs, and hip
bones were visibly prominent and easily felt with little fat and muscle covering them. Emaciated body condition could
indicate a serious underlying health issue.

Female Bulldog #39 has an abnormal condition of the left hind leg. The inspector observed the dog touching the tips of
the toes to the floor while walking and failing to bear any weight on the leg. Failure to bear weight on a leg could indicate
an underlying health concern.

Female Samoyed #11 has an abnormal condition of the right eye and poor dental health. Physical inspection resulted in

a mild pain response from the dog when the area surrounding the eye was gently touched. The tissue surrounding the
right eye is swollen and the white of the eye is reddened. An excessive amount of yellow drainage is located on the hair
from the corner of the right eye and spreading down the face. The upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are
coated in a thick tan colored material. The boarder of the gum tissue of the teeth is moderately reddened. Poor eye and
dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to further health issues.

Female Husky #86 has an abnormal appearance to the right eye. The eye is protruding outwardly and the tissue
surrounding the eye is swollen and the white of the eye is reddened. The eye has an approximately dime sized white,
cloudy material covering the surface. Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.

Dealers must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan.

Female Wheaton #147 has a matted hair coat. The matted hair was located on the chest, front legs, and hind legs. The
matts on the chest were thickened and tight. The legs are covered in layers of matted hair. Matted hair coats could
cause pain and discomfort to the dog.

This dog must be groomed and all matted hair removed from the hair coat.

Compatible grouping.

A four month old samoyed was housed with an adult dog. The inspector observed the adult dog posture aggressively and
growl at the samoyed when the young dog approached the food bowl. The samoyed responded by showing fearful and
timid behaviors. Incompatible dogs housed together could result in aggressive behaviors, limited access to food, and
failure of a dog to thrive.
Dogs housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. The licensee must separate the samoyed and the adult
dog into different enclosures. The licensee must ensure that all dogs housed together are compatible at all times.
To be corrected by: The facility representative removed the samoyed and placed it in an enclosure by itself at the time of
the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
