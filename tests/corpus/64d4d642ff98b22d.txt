A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:05 AM on
23-May-18.Inspector attempted to contact licensee by knocking on the door, calling the phone number on the
registration and leaving a message to call, waited until 11:45 AM in drive to see if the registrant returned or returned
my call, left a business card with a request to call me along with copies of regulations 2.126 - which is the
requirement for inspection and 2.77 - which is the records requirement for carriers and intermediate handlers. This
is the second attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
