*** A male Shitzu # 169 was heavily matted along his neck region and along his belly. Heavily matted fur pulls and
separates from the skin causing potential skin irritation, may not insulate the dogs well and can be painful.
*** A female Havanese identified as “Pansey” was heavily matted along her tail, and along her anal region where
feces was trapped in the fur. Heavily matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing potential skin irritation
and can be painful.
*** A female Bichon identified as “Reese” was also heavily matted along her tail, and along her anal region where
feces was trapped in the fur. She also has matted fur covering her nipple region where puppies are actively trying to
nurse. Heavily matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing potential skin irritation and can be painful.
All dogs should be groomed as an appropriate method to prevent matting.

*** The female Havanese identified as “ Pansey” had bloody discharge coming from the vaginal area. The licensee
felt it was due to whelping a few weeks ago and it was taking her longer to heal. Discharge of this duration should
be assessed by the attending veterinarian to diagnose and treat the dog.
