ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A two year old brindle Mastiff female (ID# 837037092), named (cid:28)Hilda(cid:29) had excessive drainage of greenish
discharge from both eyes. The white portion of the eye, or sclera, is pink to red in color. The condition of the eyes
can be due to infections, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian for veterinary care and appropriate treatment plan.
The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The one Mastiff housed behind the barn has a plastic water receptacle with continuous water flow. The hose was
not attached to the bucket and allowing for water to flow onto the ground around the water receptacle. There was
standing water around this watering bucket.
All facilities must be kept in good repair, so they are structurally sound. This will prevent the water from flowing onto
the ground and creating a living and breeding area for pest that can increase disease potential to the dog.

3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.* There was three metal self-feeders used to feed five adult dogs. These metal feeders had excessive rust and were
pitting along the bottoms. The prevention of required cleaning and sanitization is caused from these rusty, pitting
metal surfaces. Therefore, increasing the disease potential for the dogs.
All metal surfaces must be free of excessive rust and pitting surfaces caused by rust that prevent required cleaning
and sanitization. Proper cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces will decrease the disease potential for the animals.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The back wall of the White Shed had a board along the bottom of the wall. Also, there was a wood support post
used to support the divider fencing. This board and post had paint that has come off exposing bare wood. The
wood board is green in areas indicating algae was growing on the surface.
* A plastic divider inside the White Shed was excessively chewed along the edges.
There are three adult dogs and three puppies housed in these areas of the White Shed.
* There are three plastic watering receptacles or buckets used to water four adult dogs. These plastic watering
receptacles are excessively chewed along the top of the buckets. There was greyish dirt or debris in the chewed
areas.
These surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. This can increase the disease hazards for the animals.
All surfaces must be maintained. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization and decease the disease
hazards for the dogs.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The first enclosure to the left of the door in the White Shed had an accumulation of brown to grey grime on the
walls. This indicates that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. Without daily spot-cleaning the disease hazards
increases for the one adult and three puppies.All enclosures must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often enough to reduce the disease hazards for the dogs.
To be corrected by, 28-June-2016.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The one Mastiff housed behind the barn had standing water around the watering receptacle or bucket. This
standing water can attract pests and increase disease risks to the adult dog.
Operators must provide for regular and more frequent collection or removal of water from the enclosure. This will
minimized pests and reduce the disease risks for the dog.

3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The one Mastiff housed behind the barn had a tin covering the barn wall of the enclosure. One section of tin is
loose. This is exposing a sharp edge at the height of the dog in normal standing position in the enclosure.
* One metal self-feeder is used to feed two adult dogs in the outdoor enclosures. The bottom of this metal feeder is
bent outward exposing a sharp edge. This sharp is at the height of the dogs in normal standing position.
These sharp edges could injure the dogs in the enclosures. All enclosures must be free of sharp points and edges
that could injure the animals.
