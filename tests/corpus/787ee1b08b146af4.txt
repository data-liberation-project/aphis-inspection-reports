Facility procedure for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide does not adhere to standards laid forth in the
current AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition. The guidelines allow for carbon dioxide
euthanasia of laboratory rodents (which include guinea pigs) when the flow of carbon dioxide provides a
displacement rate of 10-30% of chamber volume/min. This is best achieved by the use of flow meter to ensure an
accurate flow rate of carbon dioxide gas is being delivered to the chamber at the recommended displacement rate
(10-30% chamber volume/min).
The method currently employed by the facility lacks a flow meter and method for accurately determining the
chamber displacement rate. The output dial in current use by the facility utilizes regulator pressure readings (psi)
which do not provide accurate flow rates for carbon dioxide into the chamber.
Carbon dioxide exposure using a gradual fill method with chamber displacement rates from 10-30% is less likely to
produce pain and distress prior to onset of unconsciousness than higher or lower rates. Methods of euthanasia
used must be in accordance with AVMA species guidelines and in accordance with 9 CFR part 1, unless a deviation
has been previously justified in writing and approved by the IACUC.
A flow meter must be installed, SOPs updated with required flow meter settings, and retraining of employees who
perform euthanasia shall be documented.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.The program of veterinary care lacks detail regarding facility procedures for contacting the attending veterinarian for
animal related issues and for provision of emergency, weekend and holiday veterinary care.
Timely and direct communication of animal related issues by animal facility staff to the attending veterinarian is
important for the well-being and health of research animals.

Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency,
weekend and holiday care. Contact information for emergency, weekend and holiday veterinary care needs to be
prominently posted in the animal facility and outlined in the written program of veterinary care.
