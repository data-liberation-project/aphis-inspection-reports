2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An 8 year old male poodle #013316114 was observed holding its right front leg up and not wanting to bear weight with it,
the owner was asked about the dog and stated that the dog had been observed with this problem prior to the inspection
and that the attending veterinarian had not been notified of the problem nor had any action been taken to treat the issue.
Upon closer inspection of the dog it was observed that the third digit of the dog’s right foot was swollen, red and missing
hair.
The foot condition could indicate an injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition. It appears to be causing the
animal pain and discomfort.
The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian. This veterinary examination is in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document this information and provide it to the inspector upon request. To be corrected by: November 13, 2020

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
