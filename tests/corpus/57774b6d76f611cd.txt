2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
Two Yorkshire Terriers did not have an ID on them. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog does not
allow the inspectors to identify the dog and could interfere with the ability to connect medical records and other
documentation to the individual dogs. The applicant must ensure all dogs have an ID.
3.10(a)

Watering
One of the outdoor enclosures with 3 dogs had a their only water bucket with a layer of ice on the top. When water was
presented, the dogs took a quick lick. Lack of water could cause the dogs to become dehydrated or other health issues.
Having water available at all times is important to the health of the dogs. The applicant must ensure all dogs have access
to potable water at all times.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Although the applicant had the attending veterinarian recently do a hands on exam and rabies vaccination, these were not
recorded in the program of veterinary care. Also missing from the program of vet care was the preventative care section.
Failure to have these plans could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals. The Program of
Veterinary Care must include a frequency of hands on exam, rabies vaccination and appropriate plan of preventative care

and treatment to maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe nails, and healthy teeth, ears, eyes and
skin. The applicant must add the missing plans to the Program of Veterinary Care in order to ensure the animals are
receiving adequate veterinary care.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by March 6, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
