2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There was no acquisition records for 4 fox pups that were born on April 22nd, 2022. In addition there was no disposition
records for one fox pup that was sold in June of 2022. Not documenting the required acquisition and disposition
information for all regulated animals doesn't allow for the proper tracking of the animals by APHIS officials. All acquisition
and disposition information must be documented for all regulated animals going forward. Correct from this day froward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
