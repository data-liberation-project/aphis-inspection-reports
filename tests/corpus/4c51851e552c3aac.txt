2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany an APHIS Official during the inspection process at 3:25 PM on
11/05/2014.
A person at the facility said that the registrant is no longer in the same town as the facility address. The phone
number on file no longer has messaging service and nobody answered.
After confirming the person there has communication with the registrant, I left my contact information there and
requested that they give my contact information to the registrant and to have him contact me.
