Sec. 2.40 Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).(b) (3)
**** A male poodle microchip number OAO1372302 with the date of birth October 21, 2009 has what appears to be
a white circular disk covering his left eye. During the inspection it can be seen to be impacting his vision by body
posturing of keeping the left side away from us and the constant turning of the head. Licensee stated that he
bought the dog on March 14, 2017. Asked him if he had called his attending vet and informed him of the dogs
condition. He said no. During the inspection he called attending vet and scheduled the appointment. The dog must
be taken in to the attending veterinarian to determine the appropriate veterinary care and the dogs health records
must be documented with diagnosis and treatment plan.
