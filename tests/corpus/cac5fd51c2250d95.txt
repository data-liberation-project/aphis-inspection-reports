INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The activities involving animals for the facility are written and maintained as SOPs only, and do not include the
required information such as approximate number of animals and species to be used, rationale for use of animals,
and justification for the appropriateness of the species and number of animals used. Without this information, the
IACUC cannot properly review and approve proposed activities prior to initiation of animal use. The IACUC's
function for review and approval is designed to ensure no animals endure undue pain or distress or are used
unnecessarily for research activities. Correct by having the primary person responsible for conducting the research
activities include in the description of proposed activities all of the elements as described in section 2.31 (e) of the
AWA and submit to the IACUC for review and approval.
