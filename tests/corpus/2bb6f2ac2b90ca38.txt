HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three metal panels for the last two enclosures on the southeast corner were extremely rusty. The metal surface
was flaking.
* Enclosure one on the northwest side of the granary had vinyl covered expanded metal flooring. The vinyl was
coming off in areas exposing the metal. This metal surface is extremely rusty and flaking.
These metal surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Thus, increasing the disease potential for the five
adult dogs.
All metal surfaces must be free of rusty that prevents required cleaning and sanitization. Proper cleaning and
sanitization will minimize the disease potential for the dogs.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Ten dog doors and the areas around the doors had an accumulation of brown grime or excreta. This indicates
these hard surfaces are not being spot-cleaned daily. Without daily spot-cleaning and necessary sanitization the
disease potential for the 32 adult dogs increases.
All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized when necessary. This will prevent an accumulation of
grime and excreta. Also, this will reduce the disease hazards to the dogs.

3.1(f)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* On the northeast side on the kennel there was fecal waste, debris and standing fluid waste underneath the
enclosures. The area of standing fluid waste was approximately 5 feet long by 21/2 feet wide. The fluid waste was
colored brown. The fluid waste cannot drain from the underneath area. Without rapid elimination of the waste and
fluid waste, this can cause orders, attracts insects, pests and vermin. Also, the risks for potential for disease
increases.
All drainage systems must be constructed so they rapidly eliminate waste and fluid waste. Operators must provide
frequent collection and removal of waste, debris and fluid waste. This will prevent orders, insects, pests and vermin
infestations. Additionally, the potential for disease risks for the 25 adult dogs will be minimized.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The underneath area for the east enclosures and all the west enclosures had an accumulation of fecal waste.
Some of the enclosures standing pools of fluid waste under them. The fluid waste was a brown color. There was
an ammonia order present around these areas. This accumulation of fecal waste and fluid waste can cause orders,
attract insects and pests and increase the disease hazards for the 32 adult dogs.
All areas underneath the enclosures must be cleaned more frequently. This will prevent an accumulation of fecal,
fluid and food waste, and reduce orders, insects, pests and disease hazards for the dogs.

3.11(b)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* 25 feed receptacles used to feed 46 adult dogs had a buildup of brown grime and debris inside the feeders. Some
of the feed receptacles had feed, debris that was cake on the sides and regulator door of the feed receptacles. The
part of the feed receptacle where the dogs eat, on some of the feed receptacles, had a buildup of brown grime and
debris. This accumulation of food waste, grime and debris indicates the feed receptacles are not being cleaned and
sanitized often enough. This can increase the disease hazards for the dogs.All feeding receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized more often to prevent an accumulation of grime, debris, food
waste and feed cake on the feeder. Feed receptacles cleaned and sanitized more often will minimize the disease
hazards to the dogs.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The area around the dog food stored on pallets had an accumulation of dog hair, dirt, debris, discarded matter and
pieces of paper. This can provide breeding and living areas for rodents and other pest and vermin. As a result, the
health of the 112 adult dogs could be affected.
All buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept free of accumulations of trash, dog hair, discarded matter and
debris. This will reduce the breeding and living areas for rodents and other pest and vermin. Therefore, the health
of the dogs would not be affected.
