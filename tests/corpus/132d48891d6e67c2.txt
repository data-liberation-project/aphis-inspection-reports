OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are three rescued domestic dogs in two enclosures. Although they have shelters in the form of wooden or
plastic dog houses, there are no rain or windbreaks over the doors of these houses. Wind and rain breaks need to
be provided in order to prevent rain and cold air from directly entering the house shelters. To be corrected by
1-8-16.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A large tree branch has fallen onto two of the enclosure fences containing wolf hybrids. The branch is propped from
the tree trunk to over the top of two of the enclosure fences pushing the fences down about a foot . This tree
branch needs to be removed and the fence repaired to prevent potential injuries or escapes. In the enclosure
containing two wolf hybrids, one of the animals has dug a deep hole in one area exposing the border ground wire.
This hole needs to be filled so that it does not expose the wire which could be an injury hazard. To be corrected by
1-1-16.

house. The wood pylon pieces need to be cleaned and sealed or removed. To be corrected by 1-15-16.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The large female bovine tore the boards off the wall of her shelter leaving some exposed screws in the pile of loose
boards. Behind her shelter, she tore a hole in the wire fence leaving loose protruding wires and a gap in the upper
fence. In the enclosure with three deer, an old chicken coop has missing and deteriorating boards. Thesestructures need to be repaired or removed to prevent potential injuries to the animals. To be corrected by 1-1-16.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure housing the large female bovine is excessively wet and muddy. Besides her shelter and a couple of
small areas, the entire enclosure is ankle deep mud. The employees have been trying to drain the enclosure, but
the flood which occurred in November and continual rains, combined with the weight of this animal is keeping the
enclosure mucky. There are plans to move this animal to a bigger dryer enclosure. Until this is done, methods
need to be employed to increase drainage in this enclosure and provide her more dry areas. To be corrected by
1-15-16.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
A new wooden shelter for two goats contains an excess amount of feces and there is both wet hay in some areas
and dirty dusty hay under the top layer of fresher hay. One of the two shelters for the single housed llama has a
large pile of hay in it. There is white mold under the edges of some of this hay and mold on the ground near the hay
bedding. These shelters need to be cleaned out more often and cleaned down to the wooden floor in the one in
order to prevent odors and disease hazards. To be corrected by 12-19-15.
