FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the food preparation room, one desk type paper waste can contained food wastes and other debris. The waste
can had no lid. Uncovered waste material may provide insects and other vermin with a source of food. These pests
may also use waste material as a breeding ground. A system should be in place to ensure that trash receptacles
are kept covered with a tight fitting lid. The proper disposal and handling of waste material enhances the health and

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The enclosure had an igloo shelter for the two goats. During inclement weather, it is not big enough to provide
sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of
movement. Inadequate space may be indicated by evidence of malnutrition, poor condition, debility, stress, or
abnormal behavior patterns. For the health and wellbeing of the animals, the shelter system needs to provideadequate space for normal postural movements and social adjustments.
