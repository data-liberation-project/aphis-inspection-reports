2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Basset Hound named (cid:28)Peanut Butter(cid:29) had excessively long toenails on both front feet. Long toenails can
force the toes into abnormal positions, can affect the dog(cid:25)s gait, and can become entrapped and injured. The
licensee must trim these toenails and must establish an effective program of toenail maintenance.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS Form 7005 records were incomplete. There were 6 adult dogs in the kennel that were not listed on this
Dogs on Hand form. Appropriate documentation of all animals is essential for proper identification and so each
animal can be traced. The licensee must update the APHIS Form 7005 to include complete information for all adult
dogs in the kennel.
TO BE CORRECTED BY DECEMBER 22, 2015.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and Curt McGruder-ACI.
