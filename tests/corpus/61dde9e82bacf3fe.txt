3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Jacobs sheep enclosure, a wood fence post is in disrepair. The post is leaning back/outward and is pulling
the fence panels with it. The post is no longer structurally sound as it was easily moved forward several inches
when pressed by the inspector. Enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain them.
Repair or replace the fence post.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The Meishan pig's enclosure was covered with thick mud and standing water during the time of inspection. The
standing water was covered with a film and accounted for the front 1/4 to 1/3 of the enclosure. The pigs must walk
through the thick mud to gain access to their water. Excessive standing water and thick mud can harbor disease
hazards.
Assure the pigs' enclosure has a suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water.

SANITATION.
The dry food storage/animal room, woodchucks’ enclosure, and Meishan pigs’ enclosure contained dense swarms
of flies during the time of inspection. The flies in the dry food storage/animal room were concentrated on the food
containers in front of the bobcat enclosure. The flies in/on the woodchucks’ enclosure resulted from the abundance
of flies located on the food bucket in the nearby turkey enclosure. Finally, the flies in pigs’ enclosure were
concentrated on the pigs' food, on one of the pigs, and in the mud adjacent to the pigs' shelter. The facility has fly
control provisions in place inside of the dry food storage/animal room, but they aren't adequately controlling the
population of flies. There aren’t fly control provisions in place at or around the woodchucks' and Meishan pigsenclosures. Flies can spread disease.
Implement/increase fly control provisions to safely and effectively control the flies at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
