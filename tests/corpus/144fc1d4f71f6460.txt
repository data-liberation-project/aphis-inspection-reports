RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Eleven dogs on at least five USDA forms 7006 do not have their identification number in column "A". All dogs being
sold, exchanged, transferred, or donated must have the 7006 filled out correctly. Proper identification for dogs
helps maintain a good level of where each dog has been shipped and proper veterinarian care has been given to
that dog. The owner must correctly fill out the form 7006 by the next shipping of dogs or by 05-10-2014.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
