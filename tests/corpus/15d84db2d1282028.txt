2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
On December 7, 2021, a rhesus macaque sustained injuries during a handling incident with two laboratory personnel.
This incident was not reported to DCM Veterinary Staff. On December 9, 2021, during routine rounds DCM Veterinary
Staff observed this macaque to have bruising around both eyes with scleral hemorrhages. Veterinary care was provided
to the macaque. A sedated physical exam was performed on December 10th and bruising in the mouth was observed.
The collar was removed from the macaque before it was returned to its primary enclosure.
The lab was contacted by DCM Veterinary Staff on 12/09/2021. On December 10th, DCM Veterinary Staff met with the
lab to review the incident. At the time of the incident, laboratory staff was moving the macaque to a chair using a collar.
According to the laboratory personnel, the macaque became agitated in his chair. The macaque threw his weight against
his collar which created pressure against his chained collar for an extended period. The IACUC investigation determined
the laboratory staff did not know how to handle the macaque during the incident. Also, the laboratory staff did not
recognize the macaque’s injuries.
Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,
excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.



Corrected before the time of inspection by corrective action plan: retraining all laboratory personnel, individual training for
involved laboratory staff, increased oversight from DCM Veterinary Staff and Behaviorist for all macaque users.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Attending Veterinarian and facility representatives.

This inspection was conducted from 09/20/2022 to 09/21/2022.
