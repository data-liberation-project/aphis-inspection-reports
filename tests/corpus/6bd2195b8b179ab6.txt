ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1. A two year old male dromedary camel was observed to have prolapsed rectal tissue while it was laying down.
The licensee said she noticed that the camel was having the issue about two weeks ago and that the prolapse goes
back in when the camel gets up. We observed that the prolapsed tissue did go back in within a few minutes after
the camel got up. The licensee hadn’t notified the veterinarian about this issue as of the time of inspection.
Prolapsed tissue could be painful and lack of prompt veterinarian evaluation could decrease the likelihood of
treatment success.
Ensure the veterinarian evaluates the camel’s condition. Follow through with all prescribed treatments and
instructions.

2. A male opossum was observed to be missing most of the hair on its head. Its head had scratches, scabs, and a
small amount of clear red fluid weeping from a wound on the bridge of its nose. Its tail had some small wounds on
it. The licensee indicated that the male opossum’s two female enclosure mates pick on him. The licensee hadn’t
notified the veterinarian about this issue as of the time of inspection. Bite wounds can be painful and become
infected if left untreated.
Ensure the veterinarian evaluates the opossum’s condition. Follow through with all prescribed treatments and
instructions.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The male black bear enclosure contains a metal resting platform that is in disrepair. The platform is constructed ofexpanded metal and has a broken panel. This has resulted in exposed rough edges/sharp points. Sharp points
and rough edges can injure animals.
Repair or replace the platform to protect the animal from injury.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Abundant amounts of flies were present in and around several animal enclosures during the time of inspection. The
flies were observed in, on, and around the animal enclosures containing the single raccoon, the single groundhog,
the four skunks, the single camel, the three Hereford cattle, the five Kodiak bears, the three kinkajous, and the
fennec fox. The facility was using Quickbayt spray, Quickbayt fly bait, had a single sticky tape trap, and one outside
trap in place during the time of inspection, however; these provisions were not enough to effectively control the
population of flies in and around these animal enclosures. Flies carry and spread disease.
Implement and maintain a program to effectively control the flies.
3.133
SEPARATION.
The licensee indicated the male opossum was injured by its two female enclosure mates. The male opossum was
observed to be missing most of the hair on its face. His head also had scratches, scabs, and red fluid weeping from
the bridge of his nose. This is the second time the licensee has indicated an opossum was injured by its enclosure
mates. Housing incompatible animals together can cause stress and fighting among animals.
Assure the animals are housed in compatible groups to provide for their health and well-being.
