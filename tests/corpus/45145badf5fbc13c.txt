Housing facilities, general.
Pens 4, 5, 6, 9, and 13 contained 2 dogs in each pen that had 1-2 stairs each that had evidence of destruction by chewing
causing the surface of the stairs to be irregular and pitted along the edges.

The pitting on the surface of the stairs cannot readily be cleaned and sanitized properly according to the regulation in
order to prevent bacteria from building up and being a possible health issue.

The licensee needs to repair or replace any surfaces when worn or soiled that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.

To be corrected by: The stairs were repaired by the end of the exit interview

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
