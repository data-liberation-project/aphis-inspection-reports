2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
On 12/16/15 a dog identified as # 2510325 was accidentally exposed to a full-strength quaternary disinfectant called
"Maxima 256" during a routine kennel cleaning procedure, and suffered severe chemical burns on its skin, oral
cavity, and one eye.
The employee involved failed to properly dilute the disinfectant prior to applying it to the kennel surfaces, and the
dog was able to come into contact with the disinfectant. The employee stated, at the time of the inspection, that he
had been properly trained, and knew that the disinfectant needed to be diluted, but decided to apply it first, and then
add water, of his own initiated.
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee took appropriate action, suspending and retraining the employee,
and reviewing Standard Operating Procedures. The dog received prompt and appropriate veterinary care, and
eventually recovered from its injuries, and was adopted as a pet into a home.
All animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause physical harm. Allowing this dog access to this
disinfectant resulted in serious harm. The facility must take steps to ensure that all employees follow the facility's
standard operating procedures and policies when handling animals.
To be corrected from this time forward.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
The clean and dirty sides of the cage wash area has some housekeeping and maintenance issues that need to be
addressed.
The clean side of the cage wash is crowded, and there are shelves with items such as bottle stoppers and long
metal sheets, on the floor under the shelves. The floor is discolored under the shelves, suggesting that adequate
cleaning is not occurring in these areas.On the dirty side, the floor is deteriorating, with clear sheets peeling off of the surface. The presence of a large
number of dirty cages awaiting cleaning on top of this floor means that there is animal waste accumulating on the
deteriorating floor surface, which cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized because of the peeling surface, which
entraps particles.
Also in this room there is a large container - at least 50 gallons, of acid wash that sits on top of a plastic grate. Dirty
material has accumulated within the grate, and it cannot be adequately cleaned, as the large container cannot be
moved until it is empty.
The facilities should be kept clean, and in good repair, in order to facilitate the necessary husbandry practices.
Failure to maintain the cage wash area in sanitary conditions could have a negative impact on the animals, since
their primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized in these areas.
Steps should be taken immediately to improve the housekeeping in the facility, and the floor repair is to be
completed by 6/19/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
The inspection occurred on 1/17/17 and 1/18/17.
