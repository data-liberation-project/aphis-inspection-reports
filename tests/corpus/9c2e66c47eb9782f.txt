HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Inside the sheltered building there was an accumulation of miscellaneous items collected at both ends of the
aisleway, within empty enclosures and scattered on top of a counter. These items included an empty water bottle,
gallon metal cans, a "Little Playmate" cooler and an overflowing trash can full of random items such as a light bulb,
metal cans and faucet handle. Some of these items were covered with dirt and/or dust and some were located
adjacent to animal enclosures occupied with adult dogs and/or puppies. This accumulation of items can increase
the risk of disease and pest hazards. The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are kept neat and free of
clutter, any accumulation of trash, waste material, junk and other discarded materials in order to protect the health
and well-being of the animals at all times. To be corrected by: November 16, 2016.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Within a sheltered building and buildings containing outdoor shelter units, there was a build up of dirt/dust, debris
and/or an excessive amount of cobwebs on the walls, flat surfaces and/or ceilings. The dirt and cobwebs were
located along the walls inside of at least two enclosures housing adult dogs. Accumulations of dirt/dust, debris
and/or cobwebs can lead to pests, odors and potential disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all hard
surfaces with which the dogs come in contact are spot-leaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of
this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee must also ensure that all
other surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices. To be corrected by: November 16, 2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Within a short walkway for a building containing outdoor shelter units for enclosures housing adult dogs, there
was a pile of straw strewn on the floor in the corner directly outside of the shelter units. There were cobwebs
present over portions of the straw. This storage method of bedding creates an opportunity for pests and
contamination. The licensee must ensure that all opened supplies of bedding are stored off of the floor and away
from walls at all times. To be corrected by: November 7, 2016.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative on November 2, 2016.
