FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Large Felid enclosures are on a concrete pad, surrounded by a perimeter fence. Fence does not meet
requirements.
- Fence is over 8 feet high from outside of pad, as pad is elevated above ground level. However, from the enclosure
area, the fence is between 5 and 6 feet high. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such
as large felines (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc. must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
- Perimeter fence is made of chain link, with plastic strips threaded through the mesh. Fence is several inches from
the various enclosures in the area. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to
prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.
Fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Enclosures in use at time of inspection did not provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal
postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. APHIS has determined that "adequate
freedom of movement" includes the ability to exercise. If the primary enclosure does not provide such opportumities,
the requirement may be met by daily release for a reasonable amount of time into an area that will allow such
opportunity. No such area is currently in use.
