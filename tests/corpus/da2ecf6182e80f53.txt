2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female white and grey Shih Tzu (#148) had a white spot on her right eye. The licensee informed me he had not
observed or treated it. Untreated eye conditions can be contagious to other dogs. In addition, problems with the
eyes can be painful and can be indicative of other health problems. The Attending Veterinarian must be contacted
to determine what treatment (if any) is needed. Correct by 7/22/16.
Master Gland Formula was found to have expired in December of 2015. Expired medications doesn't ensure that
the product given to the animal is safe and of a high quality. The expired medication could be ineffective or toxic to
the animal(s). Expired medications must not be used on regulated animals and need to be removed from the shelf
of the medicine cabinet that is reserved for regulated animal medications. Correct immediately.
3.6(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Wooden walls of the majority of the primary enclosures were chewed up. Chewed up walls doesn't allow for the
walls to be easily sanitized. The wooden walls must be fixed or replaced so they can be easily cleaned and
sanitized. Correct by 8/18/16.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The licensee informed me he sanitizes the primary enclosures about twice a year. Not sanitizing the primary
enclosures every two weeks doesn't ensure that the various types of germs (such as viruses, bacteria, parasites,
etc.) have been killed. All primary enclosures must be disinfected once every two weeks and more often if
necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. Correct by
8/1/16.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.A needle was found in an enclosure containing two dogs. Needles in enclosures can cause injury to the dogs if they
were to step on the needle. All needles must be properly discarded after use. The housing facilities must be kept
clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct immediately.
The medicine cabinet was found to be dirty and one bottle containing a liquid was found to have leaked within the
medicine cabinet. It was difficult to read the labels of the medications because of the dirt and grime that had
accumulated within the medicine cabinet. In addition, a dirty medicine cabinet can attract rodents and other pests
and contaminate the products that the medicine cabinet contains. The medicine cabinet needs to be cleaned and
kept clean on a regular basis so the labels on the medication bottles can be easily read. Correct by 7/25/16.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
