2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A six week old Yak was observed to be limping on its right rear leg. The licensee had not observed this prior to
inspection. An animal limping on its leg indicates the animal is in pain and is in need of medical attention. Not observing
this medical condition and reporting it to the Attending Veterinarian doesn't ensure the animal is receiving medical
attention in a timely manner. The Attending Veterinarian must be contacted to ensure the Yak receives appropriate
medical attention. Observations must be conducted on a daily basis and all medical problems must be treated per the
Attending Veterinarian's instructions.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 2/11/23 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
