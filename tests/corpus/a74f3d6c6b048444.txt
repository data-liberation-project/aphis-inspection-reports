Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Multiple live roaches were seen in the Emerald Forest kitchen on the drying rack for clean dishes as well as on other tools
used for preparing nonhuman primate diets.
Pests can spread disease and contaminate animal areas and feed which can negatively impact the well-being of
nonhuman primates. An effective program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and
birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained.

Facilities, general.
There are multiple areas of cracked and crumbling concrete in the sea lion enclosures, including on the west island in the
primary exhibit and the main deck in the secondary exhibit. The facility has mitigated some areas on the main decks in
both exhibits with rubber mats but are not able to cover all areas of exposed and cracked concrete. A work order was
submitted by keepers for the sea lion exhibit; however, the request only referenced an area on the main deck of the
secondary exhibit. The facility has long-term improvement plans for the primary and secondary exhibit but there are many
areas that need to be addressed now. All five sea lions currently have rotating access to both exhibits.


Defects on the coating surface or missing chunks of concrete may cause injury to the animals through skin abrasions,
lacerations, or other means. Cracking or other structural defects in the pool may put animals at risk. Indoor and outdoor
housing facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
