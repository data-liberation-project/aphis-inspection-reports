2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A bottle of Rompun-Ketaset (Ketamine injection) was observed at the facility during the time of inspection. The
bottle was approximately half full and currently being used by the licensee to sedate three adult dogs. The licensee
purchased the drug from the attending veterinarian in October of 2016. The licensee stated that the drug is used
when dogs at the facility need to be sheared. While a dog is sedated, the licensee or employee may also clip
toenails and look for any abnormal health conditions.
The bottle of Rompun-Ketaset does not list an expiration date or use for a specific animal. Medications must be
labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents and dosage rates of the
container can be known with certainty and not used past its expiration date. The licensee must also ensure that all
medication labels are labeled with the contents (concentration of drug), dosing instructions specific for the species
of the animal it’s being administered to.
This drug is not listed on the program of veterinary care that the licensee maintains at the facility. If the individual(s)
administering the controlled substance is not a veterinarian or is not directly supervised by a veterinarian, then the
individual’s training should be documented and approved by the attending veterinarian as part of the facility’s
program of veterinary care. Sedative/tranquilizers and controlled substances must be used by a trained and
knowledgeable individual. If not used properly, this medication could cause harm to the animals.
The licensee must be adequately trained by the attending veterinarian on the use of controlled substances and
other sedative/tranquilizers to ensure proper dosing rates and administration to protect the health and welfare of the
animals at the facility. Additionally, the licensee must also have written guidance from the attending veterinarian to
appropriately monitor vital signs, handle animals during and after administration, recognize when medical
intervention is necessary and determine what steps to take.
To be corrected by: February 20, 2017. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

2016 inspection report, have both had their toenails trimmed. This non-compliant item has been corrected.
