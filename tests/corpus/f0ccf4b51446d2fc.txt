FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure containing 12 reindeer had fencing that had been mangled with sharp points sticking out. Sharp
points inside an enclosure can cause injury to the animals within that enclosure. The fence line must be fixed and
maintained in good repair so no sharp points are sticking out. Correct by 10/6/16.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
