2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several protocols reviewed during this inspection did not include a rational for the appropriateness of the numbers
of animals to be used. For example, protocol 2456 simply stated the number of animals to be used and that the
number (cid:24)was based on standard numbers needed to achieve significance(cid:25). No references or statistics were included
to document significance. Protocol 2383 stated that they want 8 animals in each group with an extra 2 in each group
for replacement if any need to be removed (cid:24)for health issues or acute death(cid:25). It further stated that in a previous
(cid:24)similar model group sizes of 8 were needed to allow for variability in biological response and unanticipated health
events(cid:25). No references or statistics were provided as rationale. No rationale was given for the extra 2 animals per
group requested in protocol 2383 that were apparently included in the 8 animals of the (cid:24)similar model group(cid:25). A
protocol must include a rationale for the number of animals to be used in order for the IACUC to be able to
adequately review activities related to the care and use of animals including ensuring limiting the use of animals to
minimize discomfort, distress and pain and unnecessary duplication. Correct by Oct. 31, 2016.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
The facility reported a suspension of protocol 1626 to USDA Animal Care in November 2015. The IACUC was
monitoring this protocol closely due to previous non-compliance events. In early Nov. 2015 OLAC staff noticed that
two hamsters had open surgical incisions and another three were showing signs of pain and distress the day after
surgery. In addition some were showing neurological signs and one of them was salivating heavily. Research staff
records noted that the research staff had observed the animals that same morning and considered them (cid:24)bright,
alert and responsive(cid:25). An IACUC investigation into the incident determined that the research staff were not provided
proper training for conducting protocol procedures including surgery or for conducting post-surgical animal
assessments. During the six month suspension, extensive training was provided to all research laboratory
personnel via multiple modalities and by multiple people. Procedures have resumed with frequent IACUC member
oversight and no additional problems have been reported. Lack of adequate training of personnel involved in animal
care and use can lead to severe consequences including unnecessary pain and distress to the animals. It shall be
the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians and
other personnel involved in animal care, treatment and use are qualified to perform their duties which shall befulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel. Corrected for protocol 1626 at
this time; correct from this day forward for all protocols.
