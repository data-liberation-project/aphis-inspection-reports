HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosures and den boxes for the Savannah Cats there was wood that was not painted or sealed, and
deteriorating in some areas, and there was some peeling paint in some areas.
All surfaces in cat housing should be maintained and / or replaced as necessary so that they can be adequately
cleaned and sanitized.
Failure to maintain surfaces as required can lead to a build up of soiled materials, which presents disease risks, and
increases unhealthy odor / ventilation issues. Surfaces should be replaced or sealed so that adequate cleaning and
sanitizing can occur.
To be corrected in all cat enclosures by 1/1/15.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
