2.40(a) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian had not examined the animals or their living conditions at the authorized representatives
location. During the inspection the death of a cavy, guinea pig pup and a piglet was noted. When the inspector asked if
the AV was made aware of the conditions of the animals the authorized person said no. Arrangements must be made with
the facility's attending veterinarian to provide adequate care for these animals sold under the license, and the attending
veterinarian shall have regularly scheduled visits to the premises, providing the owner and authorized person with
husbandry practices and anything required for the health and well-being of these animals. Correct from this day forward.
2.75(b) Critical

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The dealer did not have any records of the animals at the authorized persons location in which rabbits, guinea pigs,
chinchillas, cattle, pigs and a cavy were being held. The owner stated there was a book with all the sales for animals
purchased but the book was never located. The owner and authorized person however, constructed new disposition
sheets during the inspection using the notes from their payment networks such as Venmo and PayPal. These were not
the original invoices and the authenticity of the information is questionable. The facility shall keep and maintain records or
forms which fully and correctly disclose information for the animals on hand, acquired and sold. Without this proper


documentation it's unclear of what animals are being used in regulated activity and their status. Correct from this day
forward.
2.125 Critical

Information as to business; furnishing of same by dealers, exhibitors, operators of auction sales, intermediate
handlers, and carriers.
The facility has been withholding information about the activity of the business being conducted. They have been selling
rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, pigs and cattle at the flea market and pet stores. The animals being sold were being held
at locations other than the site reported to Animal Care. The authorized representative was holding animals at her
residence in which, the location nor animals residing there were included in the animals on-hand list or the acquisition and
disposition documents for the facility.

The inspector requested acquisition and disposition documents for the animals that weren't being maintained with the
facility records and was told that they misplaced the notebook. They expressed that they had the documents electronically
and could retrieve those, but it was later found out during the visit that the information was being taken from the note
section of the Venmo and Paypal accounts and the disposition forms were being drafted during the time of the inspection.

Not providing all the information on a business prevents the inspector from properly assessing the regulated activity being
conducted and the animal's welfare. The facility shall provide the inspector any information concerning the business of the
dealer. Correct from this day forward.
2.126(a)(4) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.


The facility has a kangaroo that has been listed in the inventory but has never been inspected in its enclosure at the
facility. The facility owner's sister kept the kangaroo in a pouch on her person and when asked to inspect it she brought
the animal, but it did not have its own living quarters at the facility. Since the kangaroo isn't residing there his enclosure
has not been inspected. The inspector told the owner at the last inspection that the sister either needed to be added as
another site or he must have a place for the animal at the facility to reside and neither has occurred.

The inspector should be allowed to inspect any facilities, property and animals that are involved in licensed activity so that
the regulations and standards can be enforced for the well-being of the animals. Correct from this day forward.
3.27(b) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
The guinea pigs were being held in an outdoor structure with two entrances and a portable radiator plugged to the house
using an extension cord. On arrival there was a guinea pig pup that had expired sometime overnight. The overnight
temperature was in the 30's and could have possibly attributed to the death of the animal. Guinea pigs shall not be
housed in outdoor facilities unless such facilities are in an appropriate climate to prevent illness. Prior approval for such
outdoor housing is obtained from the Deputy Administrator. Correct from this day forward.
3.30

Watering.
The water bottle attached to the guinea pigs enclosures had residue build-up inside of them. The authorized
representative wiped her finger on the inside of the bottle to show that it was just the stained plastic and instantly wiped
away an area of residue on the inside wall of the bottle. All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty or at least
once every 2 weeks to prevent disease. Correct by February 25, 2022.
3.31(a)(1)



Sanitation.
The guinea pigs had an accumulation of feces on the bottom of the enclosure and they were standing in it. The feces
appeared old because it had broken down into a dirt like substance. The primary enclosure shall be cleaned as often as
needed to prevent accumulation of excreta and sanitized at least once every two weeks by washing them with hot water
(180 °F.) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent
solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam. Correct by
February 25, 2022.
3.53(c)(1)

Primary enclosures.
There were 15 rabbits in one enclosure and none of them could move about without being on top of the next rabbit.
Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space for the animal to make normal
postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. For individual weaned rabbits less than 4.4 lbs. requires a
minimum of 1.5 square feet floor space. Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount
of floor space, exclusive of the space taken up by food and water receptacles. Correct by February 25, 2022.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The kinkajou's den box was missing it's back right leg. The area which came apart left the remnants of four exposed nails.
The owner stated that he hammered the leg onto the screws, but it had come off again. This leg has come off before but
the method in which it has been reattached has not been effective. The leg is needed to support the den box housing 4
kinkajous and prevent it from possibly tipping over and the exposed nails could potentially harm the animals. The den box
needs to be repaired to make it safe for the animals to inhabit without injury.



The wooden pallet serving as the foundation to the den box in the white-nosed coatimundi's primary enclosure has
degraded and the wood has rotted from constant wetting during cleaning. The most proximal end of the pallet has broken
off exposing four nail heads and has created an opening where the board is missing. The exposed nail heads and missing
board could potentially be harmful for the animals and should be replaced or repaired to ensure safety to the animals.

A female mountain coatimundi housed alone has a plastic drum used as a den box. The plastic blue drum has a square
cut-out for an opening providing the animal a warmer shelter however, the edges are straight edged and could injure the
animals paws as they constantly climb in and out of it. The animal needs a den box that will not potentially cause harm
and should be species appropriate.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
The pigs outdoor enclosures' floors were completely muddy except for the stall on the far right end. Out of five stalls for
the pigs, two were muddy without any dry areas to stand on, one of the stalls included piglets and a sow. Two other stalls
of the five had something down on the floor to provide a dry area, one of which had a piece of sheet metal, but was still
covered in mud. There needs to be proper drainage to allow the animals to stay dry if they choose to, preventing the
animals from any health issues deriving from constantly being subjected to a moist environment. A suitable method shall
be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water in outdoor facilities. Correct by March 4, 2022.
