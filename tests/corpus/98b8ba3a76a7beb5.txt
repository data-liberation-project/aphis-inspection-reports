2.33(a)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On August 6, 2019 one male lamb, identification 201905228, was observed by the APHIS inspectors to be
non-weight bearing on the right front limb. Without consulting the veterinarian or following the facility’s standard
procedure for treating lameness (prescribed by the veterinarian), an Animal Health Technician (AHT) treated this
animal with an unapproved antibiotic off-label.
On February 14, 2019, despite veterinary instructions to keep the Dorset and Romanov ewes separate during
lambing, the sheep operations staff comingled the groups. On February 26, 2019, 20 to 30% of Romanov ewes
were markedly thin due to competition for food. As a result of their body condition, 2 required euthanasia.
On January 31, 2019, the veterinarian ordered an immediate ration change for a group of Romanov ewes in poor
body condition. On February 5, 2019, the sheep manager still had not implemented the ration change with no
explanation. On February 26, 2019 the AV documents the condition of the Romanov ewes continues to deteriorate
and the AV euthanized 2 ewes on March 4th, 2019.
On January 22, 2019, one ewe was identified as being dehydrated and had difficulty rising. On January 23rd, the
veterinarian give strict instructions to the AHT to separate this animal in order to facilitate increased access to food
and water. On January 24th, despite the veterinarian’s instructions, it was reported the ewe had not been
separated. The ewe was euthanized on January 24 for poor prognosis due to dehydration and persistent
recumbency.
The above incidents demonstrate repeated failures to follow AV instructions. The facility personnel’s decision not to
follow the AV's instructions reduces the veterinarian's ability to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and
may have contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in the sheep operation unit. The facility shall assure that
the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to
oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
At the time of the exit interview, the employee issues have been addressed. And a comprehensive review of
existing sheep care operating procedures/protocols as well as a review of sheep care & handling procedures hasbeen implemented.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
