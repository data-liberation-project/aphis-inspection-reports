2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, chocolate roan cocker spaniel mix with no identification (likely number 68 on APHIS form 7006) has a buildup
of dark colored tartar covering all of the upper premolar and molar teeth and about half of the upper canine teeth.
The gum line over the large left upper premolar tooth is extremely receded and red with a large amount of creamy
discharge. The rest of the gums on the upper left side are also red with a mild amount of creamy discharge. The
gum line over the large right upper premolar tooth is mildly recessed.
Adult, cream-colored cocker spaniel mix with tag number 55 has a buildup of dark colored tartar covering the upper
premolar and molar teeth of both sides. One of the left upper premolar teeth has red, recessed gum line and creamy
discharge at the gum line. This premolar tooth is loose.
These symptoms are consistent with dental disease in dogs. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue
and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall
health of the animal. The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of
business on 27 May 2016 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it
available to the inspector upon request.
2.50(a)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The adult female, chocolate roan cocker spaniel cited on this report under 2.40 b 2 was not officially identified
during the inspection. The licensee is using collars/tags for identification. This dog did was not wearing a collar or
tag. Correct identification of the dogs facilitates the inspection process by ensuring that each dogs(cid:25) identify is known
for certain. The licensee, being a class A dealer (breeder), must identify all dogs on the premises. To be corrected
by 1 June 2016.2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
APHIS inspectors counted 41 dogs in the facility during the inspection. There are only 29 dogs listed on the APHIS
form 7005 (dogs on hand form). The licensee stated that he has not yet added to his inventory forms the dogs he
has kept from his breeding that range from weaning age to about a year of age. Correct inventory information
facilitates the inspection process and allows the dogs to be traced. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain
records that fully and correctly disclose the information required in 2.75 a concerning each dog purchased or
otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control. The records must
also include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. To be
corrected by 25 June 2016.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces that cannot be cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn, chewed, and soiled. The west kennel
has at least four enclosures where the wood frames on the inside of the dog enclosers are worn and chewed. The
chewed areas are very rough with open porous and splintered wood. Surfaces must be able to be properly cleaned
and then sanitized to help prevent diseases and maintain a healthy environment for dogs. The owner needs to put
into place a good maintenance program that closely monitors and repairs surfaces before they become a problem
and a hazard for dogs. The owner must repair or replace these chewed surfaces, in order for proper cleaning and
sanitization to take place.
3.1(d) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Housing facilities must have access to reliable electric power for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, and for
carrying out other requirements per the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations. This facility has no means of
electric power. The owner must put into place and maintain the availability for access to a form of electricity to be
used as needed to help ensure the good health of the dogs in this facility and to maintain husbandry standards.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Food and water receptacles must be sanitized at least once every two weeks and more often if needed to help
prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, and waste. A good job of cleaning and sanitizing receptacles can help
eliminate diseases and keep dogs healthy. At least three water receptacles have green looking water and green
moss floating around. Breeder must sanitize these receptacles. The breeder must clean and sanitize all water
receptacles more often to help maintain clean water for dogs. Correct by 05-26-2016
