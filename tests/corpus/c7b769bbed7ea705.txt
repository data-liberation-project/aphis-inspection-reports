INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Dogs being studied on protocol MLV052500-004 are being studied repeatedly over time rather than the facility using
dogs for one test and euthanizing after the 14 days of the study as described in the currently approved protocol. All
significant changes to an ongoing activity involving animals must be described in the protocol and then approved by
the IACUC in order to ensure adequate and appropriate oversight by the IACUC of the activities being conducted.
Correct by Sept. 15, 2014.
Exit conducted with undersigned Study Director.
