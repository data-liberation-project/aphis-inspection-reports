2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Most of the dogs in the kennel had excessively long toe nails. The nails were causing the toes to curl, and could
easily tear which would cause the animal pain, or could put stress on ligaments in the toes, causing the animal
discomfort.
There were the dogs, , bichon # 050-096-341, bichon #050-115-310, and a Yorkie #075-077-847, that had a
buildup of brown material on the teeth with some redness of the gums especially in the canines . Although a dental
plan was written and the vet checked the teeth on some of the dogs a year ago and performed some dental
cleanings, the dogs have not all been checked and graded and there is no follow up of the dental plan at this time.
Licensee shall trim nails on all dogs. The other dogs in the kennel shall be checked by the vet for dental issues,
and a plan for the dogs with dental issues must be documented. Part of the dental plan should include prevention.
Hooves are currently available for most of the breeders to chew on. Correct the dental issues, by providing an
adequate follow up of the dental plan for all of the dogs.

The citations 2.40(a)(2), 3.2(d), and 3.11(b) from last inspection were corrected.
