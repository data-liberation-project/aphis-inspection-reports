SANITATION.
The floor of the kinkajou enclosure is dirt with shavings. An excess accumulation of old and new feces is on the
floor of this enclosure, and flies are present. Because the kinkajou is aggressive to the regular caretaker, this
enclosure has not been cleaned in over a month. All enclosures need to be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent
contamination of the animals, to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. This enclosure should be
modified so that the enclosure can be safely accessed and cleaned on a regular basis. To be corrected by
6-10-15.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
