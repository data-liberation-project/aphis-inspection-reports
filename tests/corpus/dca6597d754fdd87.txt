MISCELLANEOUS.
Between December 2012 and February 2014 two primates unfamiliar with each other were accidentally placed
together in a play cage resulting in minor injuries. The primates recovered uneventfully. This incident was
assessed by the Attending Veterinarian and the IACUC and has been corrected.
An exit briefing was conducted by Dr. Miava Binkley with the facility representative.
