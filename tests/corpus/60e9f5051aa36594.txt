FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several enclosures housing animals including 14 porcupines, 1 wolverine and 2 snow leopard lack adequate
shelters. The shelter for the wolverine needs repair and the animal does not have access to adequate shelter. The
primary enclosures for the porcupine and snow leopard have walls on only 2 sides designed to provide shelter.
These walls cannot thoroughly block the wind from blowing through the shelter and do not provide access to
adequate shelter. Modify the existing shelter structures or furnish shelters that provide protection for the animals
from winter/adverse weather conditions. Correct by: 22 February 2016
