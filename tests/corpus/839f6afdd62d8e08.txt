2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** The facility’s geriatric Asiatic black bear, “Dillon”, continues to have severe dental issues including missing
several teeth, a recessed gum line, and a broken left lower canine tooth that has black discoloration in the center of
the remnant of the tooth. There continues to be a visible area on the lower left jaw of moist yellow discoloration
consistent with the appearance of a draining tooth abscess. The severity and chronic nature of these dental issues
are likely to have caused the bear a significant amount of pain over a long period of time and the condition of the
teeth has continued to deteriorate since first documented in 2017.
Additionally, the bear is morbidly obese, with limited mobility and exhibits a repetitive behavior in which he sits on
his haunches and repeatedly rocks himself back and forth by using his forepaws to push against the wall in front of
him, and will rock back against a large stone behind him in his enclosure. Repetitive abnormal behavior of this
nature can often be an indicator of pain and/or psychological distress. This repetitive behavior was first documented
in 2017 and has been viewed on subsequent inspections and no methods of assessing, addressing or minimizing
the underlying causes for this behavior have been put into action.
Also noted with the bear during today’s inspection is that he has a white, opaque discharge from the right nostril and
a cough was heard while feeding the bear. During a discussion with the caretaker, she stated that he had not
previously noted a nasal discharge from the bear previously and it had not been discussed with a veterinarian.
The facility’s geriatric bobcat is similarly obese and the caretaker stated that the animal no longer utilizes climbing
structures within the enclosure. The AV hasn’t evaluated the bobcat for body condition, changes in behavior and
decline in mobility or activity.
The facility has recently made some modifications to the enclosures (including the addition of ramps to the bobcat
and wooden platforms for the bear) and reached out to several consultant veterinarians who have experience in
exotic species. One of the consultant veterinarians did visit the facility to observe the condition of the bear's mouth
but information had not been provided to the veterinarian to address the bear’s mobility, his repetitive behaviors,
and obesity. The mobility issues with the bobcat and the obesity issues of the bobcat and raccoons were also not
discussed with this veterinarian.Evaluation of the animals is necessary so that appropriate methods can be put in place to:
-Manage potential pain indicated through lack of mobility in the bear and bobcat
-Manage weight for bear, bobcat, and raccoons through guidance in proper nutrition and diet amounts
-Manage dental disease and pain for bear through appropriate means of diagnosis and treatment.
-Assess abnormal repetitive behavior by the bear and address underlying causes such as physical pain and
psychological distress
-Manage nasal discharge and cough from the bear in order reduce the likelihood of more serious respiratory issues
from arising
These areas of care need to be addressed as all these issues are having a negative impact on the health and
welfare of these animals. Correct by: having these animals examined by a consulting veterinarian as directed by
your attending veterinarian and following the plan for diagnosis and treatment provided by that veterinarian.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
