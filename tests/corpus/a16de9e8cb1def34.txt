3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence around the red fox and coatimundi enclosures is not 6 ft. tall in all areas. The red fox enclosure has a
perimeter fence of 6 ft. except for a 20 ft. section where it tapers down to the 4 ft. fence by the access gate. Another fence
is present surrounding the perimeter fence but only reaches 5.5 ft. in height. The coatimundi has a 6 ft. perimeter fence
around about half and the rest of the perimeter fence is 4-5.5 ft. in height. Perimeter fences are necessary to protect the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact
with the animals. It should also serve as a secondary containment system for the animals housed within.
Correct by ensuring a 6 ft. perimeter fence surrounds both the red fox and coatimundi enclosures and is located at least 3
ft. from the primary enclosure or by obtaining Administrator approval for a variance in the 6 ft. height requirement.
