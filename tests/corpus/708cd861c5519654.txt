3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Within an outdoor enclosure containing one sheep and one goat there is a food receptacle with wet and caked feed.
When the food receptacle was dumped out per request of the inspector, a large number of live maggots were
observed in the feed. The contaminated feed can harbor bacteria and other disease causing agents that can affect
the health and well-being of the animals. There was a second food receptacle in the shelter that the sheep and goat
had access to. This receptacle was full of feed that was free of contaminates. The licensee must ensure measures
are taken so there is no molding, deterioration, or caking of feed that is offered to the animals.
Corrected at time of inspection.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
