body, all four limbs, feet, and face (especially under the eyes and around the muzzle). The hairless skin is generally
thickened and dark in color. There are some lighter colored scabs on the abdomen and some linear red scratches
with scabs on the neck and under the ears. The is a small amount of thick discharge in and around both eyes. The
(cid:28)"white"(cid:29) of the left eye is more red than the right eye.
There is a thick coating of greenish-brown material coating the entire surface of all of the upper premolars and some
of the upper canine teeth and remaining incisors. There is one upper loose premolar tooth on each side. The gums
are recessed away from the upper canine teeth and remaining incisors and there is a greenish brown discharge
along the gum line of the upper left premolar teeth. These signs are consistent with dental disease in dogs.
Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the
ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The hair loss and skin abnormalities can
be caused by a variety of medical problems and can be itchy and painful. The linear red scratches are consistent
with ongoing scratching at the skin. Eye problems can be caused by infection, trauma (including rubbing/scratching
at self) and a variety of other medical problems and can be painful.
The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
