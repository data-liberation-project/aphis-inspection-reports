3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The off-exhibit sea-lion holding area has a large defect in the surface coating near the valve-access box cover, with
undermining of the coating surrounding the defect. Additionally, there is an area where the surface coating is
cracked nearer the far wall; it also has undermining of the coating surrounding the crack. Such defects make it
difficult or impossible to clean and disinfect surfaces, and the edges are not smooth and can cause injury to the
animal in the enclosure.
Correction: Repairs to this area are scheduled to be completed in about a year. However, the damage is such that
the area should be put out of use until repairs can be made.
3.101(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A box of fish in the commissary freezer was open; the plastic bag liner was not closed. The fish was not sealed in
an airtight container to protect it from freezer burn or contamination.
Correct by ensuring that all food items in the freezer are stored properly to prevent deterioration or spoilage from
now on.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor enclosure of the bobcat holding area is constructed with two-inch chain link. The lower ~5 feet of the
larger mesh is supplemented with coated chicken wire. The chicken wire is sagging and separating in some areas,
and in at least one place is bent into the cage, with exposed wire points accessible to the animals.
Correct by close of business March 7, 2014.3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A feed bin in the hoofstock area was positioned directly below a recently-used hose which was rolled up on its
spool. The hose was dripping on the top of the bin. This resulted in a risk of the feed getting wet which could cause
spoilage, and may result in the animals being fed spoiled feed, or wasting feed if discovered before feeding.
This was corrected at the time of inspection by moving the feed bin from under the hose.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Secondary feed containers in several different animal areas were not well-labeled as to contents, or with a mill date
or expiration date. Lacking this information, it cannot be known if the feed is fresh enough to be wholesome and
palatable, or correct for the species being fed.
Correct by properly labeling secondary containers as new feed is placed in them.
The inspection was conducted with managerial and veterinary staff, and employees of the various areas.
The exit briefing was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.
