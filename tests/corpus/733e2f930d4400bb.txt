2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On 9/10/2021 , a visitor who was on the train in the deer park was injured by a female Oryx . The Oryx was standing next
to the train and tossed it's head contacting the visitor in the mouth and lip with it's long horns. The visitor was treated for
minor injuries at a local clinic . During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to
the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so
as to assure the safety of animals and the public. A plan must be developed that will create sufficient distance between
animals such as an Oyrx with long horns to assure the safety of the animals and the public. .
