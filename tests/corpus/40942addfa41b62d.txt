Miscellaneous.
3 bank voles were left without food and water in a dirty cage put into the cagewash room for processing on May 2, 2022,
and were discovered to be expired on May 6, 2022. All animals must be handled expeditiously and carefully to ensure that
physical harm does not occur to them. The facility must ensure that animals are cared for at all times in a manner that
ensures their welfare.

Corrected by the facility by terminating employment of the employee responsible and instituting retraining and new
procedures in cage processing for all remaining staff to prevent any recurrence of this event.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
