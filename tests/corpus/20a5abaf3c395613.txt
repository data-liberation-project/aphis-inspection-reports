3.13(f)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
On Monday, 3/10/14 a cat was traveling with a passenger in the cabin from Japan to Seattle, via SFO on a United
flight. At SFO the passenger became incapacitated, and was not allowed to board the connecting flight. At that
point the cat was tagged as luggage (Tag # 401 6394 548), and went to the cargo facility, around 5:30 PM.
Subsequently, after some confusion about whether the owner would be collecting the cat from the cargo office, cat
was shipped in cargo on a United flight the next day at 10:30 AM to SEA, where it was reunited with the owner.
The Animal Welfare Act regulations require that carriers not accept dogs and cats for transport unless feeding and
watering instructions are obtained in writing from the person shipping the animal. In this instance no feeding and
watering instructions could be obtained. In this event, per 3.13(f), the carrier must continue to provide proper care,
feeding, and housing to the dog or cat, and maintain the dog or cat in accordance with generally accepted
professional and husbandry practices for the time that the animal remains in the carrier(cid:25)s possession, during efforts
to contact the owner.
Feeding requirements for an adult cat are at minimum every 24 hours per the regulations, but without instructions,
and without knowing when an animal was last offered food and water the airline should assume that the animal may
need food and water, and those should be supplied to the animal in order to safeguard its well-being. This cat was
not offered food, and it had been well over 24 hours since the animal began the trip from Japan by the time the
animal arrived at SEA.
The carrier should develop clear policies on how they handle these cases so as to ensure proper care. The carrier
should be equipped with supplies so as to be able to provide proper husbandry in cases where the kenneling
service is not used.
Additionally, 3.13(f) requires that efforts to contact the owner be documented, and this information should be
obviously apparent to any staff members responsible for caring for the animal. This information was not immediately
available, and created confusion about the status of the animal for incoming AM staff. Such confusion, combined
with the absence of feeding and watering instructions, could endanger the animal's welfare. Staff should ensure
documentation and communication to help safeguard the welfare of the animals.To be corrected immediately.
An exit briefing was conducted with United SFO cargo facility management staff on 4/14/14.
