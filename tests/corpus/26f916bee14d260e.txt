The inaccurate buyer information was also listed on the health certificate and transportation waybills.
The transportation records show a phone number for all the buyers with the same number with a Rhode Island area
code and prefix number. These puppies are sold to different buyers in different states but the transportation records
show them going to a person in Rhode Island for pick up.
An inaccurate APHIS form 7006 hinders the APHIS official’s duty to verify the buyer and buyers address to ensure
correct information discloses the disposition of dogs under your control. If you use an agent to broker a sale you are
still responsible to ensure accurate information is listed on the APHIS form 7006.
The APHIS form 7006 must be filled out which fully and correctly discloses the required information of dogs
purchased, donated, euthanized and otherwise disposed of by that of the dealer.
To be corrected on all future APHIS 7006 forms.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
