ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1200 on
01-APR-19.
Upon arrival at the facility contact was made with the licensee's son. He stated that the licensee was not home and
called her for me. I spoke with the licensee via the phone and she stated that she was unable to return to conduct
the inspection. I then left the facility.
End of report.
