3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Inside one enclosure housing two adult dogs, there was solid plastic-like flooring material that overlapped the
flooring underneath it creating a small space between the two layers of flooring. This space was large enough that
an accumulation of dirt, grime and organic material had built up inside of it. Some of the organic material appeared
to be dry kibbles of dog food and/or fecal material with a white discoloration to it. Some small insect-like bugs were
observed in between the two layers of flooring as well. This build up of dirt, grime and organic material can increase
the risk of pests and other disease hazards to the dogs. The licensee must clean between these layers of flooring
and must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices. To be corrected by: March 29, 2016.
*Note - The female white Maltese (#083) included under 2.40 (b)(2) on the report for the inspection conducted on
January 13, 2015 had been examined by a veterinarian and a treatment plan had been followed.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
