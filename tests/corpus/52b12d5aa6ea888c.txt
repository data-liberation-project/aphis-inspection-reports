2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is incomplete. It does not contain written instruction on each species held
by the owner. The only recommendation it has is that every primate is TB tested prior to sale.
Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian. In the case of a part-time veterinarian, the formal
arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the
exhibitor.
A written program of veterinary care must be developed to ensure that routine veterinary care is being followed by
the owner. The program of veterinary care must be updated annually and at any time there are additional species
added to the facility. This is to ensure that all animals kept at the facility are maintained in good health.
2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A camel named Romeo is in an extremely thin condition and is under the care of the facilities attending veterinarian.
In a phone call on September 20, 2016 between Dr. Hammel and one of the associates at the attending
veterinarian’s clinic it was related to Dr. Hammel that it was the recommendation of the attending veterinarian that
Romeo not be taken to exhibit at the Michigan Renaissance Festival. The veterinarian did not want to expose this
camel to additional stress that might exacerbate its condition. Mr. Evola did take the camel to the festival despite
the attending veterinarian’s recommendation. In a conversation with APHIS inspectors on September 8, 2016, Mr.
Evola stated that he only used Romeo for giving rides to small children. Mr. Evola did not follow the advice of his
attending veterinarian. The lack of authority of the attending veterinarian for the facility puts all the animals at this
facility at risk. Mr. Evola must follow the guidance and recommendations’ of his attending veterinarian. This is
especially a concern in the case of Romeo, a camel in an extremely poor condition. Using this camel for rides
despite the recommendation of the veterinarian put the health of the camel at risk and could adversely affect the
camel’s recovery.
2.40(b)(2)ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are several goats that have overgrown hooves and need to have them trimmed. There are also multiple
drugs kept on hand that have no veterinary approval or instruction for use by the attending veterinarian.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Trim the goat hooves as often as necessary to prevent pain and injury. Any medications kept on hand must be
approved by the attending veterinarian and include written instruction for use and dosage.

public.
All animals must be kept and maintained in good health to prevent injury to the public and the animal.
