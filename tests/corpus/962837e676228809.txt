2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One salt and pepper colored adult female Schnauzer ( tattoo number 554) and one fawn and white colored
adult female Italian Greyhound ( tattoo number 609) have an accumulation of dark brown material coating the entire
surface of the upper cheek teeth. There was a creamy white discharge along the gum line. The gum line is red and
swollen and has receded away from the upper cheek teeth. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental
disease. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful. It can impact
the ability of the dog to eat, affecting the health and well-being of the dog. Dental disease can be painful, lead to a
decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by
end of business 1/19/15 and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be
documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* There was no record of inventory present on "unweaned" puppies born at the facility. No inventory information
was attached to two enclosures containing nine "unweaned" puppies. If any puppy born on the premise has been
recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the enclosure must have the following information attached to it:
dealer's USDA license number, the letters (cid:28) USDA (cid:28) and the number identifying each puppy in that litter. If no
offspring have been recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the following information must be recorded and
attached to the enclosure. The dealer's USDA number, the number identifying each puppy, the date of birth of the
litter, the dam's ID number, a description of each puppy ( breed, sex, color and any distinctive markings ). The
inventory information records must be maintained with all corresponding 7006's for one year. If the licensee
chooses to identify the "unweaned" puppies with official USDA identification ( collar, tattoo or microchip ), then no
inventory information is required on the enclosure. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure that
every puppy's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The licensee must
maintain complete and accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility. Correct by 2/13/15.
3.11(a)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Two primary enclosures have an excessive accumulation of excreta on 20 to 30 percent of the vinyl coated
expanded flooring. Five dogs are in contact with the affected surface area which is located on the outside runs that
are attached to shelter housing. This indicates unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease
or health risks. The potential for soiling or caking of the hair coat exists when the dogs have to walk or rest on the
affected surface area. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are cleaned on a daily basis. Correct by 1/14/15.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Dust was accumulating on an estimated eight different plastic containers located in the west indoor building. The
containers are being stored beside the sink area. Unsanitary living conditions are created if the building is not kept
clean and this could lead to health issues for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all buildings and surrounding
grounds are kept clean to facilitate required husbandry practices. Correct by 1/27/15.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 1/13/15 were conducted with the licensee.
