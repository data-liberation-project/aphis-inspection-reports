INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.31 c 7
At the time of inspection rabbit protocol 310 was reviewed, which involves an eye study. The protocol for the animal
does not indicate how the animals will be monitored during the procedure. a review of the records for the animals
shows some animals are monitored for heart rate and pulse while others are not monitored at all.
The investigator needs to submit an amendment to the IACUC to indicate how the animals are to be monitored and
insure with the IACUC and vet staff those procedures are followed during the procedure.
