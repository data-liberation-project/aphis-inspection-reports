ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1620 on
28-Dec-16. I went to the location in Forest Lake, MN and knocked on the door of the main building. No one
answered. I went back to the car and honked on the horn. I tried to contact staff members at Wildlife Science
Center by calling three different phone numbers. I left messages and waited 30 minutes before leaving. I then went
to the location in Stacy, MN. I drove up to the gate that leads to the back of the property. I didn't see anyone. I
called a couple of the phone numbers again and was still unable to reach anyone. I then left.
End of report.
