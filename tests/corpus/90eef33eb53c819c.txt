FEEDING.
In the container where the open bags of food are kept, there is a large amount of spilled food gathered at the
bottom. On top of the layer of spilled food are pockets of mold covering approximately 1/3 of the bottom of the
container. The bags being stored in this container are wide open and do not have any other method of being kept
free of contamination from the mold. Moldy or otherwise contaminated food poses a risk of illness to the dogs that
are being fed that food, or may be unpalatable so the dogs will not be willing to eat it. Correct by ensuring food is
stored and maintained to be uncontaminated, wholesome, and palatable.
