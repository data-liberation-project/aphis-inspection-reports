Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The current program of veterinary care (PVC) created by the attending veterinarian is inadequate.

The PVC states that the “Licensee may perform humane termination if recommended by licensee” and “Worming
products, vaccines, antibiotics, and other indicated medication may be purchased through Angel Veterinary Clinic as
needed. and it allows the licensee to pick up “worming products, vaccines, antibiotics, and other indicated medications as
needed from the veterinarian” Allowing the licensee to determine when an animal should be euthanized or what
medications may be needed are not considered adequate veterinary care.

Failure to establish, maintain and follow a written program of veterinary care can decrease the ability to ensure optimal
care of all the animals. Each dealer and exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to
ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
In addition, an adequate program of veterinary care must be established, maintained and followed, so that the licensee
has a plan for providing adequate preventative care and treatments as necessary.

The following animals continue to suffer from poor body condition and/or poor hair coat and/or an undiagnosed/untreated
medical condition:
• White-tailed deer: One female remains thin with an unthrifty hair coat and prominent ribs, vertebrae and hips with little
muscle covering the hindquarters.
• White-tailed deer: One male remains thin with limited muscle over the ribs, vertebrae, hips and hindquarters.
• Addax: There are approximately six addax in the “back” pen and one addax in the “front” pen that remain thin with
prominent ribs and hips, with decreased muscle covering the hindquarters. Eight Addax are suspected to be pregnant.
• Hog Deer: There are two hog deer that appear thin with prominent spines and sunken flanks and long bones are visible.
One of these animals appears to be pregnant.
• There is one adult (sex unknown) muntjac that appears thin and unkempt with a dull haircoat. The vertebrae and hip
bones are prominent and the ribs are visible.
• The female ibex with a left forelimb lameness continues to be lame. No further diagnostics were performed to determine
the actual cause and no treatments are planned by the veterinarian as of the date of this report.
• There is a female spider monkey that appears thin (prominent vertebrae) with a dull and unthrifty hair coat,
Minimal diagnostics have been employed to determine the exact cause of the problems in the above animals and there
has been insufficient response to the treatments provided thus far. Without proper diagnostics and treatment based on the
results of the diagnostics, the condition of the animals may not improve or could worsen, especially in light of upcoming


colder environmental temperatures. The attending veterinarian needs to consult with a veterinarian experienced with
these species to determine an adequate diagnostic and treatment plan.

Sheltered housing facilities.
At the time of this inspection it was 49F in the area where the food bowls are located in the sheltered portion of the gibbon
enclosure. The outdoor temperature, according to the National Weather Service, at the same time period (~12pm) was


46F in Odessa, TX.
The National Weather Service projects the overnight low to be 32F in the Midland/Odessa, TX area and below 45F from
10:00 p.m. until 10:00 a.m. the following morning. Therefore it can be assumed the temperatures within the indoor portion
of the gibbon enclosures will fall below 45F overnight.
The sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities must be sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to protect the
nonhuman primates from temperature extremes, and to provide for the health and well-being. The licensee must ensure
the ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the gibbon facility does not fall below 45F for more than four consecutive
hours when nonhuman primates are present.

3.77(b) Direct

Sheltered housing facilities.
There is a kerosene/diesel-powered heater in the sheltered portion of the spider monkey enclosure that is emitting
noxious exhaust that is not adequately ventilated to the outside of the building. The smell was immediately evident,
strong and irritating to mucous membranes and eyes of the inspectors.
Exhaust fumes can be irritating or deadly, causing respiratory and other illnesses. The sheltered portions of animal
facilities must be sufficiently ventilated at all times to provide for the health and well-being of the nonhuman primates and
to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation. Ventilation must be provided by windows, doors,
vents, fans or air conditioning.
TO BE CORRECTED BY DECEMBER 8, 2021.
3.80(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.


On the outside of the middle enclosure housing one, male white-handed (lar) gibbon, there is a metal electrical box with a
rheostat and electrical wires protruding from it, fastened directly to the cage with zip ties. Some of the wires are on the
outside of the enclosure, but some wires are inside the enclosure and accessible to the animal. This poses a risk for
injury or death due to electric shock. Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be constructed and maintained so
that they protect the non-human primates from injury.
TO BE CORRECTED BY DECEMBER 8, 2021.
3.81 Repeat

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The current written plan for environmental enhancement for the two spider monkeys and three white-handed (lar) gibbons
is not adequate.
• It does not address social grouping for each species. The 3 adult gibbons are housed singly in adjacent but separate
enclosures. The enclosures are covered with a corrugated plastic that allows light but does not allow the animals to
adequately see or hear a conspecific which is a requirement if the animals are not housed together.
• There is limited environmental enrichment within the enclosures. There are limited items for climbing and swinging, but
none to facilitate true brachiation or cognitive/sensory enrichment. In addition, the licensee states the animals do not use
the “toys” or items provided for climbing and swinging, therefore she does not experiment with different types of
enrichment.
Environmental enhancement is important to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates, and it is
important that the enrichment provided varies so that the animals can have novel experiences to keep them engaged. A
plan for environmental enhancement that provides novel and engaging activity must be developed and followed for each
nonhuman primate at the facility. This plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards and
approved by the attending veterinarian.


3.84(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The 2 spider monkey and 3 white-handed (lar) gibbon enclosures have an excessive accumulation of bird feces on all
horizontal surfaces. There were bird nests along the ceiling of the outdoor spider monkey enclosure.
Accumulation of fecal material, food waste and other debris encourages soiling of the animals and contamination of food.
Routine cleaning and sanitation must be done daily to protect the health and well-being of nonhuman primates. The
licensee’s log reflects that cleaning is not done on a daily basis. Fecal material, food waste, and other debris must be
removed daily to prevent contamination of food, prevent nonhuman primates from becoming soiled and to reduce disease
hazards.
3.85 Critical Repeat

Employees.
The licensees state that they and their employees do what they can to provide adequate cleaning, feeding, general
husbandry and facility maintenance for all of the non-human primates. Despite this, adequate cleaning, feeding, general
husbandry, environmental enhancement, and facility maintenance for all of the non-human primates and other animals
remains insufficient. This is evident throughout the facility as noted in the non-compliances cited throughout this report.
Without an adequate labor force, animals and facilities cannot be properly managed and cared for, leading to
circumstances that compromise the health and well-being of the animals. Every person subject to the Animal Welfare
regulations maintaining non-human primates must have enough employees to carry out the required level of husbandry
practices and care.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.


• The “front” addax enclosure housing three addax and the enclosure housing two adult, male white-tailed deer, have
shelters with rusted metal panels and jagged edges that the animals could come into contact with.
• The wooden shelter door in the muntjac enclosure is broken in many places, sagging on its hinges and not kept in good
repair.
• The section of fencing behind the water troughs in the muntjac enclosure is in poor condition. The wood is broken and
splintered in multiple places, forming large holes. The fence is made of rotting plywood that is coming apart.
• There are multiple areas where the fencing has not been maintained and in good repair. There are areas in which large
round bales have, over time, forced the bottoms of the fences outward.
• There is a long section of fence (approximately 20 feet), extending along the sections of enclosures containing domestic
goats and white-tailed deer, that has large gaps and holes, through which animals were seen passing, and that could
injure the animals.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, and gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the
animals. A system of monitoring and maintenance should be in place so that all housing facilities remain structurally
sound and in good repair.
3.125(c) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Under the haybarn where hay and feed is stored for all hoofstock on premises, there are open bags of chicken feed and
bags of grain covered in dirt and cobwebs. There were bags of dewormer pellets lying directly on the ground. There are
bird feathers, bird droppings and other animal droppings accumulated on the dirt floor and on top of bags of food. Junk
and other materials are also stored in the haybarn among the food. Opened bags of feed can attract pests and vermin.
Food must be protected from contamination and spoilage. Fecal material on and around the hay and feed can cause


contamination and disease. Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such
supplies against deterioration, molding or contamination by vermin.
3.127 Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
***There is no shade or shelter in a pen enclosure containing one adult domestic pig and an enclosure containing one
pregnant, adult female camel. These animals have no means to escape the direct sunlight or adverse climatic conditions.
***There is poor drainage in the pig enclosure; at least 75% of the enclosure is covered in several inches of standing
water, leaving very little dry space for the animal to lie down. The animal must walk through and stand in the water to
drink and access food.
***There is no true perimeter fence surrounding the facility because the tall fence that is adjacent to the street is actually
the primary enclosure fence for hoofstock pens.
Adequate and suitable shelter is a basic necessity and failure to provide it can lead to stress/distress, or illness. The
inadequate drainage is resulting in uncomfortable conditions for the pig and can lead to contamination of food and
disease. Lack of a perimeter fence does not allow for secondary containment in the case of escape, allows other animals
and the public easy access to the hoofstock and can result in harm to these animals or humans. Sufficient shade by
natural or artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight,
and natural or artificial shelter appropriate for the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for
all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals. A suitable method shall be
provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The method of drainage shall comply with applicable Federal, State and local
laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the environment.
3.130 Repeat

Watering.


At the time of the inspection, the water receptacle in the enclosure containing one male bobcat contains water that is
brown and cloudy with what appears to be fecal material dissolved within the water. Thet bobcat water does not appear
to have been cleaned recently.
Unpotable water can be unpalatable and result in dehydration and disease. If potable water is not accessible to the
animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. All water
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
There are multiple enclosures that have mounds of decaying hay and/or excessive fecal accumulations that cover the
majority of the areas, including where the feed is placed. These include the enclosures containing six addax (the “back”
addax pen), one camel, eight ibex and seven muntjac. The licensee stated previously they never enter the pens to clean
them. Fecal accumulation attracts pests and increases the likelihood of disease for the animals. Excreta must be removed
as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and reduce hazards and odors.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
There are numerous piles of debris, rubble, junk and items unrelated to the husbandry needs of the animals accumulated
throughout the facility grounds. Piles of debris such as this harbor insects and vermin that could injure the animals or
cause disease. Accumulation of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health
of the animals.
In the pens containing one camel, eight ibex, 24 hog deer, and in the “front” addax pen containing six Addax, there are
piles of twine on the ground and twine around the bale of hay in the pen where animals were actively eating. This material
poses a risk of illness due to ingestion or injury due to entrapment.


Premises shall be kept clean, free of trash accumulation, and in good repair in order to protect animals from injury and
illness and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in the regulations. Accumulation of trash shall be
placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
3.132 Direct Repeat

Employees.
The licensees state that they and their employees do what they can to provide adequate cleaning, feeding, general
husbandry and facility maintenance for all of the animals. Despite this, adequate cleaning, feeding, general husbandry,
environmental enhancement, and facility maintenance for the animals remains insufficient. Without an adequate labor
force, animals and facilities cannot be properly managed and cared for, leading to circumstances that compromise the
health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must ensure that there is a sufficient number of adequately trained
employees to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices as set forth in the regulations.
