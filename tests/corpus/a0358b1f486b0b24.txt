HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The concrete block walls in the two interior lemur holding enclosures have areas of peeling paint and unsealed
concrete block approximately 6" to 24" above the floor around the perimeter of each enclosure. The peeling paint
could potentially be ingested by the three lemurs housed in these two interior primate holding enclosures. All
surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis to protect the health and well-being of all animals housed within
each enclosure. To be corrected by: May 22, 2015.
