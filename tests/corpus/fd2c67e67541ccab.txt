SEPARATION.
A meerkat died due to injuries sustained by the other animals in the enclosure. This was after an introduction; the
male was seen favoring his right front leg and hiding behind the rocks for two days. Signs of incompatibility were
documented in the records. When the animal was physically examined by the vet on the third day it was noted as
weak and shaky. The concern is that the animal was showing signs of injury and was being chased when it
ventured out, and additional wounds could have been potentially avoided had the animal been separated sooner. In
addition to following animal care manual guidance for introducing meerkats, an SOP should be developed and in
place when animals sustain injuries during introductions to help guide this process.
