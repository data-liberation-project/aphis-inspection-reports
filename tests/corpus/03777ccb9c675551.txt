2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no written Program of Veterinary Care available for review at the time of the inspection. The written
Program of Veterinary Care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending
veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. It outlines preventive veterinary care practices,
such as deworming and vaccinations.
The facility must ensure that the written program of veterinary care is available for review during all USDA
inspections.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were no acquisition records nor disposition records for review at the time of inspection. The licensee was
unable to provide an inventory list for the regulated animals at his facility. Acquisition and disposition records are
necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their legal acquisition,
proper care, and humane transportation.
The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession
or under his or control.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wires holding the metal gate and plastic panel together in the reindeer enclosure have several sharp points that
stick out and could lead to injury. There were six reindeer in the enclosure at the time of inspection that have thepotential to come into contact with the sharp points.
The metal siding along a wooden pillar in the reindeer enclosure had become loose, creating a gap between the
metal and wood, and exposing a sharp edge of metal. This poses a risk of injury to the reindeer, as they have the
potential to come into contact with this sharp edge.
The primary enclosure containing six goats, five sheep, two alpacas, and two llamas is enclosed by metal wire
fencing. In one corner of the enclosure, the wire had become loose, creating a large gap in which an animal could
become entrapped or injured. The licensee corrected this problem in the goat enclosure during the inspection.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury and to contain them. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and
maintenance must be in place.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The plastic panel attached to the metal gate in the reindeer enclosure was in disrepair. Numerous bits of plastic
were missing from the panel itself and were on the ground within the enclosure. These plastic pieces pose a risk of
injury to the reindeer due to possible ingestion and intestinal obstruction.
Underneath a shelter in the goat/sheep/llama/alpaca enclosure, there was a bundle of metal wire amidst the straw
on the ground. The metal poses a risk of injury to the animals within the enclosure due to possible ingestion and
intestinal obstruction.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with licensee, ACI Cindy Rhodes, and VMO Dominique Engel.
