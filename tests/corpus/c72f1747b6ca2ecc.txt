INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The last three Institutional Official (IO) reports, dated January 2017, September 2016, and April 2016, are
incomplete. Program and facility deficiencies were identified and included on the reports, but the deficiencies were
not designated as significant or minor. It is important significant deficiencies are recognized, discussed, and
addressed in a timely manner to maintain optimal animal welfare. The reports must distinguish significant
deficiencies from minor deficiencies.
Correct by: From This Day Forward. The template for recording deficiencies on the IO reports was corrected at the
time of inspection to include a S/M designation space
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol for the use of bats in teaching and outreach lacks detail. Language describing exactly how the animals
are used is missing. Teaching and outreach are broad terms which include a wide variety of potential uses. The
processes and procedures the bats undergo must be described so accurate welfare assessments can be made. A
proposal to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity involving
animals, must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.

2.33(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The euthanasia method described in the written program of veterinary care (PVC) is not consistent with the method
included in the bat teaching and outreach protocol. Euthanasia methods performed by staff must concur with
veterinary recommendations. Animals may experience undue stress if veterinary procedures are not followed
exactly. Each research facility shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Correct by: April 1, 2017
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director of Research Integrity and other facility
