INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of the 2014 and 2015 (through March) IACUC meeting minutes show that the non-affiliated/community
member has missed a substantial number of meetings. Between Jan. 2014 and Mar. 2015 the non-affiliated
member only attended two of seven IACUC meetings. The non-affiliated member is one of three required members
of the IACUC and is a pivotal member as this person represents the general community interests in the proper care
and treatment of animals. The required members, including the non-affiliated member, should be in attendance at
most meetings to ensure that the IACUC is fully constituted. Correct by August 1, 2015.
2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
*Protocol 130123-05-03-C involves teaching radiology procedures to vet tech students. The protocol is approved for
the use of dogs. The protocol was listed on the cage cards for five cats housed at the facility. Records show that at
least one of the cats was used on the protocol.
*Protocol 130311-01-05-D involves ovariohysterectomy and castration procedures in dogs and cats. The protocol as
approved lists two surgeons approved to conduct the procedures. During the inspection it was observed the
surgeon performing the procedures was not one of the two approved on the protocol.
Neither protocol was modified and reviewed by the IACUC to reflect the significant changes in ongoing activities.
Significant changes must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC before being instituted to ensure appropriate
oversight of the animal use. Correct prior to any additional use of animals on the protocols.
2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol SOP 15021101 involves dental procedures performed on animals (dogs and cats). This is a teaching
protocol as one goal stated is (cid:28)to provide students with the opportunity to practice and perfect dental techniques(cid:29).
The listed drugs to be used include pain medications. The listed medical needs to be addressed include the
potentially painful ones of dental abscesses, loose teeth, retained deciduous teeth and fractured teeth. The protocol
lacks a written narrative description of the methods and resources used to determine that alternatives to thepotentially painful procedures were not available. The IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has
considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals
and has provided a written narrative of methods and resources used prior to approving animal use. Correct by
August 1, 2015.
2.36(b)(8)
ANNUAL REPORT.
Acquisition records (form 7019) showed that two cattle were acquired by the facility on 4/7/14 and an additional ten
cattle were acquired on 4/12/14. The cattle were being held for use in teaching protocols starting in October 2014.
The Fiscal Year 2014 Annual Report reviewed does not include the species cattle or the number of cattle obtained
in FY 2014. Properly identifying species and numbers of animals held and/or used for teaching, testing,
experiments, research or surgery is necessary to inform the Institutional Official and USDA Animal Care of the
scope of animal use at the facility. The FY 2014 annual report needs to be amended and resubmitted to the
Regional Office with all animal data included. Correct by June 1, 2015.
3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The walls in the two rooms at SCHS one housing dogs and one housing cats are not impervious to moisture.
Surfaces must be impervious to allow adequate cleaning and sanitization. All floors and walls of indoor housing
facilities must be impervious to moisture. Correct by August 1, 2015.
3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During both days of the inspection dog #610 was being housed in a cage in SCHS instead of in the PACF kennel
building. The cage did not provide enough floor space. The dog measures 26 inches from nose to tail and thus
requires 1024 sq. in. of floor space. The cage measures 27in.x28in. supplying only 756 sq. in. of floor space.
Adequate floor space is necessary to provide sufficient space to allow the dog to express species typical behaviors
including sitting and lying in a comfortable position and walking in a normal manner. Each dog housed in a primary
enclosure must be provided with at least the minimum required floor space. Correct by May 4, 2015.
3.6(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.During both days of the inspection dog #583 was being housed in a cage in the SCHS instead of the PACF kennel.
There is less than four inches of space between the top of the dog's head and the top of the cage when the dog is
standing in a normal position. The interior height of a primary enclosure must be at least 6 inches higher than the
head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position to provide adequate vertical space.
Correct by May 4, 2015.
3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The facility is currently not following its documented Canine Exercise Policy. Two dogs, #610 and #583, are
individually housed in enclosures at SCHS that provide less than two times the required floor space for the dog
necessitating that they receive opportunity for exercise. Review of the LMU Canine Exercise Policy states that dogs
housed in SCHS must receive additional opportunities above the required leash walking or play yard time of at least
3 times each day for dogs housed in the PACF. Review of the dogs(cid:25) records show notations that the dogs are being
leash walked or allowed to play at least once daily but there are many days with less than three or more (at SCHS)
documented exercise opportunities. Adequate exercise is necessary to ensure opportunity for movement and
enrichment of dogs kept in enclosures that do not provide enough space to provide the opportunity. The facility shall
document and follow the facility approved plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. Correct from this
day forward.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The door to the PACF building closest to the PACF kennel has a gap between the door and the frame (along the
long side of the door) extending up about 18 inches from the ground with sunlight visible through the gap. It appears
that a weatherstrip/sweep added to the bottom of the door is too long and is interfering with the door closing
completely. Insects and other vermin can gain entrance to the building through such a gap. Premises, including
building doors, must be kept in good repair to facilitate husbandry practices. Correct by May 15, 2015.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The BTC has a crack in the concrete floor extending across the building from west to east that needs to be repaired.
The IACUC conducted a semi-annual inspection on Dec. 29, 2014 and identified the crack at that time noting that
the crack (cid:28)is allowing bugs to enter (insects directly observed)(cid:29). The semi-annual noted a correction/reinspection
date of 3/6/15. The IACUC reinspected the BTC on 3/15/15 and found that no repairs had been made. All buildings
including BTC need to be kept in good repair to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Correct by August 1,
2015. Exit conducted with undersigned IACUC chair.
