FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Hay storage structure: There were several, loose piles of old, unused wooden pallets mixed with several, large to
very small pieces of yellow, foam-type material stored next to the openings of the hay/straw storage structure.
Several of the largest blocks of foam material are also being stored directly along the sides of this canvas-covered
structure. The placement of these items or materials next to stored, animal food supplies may allow the harborage
of vermin or pests which may contaminate the food supplies. Additionally, the wind has blown several of the
smaller pieces of foam from the piles into the inside of the structure and next to the hay/straw bales. This poses the
potential risk of the small foam pieces being mixed within the hay and consumed by the animals.
- In a food storage shed adjacent to the Clinic Building there were two open, uncovered bags of animal grain feed.
Open bags of feed may attract vermin or other pests and potentially contaminate the food sources. Also, in one
corner of the ceiling of this shed were loose, torn pieces of fiberglass insulation material located directly above an
open container of straw. Any torn or loose fiberglass material located above animal feed or bedding poses a
potential health risk of this material falling into the bedding or feed and possibly being ingested.
All supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner which adequately protects such supplies against
deterioration, molding or sources of contamination to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. A system
which adequately and safely protects all animal food and bedding supplies must be in place.
