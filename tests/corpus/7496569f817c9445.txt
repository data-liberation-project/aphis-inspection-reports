CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, the following animal had recently arrived at the Air France cargo office:
A dog on waybill number 057-8570-2724, arriving on Air France flight 84.
The dog did not have a shipper's certification regarding the last time food and water had been offered, and what
feeding and watering instructions were to be during transport, attached to the crate.
At the time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment the carrier must ensure that the consignor provides certification in
writing regarding feeding and watering instructions, and the last time food and water was offered. Failure to provide
this information could put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed on the carrier, during
transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order to help ensure that
animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
At the time of inspection, the following animal had recently arrived at the Air France cargo office:
A dog on waybill number 057-8570-2724, arriving on Air France flight 84.
The crate had only one receptacle suitable for food or water: a plastic receptacle that had apparently come loose
from the crate door, and was on the floor. It was not easily accessible for providing food or water to the animal.
Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the
receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door. Failure to provide a food and a water
receptacle could result in inadequate feeding and/or watering, which could be detrimental to the animal.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with representatives for the carrier at the cargo office.
