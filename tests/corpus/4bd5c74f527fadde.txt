FACILITIES, INDOOR.
At least one rabbit enclosure is moderately covered in rust. The presence of rust may prevent the required cleaning
and sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the
animals.
The facility is currently replacing rabbit primary enclosures, food receptacles, wood beams, and other structures. It
was noted that one barn has been completed and a second barn had one row of enclosures replaced.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are
substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.
