Outdoor housing facilities.
The shelters provided were not large enough for all dogs to sit, stand and lie in a normal manner. In two enclosures the
one dog in the enclosure was taller and longer than the shelter provided and therefore the dog could not sit, stand and lie
in a normal manner. In one enclosure the two dogs could not both occupy the shelter at the same time and be able to sit,
stand and lie in a normal manner.

The avaliablity of an appropiate shelter is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.

The licensse must provide an appropriate shelter for all dogs. One that allows each animal to sit, stand and lie in a normal
manner and provide adequate shelter from the elements.

Watering


In one enclosure no potable water was avaliable. There were two dogs in an enclosue with one water bucket that was
about 10 inches deep. The bucket contained about 1 inch of a dark brown liquid that appeared to be muddy water.

Access to clean potable water is essential to the health and well being of the dogs.

The licensse must provide clean potable to the dogs on a continuously basis.

The issue was corrected during the inspection.

Veterinary care for dogs.
Program of Veterinary Care presented at time of inspection did not mention that sampling and treatment of parasites
(including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia and heartworm) would be done nor did it include a schedule for the sampling.
The Program of Veterinary Care did not mention any schedule of when preventative care and treatment (including eyes,
ears, skin, teeth, hair coat and nails) would occur.

An appropriate Program of Veterinary Care must include scheduled sampling for parasites and scheduled preventative
care to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that includes a plan for the routine sampling
of heartworm, intestinal parasites and ectoparasites. It must also include a schedule for preventative care. The licensee
must add to have the dogs sampled for parasites with a schedule and a schedule for preventative care to the Program of
Veterinary Care for Dogs.

well-being of the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs and keep copies of medical records. These
medical records must be available for APHIS inspection. The licensee must vaccinate all adult dogs for parvovirus and
