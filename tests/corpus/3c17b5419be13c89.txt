2.4(d)
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
During the exit interview on June 9th, 2014, the facility representative showed the USDA inspector photos he stated
the facility had taken of the animals found in need of veterinary care during this inspection on June 4th, 2014. He
said he wanted them signed and dated by the USDA inspector. He said he needed them signed and dated because
"you people lie and we need this to show the judge how incompetent you are." The USDA inspector stated he
would not sign the photos.
It was discovered during this exit interview that a non-compliant item listed under Section 3.129 was spilled duck
feed (present in the kangaroo enclosure for the co-housed ducks) rather than spilled kangaroo feed. In order to
ensure the report was accurate, the USDA inspector stated he would remove the citation. The facility
representative then said he was going to keep the draft report with the error and wanted a new one created. The
USDA inspector explained that the correction would mean the original was not a final report and that the draft was
only used for review and to ensure it was correct. He then said he wanted to keep the draft report and would not
return it. He said he wanted this to show the judge all the mistakes that the USDA makes. The USDA inspector
then printed the corrected copy of the inspection report, completed the review of the report with the facility
representative, and asked if the facility representative would sign it. The facility representative then said (cid:28)I will sign
it if you man up and sign the photos I want signed." The USDA inspector stated that he would only sign the
inspection report. The facility representative left the room and said he needed to talk to the licensee. He returned
in approximately 10 minutes and said they were keeping the original report and if the USDA inspector refused the
sign the photos he was going to get a video camera to record a statement from the USDA inspector stating why he
would not sign the photos. At that time, the USDA inspector advised the facility representative that the exit interview
was over and that the inspection report would be delivered by certified mail. The USDA inspector also explained to
the facility representative that a citation under Section 2.4 would be added to this report for interference of the
inspection process. He then said, "Fine. Put it on there. Just be sure you say what happened."
A licensee or representative shall not interfere with any APHIS official in the course of carrying out his or her duties.
The facility representative(cid:25)s actions during this exit interview interfered with the completion of the inspection process
and made it impossible to ensure a correct copy of the facility inspection report was delivered during the exit
interview. His comment about using the draft report and photos to show the incompetence of the USDA inspectorsin court was an attempt to intimidate the USDA inspector and therefore interfered with the inspection process. The
inspection process requires a working relationship between the USDA and the facility and interference makes this
process difficult to impossible.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**DIRECT: Two Pygmy goats were found in the walkthrough area with eye problems. The older male goat has a
cloudy right eye that is completely opaque white with red around the edges of the globe. There is also drainage
from this eye that is clear to white in appearance. A second goat in the same enclosure has a milder diffuse white
cloudiness to its left eye. This goat(cid:25)s eye also has a clear drainage from the medial portion of the eye. Ocular
conditions are painful and these eye conditions left untreated can lead to worsening of the condition and loss of
vision as well as unnecessary pain and suffering in the animals. Both of these goats require veterinary attention to
determine the cause of and recommended treatment of these eye problems. Correct this by having these animals
examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than June 6, 2014 and following all treatment recommendations.
Documentation of this examination and treatments must be maintained for future examination by APHIS officials.
Two black faced white Suffolk-type Sheep (#305 and #310) have overgrown front feet. These sheep were housed
in the production barn. Both of these sheep have front feet that are overgrown to the point that the claws are
beginning to cross. These animals require trimming to ensure they can maintain normal gait and reduce the
potential for foot and joint problems. Correct by ensuring that these animals have routine foot care (such as
trimming) provided no later than June 11, 2014 and farther, by ensuring that all routine husbandry and veterinary
procedures are provided in the future.
One black faced white Suffolk-type Lamb (#160) housed in the production barn has a swollen red mass between the
digits of the front left foot. This mass is bright red and is moist in appearance. This sheep is currently walking
normally and does not appear lame at this time. This type of lesion can result from both infectious and
non-infectious causes, which left untreated, can worsen resulting in lameness or fly-strike of the affected area.
Veterinary examination is necessary to determine the proper course of treatment. Correct this by having this animal
examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than June 10, 2014 and following all treatment recommendations.
Documentation of this examination and treatments must be maintained for future examination by APHIS officials.
One female elk in the drive through area is thin in appearance. This animal(cid:25)s spine and ribs are very evident even
when viewed from a distance. Weight loss and poor body condition can indicate the presence of many underlying
medical conditions including dental problems, heavy parasitism, and numerous other infectious and non-infectious
causes. Veterinary examination and diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the cause of this condition and
prevent farther weight loss. Correct this by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian no later thanJune 10, 2014 and following all diagnostic testing and treatment recommendations. Documentation of this
examination, testing, and treatments must be maintained for future examination by APHIS officials.
Fallow deer #0895 was found in the drive through area limping on the left front foot. The facility representative
stated during the inspection that this animal was previously removed from the drive through area to be treated for
foot rot. The facility representative reported that the animal was returned to the drive through following treatment
and was doing better. He stated there is no documentation of this problem or the care the animal received.
Limping is a common sign of pain. Veterinary examination is necessary to determine the proper course of
treatment. Additionally, accurate health records are necessary to convey information to all people involved in an
animal(cid:25)s care and to demonstrate the delivery of adequate health care. Failure to maintain health records can result
in misdiagnosis / mistreatment and delay the provision of proper care. Correct this by having this animal examined
by a licensed veterinarian no later than June 10, 2014 and following all treatment recommendations.
Documentation of this examination and treatments must be maintained for future examination by APHIS officials.
Additionally, ensure that all accurate records are maintained for all animals receiving veterinary care / treatment by
facility personnel.

Note: During the exit interview on June 9th, the facility representative provided documentation stating that the
attending veterinarian examined the 2 pygmy goats, the elk, Suffolk Sheep #160, and fallow deer #0895 on June
5th, 2014.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing various species of
animals. This includes 2 camels, 9 jersey cows, 47 sheep, 26 goats, 2 African porcupines, and 3 kangaroos. There
are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guest are encouraged to feed food sold at the
entry gate. There is no attendant present during this public contact and guests were observed during this inspection
walking directly up to goat enclosures and petting the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with
spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. This unattended public contact
continues to be a problem at this facility and does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Barriers or
sufficient distance must be provided to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Guests are still allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendant is present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: deer,
antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry
gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding and during this inspection
USDA inspectors were offered feed when advising a staff member that they were going to inspect the drive thru
area. This facility also has horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows public feeding with an attendant
present. Allowing guests to feed from vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the
public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public contact.

FEEDING.
Two baboons have access to plants outside of their enclosure. Multiple species of decorative landscaping plants
are planted close to the baboon primary enclosure and the holes in the enclosure are large enough to reach through
in order to access the plants. The male baboon was observed reaching out of the enclosure fence and pulling off a
piece of a plant commonly called Bleeding Heart. This baboon was then observed eating it this plant material.
Bleeding heart plants are considered toxic to humans as well as multiple animal species. Ingestion of these plants
can cause vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, seizures, and death depending on the amount ingested. While majority of
the diet appears to be comprised of appropriate food, all food provided to nonhuman primates must be appropriate
for the species, of sufficient nutritive value to maintain animals in a healthful condition, and fed in according to
accepted professional husbandry practices and nutritional standards. Husbandry practices which allow the
ingestion of toxic plants are not appropriate and place the animals(cid:25) health at risk. The licensee must ensure that
animals are only permitted to eat foods which are appropriate for the species. Correct by preventing them from
eating toxic plants that may surround the enclosure.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One pygmy goat was found roaming freely between the production sheep barn and the pygmy goat enclosure. Closer inspection of the pygmy goat enclosure showed that there is a small wooden piece of fencing attached to the
primary enclosure fence. This wooden piece freely swings out from the bottom and allows the animal to get out.
One adult Boer pushed its stall door open in the barn near the pygmy goats. This animal was able to get out of its
enclosure and was seen walking freely near guests in the facility. The enclosure door appeared to be structurally
sound during the inspection but may have been left unlatched. Animals that are not properly secured may easily
become injured or be predated upon. Both of these animals were returned to the enclosures during the inspection.
Licensee must ensure all animals are housed in enclosures that properly contain them.
A leg hold spring trap was found in the kangaroo exhibit hanging near the foot bridge. The facility representative
stated that it is there to trap muskrat. This trap is a potential injury hazard to the kangaroos and must be moved to
ensure the kangaroos are not caught by this trap. Correct this by moving this trap away from access by the
kangaroos and ensuring that items that can potentially injure animals are not left inside primary enclosures.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The large mound of animal waste and spent bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals were
observed walking and grazing in this mound during this inspection. There are no barriers preventing the animals in
this area from walking through, lying in, or eating from this waste mound. This exposes the animals to disease
hazards and continued to be a problem at this facility. The licensee must provide a means to remove this debris or
prevent the animals from accessing this area.

WATERING.
This facility still has no potable water for the animals in the drive through area. The only water sources for these
animals are the ponds in the area. These ponds are murky and have algae and vegetative growth throughout them.
Failure to provide a clean potable water source for the animals exposes them to disease risks and can lead to
animal suffering. Correct this by providing these animals potable water.
