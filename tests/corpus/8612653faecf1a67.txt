ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Male Yorkie #108 has signs consistent with advanced dental disease. The gums of all front incisors and canine
teeth are receded and several front teeth are loose. This dog was seen at the attending veterinarian for a dental
cleaning in October 2013. This dog needs additional attention to ensure this problem is properly managed. The
licensee must have the attending veterinarian examined this dog to determine any recommended treatment or care
needed. Documentation of this exam and treatment must be maintained for future review by APHIS officials.
**An approximately one year old Maltese male (no ID) was found with a skin problem. There is an area if skin that
is reddened (approx. 2 inches in diameter) and a scab (approx. 0.5 inches in diameter) near midline of the back just
below the shoulder blades. The hair in that area is also discolored to an orange tint. The licensee had this dog
examined on 5-13-14 and the veterinarian dispensed shampoo for use. The licensee also stated during the exit
interview by phone that this dog was seen crawling through a small opening in the wire cages used for weaning and
believes the scab may be from the dog scratching its back on the cage. This dog requires examination by the
attending veterinarian to determine recommended treatment and care. Documentation of this exam and treatment
must be maintained for future review by APHIS officials.
Failure to provide prompt treatment and care to the animals in the facility can result in pain and suffering in the
