***The outdoor shelter for the dog is made of wood that has not been sealed and is not impervious to moisture.
There is a nail protruding at the bottom right corner of the front of the dog house that needs to be removed and the
wooden “porch” for the dog is in disrepair and must be replaced.
These surfaces must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the dog and to facilitate cleaning.

***Currently the guinea pigs are housed in an outdoor building with a permanently open window and fan for air flow.
There is no air conditioning for the building to regulate temperatures and maintain the area under 85F per section
3.26 (a). There is no thermometer within the enclosure to monitor ambient temperatures.
Guinea pigs may not be housed in outdoor facilities unless prior approval is obtained by the Deputy Administrator.
This housing situation needs to be addressed for the health of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***In the building housing the guinea pigs there are sections of unsealed wood around the window ledge. There is
an unsealed wooden shelf on the ground that the guinea pigs have access to.
Shelving and accessories must be constructed of smooth materials that are impervious to liquids. These unsealed
areas need to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of the building for the health of the animals. To be corrected by: August 28, 2017

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The diet prep kitchen for primates in the emerald forest building needs to be addressed. A few of the cutting
boards are excessively worn and discolored and can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. In addition, the
knife sharpener used to sharpen knives is rusted which can then contaminate the tools used for cutting produce and
preparing diets.
Instruments used to prepare food must be maintained in such a condition that they can be cleaned and sanitized
properly. There is a potential for food to become contaminated due to insanitary food preparation which can lead to
animal illness. These instruments must be brought back into sanitary condition or removed from the area.
***The nutrition center’s walk-in freezer has a section of metal floor that is coming up off the wood base of the
cooler. The nutrition center has identified this as a contamination concern, and a work order was entered in on May
22, 2017, however there is no timeline to correct the issue. Refrigeration of perishable items must be stored
accordingly to reduce contamination and deterioration of their nutritive value. The floor condition of this freezer was
noted in the work order to be a “contaminate issue.”
Contaminated food due to an unsanitary food preparation and holding area can cause disease in non-human
primates as well as other species that share food space in the cooler. Therefore, it is important that this flooring be
fixed in a timely manner and the current work order should be upgraded with a date for repair completion.
***Several sections of the floor in the nutrition center are in disrepair, with cuts and deep pits in the surface, making
the floor in these sections unable to be effectively cleaned and sanitized. The floor should be replaced or the
damaged sections patched in order to facilitate proper cleaning and sanitation of the area.

***There are insufficient barriers in front of the howler monkey exhibit in the Tropical Discovery building. The two
howler monkeys have access to the front mesh on the guest side and the barrier around the exhibit does not
prevent public contact with the mesh on the far right and left corners of the barrier. The APHIS inspector was able to
stand off to the right side of the exhibit and grab a hold of the front mesh.
A sufficient barrier must be in place between the primary enclosure and the public at any time the public is present,in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the nonhuman primates.

3.80(a)(2)(ix) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The primary enclosures for the Capuchins, Spider monkeys, and Langurs in the back holding area contain broken
tiles, peeling paint, and rust on shift doorways and ceiling beams. These broken tiles, chipped paint and rusted
areas do not allow the area to be effectively cleaned and sanitized. This area was first identified to be corrected on
APHIS inspection report dated September 30, 2016. Animal Care personnel informed APHIS inspectors that these
repairs had been unable to be addressed due to logistical issues.
In January and February the facility identified new issues that needed repair in these primary enclosures. Both of
these work orders have been downgraded in priority due to the fact that maintenance staff “cannot have access
needed to make the repairs.” According to Animal Care personnel, due to fact that Herpes B has tested positive in
this area, animals are not able to be moved around.
Currently the animal operations department and facility maintenance department have different understandings of
when work orders will be evaluated and fixed based on their 1-5 priority system. This area needs to be addressed
and the above items maintained in good repair to facilitate cleaning and sanitization of this area for the health of the
animals and to reduce the spread of disease hazards.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***There is excessive weed and brush growth in the DeBrazza’s outdoor enclosure.
Daily spot-cleaning of primate enclosures is required. This amount of weed and brush growth prevents the daily
cleaning of this enclosure. Weeds, grass, and bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises
and pest control.

***In hoof stock barn 3, the door in stall 2, containing an eland was rusted, creating metal edges.***In hoofstock barn 2, the entire bottom of the metal divider in the bongo’s stall was rusted out, creating sharp
metal edges. This issue was identified by APHIS to be corrected by April 2017. To date, the metal divider has not
been repaired.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
If in the future the facility is unable to comply by the date of correction listed on the inspection report, the facility
must notify APHIS personnel in writing before the correction date has expired and request an extension.
This inspection was conducted from July 25- July 28 with facility representatives. The exit interview were conducted
with the Vice President of Animal Care and the attending veterinarian on July 28, 2017.
