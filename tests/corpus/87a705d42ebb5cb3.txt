EXERCISE FOR DOGS.

housed in enclosure meeting the minimum standards for exercise, however there was no documentation that had
been reviewed and signed by the attending veterinarian. The written exercise plan must be developed and followed
to ensure the dogs are receiving adequate exercise.
Maintain and be able to provide for review a documented exercise plan explaining how the requirements are being
met for dogs that are individually and group housed at the facility.
