Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The May 2020 semiannual report for site 002 indicated there was a significant deficiency in general facility conditions. A
ceiling tile in the front entry area had a water stain and needed to be replaced. The report noted the deficiency but did not
contain a specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting the deficiency. Additionally, the letter to the Institutional
Official did not mention any significant deficiencies. These aspects of the semiannual report ensure that the committee
informs the Institutional Official of any program deficiencies, identifies facility needs, and, if present, animal welfare
issues, as well as establishing a plan for correction of deficiencies. Animal welfare may negatively be impacted if a plan
for correction of deficiencies is not developed and followed. All semiannual reports must be reviewed and signed by a
majority of the IACUC members, include any minority views, and be submitted to the Institutional Official at least every six
months. These reports must identify and describe departures from the regulations or standards, distinguish significant
from minor deficiencies, and provide a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates correcting each deficiency.

TO BE CORRECTED ON THE NEXT SEMIANNUAL REPORT.
