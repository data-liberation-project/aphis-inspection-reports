2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
During the month of March on a day when the heat index was approximately in excess of 109 degrees according to the
animal director, a portable air conditioning unit inside the rabbit enclosure malfunctioned. During the morning rounds
nothing was noted as wrong and all rabbits within were fine however, four hours later an employee noted the unit was out
and two rabbits had succumbed to the heat. An additional rabbit was in distress and received fluids ultimately recovering.
It is essential that animals have access to adequate temperature and shade that is conducive and appropriate to each
species in order to ensure the health and safety of the animals. Without this, and as observed and noted, animals may
become overheated, stressed, injured or can succumb to the heat and perish. This incident was immediately corrected.
3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
During the month of March, sometime between close of business and morning observation rounds the next morning, a
section of cinder block in the grey fox indoor enclosure broke loose from the wall and impacted with the animal, killing it
instantly. This particular section of wall had previously developed a crack and had been filled in. Immediately after the
incident the entire wall was removed from the enclosure. Enclosures must remain in good repair to protect the animals
within from injury or death. This incident was immediately corrected.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with site caretaker.
