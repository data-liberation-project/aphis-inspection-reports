3.26(b)

Facilities, indoor.
Upon entering Building 1, there was a strong ammonia odor present in the indoor guinea pig housing area. No fans,
vents, or doors were observed to be open to allow proper ventilation of the room. The licensee opened a window and the
ammonia odor dissipated.
Failure to provide fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
