ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0945am on
04/28/2016.
Contact was made with one of the owners, who advised they were just leaving on an errand and would not be
available for an inspection. When asked if there was anyone over 18 available that could conduct the inspection
they advised 'no' there was not. When asked when they would return home they advised not until later in the day,
maybe after 4 pm they did not know for certain.
