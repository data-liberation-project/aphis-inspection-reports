ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care does not contain the frequencies of the vaccinations and internal parasite control.
The Program of Veterinary Care also does not contain the dosages and routes of administration for vaccinations,
ectoparasite control, internal parasite control and euthanasia.
The licensee cannot state with certainty when the animals received the preventative care as outlined in the Program
of Veterinary Care.
Without this information, it is not possible to determine if the regulated mammals are receiving the proper veterinary
care as prescribed by your veterinarian.
Have your veterinarian amend the Program of Veterinary Care to include all of the above information.
