2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medications used to treat the dogs at the facility have gone past their labeled expiration dates. The
recorded expiration date on one 100 ml bottle of Oxytocin was 11/30/15. The recorded expiration date on one 250
ml bottle of Ivermax was 07/2015. These medications are intermingled with other products that are currently being
used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or
sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute
adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are
administrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The expected results cannot
be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain, distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms or
unexpected side effects. Failure to properly label medications or other medical products as being expired and
storing them with unexpired medical materials could lead to the unintentional use on regulated animals. The
licensee must either dispose of all such expired medical drugs and materials or segregate them in an appropriately
labeled, physically separate location from non-expired medical drugs and materials. Correct by 6/1/17.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The side boards attached to one wood entrance ramp are chewed exposing a jagged, splintered, roughened edge.
The ramp used by two dogs are located in sheltered housing. Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized. A chewed, roughened surface could harbor disease causing agents which affects the
health and well-being of the dogs. The potential exists for dogs to ingest splintered wood which could cause
potential digestion problems. The licensee must ensure all surfaces are being maintained on a regular basis.
Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled or altered in a manner
that allows for cleaning and sanitation to occur. Correct by 6/8/17.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 5/25/17 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
