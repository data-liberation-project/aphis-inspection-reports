HANDLING.
At the time of this inspection, June 20, 2017 at approximately 10:30 am at the American Priority Parcel center at
Dallas/Ft Worth International Airport, two employees were trying to determine why 2 cats had been left in their
covered outdoor area that morning by American Eagle/Envoy Air. Apparently these cats had arrived on American
Airlines flight 387 from Honolulu at 6:20 am that morning. They were scheduled to connect with an American Eagle
flight chartered by Envoy Air for El Paso, TX. It appears the flight going to El Paso had problems with the cargo
area and could not take animals. Instead of keeping the cats at Envoy and rescheduling them as soon as possible
as per their SOP’s they took the animals to Priority Parcel and left them with no explanation.

Any entity subject to the Animal Welfare regulations who transports animals must do so as quickly and efficiently as
possible. Taking animals to another carrier that has no way of tracking the animals in their computer system and
leaving them with no explanation is not transporting animals quickly and efficiently.
Envoy Air needs to ensure their SOP’s for transporting animals are being followed. If the animals need to go to
another facility for temperature or other reasons that should be communicated to the other carrier prior to delivery of
the animals.
