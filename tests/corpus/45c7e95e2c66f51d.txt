2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The program of veterinary care does not include llamas and camels. Not having regulated species of animals on your
program of veterinary care doesn't ensure provisions are in place to make sure the medical needs of that species are
being taken care of. The Attending Veterinarian must review the program of veterinary care and ensure all regulated
species of animals being cared for by the licensee are listed on the program of veterinary care. Correct by 12/6/22.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee doesn't have a current inventory or acquisition records of the animals on site. In addition, the licensee was
unable to provide sales/disposition records from two goats that were recently sold/given away. Not keeping records up to
date doesn't allow for APHIS officials to properly track the animals. The licensee must have must have acquisition and
disposition records for all regulated animals. In addition, the licensee must have records for all regulated animals that are
currently on site. Correct by 12/29/22.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
An enclosure containing 14 goats and 3 llamas had fencing laying in the yard in one area. In addition part of the fencing
had sharp points sticking out into the enclosure. Fencing that is in disrepair or fencing that laying out in the enclosure

could cause injury to the animals within the enclosure. The fencing with sharp points sticking out into the enclosure must
be either repaired, replaced, or fixed so it no longer poses a danger to the animals within the enclosure. The fencing
laying out in the yard of the enclosure must be removed from the enclosure.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
