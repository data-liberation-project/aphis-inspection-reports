ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One cow, standing outside of the shelter, was noted to have hooves that had grown too long and were in need of
attention. The cow appeared to be in good body condition and moved normally; however, overgrown hooves can
cause pain and lameness and lead to other feet and leg problems. Hooves on all cows should be monitored and
cared for on a routine basis so they do not overgrow. The hooves of this cow need to be trimmed to a normal shape.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The day of inspection, it was raining and dark. In the sheep enclosure, the majority of the sheep were lying inside
the shelter, but there was no additional room if the 10 sheep outside of the shelter wanted to join those inside the
shelter. Direct exposure to the weather, without being able to get to shelter, can have detrimental effects on the
health and welfare of the animals. Either sheep must be removed from the enclosure (with only enough sheep
remaining so they all could lie down in the shelter), or additional shelter must be added to the enclosure.
Also, the same problem was encountered in the cow enclosure. The shelter in the cow enclosure was full with cattle
lying down inside it. There were four additional cows standing just outside the entrance but there was no room
inside the shelter, if they had wanted its protection. Direct exposure to the weather, without being able to get to
shelter, can have detrimental effects on the health and welfare of the animals. Either cattle must be removed from
the enclosure (with only enough cattle remaining so they all could lie down in the shelter), or additional shelter must
be added to the enclosure.
