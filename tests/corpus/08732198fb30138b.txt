CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, two puppies less than 16 weeks of age on AWB # 016-50002750 had recently arrived at
the cargo office on United flight 599.
The puppies did not have a shipper's certification regarding the last time food and water had been offered, or
specific feeding and watering instructions during transport, attached to the crate. A sticker was present on the
enclosure with a section for this information to be provided, but that section had been left blank by the consignor
and the information was not present anywhere else on the enclosure.
At the time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment the carrier must ensure that the consignor provides certification in
writing regarding the last time food and water was offered and specific feeding and watering instructions for a 24
hour period. Failure to provide this information could put the animals at risk, especially considering the young age of
the animals in this shipment. This information should be clearly displayed on the carrier, during transit. The airline
must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order to help ensure that animals are
adequately cared for while in transit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted at the cargo handling facility for United with cargo office
personnel.
