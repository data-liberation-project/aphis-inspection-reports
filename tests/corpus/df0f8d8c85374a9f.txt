Heating. The ambient temperature recorded in the middle of the guinea pig room was 54.7 degrees F. at time of this
inspection. The ambient temperature on the south side of building was 55 degrees F. The outside temperature was
39 degrees Fahrenheit. There was no heater present inside the guinea pig room. One window on the left side of the
animal room has broken and missing glass. Another window on the same side has a missing window pane allowing
cold air and wind to enter the animal room. Plastic was placed in missing and broken windows at time of this
inspection.
The ambient temperature shall not fall below 60 degree F. , nor exceed 85 degree F. in rooms housing guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs are very sensitive to drafts and changes in temperature. Animals may become ill if the temperature in
not closely monitored and kept between 60 - 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The licensee must ensure that the temperature
is maintained at acceptable levels throughout the entire facility regardless of changing conditions outside. A reliable
heater must be provided to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Correct by
