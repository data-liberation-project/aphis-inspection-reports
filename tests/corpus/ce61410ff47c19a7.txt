by 21 inches or 693 square inches of floor space. Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60
square inches of floor space each. Weanling enclosures can not house more than 11 guinea pigs weighing up tp 350
grams. Nine weanling enclosures had 12 or more guinea pigs in 693 square inches of floor space.

Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, and can increase aggression in animals which can result in ear
chewing and injuries from fighting. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are provided with a least the minimum amount
of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary stress and discomfort. Correct by June 30, 2022.
