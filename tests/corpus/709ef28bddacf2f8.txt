2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
Records of animal acquisitions & dispositions, the program of veterinary care, or animal inventory were not available for
review at the time of inspection. Failure to provide these documents hinders APHIS officials from assessing the facility’s
compliance with the Attending Veterinarian’s instructions included in the PVC and tracking animal movements. The
licensee must allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept by the AWA.

Facilities, general.
The hide structure (purple plastic) in one of the spiny mouse enclosures showed significant damage from routine wear
and tear. It provided insufficient hide opportunity for the number of animals in the enclosure (>22) as only 5-10 animals
could fit under it at a time. Indoor housing facilities should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and contain the animals.

Sanitation.


There was a build up of fecal material in 2 enclosures containing a male southern opossum and a male hedgehog. Build
ups of fecal material attracts pests and poses disease hazards to the animals. Excreta should be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce
odors. The licensee needs to increase the frequency of checking and cleaning primary enclosures to ensure that waste
material is not accumulating.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The floor of the main show room of the facility had bedding material, dead insect pests and other debris scattered around.
These accumulations can attract other insect and mammalian pests and pose disease hazards to the regulated animals.
The premises shall be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the proper husbandry of the regulated animals.

3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Soldier flies that the licensee maintains as larvae to feed insectivore species pupated, emerged as adults and
overwhelmed the facility. There was an excessive amount of these insects around the primary enclosures of regulated
species and exposed the animals to disease risks. The licensee’s current pest control plan is ineffective. The licensee
must maintain an effective pest control program to control insects, ectoparasites, avian and mammalian pests.
