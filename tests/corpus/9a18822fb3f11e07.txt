FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the wart hog's enclosure there was a wire mesh fence in the center which was removed. One section was left
intact at the ground level and needed to be removed or reburied in the substrate. The outdoor housing facilities
shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain
the animals.
This was corrected at the time of inspection.
The exit interview was conducted with the Owner.
