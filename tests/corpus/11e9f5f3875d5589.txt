2.36(b)(5)
ANNUAL REPORT.
The annual report provided to USDA for fiscal year 2012 did not include ferrets or pigs used in research,
experiments or testing. During the USDA inspection there were 4 pigs and 28 ferrets marked in the on-hand
inventory. It was unknown at the time of the inspection which pain category these animals belonged to. During
conversation with the IACUC chair, it was explained that there had been personnel changes in years past that may
have resulted in this discrepancy. Current numbers are being kept by the IACUC chair, there is personnel training
regarding the keeping and reporting of accurate animal numbers and they are currently exploring multiple options
for future back-up systems to ensure that numbers are checked and remain accurate. Numbers of animals must be
accurately kept and reported on the annual report in order to ensure proper regulatory oversight by and
communication with USDA. Correct by ensuring that numbers of animals used in regulated activities are accurate
from this point forward, and by submitting an amended report for the fiscal year 2012 to:
USDA APHIS Animal Care
920 Main Campus Dr., Suite 200
Raleigh, NC 27606
Correct by November 1, 2015
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the IACUC Chair, Dr. Kathryn Campitelli VMO and Dr. Michael
