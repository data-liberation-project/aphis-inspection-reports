Handling of animals.
On March 27, 2022, the transporter shipped 4 dachshund dogs in two crates on air waybill 080-36272121. One dog was
dead on arrival, and the other three showed evidence of serious illness, including depression, coughing, and nasal
discharge, which was documented by the intermediate handler's veterinarian after receipt, and at the veterinary
emergency hospital that the 2 live dogs were seen at, and was still evident in the same 2 dogs upon examination by the
inspector on 04/01/2022. A pathologist examined the dead animal, and gave a diagnosis of severe acute pneumonia and
hepatic lipidosis. Climactic conditions presented by air cargo travel may worsen health conditions, resulting in increased
illness or death. Animals must never be subjected to any combination of climatic condition that can adversely impact their
health and wellbeing.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
