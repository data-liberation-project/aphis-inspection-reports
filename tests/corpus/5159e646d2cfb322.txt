2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care was not available during this inspection. I contacted the licensee by phone
and she stated she could not locate it, and did not provide a copy with the traveling facility selling sugar gliders
retail. There was no documentation of the last visit by the attending veterinarian for the motor home used to house
sugar gliders which is in continuous traveling status. The licensee states the attending veterinarian has visited the
home facility within the last year but only for some of the sugar gliders.
On January 13, 2015, this licensee was cited for not having the written Program of Veterinary Care available during
the home site inspection with the correction date of February 1, 2015. To ensure adequate veterinary care is
provided for this licensee's sugar gliders, there needs to be a written Program of Veterinary Care. This licensee is
responsible for following the attending veterinarian recommendations, including visits to all facilities housing
animals.
This inspection was conducted with the caretaker at the Charlotte County Fair, Florida, and exit interview with the
care taker and licensee.
