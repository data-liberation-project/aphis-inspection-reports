ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- In the walk-through portion of the park there was a Jacob sheep with a gait abnormality. The sheep had a limp but
was able to keep up with the flock. The left rear limb appeared to be the affected limb. The sheep was able to move
around the enclosure, graze, and drink. Lameness can be caused by hoof issues, soft tissue injury, or infection.
This condition may be painful and impact the health of the animal. The applicant must have this animal examined by
a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation
must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The applicant must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the Jacobs sheep enclosure, two separate sections of wire fence were detached from the adjacent support post
leaving a section curling up with multiple exposed sharp points. One section was located next to the water trough,
and the second was along the fence line in the main pasture. This is a potential source of injury to the enclosed
animals. Fencing and other structures must be maintained in good repair to ensure the animals are safely
contained within their enclosure.
