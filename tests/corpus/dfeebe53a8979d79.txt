FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A young lion, approximately a year and a half old, and a brown bear, approximately 3 years old, have perimater
fences around their enclosures that are only six feet tall. Big cats and other potentially dangerous animals must
have a perimeter fence at least eight feet tall.
A perimeter fence is required for safety purposes: to keep people and animals away from the primary enclosure,
where contact with the animals could be possible, and to serve as secondary containment should the animal escape
its primary enclosure.
Correct within 30 days, by 1/14/2016.
