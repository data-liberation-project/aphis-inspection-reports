PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Flooring.
***At least 14 enclosures housing 14 dogs, had wire flooring where the coating was not present. The wire floor
coating was missing on portions of the outside part of the sheltered buildings. All wire flooring less than 9 gauge
must be coated with a material such as plastic or fiberglass to protect the dogs feet. The licensee must recoat or
replace any flooring that is currently not coated.
To be corrected by: December 29, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee and Chad Proctor ACI.
