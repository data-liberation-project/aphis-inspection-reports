3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On June 10, 2019, a 5- year- old goat was attacked by a coyote in pasture 11.
The facility representative stated that due to the high, thick brush in pasture 11, and in the adjacent pasture 14, a
coyote was able to enter the pasture, undetected, and attack the goat. The facility currently has 2 donkey’s roaming
pasture 14 and 1 donkey in pasture 11 to watch over the herds.
The doe incurred lacerations to her tail, and a small puncture to her caudal abdominal region. The goat received
timely veterinary care and is doing well.

The facility representative stated that the thick brush in their pastures was due to the large amount of rainfall during
spring 2019. After the attack, on June 11, 2019, farm personnel cleared approximately 75 feet of brush on each side
of each pasture, for approximately 150 feet of total clearance, allowing for better visibility of these areas to prevent
predation. The facility is continuing to clear the surrounding pastures as well as taking additional safety/
precautionary measures for the safety of their herd.
A system should be in place to ensure outdoor housing facilities are maintained in a manner that protects the
animals from injury.
To be corrected from this day,6/28/2019, forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
