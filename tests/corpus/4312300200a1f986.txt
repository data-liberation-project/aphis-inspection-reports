ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1045 on
31-JAN-18.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door. I then called the contact number provided, left a message
and waited for thirty minutes.
End of report.
