2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two adult Chihuahuas had excessively long toenails. Toenails that have grown too long can result in an injury
when the dog is walking on wire or can force the toes into an abnormal position when walking, resulting in pain.
The licensee must maintain toenails on all dogs so that they don't become excessively long.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
