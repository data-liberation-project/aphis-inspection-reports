ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A current written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is not available for review, although the attending
veterinarian has made several visits to the property, including the day of this inspection. The PVC ensures that a
standard system of veterinary care is in place and acts as the facility guide for the husbandry and care of the
animals. The program should be developed and/or reviewed, signed, and dated at least once a year by the
veterinarian and facility representative. A written PVC must be developed by the attending veterinarian and reflect
the current care the animals receive to ensure the overall health and well-being of the animals. Additionally, the
PVC must be made available for review by an APHIS inspector to ensure compliance with the standards of the
Animal Welfare Act.

***Six white fronted brown and four ringtail lemurs are in appropriate social grouping. However, there are only
narrow perches for the lemurs in the winter housing. The current enclosure is not enhanced with items or structure
that will allow species typical behavior and the opportunity to forage or manipulate objects.
However, there is no current written environmental enrichment plan available for review nor is there documentation
of enrichment provided.The environmental enrichment plan must be developed, and reviewed by the attending
veterinarian to ensure the non-human primates have their psychological needs appropriated addressed. A written
environmental enrichment plan must be developed and implemented with the attending veterinarian to include items
to enhance the environment and psychological well being of the lemurs. Additionally, the environmental enrichment
plan must be available for review by an APHIS inspector to ensure compliance with the standards of the Animal
Welfare Act.
3.81(c)(4) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The spider monkey is single-housed in an adequately enriched environment. He is able to see other non-humanprimates. There is no current written environmental enrichment plan available for review nor is there documentation
of enrichment provided.
An environmental enrichment plan should address the needs of individual non-primates housed alone. Special
consideration must be given to non-human primates that are singly housed. However, there is no current written
environmental enrichment plan available nor is there documentation of enrichment provided. A plan to ensure the
psychological health of the spider monkey must be developed with the attending veterinarian and implemented
accordingly. Additionally, the environmental enrichment plan must be made available for review by an APHIS
inspector to ensure compliance with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
***Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or electric wire. The
enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel poles, 4 inches in
diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest upon, is located
approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep roots - no lower
branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is approximately 4 feet
from the enclosure fence. The enclosure currently houses a ~2 year old male lion. Primary enclosures must be
constructed in a manner that will ensure containment of the animal. Based upon known physical and behavioral
characteristics of exotic cats, additional containment measures must be made to the lion enclosure to prevent
escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were provided.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Sheep / goat pen (back pasture): The right wall of the metal shelter is detached and the horizontal support board
is broken. The current structure is not structurally sound and puts the animal at risk for injury. Additionally, it does
not adequately provide the animals protection from inclement weather Shelter structures should be maintained
structurally sound in a manner that will protect the animals from adverse weather conditions at all times. The shelter
must be repaired or replaced to provide adequate protection from the elements and to prevent injury to the animals
contained within the enclosure. Correct by November 30, 2015.
