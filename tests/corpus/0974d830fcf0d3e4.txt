In the enclosure containing the single goat, multiple areas of the fence have several stray wires that are accessible
to the animal. The goat has been moved into this enclosure since the last inspection. The north, east, and south
sides of the enclosure livestock fencing have chicken wire attached to the bottom. Several areas of the chicken
wire have become partially detached, exposing the wires. The wires could injure the goat.
Assure the goat is housed in an enclosure that is maintained in good repair.
