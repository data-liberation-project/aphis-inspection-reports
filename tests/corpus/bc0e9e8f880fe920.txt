A pen contained 9 adult rabbits. One long-haired adult grey, white, and red ('calico') rabbit had a red/brown dry scab on its
back that was approximately 1 inch in diameter. The rabbit had an additional approximately 1 inch by 0.5 inch dry
red/brown scab over its left shoulder blade, and another red/brown dry scab at the base of its left ear that was
approximately 0.75 inches in length and 0.2 inches in width. The rabbit had an area of hair loss at the back of the base of
its ears that was approximately 1.5 inches in diameter. Within both ear canals, there was a large buildup of a dry brownish
yellow waxy substance, along with small areas of reddened skin that appeared to be inflammation of the skin. The rabbit
was observed to shake its head frequently and scratch repeatedly at the base of its ears. The rabbit intermittently carried
its ears in an abnormal, lop-sided manner. The licensee stated that he had observed the largest scab on the back of this
rabbit, and that it was a result of a fight with another rabbit, and that he was treating the scab with Vetricyn. The licensee
stated that he had not observed the crust in the ear canals or abnormal position of the ears.

Within the same enclosure, an adult white rabbit had a moderate amount of a dry brownish yellow waxy substance in both


ear canals, along with small areas of red in the ear canals. The rabbit was observed shaking its head. The licensee had
not observed the condition of the ears or head-shaking behavior prior to the inspection.

There was an adult female red and white goat in the outdoor small livestock pen who was limping. The goat intermittently
held up its front right leg, and the leg appeared slightly bent most of the time. There were no signs of swelling or wounds.
The licensee stated that he was aware of this problem, and that this goat had been recently acquired and that he was
waiting for the previous owner to provide treatment for the animal.

There was also an adult female dark brown and white sheep in the outdoor small livestock pen who was limping on both
front legs. Both front legs appeared to be stiff, and the animal walked with an abnormal gate. There were no signs of
swelling or wounds. The licensee stated that he had not noticed this sheep's lameness prior to the inspection.

Prompt identification of health problems and the provision of timely, adequate veterinary care is important to ensure
animal health and alleviate suffering and discomfort. Rabbits with ear or skin problems may experience discomfort, pain,
or secondary infections. Goats and sheep with lameness may suffer from pain, and may have difficulty moving around to
access food, water, or shelter. Some conditions may be contagious, thus prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent the
condition from occurring in other animals.

Correct by contacting a veterinarian to seek guidance regarding medical care for the goat, sheep, and two rabbits and by
providing appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in your animals.

Watering.
A pen containing 9 adult rabbits had three empty dishes with no food or water. Two dishes were filled with water and
placed in the enclosure. Two rabbits (1 black, 1 white) proceeded to drink water rapidly from one water dish for
approximately 1 minute. The licensee stated that water was provided to the rabbits at least twice a day.

The provision of adequate water for each animal within an enclosure is important for the health and well-being of the
animals within. Water is important to many normal body functions such as circulation of blood and digestion of food.
Animals who are thirsty suffer from discomfort.

The licensee provided two small bowls of water for the rabbits at the time of inspection, but these water receptacles do
not provide sufficient potable water and must be replaced to provide an adequate amount of water for the number of
animals inside the enclosure. Correct by 5PM on September 30th, 2020.

A complete routine inspection was started on September 29th. This report is limited to the direct non-compliant items
identified during that inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
