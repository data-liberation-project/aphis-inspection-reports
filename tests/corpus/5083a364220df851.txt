2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:30 on
13-SEP-17.The man who answered the door stated that the licensee was away and would not be returning until that
evening. He said there were no other knowledgeable facility representatives available, and that he himself did not
have adequate knowledge of the animals to accompany the inspection.
Without access to conduct the inspection, the regulatory process is impossible. The licensee must ensure a
knowledgeable facility representative is available to accompany inspection during normal business hours.
Correct from this time forward.
