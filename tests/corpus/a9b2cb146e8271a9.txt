ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1600 on
09-Feb-18. I went to the licensee's property, knocked on the door, and no one answered. I honked my car horn. I
called the licensee's phone number and left a message. I waited 30 minutes. No one called back. I then left the
property.
End of report.
