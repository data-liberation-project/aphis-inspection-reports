Registrant lists address at 530 Water Street (Port of Oakland office), but no one there knows of Endeavor Air. At the
airport the Administrative Office does not know of Endeavor Air. The Endeavor Air phone line says all reservations
are made through Delta, but upon visiting the Delta cargo office and ticket counter no one could be found who knew
of Endeavor Air. Repeated phone messages to the number provided to USDA / APHIS / Animal Care have not
resulted in any returned calls as requested. Unable to complete an inspection for this site, as no responsible person
or location can be identified.
