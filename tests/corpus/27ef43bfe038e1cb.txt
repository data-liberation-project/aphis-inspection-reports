2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are three separate areas within the zoo that allow public feeding and direct contact with animals:
Deer Pen, Goat Pen, and Mixed Domestic Species Pen
Each of the pens are designed so that there is a designated area for feeding. There are sections of the enclosures
along the pathways where people can have direct contact with the animals with no true public barrier. Numerous
patrons may come in contact with these animals per day. During these interactions, there were no employees or
attendants present to monitor the activity within any of these areas at all times throughout the day.
An adequate number of attendants is necessary to ensure animals are feed the appropriate food and to monitor
activity that may pose a danger or cause harm to the animals or the public. A responsible, knowledgeable, and
readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times in the feeding and petting areas for the health
and safety of the animals and the public. Or, barriers must be constructed in those areas of enclosures where the
public can have direct contact. Correct by June 26, 2017
