ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several expired drugs were found on inspection. This included:
1. One bottle AnaSed brand Xylazine (100 mg / ml) that expired on 6 / 2014 was present in the chemical capture /
restraint box.
2. One bottle Xylazine from Precision Pharmacy (333 mg/ml) that expired on 10/11/2014 was present in the
chemical capture / restraint box. This bottle appeared 2/3 full and had the additional label directions to (cid:28)Discard 28
days after needle puncture(cid:29). There was no notation on the bottle regarding the day it was first used, however, the
top seal had needle punctures and white crystalline material on the rubber port. Additionally the bottle contained a
large piece of solid material inside which appeared to be crystalized drug.
3. One bottle of Propylene Glycol that expired 12/2013 was present in the drug cart kept in the milking parlor.
The facility does not currently keep any records of the administration of chemical restraint drugs such as Xylazine.
The facility manager did state during the inspection that several animals had recently been sedated (it is unclear
whether this was done using this Xylazine or another drug). There was no Xylazine present in the chemical
restraint box which was in-date. The use of expired drugs can be dangerous or ineffective. Expired medications
may not be used on regulated animals. Correct by disposing of these expired medications and only using
medications that are in date from this point forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is documentation at the facility showing that following the last inspection the Attending Veterinarian (AV) met
with facility staff to discuss guidance regarding the use of chemical capture and restraint. The Program of
Veterinary Care was amended to include additional guidance on these topics.
Succinylcholine remains the primary drug for chemical restraint for the majority of species including: Sika Deer,
Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai, Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. Although there is significantly more guidance than present previously (such as drug dosing information by species),
this guidance still authorizes the use of succinylcholine without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia. Regarding
the circumstances for use the Protocol states (cid:28)necessary immobilization s should have benefits. 1 treatment for
injury or disease. 2 routine testing. 3 movement. 4 behavioral adjustment.(cid:29)
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) properties. When under the influence of
Succinylcholine animals are paralyzed, but retain consciousness and are capable of feeling pain and distress.
There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which are able to chemically restrain
animals while providing anesthesia and analgesia. The use of this drug without anesthesia / analgesia for painful
treatments or manipulations is inhumane. The use of this drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of
anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered distressful to the animal and is not considered to be
adequate veterinary care.
In addition to preventing movement, this drug can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop
breathing and if animals are not properly ventilated they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. While
the current guidance does provide instruction for manual chest compressions in the event an animal stops
breathing, this facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities, or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate
animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis of respiratory muscles would suffocate
without such ability. This is not considered adequate veterinary care.
Although additional guidance was provided regarding respiratory monitoring, there is no requirement for keeping
anesthetic or post-procedural anesthetic records. The facility currently keeps no record of animals which have been
administered paralytic drugs (such as succinylcholine) or sedatives (such as xylazine) for chemical restraint. This
facility has moved 3 Eland, 5 Zebra, 6 Tahr goats, 9 Aoudad, 3 Elk, and 1 Bison from the drive through area to the
Giraffe barn since the last inspection. Based on previous discussions with the facility manager many of these
animals would require chemical restraint to move them. When the Facility Manager was asked if the drive through
animals, now in the Giraffe barn, were moved using succinylcholine under the new guidelines for chemical restraint,
he said that the majority had been.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the availability of appropriate
facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to comply with the provisions of the animal welfare act. Providing the
authority to use paralytic drugs for immobilization without administration of anesthetic drugs, additional supportive
care, and the equipment to provide for ventilation in the event of respiratory paralysis is not considered adequate
veterinary care. Additionally, the use of these drugs without anesthesia or analgesia is not within established
standards of veterinary care. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and is likely
to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and / or death. Correct by working with your attending
veterinarian to ensure that there are appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services provide for
appropriate veterinary care and that any additional guidance is incorporated into the written program of veterinary
care. Records of any changes to the current methods for chemical restraint method shall be maintained for futureevaluation by APHIS Officials.
Correct by: Prior to any future use of any chemical restraint and not later than 5 April 2015.
*** A brown miniature zebu present in a group-housing stall inside the Giraffe barn had numerous areas of patchy
hair loss. These areas ranged in size and include:
- one area just in front of the left hook bone ((cid:28)hip area(cid:29)). This patch of hair loss was approximately 4-5 inches long
by 2-3 inches wide. The underlying skin was moist, red, and appeared to have a clear-yellow tinged exudate.
- one area was present behind the left shoulder on the chest. This patch of hair loss was approximately 4-5 inches
long by 2-3 inches wide. The skin was dry, light colored, and had flaks / crusts around the outer ring of hair loss (at
the junction with the haired area). There were several areas surrounding this where the hair direction was opposite
normal growth that appeared to be patterns consistent with hair having been licked by this or another animal.
- two very large areas covering the majority of her right rump and part of her abdomen. The skin in that area was
dry, intact, and appeared darkly colored.
- numerous small (1-2 inch) patches on the right chest and shoulder with underlying skin that appeared dry and
lightly colored.
When the facility representative was asked about the condition, he stated that he had observed it over the weekend
and believed that the zebu was being picked on by other animals in the stall. He stated that he intended to have the
Attending Veterinarian look at it when he next visited. Later during the inspection the farm manager stated that he
had observed this the previous day (that it had just come up) and that he had not recorded it in the observation book
either. The hair loss present on this animal was not present in the facility(cid:25)s daily observation book for that area and
entries for 2-27-15 & 2-28-15 and 3-2-15 stating (cid:28)OK(cid:29) initialed by the facility representative and two entries from
3-1-15 (cid:28)OK(cid:29) and were signed by the Farm Manager. The only other notations were initials of the staff member
making the observations regarding an Elk.
This animal must be examined by attending veterinarian to determine severity of the concern identified and to
determine required treatment. The licensee must maintain documentation of this exam and treatments for future
review by APHIS officials. Even though this is a repeat non-complaint item, this animal must be examined by the
attending veterinarian by COB on 6 March 2015.

present at today(cid:25)s inspection. There are no disposition records present for any Zebu. (Missing disposition records
for 2 Animals)
Accurate animal records regarding births, deaths, acquisition and disposition are used to help evaluate the facility's
animal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make,
keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals
purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his
or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor, including any
offspring born of any animals while in his or her possession or under his control. Additionally this must include:
(i) The name and address of the person form whom the animals were purchased or otherwise
acquired;
(ii) The USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is licensed or registered under the Act;
(iii) The vehicle license number and State, and the driver's license number (or photographic identification card for
nondrivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered under the Act;
(iv) The name and address of the person to whom the animal was sold or given;
(v) The date of purchase, acquisition, sale or disposal of the animal(s);
(vi) The species of the animal(s).

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The metal bars for the Lemur indoor enclosure are in need of maintenance. The indoor housing facility is
constructed of a combination of painted concrete walls and painted thick gauge floor to ceiling wire walls. There
are many areas where the paint has either worn off or chipped and there is rust covering a majority of the bars.
Additionally, the metal guillotine exit door has chipped and worn paint that also requires maintenance. These areas
have become difficult to impossible to sanitize in their current condition and require replacement, repainting, or
resurfacing. Failure to be able to properly sanitize can expose the animals to potential disease hazards. Correct
by ensuring that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis and that those that require maintenance are repaired
or replaced on a regular basis.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The indoor Lemur enclosure at this facility is dirty. The walls in this area are dirty and stained with dark brown
material from either animal hands or grease from fur. There is a build-up of dirt, grime, and spent feed between the
wall and the plastic kennel used as a shelter box. Many of the metal cage bars have a layer of grime or debris that
requires removal. It does not appear that these areas have been thoroughly cleaned recently. Animals that
potentially scent mark require special cleaning practices to ensure that over-cleaning and removal of too much
scent does not cause stress to the animals; however, a rotating cleaning schedule can be instituted in this situation
to facilitate adequate cleaning as required and accommodate scent marking behaviors. Failure to clean on a
regular basis exposes the animals to disease hazards and does not satisfy accepted cleanliness standards. The
facility must ensure that all primary enclosures housing non-human primates are cleaned on a regular basis.
Additionally, all indoor primate enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized at least every 2 weeks or as often as
necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of dirt and debris in accordance with section 3.84(b)(2). For those
primates that require special consideration for scent marking for their well-being, the facility may utilize a rotating
cleaning schedule that addresses this concern while also ensuring that their enclosures are kept sanitary and in
accordance with this section and 3.84(b)(2).

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The large heap of animal waste and bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals continue
to have access to this large pile and have been observed on previous inspections browsing and lying in the pile. During today(cid:25)s inspection, no animals were observed in or on the pile and no new additional spent bedding has
been recently added to the existing pile. The farm manager stated that there has been discussion at the facility
about the future of this pile. Contact the animals with this waste pile has been a concern on many previous
inspections as this exposes the animals to unnecessary disease and potential disease transmission. Correct this by
removing this waste pile and dispose of all animal wastes properly.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
***One Tahr goat is being housed in complete darkness in a stall inside the giraffe barn. This animal is housed in
an enclosure made of solid plywood walls and there was no natural or artificial lighting. The degree of darkness
made the inspection of this animal impossible. During inspection, the facility representative told inspectors they
could safely open the stall door a small amount to look at the animal for inspection. When the door was opened
(approximately 4-6 inches), the animal could be heard banging around in the stall and the walls of the enclosure
shook as the animal hit them. Even this opening was still insufficient light to allow the inspectors to identify the
number or species of animal. Based on the animal(cid:25)s behavior it appeared unsafe to open the door any farther
because of the risk of escape and Inspectors did not continue to attempt to view this animal because of concern for
causing injury. Inspectors asked facility staff what animal was in the enclosure and were informed that it contained
1 Tahr goat that had to be removed from the herd due to an injury. When discussing this animal (and the lack of
lighting) by phone with the farm manager, the undersigned inspector was informed that there were actually 2 Tahr
goats present in the stall during the inspection. Not only was this stall dark enough the animal could not be
observed by either inspector present, but the inspectors were also unable to see the material forming the top of the
enclosure, food / water receptacles, or cage furnishings (if present). All indoor housing must have ample lighting,
either natural or artificial, to allow for daily observation, inspection, and husbandry practices. Failure to provide
diurnal light cycles to the animals may also adversely affect them in many ways including disrupting hormonal
regulation, affecting appetite, and increasing the chances of injury when animals react to sounds they cannot see.
Correct this by providing this and all other animals ample lighting of good quality, distribution, and duration which is
of sufficient intensity to permit routine inspection and cleaning.
The farm manager was advised of this item by phone on March 3, 2015.
