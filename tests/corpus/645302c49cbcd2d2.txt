2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is incomplete and portions do not provide full and specific descriptions of
care required, such as routine preventative care. The PVC lists the previous license number and does not
reference the current license.
The facility representatives stated that the pigs are fed alfalfa hay without supplementation, which is an atypical diet
for pigs. However, the pigs appeared in good body condition.
Records indicate that the veterinarian has visited the facility according to the frequency listed in the PVC.
Complete and specific directions from the Attending Veterinarian (AV) are required for optimal health and well-being
of the animals.
The PVC must be updated to reference the current valid license and include specific instructions from the
veterinarian for routine and preventative veterinary care for the animals. The AV must also consulted for routine
husbandry recommendations, including nutritional (feeding) guidance.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outside portion of the pen enclosure housing the pigs and goats had an accumulation of fecal material. No
records were available for evaluation of the routine sanitation of the enclosure.
A plastic tub trough within the enclosure and reportedly used by the pigs to lay in contained water that was dirty andappeared to have bright green, algae-like growth in it. Additionally, two dead mice and one dead rat were in the
trough and were similarly discolored.
The sanitation and waste disposal for this enclosure was not frequent enough to prevent exposure of the animals to
potential disease-causing agents. These husbandry practices could cause illness in these animals.
An effective and regular system of sanitation and waste disposal for the entire facility must be in place.

WATERING.
The automatic watering receptacle was dirty and appeared to have green, algae-like growth.
Accessibility to clean and potable water is necessary for the health and comfort of the animals.
A system of regular cleaning and maintenance of water receptacles must be in place.

SANITATION.
The fence of the outside portion of the enclosure housing the pigs and goats was in disrepair. The fence near the
animal entrance to the building had large gaps that were incompletely closed with plastic string in an attempt to
patch. The end of the fence near the gate that is attached to the building was partially detached.
These fence defects could allow an animal to potentially escape if they are enlarged by the animals or cause
entrapment of their head. Injury or death of the animals might result from an such escape or entrapment.
A system of fence monitoring and maintenance must be in place.
