HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(This is a focused inspection only on Cougar exhibition)
The licensee acquired a cougar without proper training and experience on handling this animal safely. Licensees
must demonstrate adequate knowledge of the species they maintain. On 5-1-15 an offsite inspection was conducted
and the licensee was cited for improper handling of the cougar. The licensee must complete training and gain
experience with handling of adult cougars by working with an experienced cougar handler.
