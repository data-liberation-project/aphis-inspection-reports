FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sheep and goat pen area, the hog wire fence on the left side of the pen had a ¼ inch thick fence wire (about
six inches long) protruding into the pen. It was about two feet off the ground. The fence was repaired during the
inspection.
In the cattle barn, the support posts to the roof have old nails exposed which could injure the cattle. Some of the
nails have hair attached to them.

The outdoor housing facilities for the farm animals shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. For the health and wellbeing of the animals, a system
to routinely monitor the facility(cid:25)s housing facilities is to be intensified.
The Cattle barn area to be corrected before animals put back into pen. The sheep and goat pen immediate issue
was corrected at time of inspection. A system is to be in place by September 1, 2015.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sheep and goat barn area, there was a ½ bale of hay on the ground. Hay should be stored in a manner which
protects it against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. For the health and wellbeing of the animals, a
system to routinely monitor the facility(cid:25)s hay storage facility is to be created and/or intensified.
The current issue was corrected at time of inspection.

WATERING. The water trough in the sheep pen has an algae buildup. One to two inches of a green slurry (loose algae and other
debris) is at the bottom of the trough. Potable water is to be available to the animals at all times or it must be
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. All water receptacles shall be kept clean
and sanitary. A system to ensure that the water troughs are routinely monitored is to be created and/or intensified.
To be corrected by August 3, 2015

SANITATION.
The sheep and goat pen has a moderate amount of manure. The cattle pen area has a buildup of manure and
should not house animals until the manure has been removed. Manure should be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals in the pens. Accumulations of excreta
can attract flies and increase disease hazards in animal areas. For the health and wellbeing of the animals, the
facility is to create a system to ensure that the manure is adequately removed in a timely manner. This will reduce
contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
To be corrected by August 3, 2015
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
In the pig pen area, there is a moderate buildup of algae around the "(cid:28)lixit"(cid:29). Also, in an adjacent pen, there is a
leaking water faucet and there is algae growth present and the wood around the leaky faucet has rotted away. The
cement floor is not impervious to moisture and cannot be sanitized as required. Paint is peeling from the ceiling.
According to the facility representative, they have not cleaned the ceiling because there is asbestos in the paint.
The peeling paint can fall into the animal pen and can be hazardous to their health, especially if they ingest the
paint flakes.
In the cattle barn area, the cattle have access to the wooden posts that have peeling paint. The wood is not
impervious to moisture.
The buildings, pens, and grounds shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Pens, floors, walls, ceilings that are not impervious to moisture
cannot be sanitized. For the health and wellbeing of the animals, a system to routinely monitor and repair the
facility(cid:25)s buildings, pens, fences is to be created and/or intensified.To be corrected by September 1, 2015
