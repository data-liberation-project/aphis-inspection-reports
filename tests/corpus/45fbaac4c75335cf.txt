3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor portion of an enclosure in one of the sheltered buildings, there was a broken section of paneling
approximately six inches by nine inches that exposed the wood underneath.
Exposed wood is not impervious to moisture and cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces be maintained on a regular basis, and any surfaces within the facility that
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are at least 6 electric power cords for the heating pads in one whelping building where the cord protectors are
no longer protecting the cords. Some of the live electric cords have chew marks on them from the dogs. Live
electric power cords could cause injury to the dogs if they are chewed by the dogs. All power cords must be
installed in a manner that protects the dogs from coming into direct contact with the cords. This was corrected at
the time of the inspection.
This routine inspection was conducted on 4 March 2015 with facility representatives and Lynn Clarke, ACI.
The exit interview was conducted on 5 March 2015 with facility representatives and Lynn Clarke, ACI.
