There is a female Shihtzu (#169) white in color that has a large amount of drainage coming from both eyes, with
some brown crusty material in around the rims and in the corners of the eyes. The right eye has some green
discharge in it, and the left eye had a small fleshy lump in the center of the eye. There has not been any treatment
provided or veterinarian consulted at the time of the inspection.
Untreated eye conditions can be painful and cause stress to the animal. Eye injuries can become chronic if not
caught early and treated properly.
The veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the eyes.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Shihtzu (#169) white had a excessive discharge coming from both eyes, with green mucus in the right eye
and a fleshy lump in the center of the left eye. The skin under the fur at the corners of both eyes was red and raw
due to the wet fur and amount of time it has been left un-noticed. The eye condition had not been observed until the
time of the inspection, so no treatment had been given.
Daily observation of all animals is important in order to catch any health issue immediately in order to prevent a
treatable condition from becoming chronic and painful.
There must be an increase in daily observation of all regulated animals to make sure there are no health issues that
go un-noticed so that treatment can begin immediately when needed.
