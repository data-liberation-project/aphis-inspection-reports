2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On Jun 26th, 2020, the registrant identified a male hamster with a health problem after animal care staff had completed
their daily observations. The registrant flagged the cage for review by animal care staff and provided further direction to
facility staff to euthanize the animal. The attending veterinarian was not notified about the health problem and has not
authorized the registrant to direct euthanasia of animals other than for management of the breeding program. When
animal care staff examined the cage on June 28th, the animal was found dead. On review of the incident with the
registrant and the attending veterinarian, there is no mechanism of direct and frequent communication between the
registrant and the veterinarian. The registrant must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian to
ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care.
To be corrected by October 12th, 2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
