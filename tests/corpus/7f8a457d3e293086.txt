2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of this inspection I was informed that this facility's attending vet had recently passed away. The veterinary
practice had closed. Therefore, this facility no longer had a valid Program of Vet Care. This licensee will need to hire an
attending vet and have them complete the Program of Veterinary care as it pertains to this animal.
