3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lower metal pipes of two enclosure gates of the Shiba Inu enclosures are rusted to the point where one corner
joint is not secure and in the other there is rusted jagged edges. These conditions may cause injury to the dogs or
the dogs may not be securely contained. All surfaces must be free of excessive rust that affects the structural
strength of the surfaces. This was corrected at the time of the inspection.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
