2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
On February 19th, 2022, a 6.5-month-old, male mountain lion weighing approximately 35 lbs. was exhibited at an outdoor,
public event in the Los Angeles area without sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general
viewing public. Per the licensee, this animal was handled by three experienced trainers and maintained by a 5ft leather
lead with a chain-type collar for control. The licensee confirmed that the barriers used at this event for the mountain lion
consisted of a mesh-type netting along sections of the back and sides of the exhibit. The front part of the exhibit included:
sections of mesh netting, small sections with a rope and fabric cloth approximately 3-4 ft high, and a 3 ft high table with a
draped tablecloth. The licensee stated there were items such as boxes/crates placed under the table; however, she
agreed that there were sections with no solid barriers placed in the front public viewing area of this exhibit. Although the
tablecloth drapes over the table in the front part of the exhibit, there did appear to be gaps or openings under the table
potentially large enough for an animal or small child to pass through. Members of the public appeared to be able to lean
over the table barrier in the front as well as on occasion be within 5ft of the animal while standing directly next to the 3-4ft
high rope and fabric barrier. It was noted that there were no incidents involving this animal reported at this event.

Considering the age, size, and strength of this species being in an unfamiliar environment and managed with a leash as


an only barrier, this animal was handled without sufficient distance and/or barriers and posed a risk of harm to the animal
and the public. A system of sufficient distance and/or barriers must be in place for all animals handled during public
exhibition to assure the safety of the animals and the public. This includes all animals exhibited at public events outside of
the facility and at the facility including any animal interactions or experiences.

Correct from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
