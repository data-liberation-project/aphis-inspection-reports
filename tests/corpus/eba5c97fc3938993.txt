enclosures along the east and west walls and also in the center of the room. In the row of enclosures along the
eastern wall there are three enclosures, each containing one adult dog, which has broken wire flooring material.
These broken wires could injure the contained animals. Primary enclosures must be repaired or replaced and
maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the contained dogs.
