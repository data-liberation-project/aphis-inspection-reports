REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This establishment has continued to operate a petting zoo and is exhibiting regulated mammals. Ms Barber has
been notified on 2 previous occasions that her activity requires a USDA exhibitor license, and how to apply for a
license. A pre license packet has been sent to her on March 25, 2015 and again on December 28, 2015, and she
has yet to apply for a license.
You may not exhibit any regulated mammals (including, but not limited to: pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, rabbits)
without a valid USDA exhibitor license.
