Female pomsky (tattoo #14, microchip #892981) is lame in both hind legs. The inspectors observed the dog to appear
painful on both hindlegs as she moved around the enclosure. The dog often held one of the hind feet of the floor as she
moved or would rock her weight back on the heel of the foot with the toes held off the flooring when standing. Closer
inspection of the dog revealed a raw, red, open lesion on the pad of one toe on each hind foot. The dog is housed on
raised expanded metal flooring and the affected area of the toes are rubbing against the metal when the dog is walking.
The condition of the dog has not been noticed and no treatment has been provided. This dog was moved to an enclosure
with a different type of flooring during the inspection. The behavior of this animal indicates that the open lesions are
painful and if left untreated could lead to further health issues.

Female Boston terrier (microchip #991001003375932) appears very painful on the left hind leg. The inspectors observed
the dog stretching the leg out behind her several times while standing and holding the foot off the flooring. While moving
around the enclosure, the dog showed signs of severe lameness and often failed to bear weight on the leg. Closer
inspection of the leg revealed a raw, red, open lesion on the pad of one toe. The condition of the dog has not been
noticed and no treatment has been provided. The behavior of this animal indicates that the open lesions are painful and if
left untreated could lead to further health issues.

leg is swollen from the elbow to the foot. Numerous dark red wounds are located on the medial, lateral, and posterior
sides of the leg. The condition of the dog has not been identified and no treatment has been provided. The behavior of
this animal indicates the swollen leg is painful and could also suggest there is an underlying health issue such as
infection. If left untreated it could lead to further health issues.

Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the animal and if left untreated could lead to further
health issues.

Female bulldog (tattoo #37, microchip #7E10334731) has an abnormal condition on both front feet. Each foot contains a
large red lesion between the toes. A darker red area is located on the surface of each lesion and appears to be slightly
wet. The condition of the dog has not been noticed and no treatment has been provided. Abnormal skin conditions could

cause pain and discomfort to the animal and if left untreated could lead to further health issues.

The above-mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that each animal receives adequate veterinary care at all times.

At the time of the inspection a veterinarian examined and established a treatment plan for each of the affected dogs.
