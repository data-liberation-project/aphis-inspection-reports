and treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience
pain and

diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Expired drugs were discarded or labeled and removed from active supplies during this inspection.
A system to identify and remove expired medical supplies shall be developed and implemented by 5/21/2015.
3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The area where animals are housed is carpeted and cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized or easily removed or
replaced when worn or soiled.
Carpet is absorbent and cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized to prevent the buildup of potentially infectious
material (urine, excreta, etc...) which can pose a risk to the health of the animals.
The surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the
facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized,or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by 9/15/2015.
