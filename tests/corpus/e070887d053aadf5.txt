3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Multiple enclosures housing the marmosets and tamarins contained hard surfaces that had a thick opaque accumulation
of brown material coating the surfaces. The surfaces in need of cleaning included PVC tubes, plastic baskets, enrichment
items and nest boxes. The licensee stated that the facility was behind on the routine cleaning but was working to get
caught up this week.
Regular cleaning of surfaces that nonhuman primates come in contact with is necessary to prevent an accumulation of
excreta and disease hazards, prevent contamination of the skin/haircoat of the nonhuman primates and decrease pest
issues.
The facility shall clean hard surfaces with which the nonhuman primates come in contact daily or at regular intervals as
determined by the attending veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices.
Correct by 5/29/21.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
