2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On two sides of the outdoor enclosure housing three muntjac, there is no barrier fence between the animals and the
general viewing public. There are signs hung on the primary enclosure which read, "Please do not feed us!!
People food makes us Sick!!" However, there are no barriers on two sides of this enclosure (across from the
badger exhibit or across from the bison exhibit) to provide sufficient distance to prevent public feeding of the
muntjac through the primary exhibit fencing. During public exhibition, there must be sufficient distance and/or
barriers between the animals and the public to assure the safety of the animals. To be corrected by: June 30,
2017.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several areas (varying in height from 6 to 18 inches) in both the wolf and coyote outdoor exhibit areas
where the top "stucco-like" coating is missing and the underlying concrete is exposed. Pieces of the thin
"stucco-like" surface coating may fall into the animal enclosure and could potentially be ingested by the wolves or
coyote. The area of damaged wall inside both the wolf and coyote enclosures must be repaired in order to avoid
accidental ingestion by the three animals housed in these two exhibits. This is a repeat, non-compliant item.
3.127 REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The zoo perimeter fence, at the break-away gate over the Spring River, has a gap of approximately 3-4 feet due to
a buildup of organic debris. Animals (such as dogs) could go through the gap in the perimeter fence at this location
and potentially come in contact with zoo animals. The perimeter fence must be constructed (and maintained) so
that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals from going through gaps and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
This is a repeat, non-compliant item.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with city officials on May 16 & 17, 2017.Additional Inspectors
