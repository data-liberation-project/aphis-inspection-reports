WATERING.
No source of potable drinking water was available to the black bears on exhibit during this inspection. A waterfall
furnishing that could supply a potable drinking source has been inoperable for several months and the large pool in
the enclosure as currently maintained cannot be considered a source of potable water for the bears. Especially
during hot weather months potable drinking water should be readily accessible to maintain animal health and
prevent potential dehydration and discomfort to the animals. This non-compliance was corrected during the
inspection by providing an acceptable potable water source.

SANITATION.
The pool in the black bear enclosure has considerable solid and particulate debris floating in it. The pool also
appeared very cloudy and evidence of contamination by avian pests, such as feathers and fecal material was seen
in and adjacent to the pool. The pool filtration system has been under construction and is currently inoperable.
Measures should be taken to maintain sanitation in the enclosure to meet acceptable husbandry standards.
Appropriate levels of cleaning are necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and reduce risk of
transmission and exposure to disease hazards. Correct by: October 12, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with multiple facility representatives.
