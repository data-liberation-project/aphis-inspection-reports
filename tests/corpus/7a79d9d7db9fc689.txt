2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Ineffective communication and lack of documentation and follow-up between animal care staff and the veterinarians at the
facility led to the death of one adult rabbit. Daily observation records from October 18, 2021 document that an employee
noticed a rabbit with diarrhea and notified the veterinarian. The record on October 19, 2021 says that the communication
with the veterinarian was made in passing and on October 20, 2021, employees were still unsure if the veterinarians were
aware of this rabbit. The rabbit was found dead on October 21, 2021. The veterinarians have no documentation of the
employees notifying them and none of the health forms had been filled out.
Failure to effectively communicate problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being to the attending veterinarian can
result in worsening of issues and even death. The facility must ensure that a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication exists so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Corrections had been instituted prior to the inspection by outlining detailed methods of communication on abnormal daily
observations and retraining all employees involved with animal care.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
