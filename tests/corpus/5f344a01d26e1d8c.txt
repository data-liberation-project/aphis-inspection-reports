FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence surrounding enclosure #3 was recently damaged by a branch that fell off the tree. The branch
impacted the top of the fence (and the unused yard fence), decreasing the effective height of the perimeter fence to
4-5 feet high. The primary enclosure is still intact, and the caretaker is taking additional measures to ensure the
safety of the animal. Two people live on the property and can see the enclosure from the house, and the property is
surrounded by a 5-6 foot property fence. The branch has been removed, the fence damage has already been
assessed by a specialist, replacement parts are on order and the repair has been scheduled for January 8th.
Perimeter fences must be greater than 8 ft high to act as secondary containment system for potentially dangerous
animals in the facility. The fence must be constructed and maintained so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it.
