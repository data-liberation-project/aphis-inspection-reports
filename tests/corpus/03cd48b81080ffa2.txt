ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The licensee had no current program of veterinary care for any of the animals. The only PVC that could be found
was one specific to hoofed stock last signed by the veterinarian on March 10, 2015. Complete, species appropriate,
and up to date programs of veterinary care are essential for maintaining the health of the animals. An associate
veterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian’s clinic visited the facility to look at the most pressing veterinary care
issues on the second day of the inspection. The veterinarian stated that he was primarily a large animal practitioner
and had little interest in zoological species medicine. The veterinarian recommended that the licensee work with a
veterinarian with experience in the species comprising the collection for animals other than hoofed stock. The facility
must have an appropriate program of veterinary care for all species housed at the facility. Correct by November 15,

***The brown nosed coatimundi cited on the June 2016 inspection report appeared lethargic upon the first day of
inspection and exhibited slightly labored breathing. When the licensee attempted to rouse the animal, it took only a
few slow steps and would then lie back down in its enclosure. The animal appeared to have little interest in its
surroundings and was poorly responsive to stimuli. While the coatimundi appeared much more responsive the
second day, episodes such as the one described above may be indicative of disease. This animal must be
assessed by a veterinarian experienced with the species as soon as possible in order to receive appropriate
diagnosis and treatment. An associate veterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian’s clinic visited the facility on the
second day of inspection to evaluate the animal, and recommended further follow-up with a veterinarian
knowledgeable with the species. The recommendation of the veterinarian must be followed as soon as possible.
***One arctic fox appears significantly thinner than its cage mate, and has what appears to be fecal staining on the
fur of its hind quarters. The licensee stated that unlike the other fox, this animal has not grown in its new winter coat
yet, but the combination of lower body condition at a time when the species normally gains weight, possible
abnormal stool, and slower winter coat development may be indicative of poor health. This animal must be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian in order to receive appropriate treatment and management. An associateveterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian’s clinic visited the facility on the second day of inspection to evaluate the
animal, and recommended further follow-up with a veterinarian knowledgeable with the species. The
recommendation of the veterinarian must be followed as soon as possible.
***The cougar is somewhat underweight, with ribs slightly visible. In addition the animal has a plantigrade (dropped
hocks) stance on its front feet, a stiff gait, and appears to have an intermittent right front lameness while walking.
These issues may be symptomatic of disease or management issues that can cause pain or distress to the animal.
This cougar requires ongoing assessment by the attending veterinarian in order to receive appropriate diagnosis
and treatment. The licensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to another facility in the near
future. The animal must be promptly evaluated by the attending veterinarian or safely transferred to the receiving
facility for evaluation and care. An associate veterinarian of the Attending Veterinarian’s clinic visited the facility on
the second day of inspection to evaluate the animal, and recommended further follow-up with a veterinarian
knowledgeable with the species. The recommendation of the veterinarian must be followed as soon as possible.
All of the above must be corrected by October 28, 2016.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The female Asiatic black bear was observed pacing in an abnormal behavior pattern. Pacing can be indicative of
physical or psychological issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modification. The bear
was noted on inspection to be overweight and to have poor muscle tone (as seen when she stood on her hind legs).
She also exhibits a marked angular deformity of her front feet, which turn sharply inward. The licensee stated the
animal has had this deformity since she came to the facility. These issues may contribute to pain and reduced
mobility, and must be evaluated by a veterinarian in order to provide appropriate treatment and management of the
pacing, weight and mobility issues. The licensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to
another facility in the near future. The animal must be promptly evaluated by the attending veterinarian or safely
transferred to the receiving facility for evaluation and care.
***The bobcat exhibited abnormal pacing behavior in its enclosure. The animal paced very rapidly and continuously
on the partial platform in the rafters of its enclosure. We observed the animal pacing nearly continuously for over 15
minutes, and this continued even when the licensee walked away from the enclosure and the inspectors moved out
of the animal’s line of sight. The bobcat remained in the rafters for the duration of the first day of inspection, and
when asked the licensee stated that the bobcat rarely descended from that area, and primarily ventured down to
ground level only to eat and drink. Abnormal behavior patterns can be indicative of physical or psychological issues
that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modification, and must be evaluated promptly by the
attending veterinarian in order to receive appropriate treatment and management.
***The cage mate of the coatimundi cited under the direct NCI, exhibited abnormal pacing behavior in its enclosure.It paced rapidly by the rear entrance of its enclosure almost continuously for over ten minutes of observation, and
continued the behavior even when the inspectors and owner stepped away from the enclosure. Abnormal behavior
patterns can be indicative of physical or psychological issues that may require medical treatment or
habitat/husbandry modification, and must be evaluated promptly by the attending veterinarian in order to receive
appropriate treatment and management.
All of the above must be corrected by November 11, 2016.

***The licensee informed us that in April of 2016, a fallow deer doe was gored by a buck. The licensee described an
abdominal wound with evisceration. The licensee did not seek veterinary attention for the doe, and stated that the
wound appeared to close over. Approximately five days later he found the doe dead. This doe likely suffered
extreme pain and distress over the five day period before its death. The licensee must promptly convey timely and
accurate health information to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate medical care can be rendered and
suffering can be alleviated.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records of animals on hand are incomplete. There is no information on the birth of a fallow deer this past
month, nor are the births of the zebu, highland calf, and cavies recorded. There are also no dates on disposition
records. Records must be kept in accordance with the regulations of the AWA to ensure accurate information vital to
managing animal inventories and husbandry. The licensee must keep complete and accurate exhibitor records.
2.131(a)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On Thursday, October 6, 2016 the licensee was injured by the Asiatic black bear when attempting to feed it. The
bear has been quarantined for a second time (the first time was due to the handling incident cited in the August 8,
2016 inspection report). The licensee required a hospital visit and follow up medical care. After the injury the
licensee has had difficulty conducting routine husbandry tasks such as lifting the guillotine gate to allow the bear
access to her den, and as a result she has been denied access to this portion of her enclosure.
On the second day of the inspection, inspectors observed the licensee feeding the cougar. The licensee, standing
approximately one foot away from the primary enclosure, dropped the meat right next to a six to eight inch gap
between the flooring and fencing, then pushed the meat into the enclosure by hand. The cougar lunged at the meat
and snatched it away before the licensee could move out of the vicinity. Although there was no injury, this is an
extremely dangerous practice and demonstrates insufficient knowledge of the behavior, speed, and strength ofcougars.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain in order to provide appropriate handling that minimizes distress, discomfort and potential
harm. Correct by December 15, 2016.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***A wood 2-rung plank fence has been constructed in front of the porcupine enclosure. Chain link fence is placed
behind it to close the gaps between rungs. However, there chain link does not extend the full width of the plank
fencing. This leaves space large enough between rungs that would allow the entry of unwanted persons and
animals. The fence must be constructed in a manner that ensures the public and unwanted animals do not gain
access to an area that will allow direct contact.

Cleaning and Sanitation of Primary Enclosures
***A significant portion of the guinea pig enclosure underneath and around the sipper bottle contained wet bedding.
Wet bedding can lead to discomfort. In addition, it can result in microbial growth in the bedding, predisposing
animals to disease. For the comfort and health of the guinea pigs, animals in wet bedding shall be transferred to
clean primary enclosures. Corrected at the time of inspection.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General
The floor of the rabbit cage has 1x1 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin rabbit housed in this cage can
pass through easily. Wooden boards have been placed in the cage, however it does not cover the entire cage floor.
The rabbit at times prefers to rest and walk on the slated floor. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner
that protects the feet and legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to prevent the feet of
the rabbit from passing through.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
***The prairie dog enclosure has a mesh floor with approximately 1 inch by 1 inch diamond shaped openings. While
there is straw bedding on much of the flooring, some areas are bare and the animals’ feet could become entrapped
in the openings. Modifications must be employed to prevent entrapment hazards and foot injuries to the prairie
dogs.
***Bear enclosure (catch area and den): The bear enclosure is in need of repair, specifically the den and catch area.
The gate for the catch area appears to be held together by chains and locks, although one side of the gate has
metal hinge attachments at the top and bottom. The catch area latch is secured with a large metal clip that can beeasily opened by a person. An appropriate lock must be used to secure the gate to prevent unwanted entry of
persons and the potential escape of the bear. The catch gate must be constructed in a manner that will contain the
bear. The gate must have appropriate hinges installed to ensure the integrity of the gate to contain the bear.
***One side of the fence surrounding the den is held together with twine and the other side is not attached to any
support pole. The fence must be structurally sound for the overall safety of the animal and public, and to prevent
escape.
***The metal den is excessively rusty and holes are present in various areas where the den comes in contact with
the ground. The holes in the den increases the risk of the bear being able to escape from this area and also allows
for the entry of unwanted animals. The den must be replaced to ensure containment of the bear, to prevent the
harborage of pests, and to provide shelter for the animal.
***The goat enclosure fencing has sharp points and loose fence posts that are easily moved by hand. This can
result in injury or escape of the goats. The fence must be repaired for the safety of the animals.
***The squirrel cage has sharp points and gaps between the mesh sides and top. The licensee stated that on
occasion he has found wild squirrels sharing the enclosure with the regulated animals. These issues may result in
escape, injury or disease transmission. The squirrel cage must be repaired to prevent escape or access by wild
animals.
***The Fallow deer enclosure has large gaps at the bottom of the fencing that may predispose to entanglement,
injury or escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.
***The zebu enclosure has large gaps at the bottom of the fencing that may predispose to entanglement, injury or
escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.
***A Jacob’s sheep enclosure containing six sheep has loose fencing held together by twine. This may predispose
to entanglement, injury or escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.

Storage
***One open forty pound bag of dry dog food was stored in the licensee’s SUV. Another open forty pound bag of dry
dog food was stored on the floor by the meat freezer and the kibble was damp and deteriorated. Improper storage
can result in unwholesome food that can cause dietary deficiencies and foodborne illnesses. Compromised food
must be discarded and all wholesome food must be appropriately stored to protect against deterioration,
contamination and molding. Correct from this day forward.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste Disposal
The squirrel cage has an excessive amount of sunflower seed and peanut hulls, and other food wastes in the feedtrough and at the bottom of the cage. The waste also extends outside of the squirrel cage.
Excess waste can become an attractant to pests and must be cleaned on a frequent basis. Animal and food wastes
must be removed from cages and disposed of away from animal enclosures. Wastes should be removed and
disposed of in a designated area immediately and in accordance with county and state laws.
3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from Inclement Weather
***The bear repeatedly went to stand or lie next to its den after feeding, but was locked out of the den area. The
owner is injured and cannot lift the guillotine gate without assistance because it is in disrepair. The enclosure must
reliably provide den access for this species, which uses dens in it natural habitat. In addition, the den design is
inappropriate. The metal pipe construction does not possess sufficient insulating properties for this tropical species,
and the lack of bedding exacerbates this issue. Bedding provides a soft substrate as well as insulation, and is
particularly important for bears because of their motivation to build nests and line dens. Failure to provide
appropriately furnished dens may result in frustration of motivated behavior, and inability to behaviorally
thermoregulate. The bear must have access to an appropriately designed den and bedding that meets its species
specific needs. This was corrected on the second day of inspection, but a long term and effective method of
correction will be required in the future.
***The pasture containing three Painted sheep has only one calf hutch for shelter, which cannot accommodate all
three sheep at the same time.
***The arctic fox enclosure has one shelter which is not large enough to house both foxes at the same time.
Lack of adequate access to shelter can cause adverse effects from exposure to detrimental weather conditions.
Appropriate shelters with enough space to house all animals within the enclosures must be provided.
***The fallow deer enclosure has only two-sided shelters that cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation.
In addition, there are holes and sharp edges in the shelter divider.
***The mouflon shelter has only two sides, and cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation. In addition, the
shelter has gaps and loose boards.
Failure to protect animals from detrimental weather conditions can negatively impact their health and ability to fight
disease. Appropriately constructed shelters must be provided.
***The cougar has no bedding in its den. Bedding provides a soft substrate as well as insulation and is particularly
important for this animal since it is slightly underweight and has mobility issues. Soft bedding helps thinner animals
stay warm in colder weather, and can help reduce discomfort associated with mobility issues. An appropriate type
and amount of bedding must be provided in the cougar den.***The raccoon has no bedding in its den. Bedding provides a soft substrate, as well as insulation in colder weather.
An appropriate type and amount of bedding must be provided for the raccoon.

Perimeter Fence
Bear Perimeter Fence: The perimeter fence around the bear enclosure was damaged from a fallen tree. Several
sections of the chain link fence is sagging to the point that that the structural strength of the fence is compromised.
Several sections of chain link fence are detached from the top support pole. The top support pole is not continuous
around the top of the perimeter fence; some section are missing. The one section of the right half of the enclosure is
constructed of a double layer of chain link fence. The two layers are detached from each other. The strength of this
section is compromised. There is also a 3" gap between the perimeter fence support pole and gate where a person
could fit a hand through, allowing inappropriate access to the bear. Gaps and damage to perimeter fencing may
result in failure to prevent the entry of unauthorized persons and unwanted animals. The perimeter fence must be
repaired to restore its functional integrity.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
***The Patagonian cavy cited on the June 2016 inspection report was rechecked and appears to be continuing to
heal without incident. No fighting was observed during this inspection, but cavies were noted to chase each other in
the enclosure. There are no visual barriers and there is insufficient space to allow animals to remove themselves
from unwanted social contact. This results in stress for the animals. Enclosures must be designed to permit normal
social and postural adjustments for the species in question. Correct by December 15, 2016
***The Arctic foxes appeared hyper vigilant, agitated, and paced nearly continuously when we approached the
enclosure. The enclosure has one igloo style shelter that cannot fit both animals comfortably at the same time, and
there are no visual barriers that allow them to remove themselves from view, which is a social behavior for foxes.
Normal postural behaviors for foxes include a motivation to dig, create dens and jump onto elevated areas. Inability
to engage in highly motivated behaviors such as hiding and digging results in stress to the animals. This enclosure
is on a concrete slab and does not provide these normal social and postural adjustments for the species in question.
Suitable dens, visual barriers, and provisions for safe digging must be provided. Correct by December 15, 2016
***The enclosure for the bear is a corn crib on a concrete slab and this bear exhibits behavioral and orthopedic
abnormalities. Asiatic black bears are biologically designed to be smaller and slimmer to have the mobility to climbtrees, so excess weight on this species of bear can cause additional health and behavioral issues. The bear
enclosure has insufficient space and furnishings (such as climbing structures, and a water feature suitable for
swimming) to promote exercise. In addition, the substrate is concrete flooring, which can exacerbate mobility issues
and does not allow for digging, an important normal postural adjustment for bears. In light of the bear’s behavior,
weight issues and front limb angular deformities, the amount of space, furnishings, and the substrate are not
appropriate for this bear. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to provide an enclosure design
that facilitates normal social and postural adjustments appropriate for the individual bear’s medical needs. The
licensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to another facility in the near future. The animal
must be promptly evaluated by the attending veterinarian or safely transferred before the correction date. Correct by
December 15, 2016
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
***According to the licensee, the diet for the cougar includes deer carcasses, hamburger, whole store bought
turkeys, and chicken leg quarters. The diet for the bobcat consists of consists of raw chicken, turkey and deer meat
with some bones. Neither felid is receiving whole carcasses on a regular basis and the licensee stated that the meat
is not supplemented. The diet as stated may result in nutritional issues including, but not limited to amino acid
deficiencies, calcium deficiencies, calcium/phosphorus imbalances, and vitamin deficiencies. The diet should be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian, preferably with consultation from a nutritionist. Correct by November 15,
2016
On the second day of the inspection we observed the cougar being fed chicken parts. The animal rapidly ate the
food and when it was finished it licked the concrete flooring where the food had been. An associate veterinarian of
the Attending Veterinarian’s clinic observed the animal and recommended feeding to satiety. Food must be offered
in appropriate quantities as per the veterinarian’s recommendation. Correct by November 15, 2016
***The diet for the bear includes dog food, fruit, and corn. The bear appeared very agitated and hungry when the
licensee offered food, and inspectors observed the bear finishing all the scattered dog kibble within a few minutes.
Bears require a large variety of foods, and in the winter they should have a seasonally appropriate diet and be
allowed to feed to satiety, as per their normal seasonal metabolic requirements. Consult with the attending
veterinarian on an appropriate weight reduction program that takes into account the bears seasonal nutritional
needs. The licensee informed the inspectors that the animal will be transferred to another facility in the near future.
The animal must have its diet evaluated by the attending veterinarian (preferably in consultation with a nutritionist)
or safely transferred before the correction date for diet evaluation. Correct by November 15, 2016
***According to the licensee, the diet for the Patagonian cavies is approximately 90% rabbit pellets, with about 10 to
15% orchard grass/clover mix hay. Fresh fruits and vegetables are provided only sporadically. Caviids require
vitamin C in their diet, and insufficient amounts may result in deficiency and disease. In lieu of a vitamin Csupplemented pelleted diet, these animals require appropriate types and amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables or
another effective method of supplementation to meet this nutritional need. The animal must have its diet evaluated
by the Attending Veterinarian. Correct by November 15, 2016
***The potbellied pig was fed chow directly on the enclosure floor, which was contaminated with damp straw mixed
with feces and urine. Contaminated food may compromise health and lead to disease. Provided food must be clean,
wholesome and palatable. Correct by October 14, 2016
3.130
WATERING.
The bear’s water receptacle had about one half inch of water at the bottom of the approximately 2 foot by 1 foot by
six inch pan. We observed the bear visiting the water receptacle a few times but it did not appear to drink. When the
water receptacle was refilled the bear promptly went to drink. Insufficient fresh potable water may result in
dehydration. Water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Corrected at
the time of inspection.

Cleaning of Enclosures
***The bear enclosure contained several piles of fecal waste and puddles of urine.
***The Patagonian cavy enclosure contained numerous fecal pellets.
***The potbellied pig enclosure contained damp straw mixed with feces and urine.
***The Cape porcupine shelter contained damp, dirty straw bedding.
***The cougar’s bathing receptacle contained greenish water filled with debris.
Exposure to excessive amounts of feces and urine, soiled bedding and dirty water my pose a disease hazard to the
animals. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals with excreta,
minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
3.131(c) REPEAT

Housekeeping
***There is pokeweed in and around the zebu enclosure, and also scattered in other areas of the facility. Pokeweed
is poisonous to livestock. The pokeweed must be removed for the safety of the animals.
***The old coatimundi enclosure (no animals present) is in disrepair and has not been cleaned of old bedding and
empty feed bags. Empty dirty enclosures can become living areas for pests and need to be cleaned in a timelymanner to promote health and well-being of the animals.
***The rhea shelter (side adjacent to sheep enclosure) has metal that is bent upward, exposing a sharp edge. The
sharp edge is accessible to the sheep in the adjacent enclosure and could cause injury. The sharp edges from the
siding must be removed to prevent injury to the sheep.

Pest Control
Numerous rat holes were observed around the bear enclosure in the area of the den, the prairie dog enclosure,
cavy enclosure, cape porcupine enclosure, and pheasant enclosures. Rats are known to carry various disease
hazards and a safe and effective pest control program is required for animal health. Additional measures to prevent
harborage, i.e. filling in holes to prevent recolonization, must be implement to ensure an effective means of
controlling the rodent population.

EMPLOYEES.
***There are currently 55 mammals and several non-regulated animals housed at the facility. Based upon the
number animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal, maintenance, and
veterinary care there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry
responsibilities of the facility on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out
the day to day husbandry duties and maintenance or the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to
ensure that cleaning, animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at
professionally acceptable level for the current number of animals housed at the facility.
