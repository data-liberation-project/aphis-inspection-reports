RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
Review of disposition records shows that the facility has brokered the sale of two snow macaques and one java
macaque over the last year. No acquisition records were available to show the name and address of the person
who owned the monkeys, their USDA license number (or vehicle license number and State and driver's license
number and State if not licensed), date of acquisition and description of the monkeys (to include species, sex, date
of birth, color and markings). Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's
identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. Correct from this day forward.
Exit conducted with facility representative.
