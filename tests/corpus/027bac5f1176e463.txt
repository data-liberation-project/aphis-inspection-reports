The rhinoceros in the drive through portion of the park has an area without a public barrier fence and no park
employees were present. Also part of the barrier fence present has fallen and large gaps are present. This animal is
in a location where the public could easily access this animal. Animals on exhibit must either have public barriers,
and/or clearly identified park personnel in the vicinity to ensure safety of visitors and exhibit animals.

feed in paper pepsi cups that had been purchased at the gift shop. There were no park employees present during
this public/ animal interaction. The facility representative stated that the public can purchase 14% creeper pellets at

inspectors present observed this animal feeding occuring numerous times during the inspection without any park
attendant present. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Just inside the front cattle guard, a section of fence line on the hill is down. This fence is part of the first enclosurefence line. This is an ineffective barrier which does not adequately contain the animals within their enclosure, and is
also a potential source of injury. A nearby section of fence has a large fallen tree on the fence. The tree must be
removed, and the fence line must be repaired and maintained in good condition.
- In the section just inside the first cattle guard towards the back by the tiger enclosure there was an Oryx outside
the two perimeter fences. The perimeter fences are a chain link and a field fence. This animal was observed outside
the perimeter fences by both inspectors during the inspection. The facility representative stated this was the
perimeter fence and the property behind was recently purchased by the facility and no animals have been moved to
this area. The facility represenative also stated that 5 Oryx had escaped in the past but they had been captured and
returned. The facility failed to contain the animal. The facility shall be structurally sound and in good repair to protect
and contain the animals.
- In the section just inside the first cattle guard by the building where animal feed was previously sold were loose
boards with exposed nails pointing up. These boards with exposed nails pose a risk of injury to any animal in this
area of the park. This was corrected during the inspection by the facility representative.
- In the section just inside the first cattle guard towards the back fence leading out of this area was a loose roll of
field fence wire laying next to the fence. This wire poses a risk of injury to any animal in this area of the park. This
was corrected by the facility representative at the time of the inspection.
- In the Serengeti area, there is a large shelter which is in poor repair. There are numerous exposed nails, and
multiple sharp edges of sheet metal in this enclosure. This poses a risk of injury to any animals using the shelter.
The shelter must be repaired or replaced, and maintained appropriately.
- The tiger enclosure is composed of fencing with kick-ins at the top. In several places, gaps are present between
the kick-ins and the underlying fence. These gaps are a potential avenue of escape for enclosed animals, and must
be secured to help ensure the tiger is adequately contained.
- The area just north of the pond has a cross fence that is down. This down fence is in the enclosure with the
Prezwalski horses. This is a potential soucre of injury to these animals. The fence line must be repaired and
maintained in good condition or removed if not necessary.
3.125 REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. - The food storage shed for the park contained a open bags of food, with a portion of the contents spilled
onto the floor. The shed also had a considerable amount of spilled feed beneath the pallets and along the walls.
Spilled feed is an attractant for rodents and pests, which could potentially lead to contamination of stored feed and
bedding in the area. The area immediately around the food storage shed was also overgrown with weeds, and
contained several items of unused material. This is potential harborage for pests and rodents. The area around the
storage shed should be cleared to help prevent rodent/pest infestation.
