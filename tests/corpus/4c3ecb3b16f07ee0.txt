2.75(b)(3)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The disposition of two ring-tailed lemurs and two hedgehogs by the licensee occurred without the information
required under this section accompanying the animals and was not retained by the licensee. The lack of paperwork
containing this information does not provide the acquisition information for the recipients and does not allow for
tracking of animals by APHIS officials as necessary. Ensure all required information under this section accompanies
animals during transport. Correct immediately.
3.80(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two primary enclosures containing a total of ten lemurs had the following noted during inspection:
---One enclosure has two holes, one in the wall and one in the ceiling, large enough for the infant lemur to possibly
crawl into or cause injury.
---One enclosure has a section of the wire panel that is weakened and now bowing. The holes in the panel are
large enough for the lemur's fingers to go through. Electrical wire running just outside of this area of the enclosure
is close enough for the lemur's to potentially grab onto.
Holes, weakened enclosure panels and accessible electrical wires are physical hazards that could potentially cause
injury or possibly death by electrocution. Eliminate the physical hazards and maintain primary enclosures in a
condition to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 5/27/16.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three primary enclosures housing one bobcat, one porcupine and four Patagonian Cavies have one or more
gaps/holes running along the underside of the enclosure fence large enough where the animal(s) could potentially
escape or cause injury, or could allow access by pests or other animals from the outside of the enclosure. Repair
the primary enclosures to eliminate gaps/holes, to contain the animals and to prevent access pests or otheranimals.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
A bag of food being fed to the skunks was contaminated with a beetle-type insect. Contaminated food does not
ensure the food is wholesome and may cause illness to the animals. Store food in a such a way as to ensure it is
wholesome and to prevent it from becoming contaminated. Correct immediately.
Note: The contaminated feed was disposed of at the time of inspection.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
A garbage can without a tight fitting lid and filled with discarded food was knocked over and laying in an enclosure
accessible by approximately 9 goats, 5 sheep, 1 alpaca, and 1 pig. The animals were able to access the garbage
and ingest it. Garbage is not wholesome feed for the animals and can cause illness if ingested Place all trash and
trash containers in designated areas and dispose of in a timely manner to protect the health of the animals. Correct
immediately.
Note: All previous veterinary care issues identified during the last inspection on 3/28/2016 were addressed by the
licensee with his Attending Veterinarian.
