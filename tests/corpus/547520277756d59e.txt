2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
All adult dogs must have proper identification on their body. The four beagles, identification numbers 14, 16, 12,
and 26; two pugs, identification numbers 8 and 5; and one Boston terrier, identification number 3; need to have their
collars reattached. This will help dogs to be properly id when they are moved around, breeding dates, and
medicated/vaccinated. If tattoo is going to be a choice of identification, a request needs to be sent in to the
Regional Office. The owner must properly put identification on these dogs. Correct by 02-08-2014
