2.31(d)(8) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On July 23, 2021 a shipment of two pigs was received on a surgical trauma training protocol. On July 24, 2021 the two
pigs should have been transferred to the departmental training protocol and utilized in a non-invasive survival training
procedure. Once the training procedure was completed they would then return to the original protocol. Instead the pigs
remained on the surgical trauma training protocol which did not include survival training procedures. During the procedure
one pig expired which was attributed to stress related issues by the attending veterinarian. The IACUC did not approve
the use of the pigs for the survival training procedures. Any activity involving the care and use of animals on an approved
protocol may not be changed by officials without further review and approval by the IACUC. Correct from this day forward.

Personnel qualifications.
While inspecting ferrets in a room requiring a mask to be worn an employee was not wearing it. There was a sign on the
door specifying the proper PPE required to enter the room. It was also mentioned that it wasn't the first time that this
employee did not wear their mask. During the inspection of the clean side of a cage wash in RSB the temperature logs
were reviewed and it was revealed that the employees were not following the facilities SOP to record the cage wash
temperatures by applying the indicator strips when the cage wash was being operated. They had not applied the indicator


strips to the log since April 2021.
The employees were provided proper training and given standard operating procedures to follow. They were ignoring the
training and not following the SOP's provided. The facility should be reviewing the employees qualifications to properly
carry out the guidelines set in the SOP with sufficient frequency to fulfill the research facility's responsibilities. Correct
immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
