2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written program of veterinary care has not been updated since the acquisition of two coatis in July of 2022.
The PVC provides instructions to the licensee for the proper health care of animals that they maintain. Without these
directions from the veterinarian for care, husbandry and feeding practices, particularly for species not previously owned by
the facility, the animals may experience improper care, illness, or discomfort.
The facility must have the program of veterinary care updated to reflect all animals on hand and at least updated
whenever new species are acquired.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility does not maintain records of acquisition and disposition of animals at the facility. The records, for example, do
not contain the acquisition or recording of the two coatis as being on hand. The records do not show the disposition of five
pantagonian cavies and a capybara that are no longer at the facility. The records do not include the death of a rabbit that
was previously held by the facility.
The record of animals on hand, with full acquisition and disposition records, are important to assure that all animals are


located during an emergency of natural disaster, particularly if facility representatives with a working knowledge of the
inventory is not available. These records are also reviewed by APHIS officials to assure that animals are obtained from
appropriate sources and as a measure to assure appropriate animal care.
These records must be updated routinely and maintained in the future to reflect animal arrivals and departures from the
facility. By the time of the inspection report delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22), the APHIS Form
7019 was updated to reflect acquisition and disposition of animals that were on hand or were previously listed as being in
hand.

2.75(b)(3)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not assuring that one copy of the information required by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) is accompanying
the shipment of animals from their facility, including the name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold or
given; the date of purchase, acquisition, sale, or disposal of the animal(s); the species of the animal); and the number of
animals in the shipment. The facility is further not keeping a copy of this information, as required by the AWA regulations.

These records are reviewed to assure that facilities obtaining and housing animals, particularly exotic animals, have the
experience and facilities to properly care for these animals and are licensed or registered with the USDA, as applicable.
The facility must document and maintain the records required by this regulation and other relevant parts of the Animal
Welfare Act.

Contingency planning.


The facility has no documented contingency plan nor any training of personnel for plans related to an emergency of
natural disaster.
Without a plan and prior consideration of actions to be taken in the event of an emergency or natural disaster, actions to
prevent escape, injury, or death of animals might be needlessly delayed, resulting in harm to the animals.
A contingency plan must be developed, documented and followed, with training of all facility personnel. The plan must be
reviewed at least annually. By the time of the inspection report delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22),
a partial contingency plan had been written.

Facilities, general.
The primary enclosure of the two coatis had two areas that were repaired because the coatis broke open and escaped
into the inside of the facility. The repairs and where the two panels were originally joined had numerous sharp points.
There was an open electrical light switch box that was adjacent to the primary enclosure of the coatis and within reach;
the facility representative stated that it was no longer in use.
The primary enclosure for the fennec foxes had a large loop of wire of at least two to three feet that was used to attach
solid side panels to the wire mesh.
The exterior of the building where the otters have an external pen has wooden siding that has been stripped of paint and
the underlying bare wood is exposed. The damage might have been caused by the otters themselves.
The sharp points might cause injury to the coatis. Additionally, the coatis might again escape from their primary enclosure
and leave the building through the opening made for the otters. One of the fennec foxes might get a leg caught or
strangulate on the wire if either gets caught in it.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the


animals from injury and to contain the animals. Defective areas must be repaired. By the time of the inspection report
delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22), the hazards related to sharp or entanglement with wire were
rectified in the coati and fennec fox enclosures, respectively. For the coati enclosure, the area where the two wire panels
joined and where the coatis had escaped was corrected by placing a sealed board to that junction.

Facilities, general.
Every surface of the refrigerator that was used to store perishable food was dirty and contaminated with unknown
substances. The shelves of the refrigerator were variably coated with dried fluids of multiple colors, including white, tan,
brown, green and red. There was an empty bag with a red fluid that was consistent in appearance to blood. One shelf had
cardboard that was stuck to it that appeared to have been from a box that had been stored, saturated in an unknown fluid
that dried and caused the underside of the box to adhere. The doors and handles of the stainless-steel refrigerator had a
film over them. The top of the refrigerator had a layer of dust and a bin of food that was for a rabbit that was no longer at
the facility.
At least two cans of cat food with best by dates of “August 14 22” were present on food preparation area.
Two opened bags of food for the coatis were present.
Food that is stored under these conditions may become contaminated and, when fed to animals, might cause them to
become sick or diseased.
The facility must assure proper storage and protection of food, to include but not limited to routine cleaning, maintenance
and use of appropriate means to assure that food is adequately protected.
By the time of the inspection report delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22), the facility had cleaned the


refrigerator and rectified the other conditions cited. However, a system to assure future protection should be established.

Watering.
3.130 Watering
There was no water receptacle in the primary enclosure for the two Asian small-clawed otters. The facility representatives
stated that the otters drank from their swim tank and that this tank was dumped and refilled every other day. This tank
contained water that was purplish-brown, murky, opaque with leaves and other debris in it. When the tank was dumped,
the water had a stagnant odor reminiscent of old mop-water or sewage. There was a large amount of sand and other
debris left in the tank after dumping. The appearance of the water was not consistent with being dumped the day before
and it is unknown when the otters had access to clean, potable water.
The water bowl for the two coatis was dry, as was the bottom of the primary enclosure. When offered water, they waited
at the hose in the bowl until water came out. They immediately drank water.
The lack of access to water or drinking unsanitary, contaminated water may cause disease or death in the animals. Water
receptacles that are not maintained and cleaned can also contaminate the water also leading to disease. If water is not
potable, animals may not drink or drink less than they should, potentially causing disease and discomfort.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal. The frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. All
water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
The receptacles for the coati and otters were cleaned and filled on the first day of the inspection. By the time of the
inspection report delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22), a water receptacle was added for the otters


and a larger water receptacle that would be difficult for the coati to dump was added to their enclosure.

Sanitation.
Upon entering the facility, there was an immediate overpowering stench of urine, feces and ammonia. The primary
enclosures for the coatis, kangaroo and fennec foxes had an accumulation of excreta. The facility representatives stated
that the enclosures of the kangaroo and fennec fox had been cleaned two days prior to the inspection, and the enclosure
for the coatis was raked the day before the inspection. The coati enclosure, however, had a build-up of dry, light brown
matter and dried feces in the corners. The fennec foxes had a mound of dried and recent feces, and the kangaroo
enclosure had feces strewn through the entire enclosure. The top of the otter den is used by the otters to defecate. The
surface is wood that has been sealed, but the exposure to the excrement has denuded the surface and it cannot be
sanitized. The facility had no schedule for the routine cleaning of these primary enclosures.
A buildup of excreta may cause disease in animals and the resulting odor may cause difficulty breathing, discomfort and
disease in the animals. The facility representatives began to clean during the inspection.
A system and schedule of routine cleaning and sanitization of the primary enclosures must be established and
maintained. By the time of the inspection report delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22), the accumulated
excreta had been removed and the air quality had improved to an acceptable level.

Sanitation.
There was a large accumulation of variety of materials such as husbandry supplies, textiles, containers, unused small
animal enclosures, and storage totes, with used bedding that were heaped under and near a table inside the building on


one end. The table had two open bags of food for the coatis. An empty plastic dog kennel and a storage tote were against
the chain-link of the primary enclosure of the kangaroo.
On the opposite end of the building had items that were used for cleaning and feeding the animals, some of which were
not in use. The only windows in the building are on that end and had an accumulation of dead flies and both windows had
a coating of fly "dirt" that was especially prominent on the window handles. The food preparation countertop area was
directly under on of these windows and the dead flies had fallen onto the surface. Dead flies were floating and
submerged in a cup holding a disinfecting solution and the scissors that had soiled handles and were used to cut fish for
the otters were in this cup.
The surface of the food preparation area had a film of material on it and had two old, dried-out, gray-tan shrimp tails on it.
The surface was made of wood that had spaces between and not impervious to moisture. No cutting boards were
present. Immediately under this food preparation surface and partially protruding were two plastic totes, one containing
hay cubes and the other dry feed. The plastic lids were corrugated and had a dried red fluid consistent with blood, which
one of the licensees said that it appeared to be blood, on the surface as well as dirt and other debris. The lids were
designed as tightly-fitting, but were not completely closed at the time of inspection.
The unsanitary conditions of the facility can attract pests and lead to illness in the animals.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate effective husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as
necessary to protect the health of the animals.
By the time of the inspection report delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22), the facility personnel
removed clutter and unnecessary items, cleaned and removed the accumulated dead flies.

3.131(d)

Sanitation.
The facility had an accumulation of dead flies in multiple areas of the facility, including the windowsills and food
preparation areas. There were multiple live flies primarily around the food preparation area and the refrigerator. While
there was a single sticky pull-down fly trap, it was not sufficient to control the size of the fly population that was and had
been in the facility.
One of the exterior doors has a gap underneath which could allow mice or other pests to enter the facility,
Flies and other pests can harbor diseases which might impact the health and well-being of the animals. By the time of the
inspection report delivery on the second day of the inspection (21-Oct-22), the accumulated dead flies were removed.
An effective system must be developed and maintained to control pests.

Employees.
The care, such as cleaning, feeding and watering, is conducted by the minor children and one 19-year-old child of the
licensees. The licensees are not supervising these children adequately or frequently enough to assure a professionally
acceptable level of husbandry practices as required by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). One licensee hasn't been in the
facility for at least three months and the other hasn't been in the facility for 3-4 weeks.
Without adequate supervision, conditions that are potentially detrimental to the health and welfare of the animals, such as
those observed during this inspection with cleaning of water receptacles and provision of potable water during this
inspection may occur.
The licensees must assure that those providing husbandry and humane care practices are capable, adequately trained,


and supervised in a manner to assure compliance with all applicable provisions of the AWA.
