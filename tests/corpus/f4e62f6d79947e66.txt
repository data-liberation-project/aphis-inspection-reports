ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two Fennec Fox(cid:25)s housed in an enclosure in the Nursery. One of the Fennec Fox(cid:25)s appears to be very
lethargic, as it would not move much and curled into a ball in the corner, while the other foxes were moving about.
This fox had very runny eyes with a greenish mucus discharge, and its left ear appeared to have a scabby material
sluffing from the inside out of the ear. The coat was very dull and (cid:24)puckery(cid:25) in appearance and the animal appeared
thin. The licensee advised that the eyes were being treated, however a veterinarian had not been consulted in
regards to the other issues.
There is a Great Dane with both eyes expelling a thick green mucus, with some crusty material around the rims of
the eyes. The eyes have not been cleaned, and a veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to this issue.
It is important for any health issue that has not been resolved shortly after treatments, or other symptoms appear
that a veterinarian is contacted and proper diagnosis and treatment is provided. An untreated or improperly
diagnosed issue can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort and can cause a treatable condition to become
chronic if left untreated.
The licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the Fennec Fox and the Great
Dane.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are Two dog enclosures near the Tiger pens each had wooden housing that was in various stages of
disrepair and unsealed. The 2 dogs with the coyote had planks of wood that were pulled apart at the roof and on the
sides, exposing nails, and the 2 Terrier dogs had unsealed and chewed wood attached to 4 sides of a wire dogkennel.
Unsealed wood can be a source of contamination due to bacteria and other health hazards being absorbed and the
inability to properly sanitize the surfaces the regulated animals come in contact with.
All surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals must be impervious to moisture and sanitized at least
once every 2 weeks. All chewed wood or plastic must be repaired or replaced.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The enclosure containing the Great Dane and Mastiff does not have an alternate shade not including the plastic
container used as a dog house. While there is shade cloth around the back panel and side of the enclosure, there is
no shade from the sun directly above the enclosure. This lack of overhead shade prevents the dogs from getting out
of the heat of the day.
Exposure to the sun without adequate shade can cause heat related health issues.
The licensee must provide one or more separate outside areas of shade that are large enough to contain all the
animals at one time and protect them from direct rays of the sun. The dog house shelter must also provide a wind
and rain break.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The guillotine door for 3 Ring-tailed Lemurs was broken and did not allow for the Lemurs to be able to get inside
their sheltered facility for the night hours, or to be able to obtain food or water.
The lack of food, water and shelter can cause un-necessary discomfort and stress to the animal.
The licensee must repair or replace the door and allow them access to shelter, food and water.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The 3 original enclosures Tiger Pen # 4: contains one tiger known as Nahandi, Tiger Pen #5: contains tiger known
as Glacier and lion known as Ungowwa, and Tiger Pen #1: containing a dog (Bandit) and a lion known as Chief are
still non-compliant with fencing being less than 12 ft high and no kick-ins or other means to ensure adequate
containment. An additional Pen #6 which is located next to Pen # 4 contains a young tiger male known as Tacova,
also has the same violation of fencing less than 12 ft in height.
In Tiger Pen # 2 containing 1 tiger there were numerous nails protruding 2-3 inches high from the two platforms on
the climbing tower. These nails remain after the wood has been removed, and pose a potential for injury if the tiger
climbs on to the platform areas. The nails need to be removed or pounded in to prevent them from being a source of
possible injury.
In Pen # 3 containing 4 tigers there is a portion of tin in one of the shelters that has been pulled away from the wall,
resulting in the pointed corners protruding into the shelter. This is a possible source of injury. The metal needs to be
repaired or replaced.
There is a section of fencing at the front of the Hyena enclosure that has been pulled apart, resulting in multiple
wires protruding into the enclosure, coming in contact with the hyenas, which can be a source of possible injury.
During the inspection a 6-9 inch piece of wire was poking the hyena in the chest as it was crowding up to the fence.
This fencing has been repaired in the past, however it continues to be torn apart and needs to be repaired more
securely or replaced to prevent this issue.
The shelter for a Cougar next to the Hyena has a roof that sits slanted on the top and the side wall is broken in the
middle allowing the shelter to look twisted and open to the elements from the side.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In all of the Tiger Pens #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6 and the one Cougar enclosure next to the Hyena enclosure there
is a large buildup of bones lying throughout the Pens. The bones take up approximately 40-50% of the floor space
where the animals come in contact with them when pacing the enclosures. The Cougar does have a moderate
buildup of feces between the water and shelter that needs to be addressed possibly more often than the current
removal program. The buildup of bones, feces and debris can be a source of disease or injury. The bones and debris must be cleaned
often enough to prevent the animals from coming into continual contact with it when they move throughout their
enclosure. There should be more than 70% of their enclosure free of feces, bones and debris.
The removal of waste materials must be done frequently enough to prevent the buildup in the enclosures and
prevent areas for vermin, disease and clutter to accumulate.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On the South side of the facility the 8ft perimeter fence has two poles that have been damaged and are bent
approximately 2 ft from the ground. Due to the angle of the bent fence posts the fencing is inadequate in height and
strength. On 2 poles there are no fence clips connected the fencing to the poles, resulting in a weak area of
perimeter fence approximately 20-40ft in length total, which is a possible escape route if challenged by an animal
trying to escape or get into the facility.
Broken, bent or damaged fence posts and fencing can be an avenue for escape or entry into the facility.
The licensee must repair or replace the weak and broken areas of Perimeter fencing.
