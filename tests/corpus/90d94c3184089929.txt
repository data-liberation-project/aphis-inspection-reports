ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee had a number of medications and supplements that had expired in the storage area. The licensee
informed me that the expired medications had not been used on regulated animals since expiring, but the
medications were still being held in storage areas for the regulated animals. The following medications were found
to be expired during inspection:
---BO-SE injection Ex. November 2015
---Neomycin Polymyxin B Ex. January 2014
---Fluxin Meguline Ex. October 2014
---Natural E-300 Ex. June 2014
Although the licensee stated he hasn't been using the expired medications on regulated animals, a mistake can be
made and any of the expired medications could accidentally be grabbed and used on a regulated animal. Expired
medications doesn't ensure that the product given to the animal is safe and of a high quality. The expired
medications could be ineffective and/or toxic to the animal(s). Expired medications cannot be stored in storage
areas for regulated animals and must not be used on regulated animals. Correct immediately.
