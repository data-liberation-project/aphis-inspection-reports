2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One 12-year-old male Miniature Poodle (#23, known as 'Bobo') was observed shaking its head, and dark drown
stains were visualized on the hair beneath his mouth. Upon closer review, the dog's left ear contained dark brown,
dry debris, and its teeth were observed to have thick buildup of brown material that encased multiple teeth and that
obstructed the view of the normal shapes of the teeth. A greyish-colored discharge was observed alongside the
gum line. The gum line had a dark pink appearance in some areas. Upon inquiring with the attending veterinarian,
the attending veterinarian conveyed that the licensee had not called for guidance to treat the animal, and the
attending veterinarian also conveyed not ever having seen the animal although it was procured several months ago.
Licensees are required to use appropriate methods, within the attending veterinarian's authority, to control,
diagnose, and treat diseases. Thick buildup of material on teeth and of discharge at the gum line can cause pain,
can decrease appetite, and can cause a deterioration of systemic health. Head shaking can be indicative of ear
pain, and the buildup of ear debris can damage ear health.
The licensee must have Dog #23 'Bobo' evaluated by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan.
