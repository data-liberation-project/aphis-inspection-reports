ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection at 11:30 am, I observed the female tiger cub laying down in a chain link enclosure with a
grass surface. When she began walking I noticed a limp favoring her left rear leg. The care takers were unaware
of the tigers lameness and failed to provide adequate care. Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of
adequate veterinary care. For the health and welfare of this tiger cub, she needs to be seen by a veterinarian.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection at 11:30 am, I observed the female tiger cub laying down in a chain link enclosure with a
grass surface. When she began walking I noticed a limp favoring her left rear leg. I ask both care takers
accompanying me on this inspection if they were aware of this cub limping. Both care takers were unaware of this
cub's lameness. It was stated stated that the cub had recently been seen by a local veterinarian. No documentation
was available during this inspection of the cubs recent visit to the veterinarian so I contacted him by phone. The
veterinarian was not aware of any lameness problems nor notified of her limp while walking. All animals need to be
observed daily and medical problems need to be addressed and conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner.

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
According to the care takers during this inspection, the female tiger cub's diet is pieces of chicken. This diet being
provided is not a complete nutritional diet. The current written diet addresses liquids and supplements for when this
cub was younger not eating solids. During this inspection, no food was present for the cubs diet, nor any nutritional
and calcium supplements. Food shall be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good
health. For the health and welfare of this tiger cub, this licensee needs to develop, document, and follow a complete
written diet approved by a veterinarian. The tiger cubs diet needs be updated as often as necessary. The diet needs
to address the type of meats, nutritional and or calcium supplements, including the daily quantity and frequency.
