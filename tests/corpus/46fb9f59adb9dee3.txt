ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- Four bottles of expired medications were found in the pharmacy and large animal treatment area. The
medications were: Dexamethasone SP, Glycopyrrolate, Buprenorphine, and injectable Penicillin. Two other bottles
of expired medications were properly marked as "Teaching purposes only" but were intermingled with other
medications in the pharmacy. Expired medications may have unpredictable effects, and cannot be used on
regulated animals. If the facility wants to keep expired medications for teaching purposes, those medications must
be clearly labeled and should be physically separated from medications which are available for treating patients.
Correct from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- Inspection of the outdoor runs found multiple broken wires along the enclosure sides. There are also resting
platforms in all four kennels which are covered with a metal grate. On three of these platforms, the edges of the
metal coverings are loose and protruding. The wire in this area is old and showing signs of rust and wear in multiple
areas. These kennels are not in adequate condition to house dogs. Loose metal edges and broken wires are a
potential source of injury or entrapment to dogs housed in these kennels. The metal and wire in these areas need
to be repaired or replaced before they are appropriate for housing regulated animals.
