ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At time of inspection a Basset Hound, a Poodle, and a Chihuahua had long toe nails on the right front feet.The toe
nails were an estimated 1 1/2 inches in length. The right foot toe nail was growing sideways. Long toe nails can be
painful causing discomfort when the dog is trying to walk. The potential for injury exists if the toe nail becomes
caught in the flooring. Lack of nail care on a regular basis can affect the health & well-being of that dog. The
licensee must establish a nail trim maintenance program for all dogs at the facility. To be corrected by 06-20-16

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection there was an outdoor shelter structure with wood surfaces that were no longer impervious to
moisture. Fourteen dogs were in contact with the wooden structure. Urine and rain could soak into the wood
allowing for rotting. The wood needs to be treated with paint, water sealer, or some type of material that will make it
impervious to moisture. To be corrected by 07-06-16,
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
