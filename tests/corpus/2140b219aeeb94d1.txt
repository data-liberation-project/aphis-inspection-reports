INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On six of the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols, the Study Director
(considered to be the Principal Investigator based on the SOP) approved their own protocols and amendments as a
member or representative of the IACUC.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review protocols
and amendments to protocols prior to approval. No member may participate in the IACUC review or approval of an
activity in which that member has a conflicting interest (e.g., is personally involved in the activity).
