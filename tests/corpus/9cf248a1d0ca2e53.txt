2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The river otter exhibit is constructed of a cement wall that varies in height from 18" - 24" due to the topography of
the land that it is on. Then on top of the cement wall is a 24” height chain link fence. However, the public can easily
stand on the cement wall and climb over the 2' section of chain link. There are no other precautions present to keep
the public from gaining access into the exhibit. This chain link section, on the wall, is not of sufficient height to
assure the safety of the animal. This will need to be addressed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During this inspection it was noted that the concrete wall of the river otter exhibit was in need of attention. Half of the
exhibit is dry land / den box, while the other half has a pool. The concrete is severely cracked along the water line
of this pool. There is also a leaking water line within this wall that may be undermining the strength of this wall. To
ensure the integrity of the wall this will need to be addressed.
