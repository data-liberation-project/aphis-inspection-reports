Committee and delivered in a timely manner. The Dec 2018 report was not approved in writing until April, and
therefore was not updated in a timely manner. Reports to the IO shall be updated at least once every six months
upon completion of the required semi-annual evaluations.
Correct from this date forward.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The large outdoor pastures do not have sufficient shelter to provide protection and to prevent discomfort. The
available shelter does not provide protection from the wind or rain, it is a metal awning with no sides. The past
winter has been unseasonably rainy and the animals have not had sufficient shelter to get out of the rain and wind.
Appropriate shelters for the local climatic conditions shall be provided for all animals.
