ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple injectable drugs were noted to be expired including Telazol, Ketamine, Dexdomitor and Ivermectin. These
drugs were found in multiple locations around the zoo. Expired medication is not to be used on regulated species as
the efficacy of the drug is no longer guaranteed. Medications must be reviewed regularly to ensure that only drugs
that are in date are used.

SANITATION.
All the surfaces in the Bongo barn were found to be covered in dust and cobwebs. This was believed to be caused,
in part by, the dirt placed in one stall. The buildings on the grounds must be kept clean in order to ensure optimal
health of the animals on the premises. Surfaces must be wiped down as often as necessary to create a clean
environment.
