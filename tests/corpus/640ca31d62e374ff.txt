2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 4 guinea pigs with health conditions requiring treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or
consultation with the attending veterinarian.
There were 2 guinea pigs with masses under the chin. A brown and white adult guinea pig in Pen 1 and a black adult
guinea pig in Pen 2 had firm, movable masses under the chin approximately 1 inch in size. The animals were in good
body condition and did not appear lethargic.
There were 2 guinea pigs with skin conditions. A tri-color weanling guinea pig in Pen 4 and a black weanling guinea pig in
Pen 9 had areas of hair loss and crusty skin near the right and left eye respectively.
The licensee had not observed the health conditions in the guinea pigs, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and
was not administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the conditions and provided
treatment options.
Masses under the chin and abnormal skin can cause discomfort and spread to other animals if contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to
determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 535 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of
adults, weanlings, or newborns present for the last few months.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 48.8 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. There was a heat
source running at a low level. There were some pens that the sun was shining into through the window and the guinea
pigs were observed to be crowded in that area for warmth.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

Watering.


There was a build-up of wet brown grime on the platforms under the automatic waterers. The licensee said he was
unsure when the pens were last cleaned but said it may have been a month.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
3.31(a)(1) Direct

Sanitation.
All of the guinea pig enclosures contained thick mats of solid fecal material with no clean bedding available. When the
inspector used a gloved hand to dig into the bedding, there was a layer of fecal material several inches thick. The
licensee was unsure when he last cleaned but said it may have been a month.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.
