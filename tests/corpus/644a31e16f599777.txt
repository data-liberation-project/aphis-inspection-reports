***DIRECT: A female Neopolitan Mastiff (m/c# 900000000091586) had a thick gray discharge in both eyes. The
skin around the eyes was also swollen, with the right eye being more severely affected. Eye problems can progress
rapidly, can be painful, and can result in loss of vision. The licensee was verbally instructed to have this dog
examined by a veterinarian by July 02, 2016. The licensee must follow all the recommendations for treatment and
must maintain documentation of the examination and treatments for future review by APHIS officials.
***Five dogs had skin conditions that needed to be evaluated by a veterinarian.
1. A female Neopolitan Mastiff (m/c# 900000000091586; same dog as listed above) had thinning hair on her neck.
2. A female Neopolitan Mastiff (m/c# 900000000091598) had hair loss under her neck and on her chest.
3. A brown and white, adult, female French Bulldog named Colleen (m/c# 0801335740) had a 1 inch area of hair
loss and moist, reddened skin on the right side of her head. She also had a 1 inch X 2 inch area of hair loss and
moist, reddened skin on her left shoulder above the elbow.
4. A brown and white, adult, female English Bulldog named Chloe (m/c# 0A01442158) had a 2 inch area of hair loss

hair loss and moist, reddened skin on the back of her neck.
Skin conditions can be painful, can be contagious to other dogs, and can be the result of parasites or an underlying
medical condition. The licensee must consult her veterinarian about these skin problems, must follow the
veterinarian's recommendations, and must document the diagnosis and treatments given for review by APHIS
officials.
***A partially used box of puppy vaccine (Duramune Max5) had an expiration date of 09 May, 2016. The vaccine
was located in the refrigerator with other medications ready for use. Expired medications or vaccines can lose their
effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all
medications and vaccines are within their expiration dates at all times.
2.75(a)(1)RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee's Dogs on Hand (APHIS form 7005) listed 42 adult dogs at the facility. However, the inspector
counted 64 adult dogs (16 weeks old or older) at the facility during the inspection. Properly completed acquisition
records are necessary for identification of dogs to facilitate record-keeping requirements for inventory, disposition,
transport, and healthcare. The licensee must update the Record of Acquisition and maintain the record on a regular
basis so that it always has accurate information regarding acquisition, identification, and disposition for all dogs.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the elements.
One outdoor enclosure contained two adult Wiemeraners and one shelter. Another outdoor enclosure contained
two Neopolitan Mastiffs and one shelter. Neither of the shelters had a wind/rain break. Shelters must provide
protection from the rain and wind. The licensee must provide wind/rain breaks for all shelters.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the elements.
***One outdoor enclosure contained two adult Wiemeraners and one shelter. Another outdoor enclosure contained
two Neopolitan Mastiffs and one shelter. The shelters were not large enough to allow both dogs to sit, stand, lie in a
normal manner, and to turn about freely.
***Two outdoor enclosures, each housing 3 Australian shepherds, did not have any type of shelter.
Shelters are necessary to provide protection from direct rays of the sun, rain, and wind. The licensee must provide
shelters for all animals and must ensure that the shelters are of adequate size to allow all dogs within the enclosure
to sit, stand, lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
In the concrete sheltered building, two enclosures had a buildup of fecal material on the inside portion of the
enclosures. The piles of fecal material had been removed; however, the majority of the inside portions had a layerof dried fecal matter that had been spread by the dogs smearing the feces on the floor with their feet. Also, one of
the enclosures had a buildup of dirt and grime on a wall. Fecal material, dirt, and grime can soil the dogs, can
create disease hazards and odor, and can attract pests and insects. The licensee must clean the primary
enclosures as frequently as necessary to remove accumulation of feces, dirt, and grime.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JULY 4, 2016.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest Control.
There is inadequate pest control as evidenced by an accumulation of rodent fecal matter in several areas within the
concrete sheltered building. The rodent feces was present on a shelf as well as on the floor, including next to the
stored bags of dog food. Rodents and other pests can transmit disease and can contaminate food supplies. The
licensee must establish an effective pest control program.

Agriculture.
