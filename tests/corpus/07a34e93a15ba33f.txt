2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female black Pug (“Coalcreek Storm”, DOB 5-4-16, Microchip 990000000335432) has an abnormal appearance to both
eyes. The right eye appears cloudy and is light blue in color. There is a buildup of eye discharge on both eyes. The
licensee stated she is giving eye drops she purchased from the store. The licensee also stated she’s not documenting the
pug’s treatment, the pug hasn’t been to the vet for her eyes, and she doesn’t have a protocol set forth by her vet to treat
eyes. Poor eye health could cause pain or discomfort to the dog.

This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan.
The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

A female “older” cream colored poodle has heavy buildup of brown tartar and organic material on the upper and lower
canines, incisors, premolars, and molars. The brown tartar is covering the majority of the surface of the teeth and the
gums are slightly reddened with a foul smelling odor. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort as well as lead
to further health issues. The licensee isn't following their program of vet care that states teeth must be checked monthly.


This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment plan.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

Due to repeat non-compliances the licensee has decided to cancel their license effective immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
