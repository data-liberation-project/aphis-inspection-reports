ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There was a bottle of Oxytocin located in the refrigerator with an expiration date from 2008. This medication was
intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the kennel and are therefore ready for use.
Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. The licensee
must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with
standard veterinary practices and manufacturer(cid:25)s recommendations.
To be corrected by September 30, 2014.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
