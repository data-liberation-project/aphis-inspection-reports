FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The northeast side of the fencing for pasture #1 has a large section that is damaged. This pasture was accessible to
at least 2 llama and several sheep and goats at the time of this inspection. Supporting structures and wires adjacent
to the gate are broken and in disrepair compromising structural integrity of the fence. Farther down from the gate on
the same side other fence wires are bent and loose. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and safely contain the animals.The fence should be
repaired or replaced.

SANITATION.
Excessive numbers of black flies were noted in an enclosure housing pigs in the front of the open air barn and an
enclosure toward the rear of the barn housing sheep and goats. The flies were especially concentrated on a large
sow lying on the ground and the top of a feeder for the small ruminants. Flies can cause psychological and physical
distress to the animals and transmit diseases. An effective program for the control of insects must be maintained.
