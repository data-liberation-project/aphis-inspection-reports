cleaned and sanitized. Specifically the Saki and Tamarin, Emperor Tamarin and Black & White Ruffed Lemur nest
boxes were no longer sealed with paint. In the Squirrel monkey night house, the wood frame of the door is
damaged and no longer sealed.
All surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates must be able to be readily cleaned and sanitized. A system of
maintaining contact surfaces which can be readily cleaned and sanitized to ensure the health and well-being of the
animals must be in place.
