ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 am on
11-Jan-18.
** I called and texted the facility when I was 30 minutes away. The owner returned my call stating he was
unavailable and could not conduct the inspection. I left the area at 11:00 am.
