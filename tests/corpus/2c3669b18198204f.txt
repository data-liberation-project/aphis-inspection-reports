Protocol #2011-0394 involves the use of Complete Freund's adjuvant. The use of this adjuvant can potentially
cause more than slight or momentary pain, therefore the search is incomplete and cannot assure that there are no
alternatives available.
Protocol #2014-0635 and #2009-0064 are teaching protocols that involve surgeries. The searches conducted do
not include the actual surgical procedures being conducted. Without including the surgical procedures that may
cause the pain or distress the search in incomplete.
The IACUC shall review the protocols to ensure that the investigator has considered alternatives to all procedures
that may cause pain or distress.

2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The justification for the number of animals used in protocol #2009-0064 does not clearly provide a rational for the
number of animals to be used. A proposal to conduct activities involving the use of animals must provide an
appropriate rational for the number of animals to be used on the protocol.
The IACUC shall review the protocol to ensure appropriate justification is provided for the number of animals
involved.
