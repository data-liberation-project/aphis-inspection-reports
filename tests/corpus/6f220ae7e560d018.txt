ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The facility written program of veterinary care (PVC) was not available for review
during this inspection. The licensee informed the APHIS official that the PVC was left with the attending
veterinarian to review and update. The written PVC includes the preventive health care instructions from the
veterinarian for the facility animals and is reviewed during inspections to see if the licensee is following the
instructions for the health care of the animals. A copy of the PVC must be available at the facility for review by
APHIS officials and for use by the licensee. Correct by March 22, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility president.
