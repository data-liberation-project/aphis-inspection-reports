HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the rhesus and bonnet macaques night house the wooden floor had moisture damage and evidence of stains.
There was also a pungent odor coming from the night house. The night house should be made of materials and
constructed in a manner to allow it to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed and replaced when worn or
soiled for the well-being of the animals. Corrected by exit interview.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
** In the Grey-cheeked mangabey's night house there was excessive accumulation of dried hard feces covering the
floor. There was also a foul odor present. Feces must be removed from inside the night house daily to prevent the
nonhuman primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. Corrected by
exit interview.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The primary enclosure housing 6 patagonian cavies had a hole that went beneath the fence. The mouth of the
hole was about 10-12 inches wide and about 4-6 inches tall. The hole poses a risk of escape to the animals. A
system should be in place and maintained to ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to
contain the animals.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the Director and Dr. Simone Tomlinson.
