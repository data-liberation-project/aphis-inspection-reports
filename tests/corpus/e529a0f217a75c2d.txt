2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult Jacob sheep ram was noted to have an old horn injury. The horn closest to the left ear was completely broken at
the base. The facility and the AV had not observed or treated this injury prior to today’s inspection. The AV was
contacted during this inspection and the licensee followed the provided guidance. The horn area showed no active
discharge or inflammation and the sheep appeared in good health. Daily observations of animals are important so that
injuries such as this are noted in a timely manner, and that proper veterinary care can be provided upon such observation.
Daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being are required, as is a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication so that timely and accurate information is conveyed to the Attending Veterinarian. Correct by
March 30, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
