2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care has not been reviewed since September 2016, which was also the last time
the Attending Veterinarian visited the site.
The written Program of Veterinary Care should be reviewed and updated at least once per year. The Attending
Veterinarian should visit the site, and provide guidance on animal care issues, on a regular basis; at minimum
annually. Failure to conform to these requirements could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the
animals.
The facility should work with the Attending Veterinarian to update the written Program of Veterinary Care, schedule
regular visits with the Attending Veterinarian, and ensure that the animal care procedures outlined in the written
Program of Veterinary Care are followed, in order to advance the health and well-being of the animals.
To be corrected by 3/1/18.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for the goats contained elements that are potentially hazardous to the animals:
- The wire mesh panels that comprise the gate and fencing are sagging, and present a risk for entanglement or
escape.
Some of the exotic feline enclosures were in need of repair:
- In the inside shelter enclosure for "Mystery" the linoleum on the floor was peeling, and deteriorating.
- Some feline enclosures had wire mesh panels that were damaged, exposing pointed wire ends, and openings
that pose a risk of entanglement.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and / or escape. Sharp
objects could cause injury, and sagging or damaged wire panels could result in injury from entanglement, or
escape. Deteriorating surfaces present an ingestion risk, threaten structural strength, and impede cleaning. Animal enclosures should be free of objects that could cause injury to the animals. Enclosures should be
maintained in good repair, so that they can be kept clean. Enclosures should be regularly repaired so as to maintain
their structural integrity and prevent escape or injury.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The hay was stored in a small shed that was open, and the hay was strewn about, onto the ground. There were
chickens scratching through the hay. Some of the hay was discolored and clumped together, suggestive of mold.
Food should be stored in a manner which adequately protects it against deterioration, molding, or contamination by
vermin. Failure to properly store animal food could be detrimental to the animals. Contaminated / deteriorated food
shall be discarded, and all food shall be stored properly from this time forward.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Throughout the facility there was evidence of a severe rat infestation, including the presence of rat feces in animal
enclosures, especially near feline food bowls. One rat was observed sitting on top of an exotic feline enclosure in
broad daylight.
Vermin can transmit disease and contaminate food. Rats could bite felines that attempt to hunt them. The presence
of rat feces around food and bedding is unsanitary. The facility should work with professional exterminators to
address this serious vermin infestation.
This inspection was conducted by Dr. Smith, with the facility director. An exit interview was conducted on 2/6/18
and was additionally attended by Dr. Gage, Big Cat Specialist, and the Attending Veterinarian for the facility.
