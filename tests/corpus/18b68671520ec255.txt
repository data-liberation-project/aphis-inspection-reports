FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Binturong Enclosure (ante-room of sun bear enclosure): The metal support poles are showing excessive wear.
The bottom front and the center metal support poles are excessively rusty. Portions of the poles have deteriorated
leaving rough edges and holes in the pole exposing the center. Support beams provide structure to an enclosure.
Excessively rusty poles indicates a break in the integrity of the enclosure. Also, the holes in the poles can provide
area for pests to harbor and make cleaning and sanitation less effective. The support poles should be replaced or
repaired in such a manner to ensure the structural strength of the enclosure and to facilitate established husbandry
practices. Correct by May 13, 2016.

***Sun Bear Building (ante-room): There is an excessive buildup of debris on fans and in corners of the area. A
build-up of debris can lessen the effectiveness of fans and create a place for vermin to harbor. An effective cleaning
and sanitation schedule or methods for buildings and other items in a animal area should be established. The
building must be properly cleaned and a process to ensure cleaning is performed on an effective schedule must be
established. Correct by May 10, 2016 - some areas were corrected at the time of inspection.
