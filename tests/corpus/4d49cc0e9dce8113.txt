3.81(c)(1)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81(c)(1) Special considerations: An infant male vervet was removed from its mother because she was not
producing milk and is being hand raised by the facility employees. The 6.5 week old vervet was being cared for at
the home of an employee not present at the facility. The infant vervet was brought to the facility during the
inspection to be seen by the APHIS official and appeared healthy. The facility plan for environment enhancement to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates does not provide a written description of the diet and
daily care of the infant vervet being hand raised. Improper diet or amounts may affect the growth and health of the
vervet. Not meeting his social and environmental needs may cause the infant psychological distress and affect his
behavioral development.

Infants and young juvenile nonhuman primates require special attention regarding enhancement of their
environment, based on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending
veterinarian. Correct by providing a written description approved by the attending veterinarian for the infant vervet
regarding his diet/feeding and his daily care to meet his social and environmental needs. Correct by October 20,
2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility employee.
