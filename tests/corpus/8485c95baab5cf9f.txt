MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
Records indicate that on 1-16-2015 three puppies less than 8 weeks old were sold to a pet store. They were 52
days old instead of the required minimum of 56 days old. Transporting puppies under 8 weeks of age may increase
their risks of health problems. Puppies from a USDA licensed facility must be at least 8 weeks old and weaned prior
to being sold or transported in commerce.
Correct from this day forward.
