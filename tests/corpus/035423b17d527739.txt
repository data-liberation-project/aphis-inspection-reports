2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A female sheep was observed standing against the back wall in her pen. Her right eye was not visible due to a
black crusty substance over the eye. The licensee stated he had treated the animal with antibiotics but the eye had
not cleared up. He did not consult with the vet after antibiotic treatment to have the animal examined or determine
next steps in a treatment plan, including pain management. There needs to be a protocol established so that
communication with the vet is required in a timely manner to accurately convey information on problems of animals
health. This needs to be addressed for the health and well being of the animals.
