RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of acquisition and disposition for recently acquired rabbits and guinea pigs were not available at inspection.
Every exhibitor must keep and maintain records which contain the required information on animals which are
transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor. Facility corrected the records during
inspection.
3.27(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Guinea pigs were housed outdoors in a hutch with the rabbits without a variance. The guinea pigs were removed
from the rabbit hutch during inspection and placed in a transfer cage, but still need to be moved indoors or a
variance obtained. Steps should be taken immediately to ensure the well-being of the guinea pigs, and the licensee
should either request and be granted permission for outdoor housing, or make other arrangements for housing
guinea pigs

CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
The facility is currently housing guinea pigs with rabbits in the same outdoor hutch. The guinea pigs and 4
additional rabbits were recently acquired as a group and showed no signs of incompatibility. Housing guinea pigs
with other species may affect their health and well-being and increase their risk of injury. A system should be in
place and maintained to ensure guinea pigs are not housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species.
The guinea pigs were removed from the enclosure during inspection and placed in a temporary transfer cage.
