ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The same white with black spots pot belly pig cited last year for partially not bearing weight on her right front leg is
still totally lame. She was not seen putting the leg down at all today. She was examined by the attending
veterinarian on 9-11-13, who stated "no treatment, will treat if condition gets worse." Because the caretaker is used
to seeing her using and not using the leg, no further exams were done. This pig needs to be re-evaluated by a
veterinarian and treatment provided to alleviate her pain.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The group housing cage the rabbits are in has two holes where the bird feeder was covering. These holes are large
enough for the rabbits to escape out of the cage. The holes also have sharp wire edges. These holes need to becovered to prevent injury or escape. To be corrected by 9-12-14.

measures being taken to help cool them when temperatures are above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, which occurred last
week. Whenever temperatures exceed 90 degrees, artificial cooling shall be provided by some method to all
rabbits.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A couple of weeks ago, 7 rabbits were obtained. They have been placed in the former parrot cage. Although there
is a plexiglass roof on top of this solid metal cage, there are no other shelters to protect the rabbits from driving rain
storms. Adequate shelters need to be provided. To be corrected by 9-12-14.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several structural items are in need of repair. These include: in the goat barn a piece of wire fencing with
unfinished edges and protruding nail points along one wall; in the goat enclosure, a patch of fencing in the corner
with unfinished edges and protruding wire; in the pig enclosure, protruding nail heads on some boards and a piece
of fencing with protruding wires halfway up the fence; in the llama shelter, loose barb wire strands and loose double
divider fencing.
All loose and protruding wires and protruding nail heads or points need to be removed and repaired to prevent
potential injury to the animals. To be corrected by 10-3-14.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Bread is fed on a regular basis to several of the animals, along with other feed. The 9 pigs were observed eating
some of this bread. Most of it was moldy. Most of the bread stored in the horse trailer was moldy. Moldy feed can
cause digestive upsets and should not be fed to the animals. All provided food needs to be wholesome, palatable,
free from contamination, and of sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. To be corrected
immediately.Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
