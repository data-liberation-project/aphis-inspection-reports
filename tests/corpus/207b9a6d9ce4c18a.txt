2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white, female Maltese (unable to acquire ID) was observed in a sitting position and scooting her rear end across
the floor of the enclosure. Closer observation of this animal revealed a large, hard, dried clump of feces tightly
attached to the hair on the underside of the base of the tail and covering the anus. There are also numerous
smaller clumps of feces matted within the hair surrounding the dog(cid:25)s anus. Feces that have become trapped in the
dog(cid:25)s hair coat can cause pain or discomfort and could lead to further health issues for the dog. The licensee must
remove all the feces from this dog(cid:25)s hair coat. The licensee must develop an effective plan for hair coat
maintenance to ensure that feces will not become entrapped within the hair coat of any of the dogs.
