2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is an accumulation of fecal material that is mixed with some blood in the outdoor housing facility containing
an adult male poodle and an adult female labrador/poodle-mix. The bloody stool is located on the ground in the
outside run near the front of the enclosure. The licensee stated the adult male cream colored poodle (with no official
form of identification) has had a bloody stool for the last couple days. The licensee also stated that a veterinarian
has not been consulted.
Bloody stools could be an indication of internal health problems. The animal must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered. Documentation should be available on all medical problems.
The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of their documentation. The licensee must ensure that
all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
An adult male poodle and four adult female labrador-poodle mixes do not have an official form of identification.
Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have official identification on them at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Stucture; construction.
An outdoor wire enclosure that is attached to the east side of the sheltered housing facility is in disrepair. There are
areas that have bent and broken wires creating gaps the dogs could squeeze through and sharp points near the
entrance of the enclosure where three dogs can come in contact with. Some of the wire points have small clumps of
fur caught on them.
The blue building has at least two metal trim pieces on the outside corners located within the runs that are damagedand creating sharp edges that at least five dogs can come in contact with. The licensee stated that some of the
dogs have been chewing on them.
The potential for injury exists if any dog comes in contact with sharp edges or gets caught in openings created by
broken wire fencing. The licensee must ensure all enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury
and contain the animals securely at all times.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
The blue building housing six dogs has areas of chewed and worn wooden surfaces the dogs come in contact with.
There is bare wood around the outside entrance of the four dog doors where the paint is missing or peeling off.
Inside the sheltered structure the paint is peeling off the flooring exposing unsealed wood that is not impervious to
moisture. The wooden walls inside the shelters being used are scratched and missing paint.
The plywood sheets being used to divide the south side runs are worn and not impervious to moisture.
The welded wire panels also being used to divide runs in the outdoor housing area have parts along the bottom half
of the panel that are rusty and pitted.
The wooden ramps attached to the entrance of the shelter structures are worn and also not impervious to moisture.
The wire door that is attached to the damaged enclosure on the east side of the sheltered housing facility that
contains three dogs is rusty and pitted where the paint has worn off.
The pieces of carpet being used by six dogs in the blue building are heavily soiled and are fraying along the edges.
The dog door on the northwest corner of the blue building has been excessively chewed. The plastic along the top
edge is rough and jagged. The missing parts of plastic on the door are exposing bare wood that has not been
painted or sealed.
Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis can lead to unsanitary conditions and potential disease or health risks.
The licensee must ensure all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis or be replaced when worn. The licensee
must also ensure all surfaces can be readily cleaned and sanitized for the health and well-being of all dogs.

3.1(f) DIRECT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
The four outdoor runs that are attached to the blue building housing six dogs are completely covered in mud mixed
with animal waste at least an inch deep. The substrate is made up of soil and rocks. There are multiple standing
puddles of water throughout each run. A recent rain shower has contributed to the wet conditions. Four dogs havewet and soiled paws. The dogs have to walk through the wet and contaminated material to access food and water
receptacles. The mud and animal waste is being tracked back into the sheltered structures which results in the dogs
not being able to avoid wet areas. The pieces of carpet being used on the shelter floor is heavily soiled and partially
wet. The enclosure containing a male poodle and female labrador-poodle mix has a floor surface that is nearly all
covered in a layer of dirt and mud. A female chocolate labrador-poodle on the opposite side has access to a run that
is completely wet with animal waste, water and mud. The piece of carpet the dog has in its shelter is partially rolled
up and appears wet and soiled. The female labrador-poodle in the southeast enclosure is exposed to the same
conditions. The run is also a wet mix of mud and animal waste. The piece of carpet that is in its shelter is caked with
mud.
Lack of adequate drainage within the enclosures does not ensure a clean, dry environment which can lead to health
hazards for the dogs. Increased animal, food or fecal waste build-up reduces the available clean surface that the
dogs have access to. The potential for soiling or caking of the hair coat exists when the dogs have to walk or rest on
the affected surfaces. The licensee must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal and disposal of animal
wastes, water and other liquids, in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. A suitable method
shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water and other fluids from the animal areas.

3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outdoor housing facility has a sheltered structure on the southeast side that is missing an entryway door. The
licensee stated the door was torn off by the adult female labrador-poodle mix in the enclosure.
Dogs having little to no protection from the wind, rain or snow could experience difficulty conserving body heat. The
licensee must ensure all outdoor shelter structures have wind and rain breaks for the health and well-being of the
dogs.

3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are three wooden shelters being used by four dogs within the outdoor housing facility that do not contain
clean and dry bedding material. There are pieces of carpet soiled with mud and fecal material covering parts of the
shelter flooring. The ambient temperature at the time of inspection was recorded at 41.5 degrees F by the
inspector's Kestrel device. According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature for tonight will be
approximately 30 degrees F.Dogs that are not provided with clean and dry bedding material during low ambient temperatures can have difficulty
maintaining a safe body temperature. The licensee must provide dry bedding when the ambient temperatures are
below 50 degrees F and additional bedding when the temperature is below 35 degrees F.
To be corrected by: December 2, 2015.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
There is one metal and three plastic food receptacles being used within the outdoor enclosures that are not
protected from the rain and snow. At least two of the food receptacles that the dogs have access to have collected
rainwater and mixed with the dry feed. The licensee stated the feed was put in the receptacles yesterday. The
licensee also stated they put a bowl of feed in the sheltered structures for the dogs when it's raining.
When rain is allowed to collect in the food receptacles it could lead to dog feed becoming molded, deteriorated or
caked. The licensee must provide these food receptacles with protection from the rain and snow, so to ensure that
the food remains palatable for the dogs.
