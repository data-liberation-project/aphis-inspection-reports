Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On February 12, 2021 a Principal Investigator deviated from the approved protocol (AUP 2020 –00064). The study
design implemented by researchers required multiple sedations of a non human primate under circumstances not
described in the protocol. The PI failed to contact the IACUC to modify his approved protocol. The IACUC shall review
and approve modifications of those components of proposed activities related to the care and use of animals. The
protocol has now been amended to include clarification about multiple sedations.
CORRECTED AT TIME OF THE INSPECTION.
2.33(b)(4)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
A Principal investigator failed to contact the attending veterinarian regarding guidance for proper use of
analgesia/anesthesia (AUP 2020 – 00064) during a peri and post operative procedure in a non-human primate. Guidance
from veterinarians regarding complications and appropriate use of analgesia/anesthesia is important to avoid pain and
distress to the animal. There is now a plan in place that requires that the PI notify the vet staff before procedures
requiring anesthesia occur and must submit detailed documentation regarding administration of analgesia to the IACUC.

2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
A member of the Principle Investigators staff was transferring voles to new enclosures and one had hidden in an
enrichment tunnel and was mistakenly left in an enclosure. All dirty enclosures were stacked and left outside the animal
room for cleaning. The next day a caretaker found the carcass of the vole inside of one of the stacked enclosures.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical
harm. A check sheet has now been developed that requires tracking of all animals removed and transferred to different
enclosures. The sheet was present and in use in the animal room at time of this inspection.
