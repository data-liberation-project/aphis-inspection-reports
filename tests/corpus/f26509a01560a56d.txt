TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There were at least ten animals with no means of identification. The licensee uses an approved tattoo number.
Identification is required for health management, tracking, and for facility record keeping. All animals must be
identified by one of the following: 1) a collar that contains the letters USDA, a unique identifying number, and the
license number; 2) a tattoo approved by USDA; or 3) a microchip that can be scanned by the licensee.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
*****There was a very strong ammonia and waste odor inside the kennel building. This can potentially cause serious
respiratory problems and distress to the animals. There must be sufficient ventilation to minimize odor and to
provide for the well being of the animals. The ventilation system must be turned on more often or the inside of the
kennel must be cleaned more frequently.
