HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On inspection, four of the metal guillotine doors in the dog kennel used to permit access to the outside section of the
enclosure was determined to be in disrepair and does not protect the dogs from potential injury. Of the twenty
canine enclosures (each with a metal guillotine door to allow access to and from the outside section of the
enclosure), four had guillotine doors that became easily stuck in the metal track and would not become unstuck by
re-pulling the rope pull. The stuck doors had to be freed by entering into the enclosure and applying an outside force
in order to allow the doors to side down in its closed position. This is extremely dangerous if an animal is in the
enclosure when the door becomes stuck since the operator must release the rope pull and physically enter into the
enclosure allowing an animal to brush up against the door causing it to slide down. The weight of the metal door
could easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an animal. There is no counterweight or
mechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force other than a metal clip used to hold the door in its
open position. This clip must be unhooked when trying to close the guillotine door. At the time of inspection there
were no dogs present in the kennel; however, dogs will be arriving at the facility in 2-3 weeks. According to staff
there were no plans to repair the four guillotine doors before the dogs were to enter into the kennel. Repair or
replace the four guillotine doors to prevent the doors from becoming stuck. Additionally, monitor all guillotine doors
so the doors can be operated that protects the animals from possible injuries.
