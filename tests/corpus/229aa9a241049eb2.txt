2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Upon inspection of the goat enclosure housing 4 adult female goats and 1 mature buck, there was an additional adult
female goat dead in the shelter. Daily observation of all animals on premises is essential to assess their health and well-
being. Licensee must conduct daily observations of all animals on hand so that timely and accurate information on
problems can be conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The animal inventory records do not match the actual animal inventory for goats. Records are incomplete missing some of
the offspring born on the premises. Inaccurate records do not allow for tracking of animals on hand, animals acquired, or
animals that have left the property. The licensee needs to update their animal inventory records with all required
information to properly reflect the animals currently on hand.

This is a 2nd Re-License Inspection for a Class C license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 1 more inspection or by April 1st or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and

must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.
