ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 on
13-Dec-16.The inspector left voicemails on the office and cell phone numbers listed for the laboratory coordinator.
A medical student accompanied the inspector to the laboratory door, which was unanswered after repeated knocks.
The inspector waited 30 minutes before leaving the premises. The laboratory coordinator returned contact at
2:40pm, indicating she had been working off-site.
The registrant must ensure a knowledgeable facility representative is available for inspection during regular
business hours, M-F 7am-7pm. Optimal days and times for inspection and/or additional contact methods can be
established with the home APHIS inspector. Correct from this time forward.
