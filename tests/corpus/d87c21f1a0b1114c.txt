2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a red, adult, female Poodle (0A02327419) who had dried fecal material matted on her hind end and
down the back side of her hind legs. The mats covered approximately 1/3 of the hair on the back side of the dog's
legs from the rump down to the hocks. The dog apparently had loose stools at some point but the feces in the
enclosure at the time of inspection appeared to have fairly normal consistency. The licensee was unaware that the
dog had loose stools previously and had not noticed the fecal matter on the dog's hind end until the inspection.
Dried, fecal material in hair coats poses a health risk for the animals, especially since they tend to lick their hair to
groom themselves. The licensee must remove all the dried fecal material from this dog's coat and ensure that all
dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times. This includes proper maintenance of coats to avoid matting of
hair. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 26 February 2016

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
There were numerous large, upright wood posts in many of the enclosures, supporting the overhead shade
structures. Many of the older posts were worn from chewing/scratching. Some were stained/soiled indicating that
they were not impervious to moisture and could not be readily cleaned and sanitized. There were also many
wooden divider boards between enclosures which were also heavily chewed and in some cases soiled with stains.
The outdoor, concrete floors of some of the older enclosures did not appear to be impervious to moisture and some
had multiple stains from dog urine/waste. There were wet spots on these concrete floors at the time of inspection
which appeared to absorb directly into the concrete. The licensee stated they have sealed the floors before but it
was not happening very frequently.
Surfaces which are not maintained appropriately tend to be difficult to readily clean and sanitize; this poses a health
risk for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis. The licensee must
also ensure that surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized are replaced when worn or soiled. TO BE

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Some of the enclosures housing adults with young puppies had 2x4 wood pieces along the bottom of the walls, just
a few inches above the floor. The boards were intended to prevent the puppies from getting crushed when their
dam laid down. Some of the boards had turned brown in color from dirt and debris accumulating on them and they
did not appear to have been properly sanitized prior to the litters using them. These boards were in very close
proximity to the neonate puppies lying beneath them and they were in direct contact with the some of the older
puppies. The walls (both indoor and out) and floors of some of the enclosures had dirt on them which appeared to
have built up over time. The licensee stated he had not been sanitizing the walls of the shelters every two weeks.
There were also wooden divider panels between some of the enclosures along their outdoor fencing. Some of
these boards were worn and soiled brown in some spots.
The insides of some of the sheltered buildings had excessive accumulations of dust and other indications that the
areas weren't being cleaned often enough. In one of the buildings there were numerous bird droppings present on
the tops of the large, wooden dog shelters. Another building had a bird nest in the corner, just a few feet from a
dog's enclosure. In that same building, the wall almost appeared to be brown, but a light rub of the inspector's
finger easily demonstrated that the wall underneath the dust was actually white. One whelp building had a
noticeable amount of dark brown/black, pin point-sized spots on parts of the ceiling, outlets, power cords, electrical
box, etc. The licensee acknowledged that these dark spots were due to fly speck. The storage area for
medications and husbandry supplies in that same building had a thick layer of dust on some items like the plastic
containers used to store the food.
Enclosures and housing buildings which are not cleaned and sanitized at appropriate intervals can harbor bacteria,
viruses, and other pathogens which increase the risk of the dogs getting sick. The licensee must ensure that all
hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact (walls, insides of shelters, divider boards, etc.) are spot-cleaned
daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks. Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that all other surfaces of
housing facilities (not in contact with the dogs) are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 1 April 2016
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
Many of the food receptacles in the facility used by the dogs had a coating of a brown organic material inside part of
them and/or around their edges. Many of these feeders were screwed into the walls of the enclosures making it
difficult for the licensee to properly clean and sanitize them every two weeks. In one building with open rafters
rather than a ceiling, there was evidence of white bird droppings along the insides of the some of the feeders. Food
receptacles which aren't kept clean, properly sanitized, and protected from bird excreta increase the risk of dogsingesting harmful pathogens which could make them ill. The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are kept
clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks. Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that food receptacles
are located so as to minimize contamination by excreta and pests. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 11 March 2016
The inspection was conducted on 24 February with the licensee, Amanda Owens, and Bernadette Juarez. The exit
interview was conducted on 26 February with Amanda Owens and the licensee.
