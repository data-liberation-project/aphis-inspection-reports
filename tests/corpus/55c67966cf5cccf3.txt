3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The two domestic cats are housed in an enclosure that contains two litter boxes. These litter boxes had excessive
feces in them. Excessive feces in the litter box can lead to odor problems. It can also be a potential source of
disease and pest control issues. Excessively dirty litter boxes can be a source of discomfort to the cats as they will
hesitate to use the boxes when they are overly soiled. The cats in this enclosure were defecating outside the box
which could result in soiling of the cats and ingestion of feces as they groom themselves. This can lead to parasite
and other potential infections. Clean litter boxes daily.
3.83 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle in the Japanese macaque enclosure has a layer of slime lining its interior. The water
receptacles in each of the baboon enclosures have a layer of scum and slime lining their interiors. Debris is present
in these water receptacles as well. Water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to keep
them free from contamination but at least every two weeks. These water receptacles have only been power
sprayed. Unclean water receptacles can affect water palatability and lead to decreased water consumption. This
can have an adverse effect on the health of the animals in these enclosures. Contaminated water can also lead to
other potential health issues for these animals such as bacterial or parasitic infection. Clean these water
receptacles as often as needed to keep the water in the receptacles clean and sanitary.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The two strands of hot wire at the top of the enclosure housing the American black bears have vines climbing on
them. These bears can climb. It would be possible for these bears to escape this enclosure with the hot wire out.
The grizzly bear enclosure also has vines growing on its hot wire strands located at the top of the enclosure. These
are dangerous animals that could cause significant injury to people within the perimeter fence or other animals
located inside the perimeter fence. Remove these vines immediately.
The resting platform in the coyote enclosure has become worn and chewed to a point that its structural integrity maybe compromised. The shelf or ramp leading up to it could break. Two screws are also protruding down from the
shelf. This shelf needs to be repaired/or replaced in order to prevent any possible injuries to the coyote using it.
Repair this platform.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Deteriorating cherries and grapes were present in the cooler.
Molding raspberries were in the cooler. Peppers and yellow squash were discolored and soft. A package of
deteriorating greens dripped brown liquid when held for closer inspection. Spoiled produce must be removed
promptly to prevent contamination of food intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce
promptly. This cooler needs to be cleaned and have spoiled and deteriorating items removed in order to prevent
contamination of food items that will be fed to the animals.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open dumpster located about 15 to 20 feet away from the butcher area used to process meat contains cow
parts. The stench emanating from the dumpster is overwhelming and smells of rot and decay. The dumpster is
swarming with flies and infested with maggots. Flies were seen by the inspectors on the counter in the butcher
area. A litter box in a pen that contained three domestic cats removed two days ago is filled full of feces. Bones are
on the floor of the service area for the enclosures housing the tigers Pandora, Lenny and Squigy. A container of
molding and sprouting grain is located next to the Syrian brown bear enclosure. Food and fecal waste needs to be
removed promptly in order to minimize odors, vermin infestation and disease hazards. Remove this and all other
waste materials in a prompt manner.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the enclosure housing two American black bears and the enclosure housing two
Asian black bears contained a large amount of rotting food debris. The grizzly bear feed area contained rotting food
debris. Any food fed in these areas is going to be contaminated by the rotting material present. These feeders
need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from bacterial
or pest infestation which could result in health issues for the bears.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING. The white tiger was identified to us by the CEO of the facility as being "off feed". The water receptacle for the
enclosure containing this tiger has a vine with berries on it growing next to it. Some of these berries are in the
water. The CEO of the facility has no idea what type of berries are contaminating the water. These berries may be
toxic for all anyone at the facility knows. This vine should be removed or the berries identified as harmless to the
tiger. Clean this water receptacle to prevent possible harm to the animal by toxin ingestion.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces and food waste in the enclosure housing the tiger Lilly. The tiger Kahn's enclosure
contained excessive food waste. The tiger Sundar's enclosure contained excessive feces and his den contained
excessive food waste. The den areas for the tigers Xena, Pandora and JJ contained excessive food waste. A bad
odor of decay was present by the white tiger enclosure. Rotting food waste was present in the enclosure. This
enclosure also contained excessive feces. The Asian black bear den box contained excessive food waste. The
Asian black bear enclosure contained excessive fecal material. The grizzly bear enclosure contained excessive
food waste. The enclosure housing the artic fox contained a piece of rotting meat. The cougar enclosure contained
rotting food waste buried under the bedding in the den area. This rotting material was covered with maggots and
smelled of decay. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. This rotting material and feces
can lead to pest control issues. The rotting material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures and shelter boxes can
contaminate these animals as they lay in their enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when they groom
themselves. Not removing old food waste promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten
material can lead to potential health problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of food
and fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The alleyway leading to the butcher area as well as the area directly outside the building housing the butcher area
and the alleyway and building next to the butcher area are filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash,
buckets, tires and fencing. Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and
trash. Tall weeds are located throughout the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other
pests and numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help
control pests.
The counter in the butcher area is dirty with a black greasy material. The chain saw used for butchering is coveredin meat and bone material from food processing. These things must be cleaned in order to ensure that processed
meat does not become contaminated. Contaminated meat fed to the animals can make them ill and lead to
unnecessary suffering.
The pools located in the grizzly bear, Asian black bear, American black bear and bobcat enclosures are very dirty.
They contain large amounts of green water and algae. These pools must be drained and cleaned. The stagnate
water in these pools can become breeding grounds for mosquitos which are vectors for several diseases which can
make the animals ill.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were located inside the cougar enclosure
and the den for this enclosure. Multiple rodent holes were noted in the service alleyway for the tiger enclosures
located on leopard row as well as in the tiger enclosures. Rodent holes were seen in the service area for the tiger
Pandora's enclosure and the tigers Lenny and Squiggy's enclosure. Rodent holes were located going under the
shelter box of the Asian black bear enclosure. Several other rodent holes were located near the enclosure. Rodent
holes were seen near the white tiger enclosure. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to the
animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of rodent control must be established for the facility.
Numerous flies and maggots were located in a dumpster located 15 to 20 feet from the meat processing area. Flies
were seen on the counter in the meat processing area. Maggots were located in the cougar den in rotting food
waste. Flies can be a vector for disease and must be controlled in order to keep animal enclosures and food
processing areas clean. Eliminate rotten food waste promptly and clean animal enclosures on a regular basis to
control flies.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can
result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers must be reduced
or more properly trained workers need to be added. A facility schedule needs to be developed that allows for
adequate employee coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. For the most part, the facility CEO is
the only one authorized to work with the dangerous animals at the facility as the other authorized party has very
limited availability. All animal work must be done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This
limits the amount of time that is available to service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility CEO is often
offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the dangerous animal enclosures. The facility CEO needs to find a way to
be onsite more or hire trained staff to help run the facility.An exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the inspection with the facility CEO and other facility personnel.
AC personnel present were Kurt Hammel and Carrie Bongard. A formal exit interview was conducted with the
facility CEO and Kurt Hammel on 7-23-15.
