ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This facility has recently acquired a red fox. However, the Program of Veterinary Care form has not been updated to
include this new acquisition. The Program of Veterinary Care form needs to be amended to reflect that the attending
veterinarian will treat and care for all the animals on the premise.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. At the time of this inspection it was noted that the tar papered, shingled roof dog house, in the outdoor portion of
the pen was in need of repair. There were a few shingles that had been partially pulled off the roof. They were now
folded over and the wood frame was exposed. To ensure that this dog house can be properly cleaned and the
shingles do not cause any harm to the raccoons or fox this will need to be addressed.

2. The interior portion of the raccoon and fox enclosure is also in need of repair. The walls are constructed of sheet
rock and lattice panels. There are several areas of damaged sheet rock present. The edges at the very top, where
the lattice meets the sheetrock, are also damaged. To ensure that the enclosure is structurally sound and
maintained in good repair this enclosure will need to be addressed.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor portion of the raccoon and fox enclosure has a 6(cid:25) perimeter fence. The fence is constructed of (cid:24)6 high
chain link panels. However, some of the panels have detached from each other and are not very secure at this time.
To ensure the integrity of the perimeter fence, these panels will need to be repaired.

noted that there was a buildup of dirt and grim present. To ensure that this area can be cleaned and sanitized this
grim will need to be removed.
