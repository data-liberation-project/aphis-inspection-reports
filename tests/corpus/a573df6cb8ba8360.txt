HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor portion of the domestic cat enclosure is in disrepair. An area of the one by one inch wire enclosure
fencing is no longer attached to the wooden door frame of the enclosure. This affected area, approximately
fourteen inches long, has exposed a one inch gap between the fence and wooden door frame. The cats could
potentially escape from this gap if the wire is further detached from the frame.
Repair or replace the affected area of wire.
