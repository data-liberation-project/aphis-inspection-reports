OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The night houses for the nonhuman primates have heat lamps. The heat lamps have energy efficient bulbs that are
generally used for lighting not heating. There is no additional bedding being provided in the night houses. The use
of this type of bulb does not provide a sufficient source of heat to adequately protect the nonhuman primates from
the cold. Last night the temperature dropped below freezing for more than 4 hours which could be detrimental to the
animals health. The animals shall be supplied with adequate heat and/or any additional heat source for the health
and well-being of the animals. Correct by February 12, 2016.

enclosure containing the goats, sheep and pigs there were old banana peels, oranges and trash such as hay bale
twine, and a plastic container in the enclosure. The banana peels were rotten and odoriferous. The puma's igloo
shelter had an abundance of debris that needs to be cleaned out. Food waste, trash and debris needs to be
properly disposed of to minimize vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards.
