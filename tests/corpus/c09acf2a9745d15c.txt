3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** Upon entering the indoor adult dog housing facility a significant ammonia odor was present. The ammonia odor
was high enough that all three inspectors noted the odor to each other. The licensee was not utilizing any windows,
doors, or fans for ventilation at the start of the inspection, however he did open a window and turned on a fan once
the inspection started. Ammonia inhalation can be detrimental to animal health, especially the respiratory systems
of dogs housed indoor with no access to the outdoors. The licensee must keep the facility sufficiently ventilated for
the health and well-being of the dogs by minimizing odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation.
