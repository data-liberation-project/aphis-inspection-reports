2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:20 pm on
05-Sep-19.
I phoned one of the licensee's sons who said that neither he nor his brother were available to do an inspection. He
also said that his mother (the licensee) could not do the inspection without one of them present.
Additional Inspectors
