2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Shades, a Boxer (m/c# 0A02130780) was very thin. The ribs and backbone were visible. The owner began treating
the dog with a daily dewormer mixture 3 days previously. There was no consultation with a veterinarian to establish
a diagnosis or to confirm that this was the correct treatment. Poor body condition can be the result of parasites,
inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. Shades must be evaluated by a veterinarian to know with
certainty the problem and the correct treatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended treatment and
delivered treatments must be available to APHIS officials.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Tahia, a female black and white Boxer (m/c# 0A02295922) had numerous engorged ticks on her chest, neck and
some on her back. Ticks can spread disease and cause illness in dogs. An effective program for the control of
external parasites affecting dogs must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of
the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. The owner must remove the ticks and appropriately
treat the dog and its surroundings to prevent the reoccurrence of ticks.
