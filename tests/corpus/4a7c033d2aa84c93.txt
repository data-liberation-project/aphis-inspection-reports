ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:20 PM on
14-Aug-19.
Knocked on door, yelled hello, honked horn. Just when I was leaving a truck pulled in with the licensees wife. The
licensee was away and unable to conduct an inspection.
