2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:15 pm on
22-Nov-16.
On October 31, 2016, Mr. Fisher indicated his optimal hours for inspection are Tuesdays and Thursdays. However,
no one is home at the facility today. I called and left messages on both the home and business phone lines, then
waited for one half hour, but received no return call and no one returned home.
