3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The fencing around the primary enclosure containing five cows was made up of barbed wire. The bottom portions
of numerous vertical strands of wire had become detached from the wire fencing and these sharp points were
pointing into the enclosure. On one side of the enclosure, a strand of barbed wire had become detached from the
rest of the fencing and was lying on the ground inside the cattle enclosure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
