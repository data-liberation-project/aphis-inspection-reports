2.31(b)(3)(i)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The current IACUC membership does not include a veterinarian. This required position has been vacant for over 1
year (since July 2018), and has adversely affected semiannual reviews, inspections, and all other required IACUC
functions.
The attending veterinarian is one of three mandatory members of the IACUC, and their participation is vital to
ensuring the proper care and treatment of animals. If a mandatory position is unfilled, the IACUC is not properly
constituted and cannot perform required functions. All required IACUC positions must be filled prior to conducting
any future IACUC activity.
At the time of inspection, there were no animals used in any covered activity; all animals were retired in July 2018.
