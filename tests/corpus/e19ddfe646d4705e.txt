NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
During the exit interview of this inspection the licensee was continually verbally hostile and confrontational. When
trying to go over the 'Draft' inspection report, the licensee constantly interrupted with every statement and sentence
that was trying to be explained. The licensee used profanity at least every 2 to 3 words and made it impossible to
continue with any conversation, let alone explanation of the draft report. During the exit there were other
circumstances that came to light that required us to ask for records which was denied by the licensee. At one point
the licensee began to personally attack the supervisor during the exit by name calling, at which time the inspection
and exit interview was stopped.
The increasing anger by the licensee was noted by the raising of his voice where it was equivalent to yelling, in
conjunction with the insults and personal attacks by name calling; created a situation where we felt that the licensee
was going to continue to escalate to the point where the situation could possibly become unsafe.
It should be noted the licensee refused to give back the 'draft' inspection report and stated it was his and he had it in
case anything was changed, even though the 'drafts' are just drafts for the purpose of changes if needed before the
end of the inspection.
The verbal harassment and abuse of inspectors during an inspection creates a situation where there is no dialog or
learning by the licensee on how to work within the USDA regulations. The verbal attacks and anger demonstrated
by the licensee interfered with the ability to conduct a complete exit interview. The level of confrontation and
escalating anger and personal attacks have created a hostile and unsafe environment for APHIS officials to conduct
future inspections.
A licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS official in the
course of carrying out his or her duties.

2.40(b)(2) REPEATATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a female Brown bear 'Chloe' in the enclosure containing two other bears that had an unknown injury in the
area of the left elbow, where there was a significant amount of bright red blood in the fur. The blood was rubbed on
the left side of the muzzle and on the outside of the left thigh in the fur coat. It is unclear where the blood is coming
from, however the injury appeared to be bleeding during the inspection. The other bears did not come out of the
shelter and it is unknown if the other bears have an injury due to a fight, or if there was a separate issue that caused
injury to this bear. This injury had not been observed until found during the inspection, and therefore was not yet
seen by the veterinarian.
There was a Kangaroo that had died of unknown causes that the veterinarian had not been contacted for. When the
animal first presented it was ill, and the licensee did not contact the veterinarian. A person in Australia was
contacted instead, and the animal died within 24hrs. A necropsy was never conducted and a veterinarian was never
consulted.
There were two baby otters that died due to a possible formula issue, however a veterinarian was not contacted and
the animals were not seen by the veterinarian during the time and the animals died. No necropsy was conducted.
There was one adult otter that appeared sick and died within the hour, however the licensee advised he did not
contact the veterinarian and did not have a necropsy conducted on another unknown death. These 4 animals died
at this facility since the last inspection that was conducted.
It is important that a veterinarian is contacted and proper diagnosis and treatment is provided as soon as an injury
or illness is observed in order to prevent unnecessary pain and discomfort, or cause a treatable condition to
become chronic or cause death if left untreated. The lack of a proper diagnosis in cases where there is unexplained
death, can lead to a potential disease risk to the other animals in the collection, if it is an infectious disease.
The licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the possible injury or determination
of where the blood came from on the bear. All health related illness or issues that are observed in the animals shall
result in the veterinarian to be contacted for proper treatment and diagnosis . Any unexplained death requires a
necropsy, as has been discussed in past inspections.
3.1(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are still 2 nails protruding(1-2inches) out of the front of the dog house in the pen with the Coyote and Coydog.
These nails are located on the front of the dog house where they are at eye level, and one is long enough to catchon the dogs as they jump on and off of the roof as was observed during the inspection. There are 1-2 boards
missing on the roof/sidewall on the left side of the shelter box that allows for wind and rain to enter the shelter from
the top, preventing proper weather proof housing.
Nails left sticking out in the enclosure can be a source of possible injury to the dogs. Inadequate shelter boxes that
allow rain, wind and snow in them do not provide a weather proof structure for the animal to take cover in when the
weather is bad. The lack of proper shelter can cause discomfort and possible health issues if left unresolved.
.
All protruding nails or pointed pieces of metal and wire must be removed in order to prevent possible injury sites
within the enclosure. The shelter box must be kept in good condition and repair, which includes repairing or
replacing missing or chewed boards
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In Pen #1 there is a Dog (Bandit) that is housed with a Lion (Chief) that has a shelter area, however there was no
straw or bedding available. There was only the snow covered ground and dirt floor in the 3 sided shelter for the
regulated animals to lay on.
In outdoor facilities for dogs, the housing/shelter must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient
temperature is below 50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35
[deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower. The temperature during the inspection was 21degreesF and has been between 7-21
degrees for the past week.
The lack of proper bedding for outdoor shelters to protect the dogs from the cold surfaces of the ground, can be a
source of discomfort and possible health issues.
There must be clean and dry bedding made available for all dogs housed in outdoor shelters.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The 3 original enclosures, Tiger Pen #4: contains tiger known as Glacier and lion known as Ungowwa, and Tiger
Pen #1: containing a dog (Bandit) and a lion known as Chief and Pen #5 and #6 which is located next to Pen # 4
contains a young tiger male known as Tacova, are still non-compliant with fencing being less than 12 ft high and no
kick-ins or other means to ensure adequate containment. In the Tiger Pen containing 1 tiger named 'Jamba" there was an area of diamond mesh fencing that was pulled
away from the shelter box area creating a large hole at least 1-2ft in diameter. The wires of the broken diamond
mesh (up to 12inches long) fencing are protruding into the primary enclosure at eye level of the tiger.
There is a section of fencing at the left front of the Hyena enclosure that has been pulled apart, resulting in multiple
wires protruding into the enclosure, coming in contact with the hyenas, which can be a source of possible injury.
While the rightside has a metal wall secured to cover the previous hole from the inside, the left side has wood on
the outside to cover the hole, however the pointed wire sections are in direct contact with the hyenas, where they
continue to pull apart the fence.
Holes and protruding fencing wires inside the enclosures of the regulated animals can be a possible source of injury
to the eyes or other areas of the body, if they were to be punctured. The holes left in the fences are also areas of
weakness and stability to the primary enclosure and can be at risk for escape or injury if the animal gets caught up
in the hole trying to climb through it.
This fencing needs to be repaired more securely or replaced to prevent the animals from coming in contact with the
broken wires and damaged fence. The fence should be kept in good repair to provide the strength needed in the
walls to prevent possible escapes or entry by other animals.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are 3 wolves (between 80-120lbs each)that have been moved to an enclosure that has only 1 Med/large
igloo shelter that is only big enough for 1 animal comfortably. The enclosure is open on all 4 sides and top, there is
no wind break or shelter from the sun, rain or wind.
There is a full grown lion(Ungowwa) and tiger(Glacier) in Pen #4 that does not have an appropriate shelter for the
cold winter weather. Currently there is only a partial conduit, approximately 8-10ft long and approximately 5-6 ft in
diameter that is open on both ends wedged between 2 mounds of dirt/rocks holding in it in place. This conduit is
open on both ends allowing for the snow and rain to be blown in. The size of the partial shelter appears to be big
enough for 1 animal comfortably, but would be tight with two adult big cats. The lack of appropriate shelter that is large enough for all the animals in the enclosure to fit in comfortably, can
expose the animals to severe weather and the inability to stay dry and/or manage their temperatures in a safe
manner. The lack of wind breaks, or shelters that protect the animals from the rain, sleet, direct sun and snow can
cause possible health issues and discomfort to the regulated animals, that in nature would be able to find
appropriate shelter from the elements if able.
The temperatures have been very low for the past week between 7-21 degrees with 2-3 inches of snow as was
present during this inspection.
The licensee needs to provide enough shelter areas in an enclosure to protect the animals from inclement weather.
Each shelter should be able to comfortably house each animal either as a group or individually. If it appears that an
animal is not being let into the shelter due to compatibility issues, there needs to be additional shelter provided for
that animal.
An inspection was conducted with the facility representative and with Dr. Kirsten, SACS.
The exit interview was unable to be finished or signed due to the continual interruption and verbal abuse issued by
the licensee toward the inspectors. The exit was ended and the licensee was advised the report would be sent via
certified and regular mail.
