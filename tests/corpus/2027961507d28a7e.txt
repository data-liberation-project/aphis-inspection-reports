2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***The Animal Care Regional Director did not receive an itinerary from the licensee prior to this overnight travel.
One of the attendants stated to APHIS VMO's that they arrived to the fair approximately 1 week ago. The licensee
must submit an itinerary to the Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever the animals
will be exhibited at a location other than the licensee's approved site(s) and whenever that travel extends overnight.
The itinerary shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended
for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***There was insufficient distance and/or barriers between the tigers and the public during the time that the public
was allowed to feed the tigers. The public is allowed to use kitchen tongs to feed raw meat to the tigers while having
their photo taken by an attendant. The barrier that the public stands behind was about 3 feet high and was 32
inches away from the tiger enclosure. This height and distance was not enough to prevent people from leaning over
the barrier far enough to potentially be able to stick their fingers or hands into the 2 inch by 4 inch openings of the
enclosure. Insufficient distance or barriers between the animals and the public can compromise the safety of both.
The licensee must ensure that there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the general viewing public and
the animals so as to assure the safety of the animals and the public.
Inspection took place at the Central States Fair in Rapid City, SD.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted on-site with facility representatives and 2 APHIS VMO's.
