This was a focused inspection on veterinary care issues.
Shih Tzu #10, previously identified on inspection on 7/7/14, was seen by the attending veterinarian on 7/11/14. The
whiteness on both corneas was diagnosed as scarring that may not improve after 5 days treatment with a
prescribed ophthalmic ointment. Today, the corneas both have a small area of central whiteness with no other
abnormalities noted in the eyes. The licensee will continue to monitor the condition and maintain a record of all
communications with the attending veterinarian regarding animals with chronic issues such as this.
No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
