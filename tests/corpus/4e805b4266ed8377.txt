USDA inspector reviewed the June 2021 IACUC minutes and read that the PI for protocol 05-11-015 euthanized an
anesthetized rabbit on June 8, 2021, during study procedure based on oxygenation falling to as low as 64 spO2. While
an animal is under anesthesia for this study, per the approved protocol, the PI is required to monitor the animal’s heart
rate, withdrawal reflex, body temp, and pulse oxygen. Approximately one hour into the procedure, oxygenation started to
decrease, but the investigator did not notify anyone on the veterinary staff. Oxygenation was maintained below an
acceptable level, with the animal noted by investigator as breathing faint, and approximately two hours from the start of
procedure, the PI euthanized the animal without consulting the veterinary staff.
The investigator conducting this procedure may not have been aware of their responsibility to communicate animal health
concerns during procedures to the veterinary care staff. All personnel responsible for animal care and use must receive
training, in sufficient frequency, on the expectations of the research facility for the health and well-being of the animals.
The facility has corrected this item by instituting a program to re-educate investigators on working with the veterinary
staff.
