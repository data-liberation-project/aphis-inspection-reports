ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a new attending veterinarian (AV). The written program of veterinary care (PVC) has not
been updated to reflect this change. A complete PVC, approved by the current veterinarian, is required to ensure
the facility has written guidance from the AV in the areas of vaccinations, a parasite control program, emergency
care, euthanasia, and additional program topics, to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time
attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care
and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.
