***There were several rabbits (greater than 10) that had hair loss of varying degrees on their faces, above the nose
and extending as far as between the eyes. There are no records indicating the current rabbits conditions have been
identified and communicated to the veterinarian. The rabbits shall be examined by the veterinarian and appropriate
treatment provided as necessary.
***There is a female rabbit with wet yellowish discoloration in the genital, inguinal and perennial area. Upon further

2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***The facility representatives indicated that the loss of hair on the nose and face is not a condition that they
document and they stated that some of the rabbits arrive at the facility with this condition but it is not documented in
anyway on intake health records. I was also told that at some point skin scrapings were performed in the past to
determine the possibility of ectoparasites but there were no records for review. With the daily observations of the
rabbits being performed by someone other than the veterinarian a mechanism of direct and frequent communication
is required to convey timely and accurate information on health conditions to the veterinarian.
