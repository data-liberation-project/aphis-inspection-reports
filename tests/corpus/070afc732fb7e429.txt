3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the hammocks in the indoor gibbon enclosure is secured on one end with a hose clamp on each corner. The
hose clamps are loops made of thin metal strips that can trap and/or injure a digit of an animal as it moves around
the enclosure.
Enclosures and the structures within it must be constructed with consideration of the safety of the animals. Surfaces
must be free of sharp edges or points that could injure the animals.
This was corrected at the time of inspection by replacing the hose clamps with carabiners.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel.
