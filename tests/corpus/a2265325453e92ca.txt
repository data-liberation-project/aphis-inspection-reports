ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:35 p.m. on
01-Jun-17.
I called the phone numbers provided and the numbers are no longer in service. Also, I stopped by the new address
for the pet store at: 127 S. Main, West Point, Ne, and the store was empty with the door locked. The store look
unoccupied. Please let me know of a good contact phone number and the new site for the pet store, if you are still in
business.
This attempted will be sent by regular and certified mail.
