FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence has fallen into disrepair, and does not meet the requirements for a perimeter fence. Not all
sections measure six feet in height, due to fence damage or deterioration. The strands of barbed wire that comprise
the fence are spaced six inches apart, which would not prevent small animals from passing through the fence.
Some sections have been damaged, and these openings in the fenceline could enable people and / or animals to
pass through, as well as failing to provide secondary containment in the event that one of the exhibit animals were
to escape its primary enclosure. In some areas, near entrances, there is not a three foot distance between the
perimeter fence and the animal enclosure fencing.
The perimeter fence should:
•(cid:9)Keep people and animals from going under or through the fence;
•(cid:9)Be at least 6’ in height for the animals currently present on exhibit;
•(cid:9)Act as a secondary containment in the event that an animal escapes its primary enclosure;
•(cid:9)Be at least 3’ from the animal’s enclosure to prevent unwanted contact through the fence.
Failure to maintain the perimeter fence as specified could put the animals at risk of unwanted contact with people or
animals, and / or at risk of escape. The fence should be maintained and updated so that it meets the specifications.
To be corrected by June 1, 2017.
