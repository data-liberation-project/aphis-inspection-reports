3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
An enclosure in the outdoor housing area has a shelter structure that is missing the metal door at the entrance. The
licensee stated the door was broke off by the dogs. An adult male and female German Shepherd have access to the
shelter. Missing doors or entryway flaps at the entrance of the shelter provide little to no protection from the direct
effects of wind, snow or rain blowing on to the dogs. The licensee must ensure all outdoor shelter structures have
wind and rain breaks at all times for the health and well being of the dogs.

Exit briefing conducted with the licensee.
