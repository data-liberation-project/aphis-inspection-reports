ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15 PM on
07-Aug-19.
Arrived on site, and adult was just leaving the premises and said he could not assist me. I called the exhibitor, and
she said she was away doing a presentation, and she told me no one else was available to assist me at that time.
