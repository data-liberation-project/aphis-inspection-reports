2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The approved IACUC protocol involves 900 pigs per year in category D. In the Annual Reports for Fiscal Year 2015
and 2016, 1203 pigs and 1168 pigs respectively were reported in category D. There is no documentation of an
additional amendment or IACUC approval for the increase in animal numbers in the records reviewed. The
registrant was specifically asked for any approved amendments to the protocol during records review.
Protocol changes of this type can have a significant impact on animal well-being and require approval by the IACUC
prior to being instituted. A system should be in place to ensure that proposed significant changes to activities
involving the care and use of animals are reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to their implementation.
