Housing facilities, general.
One outside enclosure housing 5 Goldendoodle, 2 poodle, and 1 golden retriever puppy has a 2' area of underground 2"
by4" fence dug up. There is a 6-8" gap under the wire. There is another enclosure housing 2 Berne doodle, and 1 Aussie
Doodlle with underwire fencing dug up in a 3' by 1' section.

Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury.

Ensure that enclosures are maintained in good repair to prevent foot and leg injuries to the dogs and puppies contained in
the enclosures.

Outdoor housing facilities.
There are a total of 41 puppies that range from 12-16 weeks of age that do not have appropriate shelter in their outside
enclosures. 3 enclosures housing 5 Goldendoodles in each, 6 pomsky's housed with a single poodle, 5 bernese

mountain dogs housed with 1 Australian shepherd and 1 AL aleekai, 5 Golden doodles housed with 2 poodles and 1
golden retriever, 4 aussie doodles housed with 1 pomsky. There are not enough, or the shelters provided are too small to
house the number of puppies contained in the enclosure.

Outdoor facilities for dogs or cats must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each
outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely.

Shelter must be provided to all dogs housed outside. The shelter or shelters must allow all animals in the enclosure
access and allow for the dogs to make normal postural movements freely.

3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
There are 7 outside enclosures with doghouses that do not have a wind and rain break at the entrance.

Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must be provided with a wind break and rain break at the entrance.

A wind and rain break must be added to these outdoor shelters to prevent wetting of the animals in the shelters.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
3 Maltipoo puppies were weaned an put in an enclosure with trays below to catch excreta and food waste. These trays
have not been cleaned out since the last litter of puppies were placed in the enclosure. The trays are full, wet, growing
mold, and are odorous.

Excreta and food waste must be cleaned from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained in the primary enclosures, and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.

Clean under the enclosures as often as necessary to prevent excess odor, reduce pests, and disease possibilities.

To be corrected by end of business today.
