SANITATION.
There is one plastic cage that contained 1 hedgehog ("Nebula"). This cage is covered with a plastic lid containing
several ventilation holes. When the lid was removed for inspection, a strong ammonia odor was present. The
amount of odor was sufficient to cause irritation of the inspector's respiratory tract.
This cage shall be cleaned more frequently than the other cages (which are uncovered), or redesigned, so that
ammonia does not build up within the cage. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odors.
