ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 AM on
01/19/2016.
For the past three weeks in a row including this week, the inspector has received a message by cell phone
voicemail in which Mr. Vanneste has stated that he will not be available for inspection the following week. Mr.
Vanneste has previously indicated to APHIS that he would be available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays
to host inspections. Due to the concerning citations with regards to improper veterinary care and also lack of
adequate water and bedding in times of very cold weather in the past it is essential that APHIS inspectors be able to
check on the welfare of the animals housed at the facility.
Mr. Vanneste needs to be available to host an inspection during the times he has designated to APHIS.
