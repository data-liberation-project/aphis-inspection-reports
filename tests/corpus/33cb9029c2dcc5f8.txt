ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Dogs identified as # 005, 009 and 010 all have matted fur around the ears, under the neck and along the legs
and anal region. Matted fur can pull and separate from the skin causing skin irritations and be painful. In addition
some of the fur around the anal region had trapped feces. These dogs need to be groomed on a routine basis to
prevent this matting from occurring.
*** Dogs identified as # 005, and 010 both had brown tarter along the teeth with red irritated gum lines. These dogs
need to have their teeth assessed by the attending veterinarian to determine the course of action and possible
treatment or cleaning options.
*** Dog identified as 009 had dirty ears that appeared moist and red with an odor indicating a possible infection.
This dog needs to have her ears cleaned and checked on a regular basis to prevent this condition.
