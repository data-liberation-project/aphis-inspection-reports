2.33(b)(5)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On February 16, 2018, a nonhuman primate that had received a non-major surgical procedure was not administered
buprenorphine or cefazolin the morning after surgery. The protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee included these treatments as part of their description of procedures. During the routine post-surgical
assessment, a certified veterinary technician (CVT) indicated a pain score of 0 (no pain). The NHP received all
other treatments, including pre-operative and other post-operative medications.
The corrective and preventative actions taken by the facility included using an additional cross-check reference to
the medication sheets. Additional assistance to the technicians in charge of administering these medications is
being provided on days with high numbers of injections to be performed. Additionally the use of a sustained-release
formulation administered peri-procedurally, which would decrease the number of injections for a NHP, has been
instituted.
Adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care in accordance with current established veterinary medical and
nursing procedures are necessary for adequate care of the animals.
Corrected prior to this inspection.
3.80(a)(2)(ii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The facility reported that on May 6, 2018, facility personnel found a young non-human primate (NHP) that was
constrained by PVC pipes of a resting perch. The (NHP) was freed and taken immediately for evaluation by a
veterinary technician. A veterinarian assessed and initiated treatment a few minutes after presentation to the
veterinary technician. The NHP responded to initial treatment but later developed neurological signs. The NHP was
euthanized based upon the follow-up veterinary evaluation. The necropsy and histopathology revealed signs that
appeared consistent with the entrapment and subsequent events.
The facility installed a device to decrease the side-to-side movement of the PVC pipes of the perch. Theirevaluation of other perches did not reveal any similarly affected. All other perches were evaluated to assess
stability, the potential for entrapment, ease of sanitization as well as to identify and prioritize possible refinements of
the perches. They have instituted a policy of daily checking of perches for damage, wear or
instability.
Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates contained in them. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so
that they protect the nonhuman primates from injury
Corrected prior to this inspection.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
