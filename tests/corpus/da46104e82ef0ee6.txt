2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care is lacking information on their tail docking, dew claw removal, and tattooing
procedures, all of which are performed by the licensee. These procedures are not outlined in the Program of
Veterinary Care. It doesn't give information as to how to carry out these procedures, what instruments are
supposed to be used, or how to properly sterilize the instruments. The lack of information on these procedures in
the Program of Veterinary Care had been discussed with the licensee at the last inspection. Not having detailed
instructions for these procedures in the Program of Veterinary Care doesn't ensure that the animals are receiving
optimal care. The Program of Veterinary Care must be updated to include detailed instructions on all of these
procedures. Correct by 10/24/17.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT

Antiseptic medicated spray expired Sept. 2013. Gentamax expired 7-17 and Gentafuse expired 4-1-2016. Expired

3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The cement and wood surfaces of the outdoor enclosures are not sealed. The concrete is rough and worn. Many
of the wooden posts have been chewed up and are not sealed. Rebar and metal posts running along the
separating walls of the enclosures are rusted. In addition, many of the igloo shelters within the enclosures are
chewed up around the entrances. These surfaces are not impervious to moisture and doesn't allow for the primary
enclosures to be properly sanitized. These facility issues have all been discussed with the licensee at previous
inspections. All surfaces must be repaired or replaced so the enclosures can be properly sanitized. Correct by
4/17/18.
3.11(b)(2)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At least 10 dogs had not had their cages cleaned since Sunday (approximately 48 hours). Feces was accumulating
in the outdoor enclosures. One of the indoor enclosures was wet and dirty. There wasn't a dry spot in the
enclosure. It was wet with what appeared to be a combination of urine, feces, and water. The licensee admitted
that the indoor enclosure containing one dog was overdue to be cleaned. The licensee was asked how often they
sanitize the outdoor enclosures. She informed me they are not done every two weeks. The enclosures can
sometimes go as long as six months before they are sanitized. The cleaning requirements were discussed with the
licensee at the last inspection. Not sanitizing the enclosures every two weeks or more often as necessary doesn't
ensure that the various types of germs (such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc.) have been killed. All enclosures
must be sanitized every two weeks or more often as necessary. Correct by 10/31/17.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Bird feces was observed on the walls and floors of two primary enclosures containing a total of five dogs within the
main barn. The licensee stated the birds have been a constant problem. They have tried some deterrents which
were effective for a while, but she said the birds seem to be getting bad again. Bird feces within the enclosure is a
disease hazard not only to the dogs, but also the employees cleaning the enclosures. An effective pest control
program must be established and maintained to control the birds within the barn. Correct by 10/24/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
