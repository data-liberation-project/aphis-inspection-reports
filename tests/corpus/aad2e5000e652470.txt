ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medication was past the labeled expiration date. There was one (cid:19) 1000 ml. bottle of Panacur with
an expiration date of 12/2014. This medication was intermingled with other products that are currently being used
at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or
sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute
adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are
administrated to dogs could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that
all medications used are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices. Correct
by 4/30/15.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two dug holes were observed in the dirt ground floor directly under the cattle panel enclosure fencing. Three
dogs are in contact with the affected areas located in outdoor housing. One hole was estimated to be one foot wide
by six inched deep. The second hole was estimated to be two foot wide by one foot deep. This affects the ability of
enclosure fencing to contain the dog securely. It could lead to potential injury affecting the safety and welfare of the
dogs. The licensee must keep facilities in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals
securely at all times. Correct by 4/30/15.
********************************************************
* Broken, protruding wires were observed in an estimated two foot section of enclosure fencing. Three dogs are

the dogs securely and could lead to potential injury. The licensee must ensure all enclosure fencing is kept in good
repair to protect the dogs from injury and contain the dogs securely at all times. Correct by 4/30/15.
