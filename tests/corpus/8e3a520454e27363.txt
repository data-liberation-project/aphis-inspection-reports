Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
An environmental enrichment plan has been written and is being followed but some specific details are not documented
properly. The social grouping and infant care of the nonhuman primates has not been described or how the foraging and
exploration enrichment is being conducted.
*A further documented environmental enrichment plan is needed so we can assess how their psychological well-being, to
include socialization, environmental enrichment, and special considerations, are handled to ensure their overall well-
being.
*Under the direction of the attending veterinarian, and in accordance with accepted professional standards, the facility
shall develop and document how the nonhuman primates are socially housed, how the special consideration of infants are
cared for, and detail how their foraging and exploration enrichment is conducted to promote the psychological well-being
of the nonhuman primates.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


A layer of grayish/black debris was present on surfaces the nonhuman primates and coatis touch within the sheltered
portion of their primary enclosures. Currently, the interior wood board platforms and perches are scraped with a metal
scraper to remove animal waste and food debris, but a layer of grime remains on the wood shelves/perches and the metal
wire enclosing each associated primary enclosure.
*Not cleaning these areas and by allowing grime to accumulate can pose a disease hazard for the animals, may attract
insects or pests, and result in odors as well.
*Perches, bars, shelves, and the wire mesh must be kept clean and be replaced when worn to maintain husbandry
standards and a healthy environment for the animals.

Facilities, general.
A few areas were found to not be in good repair nor protecting the animals from injury:
• The shelter structure in the primary enclosure for two Tammar wallabies has a rotten board that helps support the roof.
This rotten board is completely broken in the middle and is no longer structurally sound. Also, there is netting material
that covers this enclosure which, in some areas, has a large volume of tree debris and leaves that is causing the netting
to sag down into the enclosure. The licensee has placed wooden boards vertically from the ground to the netting material
to prop the netting up. These boards are not fastened or secured and easily wobble as they are just leaning by tension
from the ground up to the sagging netting.
• Unprotected electrical cords were observed in the shared primary enclosure for the Bennett and Swamp wallabies.
Within the back part of their shelter, an unprotected electrical power source cord of approximately 12 inches in length
originated underground and went up the wall to a mounted wall electrical outlet. Then, an unprotected electrical extension
cord measuring about 3 feet in length went further up the wall from the electrical outlet to the lowered ceiling of the shelter


which powered hung heaters.
*Loose and unsecured boards pose a significant health risk to the animals due the potential of the board falling on them
and causing injury. The unprotected electrical cords can be chewed or pulled on which allows for potential electrocution,
injury and/or death.
*Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury including limiting access to electrical
cords, securing loose boards.

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence is not currently 6 feet in height in all areas and for some species (the wallabies and capybaras), the
perimeter fence is serving as two sides of their enclosure. A variance was granted previously but the permission was on
the basis that a 6-foot perimeter fence was in place and that it contained red kangaroos and a small species of deer at
that time. Currently, the perimeter fence mostly varies from a low in some areas of 4 feet (at the gate for the capybara
and wallaby enclosures) to 5 feet in most other areas but especially at the Swamp and Bennett wallabies shared primary
enclosure. The nonhuman primates and coatis are located in the middle of the property in a sheltered primary enclosure
with indoor and outdoor areas, but they are also enclosed by this same perimeter fence.
*The perimeter fence must be 6 feet in height and 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosures so that it can function as
a secondary containment system as well as protect the animals by restricting other animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it, under it, or having contact with the animals in the facility.
*The facility shall construct a suitable perimeter fence that meets the above requirements or obtain a written variance from
the Administrator.
