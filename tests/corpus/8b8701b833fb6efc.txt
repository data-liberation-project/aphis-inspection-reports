FEEDING.
On today's inspection most of the self feeders in the big building were identified to have a moderate to heavy
black/brown buildup of excreta, debris and caked food in the open lip where the dogs access their food. Food
receptacles that are not kept clean can contaminate food the dogs are ingest. All food containers must be cleaned
and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 of the regulation; at least every two weeks or more often if necessary to
prevent the buildup of excreta, debris, and caking of food.

3.11(b)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
On today's inspection most enclosures in the big building have a moderate to heavy accumulation of excreta, food
waste, hair, and other organic material build up on the walls and wire mesh flooring of the enclosure. There were 3
dogs on today's inspection that had excreta on their legs, back or feet due to the amount of building in their
enclosure. In addition, the under side of their enclosures have an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste
and excreta. The lack of cleaning and sanitizing is a direct result of the high ammonia level within the facility and
subjects the dogs to unnecessary disease hazards. All enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as
necessary to prevent the soiling of dogs and to prevent the buildup of excreta, food waste, hair, and other organic
material build up.
