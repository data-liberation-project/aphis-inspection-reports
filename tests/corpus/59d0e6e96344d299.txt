Improperly stored food supplies for NHP can become contaminated and can deteriorate in its nutritive value and allow
vermin infestation.

Supplies of food and bedding for NHPs must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage,
contamination and vermin infestation. When not in use, open food supplies must be kept in leak proof containers with
tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination. To be corrected by 10/8/2021.

Facilities, general.
Several primary enclosures need maintenance and/or repair:
• Primary enclosure housing 5 whitetail deer had a leaning chain-link fence with protruding pipe and wire which provided
numerous sharp edges.
• Primary enclosure holding a coyote had an elevated platform with several missing and worn boards.
• Primary enclosure housing a white raccoon had an elevated platform which was accessed by wooden stairs composed
of broken and rotted wood which cause it to lean and be unstable.
• Primary enclosure housing a bobcat had an elevated platform with broken and rotted wood.
• Primary enclosure housing 2 macaques had a lixit (waterspout) that was no longer secured to the enclosure. One of the
macaques was observed vigorously pushing the lixit away and then pulling it quickly back toward the enclosure.
• Primary enclosure housing a leopard had a platform with several damaged and rotting wood planks.
• Two primary enclosures housing one gibbon each had resting platforms which were unstable and shook as the animals
pounced on and from them.

Sharp edges and damaged platforms can cause injury or harm to the animals.

Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by 11/7/2021.

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence is incomplete. A portion of the perimeter fence has an intended gap, per the licensee. The perimeter
fence also serves as a side wall for the pig and goat enclosure. There is a gap in the fence that allows the animals to
enter an outside pasture.

A complete perimeter fence is intended to keep animals and unauthorized persons out.

The perimeter fence must protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment
system for the animals in the facility. To be corrected by 11/7/2021.
