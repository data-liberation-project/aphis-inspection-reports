FEEDING.
A large bag of alfalfa cubes meant as rabbit food and enrichment was found uncovered in a feed barn. Peacocks
are loose in the barn. Uncovered food may become contaminated by dust or bird droppings and may provide an
environment favorable for vermin. Food should be stored in such a manner that it is kept wholesome, palatable, and
free from contamination. Consuming contaminated food may be detrimental to the health of the animals.

SANITATION.
Approximately 30 rabbit primary enclosures have an excessive amount of hair build-up. Hair is adhered to the floors
and sides of the enclosures. The hair is thick enough to prevent feces from falling through the wire flooring in many
enclosures and also appears to be stained with urine in some enclosures.
Approximately 50 rabbit primary enclosures have an excessive amount of rust adhered to the sides of the
enclosures under the automatic water spigots or on the identification card holders attached to the enclosures.
Rabbit enclosures should be kept reasonably clean and free of hair and debris such as rust. Failure to keep the
cages clean could increase animal exposure to disease causing agents and be detrimental to their health.

FEEDING.
Hay used to feed the goats at the facility is being stored directly on the ground and uncovered, or partially coveredby tarps. The sides of several stored bales are noticeably darkened and discolored. A staff member stated that
while the hay appears to be bad on the edges, the center of the bales are not bad and are fed to the goats while the
edges are fed to the unregulated cattle.
Hay that is stored so that it is exposed to the elements may become contaminated and may lose nutritive value. Hay
should be stored in such a manner that it remains wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of
sufficient nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health.
