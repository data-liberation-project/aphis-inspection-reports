ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The two year old, female, Maltese/Bichon Frise dog with USDA tag number 02 is squinting her left eye. There is a
mild amount of clear discharge below her left eye. Eye conditions can be uncomfortable for the dog and can lead to
permanent eye damage if not treated properly.
The seven year old, female, Yorkshire Terrier with USDA tag number 15 has dental disease, dirty ears, and long
toenails. The gums have receded from the base of both of the upper canine teeth and there is a mild amount of
hard, brown, material on the canine and cheek teeth. Dental disease can be painful and lead to further health
problems if left untreated. It can also make it difficult for the animals to chew hard food.
The left ear has a large accumulation of greasy, brown material in the ear canal. Dirty ears can be uncomfortable
for the dog and can be an indication of a more serious issue such as an injury or infection.
The front toenails are excessively long. Long toenails can lead to more serious injuries if the nails get caught in the
wire flooring.
The six year old, female, Maltese dog with USDA tag number 31 has thickened, leathery skin. The head, neck and
inguinal areas of the dog appear to be the most severely affected. The animal was not observed to be scratching
and the skin does not appear to be inflamed. There are many causes of skin conditions in dogs and the proper
diagnosis is necessary to initiate the proper treatment.
These three dogs must be examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of the examination, diagnosis, and
treatment for each dog must be maintained by the Licensee and made available to APHIS officials for review.
