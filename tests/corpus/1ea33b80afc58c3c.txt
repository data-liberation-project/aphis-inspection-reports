Space requirements.
Gilts and dry sows spend 7-11 days in enclosures that do not provide sufficient space to turn around. These enclosures
do not allow adequate freedom of movement for normal postural and social adjustments as required.

Insufficient space prevents normal postural and social adjustments, which can lead to stress and affect the animals'
comfort and wellbeing. Enclosures should provide sufficient space for the animals to make normal postural movements
and social adjustments.
