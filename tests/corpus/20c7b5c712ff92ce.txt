3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The interior surface of the lower level structural supports of the metal enclosure for the cotton top tamarin have a lot
of rust and some areas have rusted completely through. Rust is not sanitizable and the rusted through areas create
sharp and jagged edges that can injure the animal. The facility must ensure that surfaces that the non-human
primate can come into contact with are free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitation, or
that affects the structural strength of the surface for the well being of the animal. The facility showed the inspector
an appropriate enclosure that was not in use in which they could house the tamarin.
Correct from this point forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
