Contingency planning.
There was no written contingency plan available at time of this inspection. Failure to have a written contingency plan can
result in lack of readiness for emergencies or disasters which could impact animal health and well-being. Facilities must
develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing,
and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster.

Housing facilities, general.
Outdoor enclosure housing dog, Tobias: A shelter door flap has broken off and exposed a square-shaped, metal hinge at
the top of the entrance to the shelter structure. The hinge had four sharp pointed ends and was protruding into the shelter
entry.

Outdoor enclosure housing dogs, Cleopatra and Wynona Judd: The frame material which surrounds the outer edges of
the shelter entrance was in disrepair. The frame is loose and has left an approximately one-inch gap between the frame
and the shelter entrance opening at the bottom.



Sharp or pointed metal edges within the enclosures could result in punctures or laceration wounds to the animals. Gaps
or loose openings due the disrepair of shelter framing material may cause entrapment of the animals’ legs or other
injuries. Housing facilities for dogs must be in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injuries and contain the
animals securely. A system of facility repair and maintenance must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of the
animals.

sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.
