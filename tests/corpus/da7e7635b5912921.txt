OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At least two outdoor dog shelters are in need of repair. The fronts of these dog shelters have been chewed and
there are cracks around the lower edges. As a result of this damage to the shelters they no longer provide
adequate protection from rain, wind and direct rays of the sun. All outdoor shelters must provide the dogs with
adequate protection from the elements at all times. Correct by 27 April 2015.
The routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
