SANITATION.
*** The sugar glider exercise wheels have not been cleaned for over a month according to an employee. These
wheels were very dirty with caked on fecal debris and grime. These exercise wheels need to be cleaned frequently
to prevent contamination of the animals when they utilize the wheels. These wheels were cleaned at the time of the
inspection. A schedule for cleaning needs to be implemented to assure wheels are cleaned with the enclosures in a
timely manner.
