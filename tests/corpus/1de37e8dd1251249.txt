2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Since the last inspection, the new attending veterinarian has visited the facility for a formally scheduled visit to the
premises and has signed a written program of veterinary care. However the written program of veterinary care does
not include all species currently at the facility (zebu and bison) and does not include pertinent details regarding the
veterinary care of the animals. There is no information about what dosages or frequency of administration are
recommended for the few drugs and vaccines listed. There is no information as to parasite control methods, capture
methods or TB testing for the exotic species. There is no information included regarding vaccinations, parasite
control methods, emergency care or euthanasia of the domestic species. The owner states he has contacted the
attending veterinarian but has not yet had the written program of veterinary care updated. The facility shall ensure
that there is a complete written program of veterinary care approved by the attending veterinarian.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The new attending veterinarian has signed a written environment enhancement program that is not complete. It
does not include all the non-human primate species currently at the facility (snow macaque), does not cover all
special considerations currently in place at the facility (isolated spider monkey) and lacks species specific
recommendations for socalization and environmental enrichment. Non-human primates are highly social animals
whose psychologically well-being, to include socialization, environmental enrichment and special considerations,
needs to be cared for in order to ensure their overall well-being. The owner states he has contacted the attending
veterinarian but has not yet had the written program updated. Under the direction of the attending veterinarian and
in accordance with accepted professional standards, the facility shall develop, document and follow an appropriate
plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of the non-human primates.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Since the last inspection there have been no changes to any perimeter fencing and the owner states that noamended variance request has been submitted to the Regional Office. A written draft of the variance request letter
viewed today has been started and almost completed but has not yet been submitted to the Regional Office. A
secondary perimeter fence is required to ensure that the animals are not injured/distressed by outside
animals/wildlife/humans and to act as a secondary containment system in case of escape. The housing facilities for
all the outdoor non-farm animal species exhibited must be enclosed by a secondary perimeter fence of at least 6 ft
height or an addition to the current variance needs to be obtained.
This is a focused inspection on the non-compliances from the previous inspection report.
Exit conducted with owner and undersigned facility representative.
