REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Although formerly a licensed exhibitor, the facility is not currently licensed. The facility offers a petting zoo with
animals that include goats, pigs, llamas, and miniature cows. There is an entrance fee to the animal area, and the
public is allowed to feed and interact with the animals.
Exhibiting animals outside of compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations could be detrimental to the
animals. These regulations were instituted to protect their welfare by providing regulatory oversight.
Conducting regulated activities without a USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
