2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:57 AM on
18-JUN-18.
Inspector contacted the licensee by the cell phone on file. The licensee stated that he had to go out of town and
was unable to conduct an inspection today. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
