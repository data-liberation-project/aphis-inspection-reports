3.25(a)

Facilities, general.
Although the enclosure walls were 7 inches in height, during the inspection, three guinea pigs were observed to be out of
their enclosures. One was loose on the floor of the facility and two were outside the facility.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosures could be at risk of injury as well as the inability to access food and water.
In particular, guinea pigs that are outside the facility are at risk of escaping and not being recaptured and being injured or
killed by predators.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
