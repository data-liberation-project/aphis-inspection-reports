FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On today’s inspection, the hay for being fed to the guinea pigs was observed stored directly on the floor.
Feed/food that is stored inappropriately can result in deterioration of the food or be contaminated by pests, mold, or
other sources and if used, cause illness in the animals.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against spoilage or
deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Upon entering the building housing the guinea pigs, there was a strong ammonia odor causing the inspector's eyes
and nose to burn. This was a result of soiled enclosures in need of more frequent cleaning and the vents being kept
only partially opened. When the facility representative opened the vents further and opened the door the odor
dissipated.
Failure to provide fresh air can expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
Remains uncorrected.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In several of the guinea pig pens, the wooden sides of the enclosure are chewed, worn down, and have exposed
unsealed wood. There are also several pens that have chewed and exposed wood around the opening for the
automatic watering system. Additionally, all of the pens have a thin piece of wood attached to the tops of the walls
to increase wall height. This wood is not sealed or painted and therefore is not impervious to moisture.
Chewed, exposed wood or unsealed wood that is not impervious to moisture can be difficult to clean and sanitizeand can increase the spread of disease through improper sanitation.
Enclosures for guinea pigs must be kept structurally sound, maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can
be readily cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.

SANITATION.
Many enclosures in this facility require additional cleaning. Approximately half of the enclosures have an
accumulation of dirt and debris especially in the corners and excessive build-up of fecal material.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
The licensee must thoroughly clean all primary enclosures often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and
debris.
Remains uncorrected.
