HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least two enclosures in the first building, there are wires hanging off the access doors and the sharp points of
these wires are located at the level of the dogs. There are at least three dogs housed in these enclosures. Also in
the first building, there is one enclosure whose wire side has broken along the floor resulting in sharp points at the
level of the dog. There is one dog housed in this enclosure. Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.
Enclosures must be free of sharp points or jagged edges that could injure the animals. The licensee must remove
all sharp points from all dog enclosures to ensure that they remain safe for the animals. Corrected at the time of
