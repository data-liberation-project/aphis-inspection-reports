INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Required reports had not been generated and thus were not available for review at the time of the inspection.
Reports of evaluations conducted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) to review the
facility's program for humane care and use of the animals and inspections of the animal facilities had not been
prepared and submitted to the Institutional Official (IO) for any IACUC activities that occurred during 2014.
The facility should ensure that reports are generated for IACUC activities, are submitted to the IO, and are made
available to APHIS officials during unannounced inspections in order that facility compliance with the Animal
Welfare Act may be evaluated.
Correct for all future IACUC evaluations.
2.31(d)(1)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A principal investigator (PI) using regulated animals did not provide a written assurance that the activities being
performed do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that activities using animals are performed in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act. The duplicative use of animals in experiments may result in animals experiencing unnecessary
pain or distress. The IACUC should not approve an activity using animals without the assurance of the PI that
animals will not be used in an unnecessary, duplicative experiment.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUCU approved protocol using animals for antibody production did not contain a complete description of the
proposed use of the animals. The protocol did not include any description of bleed schedules or recovery periods,
maximum volumes of blood to be collected, or guidelines for monitoring the animals to determine their suitability for
blood collection.
The IACUC is responsible for reviewing all aspects of animal care and use and for evaluating protocols in order to
ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. To accomplish this function, the IACUC must be made aware of all
aspects of animal use that could have a significant impact on animal welfare. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to
ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of proposed activities that involve the use of animals in
order that those activities may be adequately reviewed and determined to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare
Act.
