2.40(a)(1) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The applicant does not have a written program of veterinary care filled out by the attending veterinarian. The licensee
does have three veterinarians that have agreed to work with the facility.

The lack of a complete program of veterinary care with the written guidance from the veterinarian can be a source of
confusion and non compliance with the veterinarian's directions of care for the regulated animals.

The applicant must make sure that his attending veterinarian fills out a complete program of vet care for each species.
2.75 Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are two animals that are on the inventory, a male fennec fox and a male North American porcupine, that are not at
the facility. There is no documentation of the location where the animals are being kept or when they began staying at an
alternate location.

Updated and accurate record keeping is necessary for the proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.


The applicant must keep complete records of the animals on hand as well as their locations and dates when they are
moved to another facility or location. The inventory should have complete current information of all animals owned and at
the licensed facility.
2.131(a) Repeat

Handling of animals.
The applicant acquired 2 tigers and 2 cougars for exhibition over the past two years. All licensees/applicants who maintain
wild/exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of those animals. There have been many
dangerous incidents, documented in previous inspection reports, that prove a lack of the necessary knowledge and
experience.

Since the acquisition of these dangerous animals, the applicant has not taken steps to gain the acquired knowledge, other
than having a person with tiger cub experience at the facility for a short time and talking with other licensees. The
applicant can bring an experienced person (with these species) to the facility or go to other facilities and work with them to
gain the required knowledge/experience.

Lack of the required knowledge/experience is dangerous for the licensee/applicant/volunteers/public and the animals and
could result in serious injury or death in any of those groups.

All licensees/applicants who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of
the species they maintain.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

The metal food bowl used in the cat primary enclosure had a large buildup of dirt and debris around the inside of the
entire surface of the bowl. There were some hay strands in the food bowl. The accumulation of dirt in this bowl does not
allow for proper sanitization of the surfaces in order to provide a clean receptacle for uncontaminated food. The cleaning
and sanitization is not often enough to prevent the dirt buildup.

The lack of clean surfaces or receptacles for food can cause possible health or disease hazards.

All food and water receptacles should be cleaned often enough to prevent the buildup of dirt and debris in order to allow
for proper sanitization and to prevent buildup. Food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least
once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other
disease hazards.

3.75(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There are several wooden beams at the top of the primary enclosure holding three Japanese Macaques that have been
chewed, exposing raw wood beneath the painted surfaces.

The chewing of wood surfaces can be a possible source of injury for the primates due to splinters that could puncture their
mouths, hands/feet, or become ingested possibly causing serious health issues.

All surfaces must be repaired or replaced and kept in good condition to prevent injury to the regulated animals.

3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The eight-foot perimeter fence surrounding the facility is still under construction. The South and East sides of the facility
are still completely open with no fence structure to prevent animals from escaping the property. The North and NW part of
the property has a six-foot perimeter fence, with the SW part of the property having an eight-foot wooden fence behind the
tiger, cougar, macaque and porcupine enclosures.

An eight-foot perimeter fence is required for the two cougars and two tigers that are in outdoor primary enclosures on the
facility property due to being considered dangerous animals.

There is no six-foot perimeter fence completely surrounding the non-dangerous animals as required. This requirement is
for animals such as the three badgers (bottom of the perimeter fence is not secured and open for animals to get under),
the two coati, Geoffroy's cat, bobcat and two Tayra.

While a six-foot perimeter fence and partial eight-foot perimeter fence surround over half the facility, the remaining South
and East sides are open which can allow any of these animals to escape if they get out of their primary enclosures, and
allow other animals or people to gain entry into the facility and make direct contact with the enclosures.

A perimeter fence must be completed for the dangerous and non-dangerous animals per USDA regulations and
standards for those species.



During the inspection a small piglet, approximately 3-4 weeks of age, was observed outside of the primary enclosure
fence surrounding the pig and goat area within the facility. Within a minute of being observed the piglet was seen entering
back into the primary enclosure by squeezing through the 2in x 4in mesh of the fence. There were 13 baby piglets of
similar size that could all currently or until recently have the ability to leave the primary enclosure at any time through the
fence.

This fence spacing is too large to safely contain the piglets. There is a risk of the piglets becoming prey for other animals
or being injured while going in and out of the fence.

The applicant must provide an area where the piglets will not escape through the fence.
3.129

Feeding.
There are three goats kept in a fenced area across the driveway of the facility. The food bowl contained dry dog food due
to the facility running out of grain. The applicant advised they ran out of grain and sometimes feed dog food to the goats.
There was no documentation from the attending veterinarian that advised feeding dog food to goats was an approved
diet.

The lack of an appropriate, species specific diet could cause serious health issues or malnutrition if not fed properly. All
diets should be approved by the attending veterinarian if feeding a diet that is made specifically for another species than
what that diet was made for.


The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and
type of the animal.

There was a large buildup of dirt/debris and old food in the feeding receptacle for the prairie dogs.

The buildup of dirt and debris can cause a health hazard for the regulated animals.

The feeding receptacles should be cleaned often enough to prevent the molding, contamination, and deterioration or
caking of food.
