3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
Two enclosures failed contain animals or protect the animals from injury.
***In December 2022, over 2 nights, 11 fallow deer were killed by stray dogs that dug under the pasture fence and
entered the enclosure housing the deer. After the first night the licensee repaired the affected area of fence, but the dogs
returned and were able to dig under the fence again. Since the incident, the licensee has repaired and secured the fence
and the stray dogs are no longer in the area.
***A young female wallaby was spooked and was able to pass through the wire fence wall of her enclosure into an
adjacent pasture which was still within the facility's perimeter fence. After consulting with the Attending Veterinarian, the
licensee darted the animal in order to capture her. The animal died soon after it was darted.
Animals in enclosures that do not adequately protect them from escape, injury, or predators may suffer from stress, injury,
or death.
Correct by February 17, 2023 by ensuring that all animal enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair
to contain the animals and protect the animals from injury. Corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.


An enclosure containing sheep, goats, and other animals was extremely muddy. The enclosure was an outdoor pasture
containing some trees and two shelter structures. There was deep mud around the shelter structures and water trough.
Animals were unable to enter or exit the shelter structures without walking through deep mud.
Animals in enclosures that are excessively muddy may suffer from foot issues, poor hygiene, and may become cold if wet
or muddy. Young animals may struggle to walk through the mud.
Correct by February 17, 2023 by ensuring that all animals are contained in enclosures with adequate drainage.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
