Feeding.
Some boxes and plastic bags or containers of food in the freezers of the polar bear and pinniped/otter areas are not
labeled as to contents or expiration dates. Frozen treats are not labeled as to contents or preparation date, and are left
uncovered in the freezer.
Identifying contents and important dates on food containers helps determine freshness and wholesomeness, and helps
prevent mistakes in feeding.
Corrected at the time of inspection by labeling all containers. Ensure all stored foods continue to be properly labeled from
this point forward.

Feeding.
A bag of frozen feeder rodents in the cougar area was unsealed and unlabeled.
Length of storage and potential freezer burn from unsealed containers can diminish wholesomeness and palatability of
foods.
Corrected at the time of inspection by properly labeling and sealing containers in the freezer. Ensure containers are
labeled and sealed from this point forward.
