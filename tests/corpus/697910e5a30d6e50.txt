ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:35 PM on
03-JAN-18.
When I arrived at the facility at 12:35 pm, there was no facility representative present. I called a facility
representative at 12:37 pm and left a message with a call-back number regarding the attempted inspection. I called
again at 1:02 pm and when a facility representative answered, she stated no one was there to conduct the
inspection with me and she was unable to meet me herself.
