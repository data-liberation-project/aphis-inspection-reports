OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the elements.
An adult male German Sheperd identified by microchip (075-880-845) was acquired by the licensee approximately
two weeks ago. The dog is being kept in an outdoor enclosure that does not include a shelter structure. The
enclosure has sheet metal on the roof and along the north and south sides. The east and west sides are
constructed out of coated wire. The licensee stated that the pen is only used when quarantining new dogs. The
licensee also stated the dog will be moved to the sheltered housing area when the test results are available and
there are no health concerns.
Not having access to sheltered housing that will provide protection from direct effects of wind and rain can be
stressful causing discomfort for the dog. The licensee must include one or more shelter structures that are
accessible and that are large enough to allow the animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor,
and must provide the dogs with adequate protection and shelter from the cold, heat, wind, rain, snow and direct rays
of the sun.
