2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
While reviewing records it was noted that the written program of veterinary care was inaccurate. The program of
veterinary care listed pigs and hamsters as the current inventory, however, rabbits are currently housed at the
facility. The program of veterinary care should be updated to accurately reflect the current inventory of animals on
hand. Lack of a complete program of veterinary care does not ensure proper veterinary care is being provided in
accordance with currently accepted veterinary medical standards.
