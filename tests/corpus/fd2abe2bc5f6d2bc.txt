There is no documentation provided to verify reports sent to the Institutional Officer (IO), including IACUC meeting
minutes and semi-annual program and facility inspections, for the last year have been reviewed and approved by a
majority of the IACUC. A system should be in place to ensure the required reports are reviewed and signed by a
majority of the IACUC members and include any minority views.
To be corrected from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
