ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There was a white, female, adult Morkie #0A02257345 housed in an enclosure with three other dogs. The Morkie
was extremely thin with minimal muscle mass so that nearly all her bones (shoulders, spine, ribs, hips, legs, etc.)
were prominent and could very easily be felt. The protrusion of some of these bones could be visualized despite
the dog's longer hair. The licensee stated that the other dogs were probably keeping the Morkie from getting her
fair share of food. The dog was then placed in an enclosure by herself and ate voraciously when provided with
food.
** Dogs with a very poor body condition could be lacking adequate nutrients or could have a medical condition
which could be detrimental to the animal's health.
* There was a male Shih Tzu #0A02033155 who had a small circular white lesion on the surface of both his left and
right eyes. The lesion on the left eye had a reddened area around it. The licensee had not noticed the lesions until
they were pointed out during the inspection.
** Abnormal lesions on the eyeballs can indicate the animal may have a painful medical condition.
* There was a red, female Shiba Inu, "Tori" #0A02255154 and a black and tan, male Shiba Inu, "Chewy"
#0A02315019 housed together in an enclosure in the whelping room. Both dogs were making a strange,
honking-type sound as they were barking/coughing.
** An abnormal cough/bark could indicate the dogs may have a medical condition which could be harmful to the
dogs and possibly contagious to the other young puppies in the room.
*** All of the above mentioned animals need to be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to obtain accurate
diagnoses and to ensure appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. All animals must receive
adequate veterinary care at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 25 March 2014
3.6(a)(2)(1)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General Requirements
* The metal flashing around one of the dog doors was ripping up where the nails were located resulting in sharp,
jagged edges which the dogs had to step on in order to get in and out of their enclosure. There were also a few
broken wires protruding into a few enclosures resulting in sharp points. In the whelping room there were several
enclosures which used wire mesh flooring material to contain the puppies to one half of the enclosures. Most of
these wire dividers had small sharp points at their tops where the wire was not cut flush.
** Sharp points and jagged edges could puncture the dogs and puppies resulting in painful wounds which could get
infected.
*** The licensee must ensure that enclosures contain no sharp points or edges that could injure the animals. TO BE
CORRECTED BY: 4 April 2014
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
