the written Program of Veterinary Care were not with the traveling exhibit. Animal acquisition and disposition
information is necessary to allow animal tracking for animal disease and ownership purposes. A copy of the written
Program of Veterinary Care is necessary for facility personnel to review to ensure the instructions of the attending
veterinarian are followed for the health of the animals. The animal acquisition/disposition information and the
written Program of Veterinary Care are required to be kept by the Animal Welfare regulations. Correct by getting
the capybara acquisition information and the written Program of Veterinary Care for the traveling exhibit. Correct by
September 14, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
This inspection was conducted at the Allentown Fair in Allentown, PA.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the "prepared by" date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 31, 2016.
