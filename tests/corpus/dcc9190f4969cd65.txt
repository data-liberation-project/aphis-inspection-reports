* The metal base square tubing to help support the wire panels is showing excessive rust. The affected area is
located in the outside building housing nineteen dogs. Some of the tubing has rusted completely through.
Excessive rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces which affects the structural strength of the metal. The
licensee must ensure that all metal surfaces are structurally sound, kept in good repair and must protect the animals
from injury. To be corrected by 06-30-17.
