(a) Structural strength.
***The framework for the Tiger enclosures, the Bear enclosure and portions of the wire panels are rusted. There is a
wire panel on the front portion of the Bear enclosure that has a broken cross wire. The wires around this break are
rusted and bent. Left unattended, the rust can worsen the structural strength of the enclosure allowing for injury or
escape. The licensee must repair this broken area and assure that all areas of rust are kept in good repair as
required.
To be corrected by May 30, 2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(d) Waste disposal.
***In the Tiger enclosures there were feathers, bones, left-over turkey parts that were covered with flies, leaves, dirt
and other debris on the floor portion. The facility representative stated that the Tigers had been fed on 5/10/14.
There were also piles of debris that had been cleaned out of the enclosures that were placed up against the dens
just outside the enclosures. Old food, debris and other waste materials that are not removed from the enclosures
increases the risk of disease by attracting pest and providing a harboring place for them. The licensee must remove
the waste material from these enclosures and assure that all enclosures are cleaned as required.

SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
***In the Bear enclosure the waste material drain was full of liquid, shavings and fecal material. There were piles of
fecal material on the floor of the enclosure from the drain out to the edge of the den doorway and up to the front of
the enclosure. The Bear was observed walking through the feces when he walked on this side of the enclosure andturned around. Paw prints of feces were on the right side of the enclosure floor. At least one of the piles of feces
was covered with a white coating. Among the feces was several areas of standing liquid. The liquid was a
brownish/rusty color. Waste materials that are not removed from the enclosures can soil the animals and increase
the risk of disease by attracting pest and providing a harboring place for them. The licensee must remove the waste
material from the enclosure and assure that all enclosures are cleaned as required.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
An additional exit conference was conducted with the licensee on 5/13/14.
