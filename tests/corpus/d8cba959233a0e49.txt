2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not have a written program of veterinary care. Recorded site visits to the facility by the attending
veterinarian are also not available. Failure to have a written program of veterinary care does not ensure the covered
animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
Good communication and consultation between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form of a written
program of veterinary care, are necessary to ensure adequate veterinary care is being provided at the facility. The
licensee shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements, schedule regular visits to the premises
and complete the written program of veterinary care. The written program of veterinary care must also be made
available at the time of inspection.
Exit briefing conducted with the facility representative.
