2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The light colored female pig in the second pig pen (containing a total of four pigs), is noted to have overgrown hooves;
the hooves are curving and the toes are beginning to drag along the ground when the pig lifts its feet to walk due to a lack
of regular hoof trimming. Failure to properly maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause
injuries. The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, to include
timely and appropriate hoof care as needed.

Housing facilities, general.
***In the enclosure containing one female marmoset, there is a nesting box made of plywood with an accumulation of
feces on the top. The wood on some parts of the box is not sealed, making cleaning difficult.
***In the enclosure containing one adult male African green monkey, there is an accumulation of bird excreta on the patio
of the outdoor area.
Soiled surfaces that are not or cannot be adequately cleaned can harbor harmful microbes and encourage microbial
growth, attract pests and vermin, and can lead to animal illness. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in


contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. Surfaces of
housing facilities, including houses, dens and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
***In the enclosure containing two adult female lemurs there are scraps of plastic trash.
***In the enclosure containing one adult male African green monkey, there is a plastic trash bag and scraps of plastic
debris. The facility representative mentioned these items likely blew into the enclosures from the parking lot. Trash and
debris in enclosures can cause entrapment or injury, or illness to the animals if ingested. Premises where housing
facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair in order to
protect the nonhuman primates from injury and to facilitate the husbandry practices required in the regulations.

Facilities, general.
In the kitchen food preparation area, there is a container of kibble stored on top of the refrigerator alongside cleaning
products. Storing food in close proximity to chemicals can contaminate the food and lead to animal illness. The licensee
must ensure that supplies of food are stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage or contamination, and that
chemicals are stored away from food and food preparation areas.

Facilities, general.


***In a racoon pen containing two adult raccoons, there is an accumulation of feces, dirty mulch and a soiled tarp covering
a large portion of the enclosure floor. There are a great number of flies swarming the enclosure around the waste
accumulation.
***In the enclosure containing a single male bobcat named "Maui," there is a soiled hammock hanging from the top of the
enclosure that cannot be used because there is a very large hole in the bottom portion that would hold the animal. There
are also broken enrichment items and miscellaneous debris inside the enclosure. A caretaker removed some broken
enrichment items at the time of inspection when mentioned by the inspector.
Accumulation of animal and food wastes and debris encourages microbial growth, attracts pests and vermin, and can lead
to animal illness; damaged enrichment can cause animal injury. The licensee must provide for the removal and disposal
of animal and food wastes, bedding, trash and debris to minimize insect and vermin infestation and odors and to protect
the animals from illness or injury.

Feeding.
In an enclosure housing two camels, one zebra, one zedonk, one alpaca, one llama and two miniature cows, there is a
large metal food trough with produce to feed the animals. The food trough is dirty with caked on, decomposing food from
previous feedings. There is also an accumulation of flies on the food and swarming above the trough. Food receptacles
that are not kept clean and sanitary can lead to food contamination and attract pests and vermin, leading to animal illness.
The licensee must ensure that food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary at all times to maintain the health and well-
being of the animals and prevent excessive insects. Adequate measures must be in place to prevent molding,
contamination, and deterioration or caking of food.

Watering.
In the pen containing one male gray fox, the interior of the water receptacle is noted to be densely covered in algae; along
the bottom of the receptacle, the algae is greater than 2" long. When asked about the minimum frequency of sanitation
for food and water receptacles, the caretaker charged with that task stated that he was not given a minimum frequency for
sanitizing receptacles but tried to do it as often as needed.
Watering receptacles that are not regularly cleaned can cause animals' drinking water to become contaminated or
unpalatable, leading to illness. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.

Sanitation.
***The floor of the commissary is dirty around the refrigerator and shelves, where dried-on vegetable matter and rodent
feces are noted.
***There are a large number of flies in the commissary, swarming and landing on food preparation surfaces; the only two
fly strips suspended from the ceiling are full of flies.
Premises that are not kept clean do not facilitate adequate husbandry; they also attract vermin and pests and can result in
contamination of food. The licensee needs to keep facilities clean and in good repair, and establish and maintain an
effective method and schedule to keep the premises, including the food preparation area and all food storage areas, clean
and sanitary. In addition, a safe and effective program for the control of insects and other vermin must be established and
maintained.
