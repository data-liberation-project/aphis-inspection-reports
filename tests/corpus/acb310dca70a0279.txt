SANITATION.
Numerous live mice were noted through out the sugar glider and hedgehog portions of the facility. Mice can be
vectors for disease and it is essential that the population of live mice within the facility be minimized. New
construction is planned that should eliminate the problem. In the meantime a more effective means of pest control
must be implemented and maintained to minimize the mice at the the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owners of the facility.
