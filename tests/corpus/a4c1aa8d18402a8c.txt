3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
A couple of dog boxes didn't have bedding for three adult Labrador Retrievers. Temperature at the time of inspection was
40 degrees F. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing a sufficient source to keep them warm increases the risk of
stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. The applicant must ensure shelters contain clean, dry, bedding material if the
ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees
F or lower.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by January 12, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
