2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is not scheduling regular visits to their facility by the Attending Veterinarian (AV). The licensee's
Program of Veterinary Care states that these visits will occur annually, however, the last visit by the AV was on
8/16/13 according to records supplied during the inspection. Facility visits are necessary to ensure that the Program
of Veterinary Care is being understood and followed by the licensee, to check the health and well-being of the
animals and to determine if changes in the Program of Veterinary Care are needed.
Each dealer shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care
and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer.
To be corrected by 2/15/15.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The enclosure housing 1 female serval "Jamie" and an enclosure housing 1 male serval "Chip", had excessive
accumulation of debris (dried blood, food debris, dirt, excreta etc.) on the roof and on the plastic door covering of
the housing/den structure. These dirty surfaces come into regular contact and pose a health risk to the animals. An
excessive accumulation of waste can increase insects, pests, and odors, and may harbor pathogens and play a role
in disease transmission. These surfaces should be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard
husbandry practices.
To be corrected by 1/30/15.
Exit briefing was conducted with the owner on 1/26/15.
