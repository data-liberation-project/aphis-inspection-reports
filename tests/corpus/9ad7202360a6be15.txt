HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The indoor night house area for the gibbons, immediately adjacent to the primary enclosures, has a metal electrical
cap above the sink that is being pushed loose from the wall by plant roots growing through the wall from the exterior
of the building. The plant roots also extend between the paint layer and the interior wall and is damaging the painted
surface.
*A metal light casing in the ceiling of the spider monkey night enclosure area immediately adjacent to the primary
enclosures is excessively rusted with a resuling hole. There are rust colored stains on the wall next to the light
fixture indicating water was flowing through the light fixture and casing and down the wall through the hole.
Non-human primate housing facilities must be structurally sound and in good repair to ensure the safety of the
animals and maintain structural suitability for cleaning and sanitization. The above areas should be repaired or
replaced.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*A metal strip adjacent to the shipping door in the giraffe stall is excessively rusted. A significant hole is visible in the
metal because of deterioration.
*A section of wood at the bottom of the entry to the exterior door in the giraffe housing area is deteriorating and
soaked with liquid. Paint is peeling off the wood in the damaged area.
*A section of plywood in the area just outside the exterior door and leading to the tamer system is deteriorating. As
a result pieces of wood are missing in this damaged area.
Deteriorating surfaces are unable to be appropriately cleaned and may eventually effect structural integrity. Indoor
and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to prevent injury to the animals,
securely contain them and facilitate cleaning and any other required husbandry procedures. The above defects
must be repaired or replaced.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The kitchen in the quarantine building has cabinets constructed of particle board. The cabinets were damaged by
water and are now deteriorating and crumbling. Several drawer fronts and doors to the cabinets are missing. Storage of certain items in this area may be inappropriate because drawers and cabinets are unable to be be
properly secured and exposure to potential toxins or contaminants could more easily occur. The deteriorating
particle board is unable to be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Buildings must be kept in good repair to support
and facilitate husbandry and housekeeping practices necessary for the maintenance of animal health and
well-being.
