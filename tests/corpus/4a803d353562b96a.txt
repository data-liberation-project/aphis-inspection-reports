2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On 2/18/15 a goat named "(cid:28)Oliver"(cid:29), which is being used under an IACUC approved teaching protocol, underwent a
blood collection procedure. The protocol specifies that Xylazine will be used for sedation during blood collections,
and
yet the animal was given Diazepam instead.
Although there was no significant animal welfare impact, the protocol should accurately describe the intended use
of analgesics and anesthetics, and the investigator should follow the protocol, or request approval of modifications
as needed, and prior to making actual changes.
Significant changes to the approved protocol, such as drugs used to minimize pain and / or distress, must be
approved by the IACUC. Investigators should adhere to the approved protocol, or request approval for
modifications, in order to ensure appropriate use of animals.
A similar issue was cited on the last inspection report on 6/17/14, with a correction date of 10/31/14.
2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On 2/17/15 facility staff reported that a blood donor llama, which was on an IACUC approved teaching protocol, had
died on 1/26/15. The necropsy report states the llama had a suppurative enteritis and subsequent sepsis, poor body
condition and serous atrophy of fat. The 18 year old llama had arrived at the facility on 9/24/13 and weighed 292
pounds at that time, according to medical records. No other weights were recorded until the llama was used for a
blood collection on 12/19/14, at which time theweight was recorded at 217 lbs. There were no notations made in the
medical record at that time about the weight loss
or body condition, and no other treatment or intervention prior to the death, which was described as unexpected.
There is another llama on site currently on this same protocol. This animal arrived on 7/16/12 and weighed 373 lbs.
The current weight on this animal is 295 lbs, with a body condition score recorded as of 2 out of 5. Weights and
bodycondition evaluations had not previously been conducted on a regular basis on these animals. The facility indicates
that they have now begun monthly physical exams on these animals.
The facility should use appropriate means to evaluate the health status of the animals on a regular basis, and
investigate possible health concerns, such as substantial weight loss, in an appropriate and timely manner, in order
to safeguard the health and well-being of the animals.
Another Veterinary Care issue was cited under this same section on the last inspection on 6/17/2014, and was to
hae been corrected at the time of inspection.
This was a focused inspection on areas previously identified on inspection reports and facility self-reporting.
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives.
