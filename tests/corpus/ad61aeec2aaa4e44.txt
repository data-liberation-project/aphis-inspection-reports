ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee has a formal written program of veterinary care (PVC) that has recently been updated; however, it still
lacks sufficient detail on some of the routine care provided to the animals. The external parasite control plan only
states 'treat as necessary' but does not indicate with what products and how they should be used if external
parasites are present. The licensee is docking tails but the PVC does not give any instructions on procedure
protocol, instruments used and methods to sanitize the instruments. There was also a bottle of Oxytocin in the
fridge in the whelping building but instructions on when and how to use this product is also not on the PVC.
Regarding a dental plan for the dogs, the licensee stated that the attending veterinarian evaluates the dental health
of the dogs on the site visit to determine which dogs need a dental cleaning; however, this is also not indicated on
the PVC.
Failure to have adequate written authority approved by the attending veterinarian on treatment plans and
procedures does not ensure animals are receiving appropriate care. An incomplete PVC also does not allow the
attending veterinarian appropriate authority to ensure the provisions of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Update the written PVC so that it reflects the care being
provided to the animals and to ensure sufficient oversight by the attending veterinarian.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Condition and Site
Throughout the facility grounds, including areas that come up to and against enclosure walls, there are areas where
construction waste, discarded farm equipment, and horse barrels have accumulated. There are also areas in which
grass and weeds have grown up to almost knee high. 1 enclosure amongst enclosures in which dogs are being
housed is being used to house one goose. Outside of this enclosure, there is a plastic baby pool and a large plastic
container that contained dirty brackish water for the goose when it is not in the enclosure. These areas can house rodents, predatory animals, or insect populations, can contaminate the ground around
enclosures, and can pose injury hazards to animals that may escape. These areas also make it difficult or
impossible to properly inspect some sections of the enclosures that possibly may be damaged or hazardous to the
animals housed within. All areas around enclosures must be free of unnecessary or unused items or trash, and all
grass, weeds, trees, or other organic materials must be kept up in such a way as to provide free and easy access to
all areas in and around the enclosures during an inspection. Correct by 1 June 2014

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces--(1) General requirements.
***The enclosure next to the house garage that housed two dogs had a rusted metal post in the back corner behind
the garage. There was also a rusted metal fence section approximately two feet wide near the large tree in the
enclosure. In addition, a few metal barbwire ties used to secure the support posts were rusted. These rusted areas
had a rough surface to the metal.
***The enclosure adjacent to what the owner refers to as the new barn, which housed two dogs, had a rusted metal
hook attached to the wood wall inside the shelter area at the level of the dogs.
***On the indoor portion of the first enclosure in the north shed, which housed three dogs, the metal support pipe
along the bottom of the gate has rusted through the paint leaving a rough surface to the metal. There was a rusted
metal hook attached to the wall in the corner by the water bucket at the level of the dogs. This enclosure also had a
metal support pipe with excessive rust at the bottom on the outdoor portion on the north section of the fence. The
post has a rough surface to the metal and the pipe is breaking leaving jagged edges exposed.
***The third enclosure on the indoor portion of this same housing area, which housed two dogs, had chain link and a
metal panel along the bottom of the gate that had excessive rust leaving a rough surface to the metal. The chain link
had broken in areas where the rust was excessive leaving sharp points. This enclosure also had a metal support
pipe with excessive rust at the bottom on the outdoor portion on the north section of the fence. This post has a
rough surface to the metal and the pipe is breaking leaving jagged edges exposed.
***The shelter building attached to the south of the north building has rusted surfaces. The first enclosure housing
two dogs had a rusted metal post stuck in the ground on the outside adjacent to the wall. The alleyway inside this
building used as an enclosure for one dog had a rusted metal hook attached to the wall at the level of the dog. The
other enclosure in this building with outdoor access also had a rusted metal hook attached to the wall.
***The enclosure just north of the whelping building that housed two dogs had a rusted bottom edge of the metal
feeder where the dogs access the food. The rusted edge has also become jagged.
***The enclosures in the whelping building had rusted hinges on the access doors at the level of the dogs on the
inside of their enclosures. The alleyway of this building is also used as an enclosure for five dogs and has areas of
excessive rust at the level of the dogs. There is a rusted metal edge along the bottom of the south wall in this area,
the hinges at the bottom of the whelping enclosure doors have excessive rust and the metal medicine cabinet in thisarea also had excessive rust along the bottom.
***A plastic dog igloo in an enclosure on the new concrete pad housing two dogs had excessive chewing causing
grooves and pitting along the edge of the doorway with dirt accumulating in the grooves.
***At least two plastic water buckets for 5 dogs had excessive chewing causing grooves and pitting on the top edge
of the bucket.
***There are two shelter structures just north of the whelping building constructed in a manner that does not allow
the inside to be cleaned and sanitized. Each enclosure housed two dogs. The opening for the structure is too small
for the owners to access the shelter to properly clean and sanitize surfaces.
Failure to maintain surfaces that can be readily cleaned and sanitized may increase disease hazards or affect
structural strength leading to injury or escape of the animals. Replace, cover or repair rusted and chewed surfaces
to ensure structural strength and cleaning and sanitizing of the surfaces. Provide a means of accessing shelter
structures so that they can be cleaned and sanitized and allow for inspection. Correct by 01 June 2014.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Food Storage
There is an open bag of dog food in the animal food storage area that is approximately 1/3 full of dog food. This
bag was not closed or sealed in any way.
Feed that is not properly stored is in risk of becoming spoiled, contaminated, or infested. All open bags of animal
feed must be kept in a sealable container at all times. Correct by 16 May 2014.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage
In the large enclosure attached to the whelping building housing 2 adult German Shepherds, there is absolute
ground coverage of mud, water and waste. There is not an area in which the two animals can access that is dry or
free of moisture. Both of the animals were observed as being drenched with muddy water from the chests down.
There was standing puddles of water in the enclosure and a sour, moldy smell was evident around the enclosure.
The licensee stated that he had dumped a load of gravel into the enclosure but it was immediately overtaken with
mud and water.
There is an immediate risk of rodent or insect infestation, illness or skin conditions to the dogs housed within, and
contamination to areas around the enclosure unless proper drainage or coverage with dry material is done. Animalsmust be moved to a clean, dry area by the end of 15 May 2014 and an adequate means of drainage or coverage
with dry material in this enclosure must be completed by 1 June 2014.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the elements.
The shelter in the far southwest enclosure housing two Australian Shepherds is inadequate. A plastic travel crate is
used for their shelter and does not afford the dogs protection from the wind and rain due to the ventilation openings
in the sides of the crate. There is also not a wind break at the entrance. The roof of the shelter for two Australian
Shepherds in the first enclosure south of the whelping building is in disrepair and does not afford the dogs
protection from rain. The ceiling had water damage and is deteriorated to the point of potentially collapsing.
Inadequate shelter from wind and rain does not ensure that the dogs remain dry able to maintain a comfortable
body temperature. Provide adequate shelter structures for these dogs to ensure their health and comfort. Correct by
16 May 2014.
3.4(c) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Impervious Surfaces
There continues to be surfaces throughout the outdoor enclosures that are not impervious to moisture. This includes
the new wood posts and privacy wood fencing, unsealed wood for the platforms holding the food and water
receptacles, railroad ties and posts used along the bottom of enclosures to prevent digging, cement blocks and
landscape bricks on the ground in some of the outdoor enclosures, round wooden support posts for the fencing,
plywood and painted wood shelters where areas of the paint have worn off leaving bare wood exposed or not
sealed at all.
Unsealed surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, which could increase disease hazards and odors.
These surfaces must be made impervious to moisture or covered or replaced with materials that are impervious to
allow all surfaces in contact with the dogs to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General requirements.
The enclosure housing two Australian Shepherds just south of the whelping building contains a shelter structure thatis in disrepair. The inside back wood wall of the structure has a hole chewed through at the bottom left corner
exposing fiberglass insulation. The roof of the structure has water damage and the ceiling is now bowed and
damaged to the extent that collapse is likely.
This structure could harm the dogs by them ingesting insulation or by the structure collapsing on them. This shelter
structure is unsafe for current use and must be removed and replaced with one that is in good repair. Correct by
end of 15 May 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General requirements.
***There are multiple sharp nail heads protruding outward from the wood fencing in the enclosure next to the garage
attached to the house. Additionally, in that same enclosure, the licensee has used barbed wire to hold part of the
fence in place, exposing sharp points at eye level of the dogs within.
***In the indoor portion of the enclosure beside the garage and the machine shop housing 2 dogs, as well as the
whelping building and the indoor portion of enclosures directly beside that housing a total of at least 15 adults and
puppies, that are large sharp hooks screwed in to the walls or posts that have been used in the past to hold water
receptacles in place. These sharp hooks are at eye level to most of the dogs within.
***In the outdoor enclosure just south of the whelping building housing 2 Australian Shepherds, there is a
homemade dog house that acts as the sole shelter from the elements. Upon further inspection of this shelter,
multiple long sharp screw heads were found along every wall all pointing inward so that if animals entered the
shelter, only the center of the shelter could be utilized.
***There are multiple areas throughout the facility in which the cyclone fencing used as enclosure walls has become
damaged or unraveled in places exposing sharp points which the animals have access to.
***In several areas throughout the outdoor enclosures, cyclone fencing is attached to metal poles by way of clamps
held in place by nuts and bolts. The bolts in many of these areas are facing inward so that the animals have access
to them and some of them are as long as 4 inches with abrupt edges that could potentially tear flesh or pull hair.
***In the indoor portion of the enclosure beside the garage and the machine shop housing 2 dogs, there is a gate
that can be closed to divide the enclosure off from the outdoor portion. This gate was open during the inspection
revealing a long sharp edge from aluminum sheeting that is being used to cover the lower portion of the gate door.
Sharp points or edges present physical hazards that could injure the dogs. Repair, remove or replace these sharp
points or edges to prevent injury.
3.6(a)(2)(3) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.General requirements.
***One enclosure towards the southeast corner of the property has a large gap between the enclosure's dog house
and the chain link fence that acts as the enclosure wall. This gap has been plugged with a wooden pallet that is
loose and can be manipulated freely without much effort. There are dog paw tracks and evidence of digging
between the pallet and the dog house indicating that the two American Eskimos housed in the enclosure are able to
get into the gap and there is a possibility of escape.
***The enclosure housing two German Shepherds located between the garage and machine shed is not properly
securing the dogs. There is a gap between the chain link fencing facing the driveway and the garage beside it that
was large enough for the German Shepherds housed within to stick their heads out of the opening. During the
inspection, one of the German Shepherds was observed as it stuck its head out of the enclosure and had direct
contact with the licensee's personal pet by biting its tail. The animals growled and barked at each other and the
licensee had to intervene to stop what could have been an animal fight.
Failure to maintain enclosures that securely contain the dogs may lead to escape, injury or allow dogs that are not
compatible to have access to each other. Repair, replace or cover these areas to ensure the dogs remain secured
in their enclosures.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
The enclosure beside the garage attached to the licensee's home housing 2 dogs, the outdoor portion of the three
north shed enclosures housing approximately 6 dogs, the easternmost enclosure housing 2 German Shepherds and
at least five other outdoor enclosures housing a total of eight dogs had more than a day's worth of feces present.
The licensee stated that some of these enclosures are cleaned daily, but other enclosures have not been cleaned in
several days.

Failure to remove excreta daily from primary enclosures could increase disease hazards, pests and odors and lead
to soiling of the animals. Remove the feces from these enclosures and maintain daily removal of excreta in all
enclosures to reduce these risks and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles.
Primary enclosures for the outdoor enclosures housing at least 12 dogs are not being disinfected at least onceevery two weeks or as often as necessary to provide a clean and sanitary environment. At least 2 water receptacles
had dirty brackish water that could not be seen through. This is evidenced by the excessive accumulation of
excreta on the ground and the dirty buildup on the walls and dog doorways present in the enclosures throughout the
facility. The accumulation of cobwebs and dust on some upper surfaces of the sheltered portion of the north shed
enclosures also shows an insufficient cleaning and sanitation schedule.
Failure to clean and disinfect enclosures and food and water receptacles at least once every two weeks increases
disease hazards and accumulation of dirt, debris and excreta. Clean and disinfect all enclosures to reduce these
risks and maintain all primary enclosures and food and water receptacles on a sanitation schedule of at least once
every two weeks.
3.12 DIRECT
EMPLOYEES.
Employees.
Numerous non-compliant items concerning cleaning, disinfecting and facility maintenance and repair are present at
the facility. Several of these non-compliant items were repeats and/or directs. The two owners currently reside at
this site and have one part-time employee that assists in the care of the dogs, which currently consists of 63 adult
dogs and 12 puppies. The part-time employee is graduating in the near future and will no longer be available to
assist at this facility. Due to the number and degree of non-compliant items present at this facility, the number of
employees or temporary employees is not sufficient.
Failure to ensure that enough employees are maintained in order to carry out the level of husbandry practices and
care required in this subpart may directly affect the health and well-being of the animals. Ensure that enough
employees are maintained in order to carry out the level of husbandry practices and care required in this subpart
and that the employees can perform to these standards. Correct by 29 May 2014.
