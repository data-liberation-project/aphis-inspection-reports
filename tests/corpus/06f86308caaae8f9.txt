Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
Review of the May 2022 auction records show that SK consigned and sold 5 adult female hedgehogs over 1 year of age
and 1 female hedgehog six months of age along with four 3 month old female hedgehogs and five baby hedgehogs (tags
124-133) without a valid USDA license. This consignor did not hold a current, valid USDA license under the Animal
Welfare Act as required to sell these exotic animals. The auction was previously cited in September 2021 for accepting a
consignment of hedgehogs from this same individual without the individual having the required USDA license. No one
time exemption was noted on file. The auction facility may not consign any animal from a person required to be licensed
but who does not hold a current valid unsuspended license.

This is a focused records inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
