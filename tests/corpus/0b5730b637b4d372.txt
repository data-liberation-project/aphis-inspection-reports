2.31(d)(1)(8)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) involving terminal thoracotomy
on rabbits was being conducted at the time of inspection. During the review of records, it was discovered that the
individual conducting the experiments on this day was listed in the approved protocol, but her (cid:28)training and
experience(cid:29) section was left blank, (others listed had a description of their training and / or experience). The training
records on file did not show that she had been trained on thoracotomy on rabbits, although the individual and the
facility representative maintain that she was trained on this procedure three years ago, but that it had not been
appropriately documented.
Prior to approving a protocol, the IACUC should ensure that all personnel have, or will receive appropriate training
prior to engaging in covered activities. It is essential that the IACUC be provided with accurate and timely
information so that they can conduct a thorough review of proposed activities prior to approval. Failure to ensure
adequate training could put the welfare of the animals at risk.
To be corrected from this day forward.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
Inspection completed by Veterinary Medical Officers Dr. Pamela L. Smith and Dr. Katharine Frank.
