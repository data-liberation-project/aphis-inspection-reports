ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(2) Veterinary care: The calendar shown to the APHIS official by the licensee had written on the
space for November 1, 2015: (cid:28)treated fallow deer(cid:29). There were no specifics on what was treated, what was used, or
the outcome of the treatment. The fallow deer was pointed out by the licensee during the inspection and the area
identified by the licensee appeared healed. The licensee informed the APHIS official that the female fallow deer
had a superficial wound that was treated by him with Blue Coat. The veterinarian was not consulted. Specific
guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs and treatments used on animals by the licensee.
Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure that the attending veterinarian is aware of the current
practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary
care to the animals. Records must contain sufficient detail to identify the animal, symptom/problem, treatment and
outcome. Correct by having the attending veterinarian approve drugs and treatments used on the animals by the
licensee and by maintaining records for the animals administered drugs/treatments.

Correct from this time forward.(cid:9)

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The shelter for the 13 four horned sheep has broken missing wood boards in
the lower left corner of the outside of the shelter wall leaving jagged wood edges. Sheep rubbing up against the
wall may be injured. The shelter must be repaired to protect the animals from injury and to maintain the structural
integrity of the shelter. This is a repeat non-compliance for this section.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The following areas have an accumulation of mud, water and ice.1) There is a large muddy area with puddles and ice by the water receptacle in the enclosure housing 5 Sika deer.
2) There is a large muddy area with puddles and ice by the water receptacle in the enclosure housing 2 alpaca.
These animals have to walk through mud, water and ice to get to their water. Walking through mud and water may
cause problems such as foot rot. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent
muddy conditions to protect the health of the animals. This is a repeat non-compliance that remains uncorrected.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(d) Perimeter fence
The perimeter fence by the pond is a chain link fence that is six feet in height with angled frame posts for 3 strands
of barb wire above the chain link. This fence is still only about 7 feet in height. The facility must establish and
maintain a program to keep an 8 foot perimeter fence in good repair to restrict animals and unauthorized persons
from gaining access into the facility and to act as a secondary containment system for the animals housed within the
facility. This is a repeat non-compliance that remains uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
