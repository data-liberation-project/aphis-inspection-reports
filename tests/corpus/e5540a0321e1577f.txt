ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00 on
22-NOV-16.
The licensee's wife was home but could not accompany inspection. The licensee was working away from home
and would not return until later that evening. Licensees must ensure a responsible, knowledgeable adult is
available during regular business hours to accompany inspection. Correct from this time forward.
