A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230-1300 on

The ACI made contact with a relative of the licensee at the licensee's residence who informed the ACI that the
licensee was no longer conducting regulated activities. The licensee was unavailable and the ACI left information
for the licensee on how to cancel their license if in fact they are no longer conducting regulated activities.
