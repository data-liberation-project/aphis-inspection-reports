2.40(b)(4) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On August 26, 2021 a 16 year old male javelina, Javier, was anesthetized for a physical exam and radiographs because
of reported stertorious breathing and slight blood-tinged fluid coming from the left nostril. The animal was intubated and
maintained on 1% isoflurane. While preparing for radiographs, the anesthetic reservoir bag ruptured due to the pop-off
valve being closed. The animal sustained a ruptured left lung due to overinflation and was euthanized.

The facility investigated this incident and found that the veterinary technician did not open the pop-off valve on the
anesthetic machine, causing excessive pressure to build in the anesthetic system. The facility must ensure correct
anesthesia practices are implemented and maintained. Not properly setting up the anesthetic machine during anesthesia
can lead to pain, suffering or death of the animal. In order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, the program
of adequate veterinary care must provide appropriate guidance to personnel with regard to handling, immobilization,
anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia of the animals at the facility.

Corrections had been instituted prior to the inspection in order to prevent recurrence.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
