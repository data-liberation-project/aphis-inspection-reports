PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General.
The rabbit enclosure has a dirt floor and there are areas on the ground where the rabbit is digging. One area of
digging is along the primary enclosure fencing and the other along the back wall. Both of these present a risk for
escape, if the rabbit is allowed to continue digging in these areas. The facility must appropriately address the
digging in this enclosure to ensure that the rabbit remains contained and to keep predators out. CORRECT BY 23
OCTOBER 2014.

SANITATION.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
The shelter structure for the rabbit has a buildup of feces and urine throughout the solid floor area. The presence of
this excreta increases risk for disease, pests, odors and soiling of the rabbit. The shelter structure must be removed
of this excreta and facility must maintain a regular cleaning frequency to prevent an accumulation. CORRECT BY
