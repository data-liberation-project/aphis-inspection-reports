2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* Two Saint Bernard dogs have open wounds, with flies, on their noses. Both dogs, an approximately nine year old
female (not identified) named (cid:28)Freckles(cid:29) and an approximately four year old female (not identified) named (cid:28)Beckles(cid:29)
have open wounds on their muzzles, right before the wet hairless surface around the nostrils. The wounds are raw,
moist, pink in color with areas of bright red color. These wounds can be painful and irritating for the dogs. Although
the owner mentioned that they purchased a product to treat the wounds from the feed store, there was no
documentation or communication with a veterinarian about an appropriate medication and treatment plan.
The kennel operator may have to move these dogs into an area that is free from flies until the healing is complete.
The owner must have these two dogs examined by a veterinarian to help get these open wounds healed, set up a
program of treatment for both dogs and administer the appropriate medication. The kennel operator must provide a
treatment record and or record of consultation with the veterinarian upon request during the next inspection. Proper
treatment will minimize the pain and irritation for the dogs.

2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* Although the owner mentioned some of the dogs were microchip, no scanner was made available during the
inspection to scan the chips of the dogs. All dogs must be microchip, tag and or tattooed. A microchip reader must
be provided if the dogs are microchip. Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be
known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements.

2.75(a)(1)RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* The APHIS form 7005 (Dogs on Hand) is incomplete and inaccurate. Block A. does not contain the identification
of the dogs listed. Block I. does not have complete addresses for eight dogs from where they were purchased or
acquired. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known
with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of dogs.

3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two enclosures in the old kennel building, housing four adult dogs, have flaps that are excessively chewed and
torn along the sides of the flaps.
These excessively chewed and torn surfaces cannot be properly cleaning and sanitization. Improper cleaning and
sanitization can increase the disease potential for the dogs housed in these enclosures. All chewed and worn
surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be repaired or replaced. Maintained surfaces that can
be properly cleaned and sanitized will decrease the disease potential for the dogs.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three dog doorways, inside the old kennel building, housing eight adult dogs, have an excessive accumulation of
brown grime on the surfaces around the doorways.
* The whelping enclosure, housing three adult dogs and 21 puppies, has an excessive accumulation of soiled straw
and waste on the floor. The soiled straw is moist in areas and mixed with waste.
* The north end enclosure for the new kennel, housing one adult dog, has an accumulation brown grime on walls of
the enclosure.
These mentioned surfaces indicate that daily spot-cleaning is not happening. Without proper cleaning and
sanitization of the surfaces, this can increase the disease potential for the dogs. All surfaces must be spot-cleaned
daily and sanitized as often as necessary. This will prevent an accumulation of waste and reduce the disease
hazards for the dogs.3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Inside the old kennel counting from the doorway, enclosure three has sharp protruding wire points. These wire
points are along the bottom of the chain link divider. This sharp wire points could injure the two adult dogs housed
in the enclosure.
* The whelping enclosure, housing three adult dogs and 21 puppies, has an nail that is protruding outward into the
enclosure. This nail is at head and eye level for the puppies in the enclosure.
These sharp wire points must be removed. All enclosures must be maintained so that they have no sharp
protruding points or edges that could injure the dogs.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* There were numerous flies around all the enclosures that housed the dogs. Two Saint Bernards had open
wounds with several flies on and around the wounds. There was no fly prevention for the flies. The flies can irritate
the dogs and cause open wounds on the dogs. A fly prevention program is needed to protect health and well-being
of the 25 adult dogs and 28 puppies from the flies.
