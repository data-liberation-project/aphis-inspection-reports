SANITATION.
In the barn that provides shelter for the goats, alpacas, and llama, there is an accumulation of bird droppings along
all three walls and on the ledges of these walls. These ledges are at a height of approximately four feet and within
reach of the alpacas, llama, and taller goats housed in this pen.
A safe and effective program for the control of pests, including birds, needs to be established and maintained.
Failure to do so can have a negative impact on animal health through possible contamination of feed, water, or air
quality of the enclosed area.
Correct by preventing the entrance and roosting of birds into the barn area of the animal enclosure. Correct by
4/22/2019.
