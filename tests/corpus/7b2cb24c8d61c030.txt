FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing for the new primary enclosure housing the Subaliczar and lion Shaumbay does not have enough height
to contain these animals. The height of resting platform to the top of the enclosure is approximately 10' and less
than 10' from the top of the fencing. These large felids are several years old and there is evidence that large felids
can escape enclosures with heights of 12'.
Outdoor housing facilities shall be constructed to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
1) The entrance gate to the facility which is part of the perimeter fence was open during and after the inspection.
This gate must be remained closed after each use. 2) There are several sections of perimeter fencing that is
damaged located to the left side of the entrance that needs to be repaired or replaced. Perimeter fences protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
