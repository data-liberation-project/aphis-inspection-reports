2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were two medications (Pyran, Panacur) that did not have expiraton dates on them. These medications had
been placed in small containers taken from larger containers and the expiration dates had not been transcribed from
the original containers. Medications without labels or with incomplete labels can result in an animal receiving the
incorrect medication, the incorrect dose, or expired medication. The licensee must ensure that all medications are
properly labeled.

2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee is not using an appropriate method to identify unweaned puppies. Appropriate identification of dogs is
necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation.
The licensee must identify puppies that are less than 16 weeks old with an approved method: offical tag, tattoo,
plastic-type collar, microchip, or cage card (provided that all the puppies in the enclosure are from the same litter).

2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee is recording the required information for sales of dogs, but is not using the required disposition form
(APHIS Form 7006) and has not requested a variance to use another form. Proper sales documentation is
necessary for transport purposes and to trace the identification of dogs when needed. The licensee must record
sales that have occurred since becoming licensed onto Form 7006 and must use this form for future dispositions.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
3.4(b) Shelter from the elements.
The outdoor shelter for a male Golden Retriever was too small. The dog was able to get its entire body into the
shelter, but it did not have enough room to make normal postural movements for sitting and lying down. Shelters
must be large enough for the dog to sit, stand, lie down in a normal manner, and to turn about freely for the comfort
of the dog and to protect them from the elements. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have shelters that are
large enough to accomodate the dogs while protecting them from the elements.
