ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the sheltered facility there was an unidentified Yorkshire Terrier puppy, DOB 09/10/15, that was dragging
its back legs as it tried to walk. The left back leg appeared to move partially as the puppy tried to walk. The right
back leg did not move as the puppy scooted around the enclosure. Both legs turned to the lateral side as the puppy
moved forward. The facility representative stated that the puppy had never walked correctly, that the puppy had
been seen by the broker, yet had not been evaluated by a veterinarian. Limited weight bearing or non-weight
bearing limbs are an indication of discomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the risks of further deterioration if
not properly diagnosed and treated or left if left unattended. The licensee must have this puppy evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian for a diagnosis and treatment plan, follow the plan and assure that all of the dogs receive
adequate veterinary care.
To be corrected by November 10, 2015.
This inspection began at 1127.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative and Beverly Hicks, ACI.
