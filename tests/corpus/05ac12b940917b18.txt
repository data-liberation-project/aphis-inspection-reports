2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male hedgehog "Bramborik" was examined by the attending veterinarian on 11 October 2016, as the animal had
developed a growth in its groin that extended down the hind limb. The growth was inoperable, and the animal was
doing well at the time; thus, the licensee was instructed to monitor the animal. Over the next eight months, the
growth enlarged until it encompassed three-quarters of the right hind limb. It appears discolored, bruised, swollen
and significantly protrudes to the point where mobility is questionable. During that time period, no subsequent
veterinary evaluations were sought by the licensee. The licensee stated that the animal had begun to slow down
near the end of May. The animal died on 27 June 2017 without veterinary care or analgesia.
The licensee must ensure that any medical conditions be evaluated and re-evaluated by the attending veterinarian
to ensure that any pain and distress are minimized.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
