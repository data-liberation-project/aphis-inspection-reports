2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection a female chocolate cocker spaniel with ID #83 had a large amount of black greasy material
covering most of the inner surfaces of both ears. The skin of the inner surfaces of the ears appeared red. Both ears
had a musty odor. The dog shook its head multiple times over a 2-3 minute period. The licensee stated he had not
notice the dog's ears but he had taken it to a veterinarian 10 days before for ocular condition. The dog's ears
indicate a disease process is present and a veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to this animal's current
condition. Delays in providing necessary veterinarian treatment can result in worsening conditions and can be a
source of pain and discomfort. It is the responsibility of the licensee to provide veterinarian care in order to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in a timely manner. Please have the dog evaluated by a
veterinarian in order to address all health issues including any possible ear infections. If the attending veterinarian is
unavailable, than it is the licensee's responsibility to contact another veterinarian. It is vital that all animals be
properly assessed and treated when injured or sick.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure in the whelping building housed a West Highland White Terrier with 4 puppies on a coated wire floor
with openings big enough (2 inches by 1 inch) that easily allowed the puppies to pass their feet and legs through the
floor. During the inspection puppies were observed getting their feet and legs caught in the flooring multiple times.
These openings easily allow puppies to get stuck and injured. Any flooring in the primary enclosure cannot allow a
dog's foot to pass through it. The licensee must provide flooring to all dogs, including puppies, that prevent feet
passing through the flooring.

3.11(b)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the whelping building there is a brown film covering the white back walls of all the primary enclosures. The tops of
all the wire enclosures in the whelping building have a layer of dust and dirt along with imbedded hair. Four of the
Lixit automatic watering dispensers in the whelping building have a significant amount of calcium build-up. The
brown film, dirt, dust, and calcium residue can function as a suitable environment for bacteria to grow and can serve
as an opportunity of infection for the dogs in the enclosure. It is especially important that whelping enclosures be
clean since puppies have a weaker immune system and can easily develop illnesses. Proper cleaning removes all
sources that promote bacteria growth. The primary enclosure must be free from all dirt and debris in order to
promote a sanitary environment that removes all hazards to animal health.
