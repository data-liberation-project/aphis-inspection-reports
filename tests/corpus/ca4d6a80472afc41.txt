ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female King Charles Spaniel, USDA tag 177, was identified as having a lesion between the toes of the rear
left foot. The lesion was approximately 1cm x 1 cm and bright pink and red hairless tissue was exposed. The
exposed tissue appeared to be reddened and inflamed. The animal appeared to be walking normally on this foot.
The issue noted may cause unnecessary pain and distress to the animal. The program of veterinary care provides
instructions as to the proper care of the animals and must be followed to ensure that adequate care is given to the
animals in a timely manner. Daily observations of this animal are also needed to monitor the progression of any
treatments given by the attending veterinarian. The licensee shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
Correct by March 2, 2016. This can be achieved by following the instructions within program of veterinary care
provided by the attending veterinarian.
The Inspection and exit interview was conducted with licensee's wife and Michael Neafsey, VMO.
