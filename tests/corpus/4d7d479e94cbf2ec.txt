3.103(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility has replaced/repaired the perimeter fence with the exception of the south side near the shoreline. The
licensee is in the process of obtaining bids to complete the repairs but has not made any decisions to date. This
portion of the fence line still does not extend all the way to the shoreline. Unauthorized persons and animals can
easily gain access into the facility from the adjacent property.
For natural seawater facilities, the perimeter fence must prevent access by animals and unauthorized persons to the
facility from the abutting land, and must encompass the land portion of the facility from one end of the shoreline as
defined by low tide to the other end of the shoreline as defined by low tide.
