*** In a litter of five bulldog puppies, one puppy is very small and is not thriving. The licensee was tube feeding the
puppy for an extended period of time during the day but stopped several days ago. The puppy appears to be
declining and its condition should be communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner.
