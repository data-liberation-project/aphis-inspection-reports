ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shih Tzu (073-609-108) was continually licking, and the fur around its mouth was wet. Most of the teeth
had a heavy build-up of yellowish-brown material on their surface. This abnormal build-up of material extended into
the gum line. The gums appeared reddened, swollen and had receded along some of these teeth. The abnormal
build-up of material on the dogs teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. The dogs dental
condition could be painful, may decrease the dogs ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health.
This dog also had a pea sized gray spot in the center of the pupil on the left eye. The skin immediately surrounding
this eye was missing fur. There was a whitish material that was wiped from the dogs eye prior to closer inspection.
The dog did seem to have above normal tear production, and had a brown material in the fur around the eye. Eye
discharge, discoloration, and excessive tearing can be caused by an infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other
medical conditions that could be painful.
On the scruff of this dog there was a golf ball size area with a blackish material caked in the fur. The skin under this
was red and oozing a blood like fluid. This skin lesion could be the result of injury, infection or other veterinary
medical condition which could be painful.
Female Yorkshire Terrier (084-102-559) was not bearing weight on its left hind leg. There was a lesion on the pad
between the middle toes. The pad lesion on the rear foot was, oozing a clear liquid, reddened, and slightly swollen.
The lesion on the pad could be the result of injury, infection or a variety of veterinary medical conditions which may
cause discomfort.
Male Bengal (041-597-005) was excessively scratching its left ear. The back side of the ear was missing fur and
had some scabs. When the ear was massaged, the cat would continually try to scratch with its hind leg, and would
shake it's head after someone touching its ear. This cats condition could be an indication of parasites, infection
and/or a variety of other veterinary medical conditions.
The licensee must have these animals seen by a licensed veterinarian regarding these animal's conditions in order
to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The licensee had several unlabeled medicine containers. All of these medications were stored with othermedications
that were currently being used and therefore ready to use. The use of medications that are not properly labeled may
harm the animals. Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the
contents of the container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications
are not used past their expiration dates. As part of the program of adequate veterinary care, the licensee must
ensure that all medications are labeled with the contents (name and concentration of drug), dosing instructions
(specific for the species of animal being treated), and expiration date.

3.9(b) DIRECT
FEEDING.
***Within sheltered building #2, at least two self feeders contained food which was contaminated. The contaminated
food in each of these self feeders was located at the opening where the dogs access the food. In one of the
feeders, some of the food appeared like a dark brown soupy mush. The food in this feeder was wet with mushy food
covering most of the bottom, and most of the rest of the food had a grayish-white, mold-like material. At least one
other self feeder in another enclosure contained food that appeared mostly dry, but caked in some areas, with some
covered with a grayish-white, mold-like material. It appeared that the 5 dogs in these enclosures did have another
self feeder available with palatable food. Contaminated food can decrease the dog's acceptance of the food and
can increase the risk of disease and health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the current wet, caked and
moldy feed to protect the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee needs to establish and maintain a
program to ensure that food is protected from contamination and that measures are taken to ensure that there is no
molding, deterioration and caking of feed at all times.
To be corrected by: Corrected during inspection.
Throughout the facility approximately 15 self feeders had an accumulation of a brown or black dirt and grime inside
them. This dirt and grime comes in contact with the dogs food, which can contaminate the food and harm the dogs.
The licensee must ensure self feeders are cleaned and sanitized at least every two weeks or more often if
necessary.
