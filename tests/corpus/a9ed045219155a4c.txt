FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A gate in the enclosure housing three large pigs has been damaged so that sharp points of wire ends project into
the enclosure. The gate appears to be too light of construction for the large pigs in the enclosure.
These sharp ends pose a risk of injury to the animals in the enclosure. Pigs are hard on facilities, and require
frequent inspection to ensure hazards are addressed quickly.
Correct by May 31, 2014. The facility representative said that the gate will be replaced within a week or two.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
