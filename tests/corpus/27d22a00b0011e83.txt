3.87(a)(3)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
On Saturday, December 3, 2022, while taking inventory at the Madison, FL Auction three home-built cages with tag
numbers 1937, 1938, and 1939 had one common marmoset each. All cages had spaces of 0.5 inch, where the non-
human primates could stick their hands and arms through. Getting their hands and arms through could lead to injury to
the non-human primate, injury to the public, or to animals close by as different species were placed in the same area.
Primary enclosures used for transporting non-human primates must be constructed so that the non-human primate is at
all times securely contained within the enclosure and cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure in a way that
could result in injury to the animal, or to persons or animals nearby.

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
On Saturday, December 3, 2022, while taking inventory at the Madison, FL Auction three home-built cages with tag
numbers 1937, 1938, and 1939 had one common marmoset each. All cages had puppy pads that had been moved
around and bundled in corners by the non-human primates. The collection of urine and excreta on the puppy pad can
lead to disease and no dry place for them to stand and lay on while on transport. The primary enclosure must have a

solid, leak-proof bottom, or a removable, leak-proof collection tray under a slatted or wire mesh floor that prevents
seepage of waste products, such as excreta and body fluids, outside of the enclosure. If a slatted or wire mesh floor is
used in the enclosure, it must be designed and constructed so that the animal cannot put any part of its body between the
slats or through the holes in the mesh. It must contain enough previously unused litter to absorb and cover excreta. The
litter must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic to the nonhuman primate and is appropriate for the
species transported in the primary enclosure.
