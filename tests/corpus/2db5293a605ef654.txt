2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The Program of Veterinary Care, Acquisition & Disposition records, and the inventory were not available for review
at the time of inspection. Lack of required records does not allow APHIS officials to accurately track animals as
necessary. It also does not allow personnel access to the Program of Veterinary Care in event of an emergency.
Ensure all records are available for review by APHIS Officials during business hours. Correct by 7/15/16.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During exhibition only one attendant was readily identifiable by a logo sweatshirt. It was difficult to determine the
other two attendants from members of the public. Without attendants that are readily identifiable it cannot be
determined which persons are ensuring the safety of the animals and the public during public contact. Ensure all
attendants are readily identifiable during times of public contact. Correct from this time forward.
3.137(e)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
"Live animal" and up arrow markings were missing from the carriers used to transport the African Porcupine, Black
Buck, and the Patagonian Cavies. Markings help identify the carriers as having a live animal inside and how to
properly handle the carrier. Lack of "live animal" and up arrow stickers on the carriers does not ensure that persons
are handling the carriers with the animals properly to ensure their comfort and wellbeing. Ensure all carriers used to
transport animals are marked with "live animal" and up arrows as required. Correct immediately.
