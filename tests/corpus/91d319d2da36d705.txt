ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The self-reported incident from August 26, 2015 associated with protocol # 13041668 indicated that 23 adult rabbits
had tissue samples collected via ear snip. The protocol indicates that these tissue samples should only be collected
from 10 day or 25 day old rabbits. The principal investigator followed the protocol for the use of analgesia, however
this approved analgesia was meant for the 10 day or 25 day old rabbit and not the adult. According to the document
reporting this incident as well as in discussions with members of the IACUC, the attending veterinarian at the time of
the incident determined that the analgesia used at the time of the procedure was not adequate to alleviate the
associated pain, and that adequate follow-up analgesic treatments were not provided.
After a full investigation of this incident by the IACUC, corrective actions were taken by the principal investigator to
ensure that this incident would not occur again. A letter of reprimand was sent from the IACUC to the principal
investigator and their supervisor regarding this incident. This investigator and their staff completed of retraining on
protocol adherence. The protocol has been further reviewed by the IACUC and amended to include non-invasive
sample collection methods for the adult rabbits.
The self-reported incident from October 13, 2015 associated with protocol # 1414544 indicated that an adult rabbit
(R463-15) had died following being anesthetized for protocol approved imaging. This animal was returned to its
cage while still in lateral recumbancy. On October 14, 2015 the animal was found deceased. The necropsy by the
veterinarian noted lung consolidation with respiratory distress and subsequent arrest as the likely cause of death.
The universities surgical policy at the time of this event stated that animals must be observed and monitored post
operatively until they are awake and show evidence of spontaneous and voluntary movement within their cage,
before returning to their respective animal holding rooms. This policy was not followed by the investigator at the time
the animal being returned to the caging area.
After a full investigation of this incident by the IACUC, corrective actions were taken by the principal investigator to
ensure that this incident would not occur again. A letter of reprimand was sent from the IACUC to the principal
investigator and their supervisor regarding this incident .The principal investigator and their staff were retrained on
the universities surgical policy and were counselled on their responsibilities in caring for these animals. The surgeon
for this protocol completed an in-person training related to the care of animals in this protocol. The protocol hasbeen further reviewed by the IACUC and amended to include reversal agents to ensure that animals are able to
regain consciousness as expected at the completion of a procedure.
As a result of the principal investigators departing from established SOPs for care, adequate pre-and
post-procedural care was not provided in accordance with established veterinary procedures. All personnel at the
university, including principal investigators that have direct care for animals, are responsible for ensuring that these
standards are maintained.
Correct from this point forward.
