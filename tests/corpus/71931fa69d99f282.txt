SANITATION.
There were two approximately 2-3 x 4 inch mounds of dried fecal material in a wire-bottom primary enclosure
shared by two rabbits. One of the mounds was located in front of the feeder and the rabbits would only be able to
access the food through the mound. Primary enclosures shall be kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, and cobwebs
by periodic cleaning to prevent disease and infestation of rabbits. To be corrected by 3/24/2014.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two baby goats were observed browsing on the property outside the large goat enclosure. The goats were small
enough to have slipped through the openings in the wire fence. Ability of the young goats to escape from the
enclosure can increase risk of predation, loss, or injury of the goats. Outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained
in good repair to protect animals from injury and contain the animals. To be corrected by 3/24/2014.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
