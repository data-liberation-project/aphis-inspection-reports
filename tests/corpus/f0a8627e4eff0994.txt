Veterinary care for dogs.
The dogs were all examined for their annual physical exam in October 2021 and several dogs are listed as having
moderate to severe tarter with missing teeth. No preventative care or treatment plan to address the dental disease has
been implemented. The licensee needs to contact the vet for further guidance in how to proceed with preventative care
and treatment for these animals to ensure their dental issues are addressed.

Four dogs were identified to have heavily matted fur, around the feet, underneath the neck and along the belly or back
area. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing skin irritations and is no longer an effective insulator against
the elements. Additionally, these dogs have long nails that need to be trimmed. These dogs are: Bichon id #027 (Bun),
Bichon #022 (Biscuit), Poodle # 014, and Bichon #007 (Frank). These animals all need to be groomed to ensure they
have healthy un-matted hair coats for their health and comfort.

Part of preventative care for this section is to not only identify concerns of animal health but develop a plan that treats
identified issues with hair coats, nails, and teeth.
