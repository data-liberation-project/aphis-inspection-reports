ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A 2.5 year old male cynomolgus macaque was found dead in his enclosure where he was housed with 5 other male
cynomolgus macaques of the same age. Daily observations are recorded per enclosure and not per animal unless
there is a health concern. Prior to his death the facility stated this animal did not appear unhealthy and was active
with a healthy hair coat. After the animal’s death the facility raised potential compatibility issues between this same
group of macaques.
According to the necropsy report, the animal was found to have marked dehydration, little to no visceral fat, and an
overall thin body condition. Observations for compatibility within primate groups is necessary to prevent situations
where individual animals are not allowed access to food, water, or shelter by other animals.
Observations regarding problems of animal health, behavior and well-being may be accomplished by someone
other than the attending veterinarian but all such issues must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner to ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care.

MISCELLANEOUS.
A 2.5 year old male cynomolgus macaque died unexpectedly during a face-mask inhalation to test the effects of a
substance. During this procedure one animal technician was monitoring the 5 cynomolgus macaques. It was stated
that this was beyond the usual number of animals monitored per technician. It was stated that during the procedure,
the arm restraints on the chairs where the animals were held were too large for some of these animals. This allowed
the animals to maneuver their arms to bypass the arm restraints and move around in the chair and get entangled in
the equipment. In addition, according to the technician, the monitoring equipment was producing many false error
alarms making it difficult to monitor the animal’s condition. Near the end of the procedure, the technician found thisanimal to be non-responsive. The incident was immediately reported to a veterinary technician who examined the
animal but was unable to resuscitate it and the animal died.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
