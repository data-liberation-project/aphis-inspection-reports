her right front foot. This area was sensitive to touch.

addition, she had excessively long nails. This dog would not allow further examination.
Having foot issues can affect the gait of the dog and cause pain and discomfort if it is not treated within a
reasonable amount of time.

must be seen by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of examination, diagnosis and treatment must be
maintained by Licensee and made available for viewing by APHIS officials.
