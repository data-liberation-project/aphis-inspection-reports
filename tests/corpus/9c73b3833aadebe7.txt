This condition puts this animal at risk to have an infection and the tissue is at risk of been injured and/or suffering
necrosis, in addition to the fact that this condition is uncomfortable and painful for the animal.
Because of the difficulty maintaining this tissue clean and moist all day in this kennel environment and thenecessary manpower that needs to be employed to do this, another type of treatment may need to be taken to
prevent the unnecessary extension of the condition and the risk of infection and necrosis in this case.
Despite the fact that this animal was seen by the veterinarian approx. 48 hours ago, the veterinarian may not be
familiar with the condition of the vaginal tissue due to the neglect of treatment. The tissue of the vagina looks dry,
with some evidence of scabbing.
Failure to provide adequate follow up to ensure a successful resolution of the condition may lead to a prolonged
time of suffering for this animal.
This dog needs to be seen by the attending veterinarian. Documentation of the diagnosis, recommended treatment
and treatment of the dog must be maintained.
