HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Refrigerator 3 in the food preparation area of the zoo was found to have rusted metal shelves and sections of the
coating on the shelves was flaking off. Open prepared food bowls were noted below the flaking shelves and
produce was sitting directly on the rusty shelves. Multiple cutting boards were also found to show signs of excessive
use such as deep cut marks and discoloration. The food must be stored in a manner to prevent contamination and
deterioration of its nutritional value. Instruments used to prepare the food must in such condition that they can be
cleaned and sanitized appropriately. Contaminated food due to an insanitary food preparation and holding area can
cause disease in non human primates as well as all the other species that share food space in the refrigerator.
Refrigerator 3 and the cutting boards must be brought back into a sanitary condition or removed from the area.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two spotted necked otters were observed in their indoor holding where they have been held since December 13th,
2016 while their outdoor enclosure is being renovated. The holding are is a set of three enclosures connected with
shift doors. There was a large black tub of water in the far right enclosure and no other furniture items, platforms,
nest box or soft areas for the otters to engage in. Both otters stayed in the front shift tunnel while the inspectors
were in the area and did not vocalize, move or engage in their surroundings. Normal behavior for this speciesinclude play behaviors, extensive grooming and scent marking, and show general curiosity about their environment
and the people entering it. The lack of any normal behavior exhibited by these otter could indicate stress or poor
conditions. This holding area needs to be modified with furnishings and a nest box that would promote normal
behavior patterns. In addition the main exhibit's renovation needs to be completed as this is part of the animals
enclosure that can provide sufficient space with adequate freedom of movement of active swimming behaviors.

WATERING.
Two spotted necked otters in an indoor enclosure were not being provided a water source beyond the water trough
they swam in. At the time of the inspection, the water was dirty with fecal material and fish parts. An additional
potable water source should be accessible to the animals at all times to ensure the health and comfort of the
animals. The facility must provide the otters potable water in a clean and sanitary way daily in addition to the tub
meant for swimming behaviors.
