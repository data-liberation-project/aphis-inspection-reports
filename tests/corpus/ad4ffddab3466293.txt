ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1208 on
26-SEP-17. We went to the licensee's property. No one appeared to be around. I contacted the licensee by
phone. The licensee informed me he would be unavailable for inspection. I told him we would try again some other
time.
End of report.
