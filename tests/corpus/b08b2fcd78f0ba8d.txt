FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Two outdoor off-exhibit holding enclosures, utilized by both seals and sea lions, do not provide shaded areas
(either natural or artificial) to protect the animals from direct sunlight.
***In the outdoor exhibit pool where the sea lion shows occur, the shade from the sun is not being used
appropriately for the animals’ activities. A shade structure is present that covers approximately one-third of the pool.
This shade, however, was not effectively used to protect the sea lions’ eyes during the show. Exhibition and training
methods observed by USDA personnel during the morning sea lion show encouraged direct solar exposure to the
animals’ eyes. During the show, the sun was oriented over the trainer’s right shoulder. The animals were repeatedly
asked to perform behaviors for which they were rewarded by having food tossed to them to catch. This was not
consistently done under the shade structure and the animals were required to lift their heads up and look directly
into the sun in order to see and catch the food.
The sea lions and seals have a history of chronic, intermittent eye problems. Direct sunlight can be uncomfortable
for the animals. In addition, excessive exposure to UV light (sunlight) has been linked to the development of eye
abnormalities in captive marine mammals. Lack of adequate shade may be contributing to the eye conditions in
these animals.
Additional steps should be taken to provide shade for marine mammals when they are being asked to interact with
the trainers, while holding their heads out of the water, and looking up into the sun. The facility should re-review
shade for all marine mammal enclosures and ensure that adequate shelter is provided to afford the animals
protection from direct sunlight.

WATER QUALITY.***Three seals and three sea lions were observed by APHIS personnel to have eye lesions or were identified as
having chronic eye issues in their medical records. Medical records dating as far back as 2015 to present indicated
that veterinary treatment has been provided for numerous eye conditions, including squinting (which could be
indicative of pain), corneal edema, inflammation, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, chronic corneal fibrosis, chronic
keratitis, aqueous flare, and corneal opacities.
APHIS personnel reviewed water quality records from the seal and sea lion pools from December 2016 to March
2017. The institution’s guidelines indicate that bromine ranges for pinnipeds should stay between the range of
0.7-1.0 (unit of measurement not identified in institutional documents). On 1/7/17, 1/16/17, 1/31/17, 2/9/17, 3/3/17,
and 3/24/17, spikes in bromine levels were noted in the primary seal lion pool, with levels as high as 1.84. These
bromine spikes are outside of the institution’s own guidelines and is likely contributing not only to eye discomfort but
may possibly cause harm to the animals’ eyes. The protocol indicates that when bromine levels are below the
acceptable range, the action required is to “adjust bromine feeder.” Once the bromine feeder has been adjusted,
there is no documentation of follow up testing performed that same day to determine that bromine levels had
stabilized.
The protocol indicates that when bromine levels are above the institution’s acceptable range, the instructions are to
“add 25 oz sodium thiosulfate directly to the pool then retest.” No documentation was provided showing that sodium
thiosulfate was added to the pool when bromine levels were elevated. Additionally, the documentation provided
does not show that follow up water testing was performed that same day to determine that bromine levels had
stabilized.
The institution’s acceptable range for bromine in the polar bear pools is between 1-1.5 (unit of measurement not
identified in institutional documents). The polar bear primary pool exceeded 1.5 on 1/15/17, 1/16/17, 1/17/17,
2/16/17, 2/17/17, 2/18/17, 2/19/17, 3/20/17. The polar bear secondary pool exceeded 1.5 on 12/29/16, thirteen
times in January 2017, and twice in March (on 3/13/17 and 3/20/17). Some of the bromine levels were as high as
3.46. Additionally, bromine levels were not checked on January 2, as it was noted in the records that “no Br packets
left, Br not tested.” On January 3, bromine levels had exceeded acceptable limits.
Bromine spikes and brominated disinfection byproducts may lead to the development and exacerbation of eye
problems in marine animals. The sea lions and seals have a history of chronic, intermittent eye conditions that could
in part be caused by the high levels of bromine and bromine byproducts found in their water. The institutions
guidelines are not detailed enough for employees to adequately respond to fluctuating bromine levels.
The facility should, as a part of its program for water quality, consult with water quality specialists, revise their SOP’s
to include more detail and retrain staff on water quality procedures. Bromine levels need to be monitored closely
and re-testing of the water needs to occur more frequently once high bromine levels are noted.
The facility must ensure that when water is chemically treated, the chemicals shall be added so as not to causeharm or discomfort to the marine animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There was a nail head sticking out of a door in the bongo’s stall in hoofstock barn 2, approximately two feet up
from the ground.
***In hoofstock barn 2, the entire bottom of the metal divider in the bongo’s stall was rusted out, creating sharp
metal edges.
***In hoofstock barn 2, there is a wooden chute in the bongo stall. The edge of the outermost wall of the wooden
chute is worn, jagged, and in disrepair.
Although some of these issues were identified by the facility as needing repair, it has been approximately six
months since they were placed on a work order list, with no specific plan or timeline for addressing the issues.
Sharp edges and nail heads have the potential to come into contact with the animals and lead to injury.
The facility must ensure that the indoor and outdoor housing facilities be maintained in good repair and free of sharp
points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of timely
identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
***Two brown bears, a 15 year old female named “Tundra” and a 16 year old male named “Kootenai,” are housed
together in an enclosure that is made up of a concrete outdoor exhibit that contains a pool of water with two trees
lying horizontally across it and concrete indoor holding area. The only soft substrate in the enclosure is a sand pit
that allows one bear at a time to be in it. Since this is the only soft area in the exhibit, it is a highly desirable area
and can add to potential stress and frustration for the bear who cannot access the sand.
APHIS personnel observed the male brown bear engaging in an abnormal behavior pattern of pacing. APHISpersonnel observed this abnormal behavior for approximately ten minutes in the morning, during which time the
behavior did not stop, and then returned during the afternoon of the following day and observed the abnormal
pacing behavior again. The male would pace for several minutes, scratch his back, and then continue to pace; this
appeared to be a repetitive, rigid pattern. According to the curator of behavioral husbandry, she is aware of the male
bear’s abnormal behavior pattern and stated that the female also exhibits an abnormal behavior of head swinging.
This enclosure limits the bears’ ability to perform species specific behaviors because it lacks adequate functional
and structural elements, including adequate space, adequate opportunities to exhibit climbing behavior, and
appropriate quantity of natural substrates. Pacing and head swinging in brown bears are abnormal behavior
patterns and can indicate stress, frustration or an underlying medical condition. Inadequate enclosures can also
contribute to these abnormal behavior patterns.
Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make
normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Inadequate space may be indicated
by evidence of malnutrition, poor condition, debility, stress, or abnormal behavior patterns.
A plan and timeline to address this must be provided by May 27, 2017

SANITATION.
***In the hoofstock building, barn 2, there was an accumulation of bird droppings throughout the central walkway
and within individual stalls. Several nests were visible throughout the barn. Bird droppings were present on metal
piping, wooden beams, tops of the walls, and on the floor. In the main walkway, there was an accumulation of bird
droppings on a pipe above a food preparation table.
The established pest control program does not appear to be effective in controlling the bird populations in this barn.
Additional measures to eliminate and attraction and harborage of pests must be implemented to ensure an effective
means of controlling the bird population. A safe and more effective program for the control of birds shall be
established and maintained by the facility.
