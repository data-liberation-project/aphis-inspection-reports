FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On Sunday September 6, 2015 at 9:35am a guest reported seeing a cheetah escape the outdoor exhibit area by
climbing over the 9'(cid:25) 4"(cid:29) wall of the enclosure. This was a 4 year old, recently acquired, male cheetah. The incident
command system was activated and the cheetah was located in a landscaped area next to the wall, sedated, and
contained. No animals or people sustained any injuries. The cheetahs remain in indoor housing until the outdoor
exhibit is modified to prevent recurrence. Animal escape may lead to injuries, even death. The facility must be
constructed as appropriate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

This was a focused inspection regarding the cheetah escape only.
