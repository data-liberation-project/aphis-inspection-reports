3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The 15 guinea pig enclosures are not being cleaned often enough to remove accumulations of excreta, soiled
bedding and debris. There are accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding and debris under the hay on the floor of the
enclosures. The 15 enclosures had soiled bedding and material consolidated in a moist pad under the hay
especially by the water receptacles. The enclosures were last cleaned over a week ago. Ineffective cleaning and
sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures
must be cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, and debris and must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized
often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, and debris. Additionally, ensure that all primary
enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by July 1, 2016
