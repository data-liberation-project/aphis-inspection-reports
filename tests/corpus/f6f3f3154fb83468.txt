2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
According to the written program of veterinary care, the attending veterinarian indicated the vaccinations for parvovirus,
leptospirosis, hepatitis, Bordetella and yearly fecal testing for intestinal parasites but the owner declined the veterinarian’s
recommendations to conduct these necessary items. This declination dismisses the attending veterinarian’s authority to
appropriately provide adequate veterinary care for the wolf hybrids and coydogs. The exhibitor shall assure that the
attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The rotted and deteriorated interior wooden support post, just inside of the shelter door opening, still remains unrepaired.
This post could still injure the wolf-hybrids upon entering and exiting the shelter building. The rotted woodent post should
be repaired to keep the building in good repair and to prevent injury.
3.10(a) Direct

Watering

3.10 - Watering. (a) Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs, unless restricted by the attending
veterinarian or excepted as provided in section 3.17(a).

Upon arrival, the temperature was 32 degrees F. The metal water buckets and rubber tubs, provided for all the wolf
hybrids and both coydogs, had frozen water in them. Most were completely solidified thus not drinkable. One wolf hybrid
was observed licking the ice in its water bucket. During the inspection, staff removed the ice from the buckets and tubs
and provided potable water for the animals to drink. Drinkable water must be continuously available for the health and
well-being of the wolf hybrids and coydogs.

CORRECTED AT TIME OF INSPECTION
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
3.13 (a)(3) - Vaccinations for contagious and/or deadly diseases of dogs (including rabies, parvovirus and distemper) and
sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm) in
accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian, unless otherwise required by a research protocol
approved by the Committee at research facilities;

According to the written Program of Veterinary Care, the attending veterinarian for the wolf hybrids and coydogs are to
receive vaccinations for parvovirus but the owner declined to have this vaccine provided. Additional vaccines for
leptospirosis, hepatitis and Bordetella were suggested but were also declined by the owner. The attending veterinarian
also recommended annual fecal sampling to test for intestinal parasites but this was also declined. The facility is not
following the veterinary care plan that the attending veterinarian feels is appropriate for the wolf hybrid and coydogs. Lack

of the required vaccines will potentially affect the health of the wolf hybrids and coydogs.
