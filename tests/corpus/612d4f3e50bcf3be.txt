2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During the inspection, one female German shepherd "Sophie" was observed favoring the left hind limb, reluctant to put
weight on it when standing and a slight limp while walking. The skin between her foot pad and toes in this area was red on
initial inspection, but returned to white after several minutes spent inside on a dry floor - the redness may have been due
to cold, wet conditions when she was outside. However, there remained a swelling in the main paw pad and a whitish
thickened line of tissue where the pad meets the skin, as well as a yellowish scab-like material at the point of the pad.
This condition is painful and causes difficulty maneuvering in her enclosure. The written program of veterinary care does
not address this specific condition, and the licensee had not noticed it prior to the inspection. He provided a treatment
prescribed for minor abrasions during the inspection.

Correct this by ensuring appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries such
as this. Appropriate methods can be determined by consulting a veterinarian to examine, diagnose, and treat this
condition.
