CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
***Three adult guinea pigs were housed in the same primary enclosure as several birds, including parrots. All of the
guinea pigs were observed within their shelter structures. Housing guinea pigs in the same enclosure as birds can
increase the risk of stress and disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are not housed in the
same primary enclosure with any other species of animals at all times. To be corrected by: August 5, 2017.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***A rabbit was no longer in its outdoor enclosure but was found in a nearby enclosure housing three young pigs.
The pigs were laying down at the opposite end of their enclosure from where the rabbit was located. According to
the licensee, the door of the rabbit's enclosure had inadvertently been left open and the rabbit was able to get out.
The licensee returned the rabbit to its original enclosure.
***An adult dog was observed in an enclosure housing a rabbit. The dog had not been present in the enclosure
when the area was first inspected. The rabbit had a large shelter structure with a small access opening to get away
from the dog. The rabbit's enclosure had cattle panels for walls along with chicken wire that reached up the majority
of the height of the panels. The top of the enclosure was covered with wire panels. There was an approximately 3
inch horizontal gap between the access door and a vertical support pole, which was large enough for a dog to fit
through, near the top of the enclosure. The licensee removed the dog from the enclosure during the inspection.
Enclosures which do not adequately contain the animals or restrict other animals from entering increase the risk of
injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that enclosures for rabbits are structurally sound and are kept in
good repair to protect the animals from injury, are maintained to contain the animals, and restrict the entrance of
other animals at all times. To be corrected by: August 5, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee on July 31, 2017.
