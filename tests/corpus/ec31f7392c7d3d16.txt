INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There have been several employee changes recently and the membership of the IACUC has also changed. There
is no formal appointment of the members of the IACUC committee by the Chief Executive Officer of the research
facility. The attending veterinarian is also acting as chair of the committee which is not recommended to prevent
conflicts of interest. The current new Institutional Official needs to formally appoint the members of the IACUC.

SANITATION.
The breeding guinea pigs are housed in large plastic bins, 4 bins to a rack in one large room. Pine bedding is used
and is piled 6 inches deep when cage changes are done at least once a week. Approximately 8 adults and various
numbers of weanling aged and new babies are in each bin.
During this inspection, at least a third (34 of 112) of the bins are excessively dirty with feces and urine soaked
bedding. These bins do not have any dry bedding in them at the top. Although the animals do not appear soiled, in
several bins they were standing on a layer of packed feces in places. No health issues were observed even
though several of the bins have an ammonia smell.
The guinea pig bins need to be cleaned more frequently so that the guinea pigs will be kept clean and dry, and so
as to minimize offensive odors (as stated in the company SOP for guinea pig housing).
