3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
1. The fabric hammocks in several of the marmoset enclosures were noted to be excessively worn with some
frayed edges and hole(s) 1/2" x 1/2 " to 1 1/2" x 1" in size. The condition of these hammocks pose a hazard to the
animals from ingestion of the frayed fabric fibers or from the possible entrapment of a limb.
Per this Section of the Regulations, surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures and objects, must be replaced when worn. This is important for the safety and health of the animals.
The research facility corrected this item by the end of the inspection by removing the excessively worn hammocks
from the primary enclosures and replacing them with other hammocks.
