2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
When reviewing facility records, it was observed that records of animal sales and animal deaths are being
maintained but there is no documentation of animal births or number of animals on hand.
Dealers need to make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals held,
owned, and acquired (including births) in addition to number of animals sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to identify animal losses through escape or if there is disease
in the facility that affects number of offspring born. Correct by establishing and maintaining an inventory that
includes animals born as well as animals sold, died, or euthanized. Correct by July 31, 2019.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the weanling pens, several guinea pig weanlings were observed to easily jump over the panels between the
pens. No animals were observed loose in the barn, animals were only seen jumping from one pen to another.
However, at the time of inspection, there was a back door open from the barn to the outside to facilitate cleaning of
the barn, making escape to the outside possible for these animals.
Housing facilities for guinea pigs need to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. Failure to do so
can lead to injury or death from falls to the ground, escape from the barn, or becoming trapped outside of the pen.
Correct by increasing the height of the sides of the pens so that the animals within cannot climb or jump out.
