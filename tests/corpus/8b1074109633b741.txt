2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male schih tzu (tag 011) has an eye (right side) that is white on the outside and is not clear like a normally
healthy eye. This is reported to have been like this for about a year and owner reports that the attending
veterinarian has not seen it. Some abnormalities in eyes can be painful and must be reported to the attending
veterinarian so that it can be evaluated and determined what treatment is needed. Promptly and routinely
communicate any health condition or injuries observed in animals to the attending veterinarian to ensure that
optimum veterinary care is provided.
***Various medications in the storage cabinet reportedly used for dogs are labeled for other species other than
dogs. There are no written instructions from the attending veterinarian on these medications for dosage (how
much), route (oral, injection type, etc), frequency (how often), and what the medication is for. Use of medications
for other species other than what the label describes (off-label or extra-label use) must have written instructions
from the attending veterinarian. This is to avoid giving a dog too much or too little of a medication and to ensure
that a medication is safe for dogs. Obtain written instructions from the attending veterinarian on any medication that
does not have a manufacturer's label with instructions for dogs.
