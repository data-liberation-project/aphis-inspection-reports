3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility is currently using six metal barrels and one plastic tank-type structure as a means of shelter for seven bears.
While each of the shelters is bedded with a large amount of hay/straw, three of the metal shelters do not allow the facility
access for changing of the bedding while the bears are in the primary enclosure due to how they are affixed to the
enclosure. The plastic shelter is completely contained within the primary enclosure. Additionally, the facility has wrapped
the six metal shelters with blankets/quilts secured with bailing twine. These blankets are not waterproof and given the
local climatic conditions will become wet reducing their insulating ability. The inability of the facility to maintain appropriate
bedding and improper insulation of shelters may lead to hypothermia and undo suffering of these animals. Natural or
artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept
outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
