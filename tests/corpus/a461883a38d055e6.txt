2.32(b) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
On 7/23/19, a female macaque injured her finger when she placed it a small hole which was part of the squeeze
mechanism in her primary enclosure. The facility was aware of this risk as this animal had done this previously
without injury. Corrective action was taken after the first incident and two enclosures were modified for use with this
animal and her cage mate . On a cage change out day, an employee placed these animals in an unmodified
enclosure as there was no modified enclosure available for use. The macaque again stuck her finger into the
squeeze mechanism hole and at this time her finger was injured. She received immediate veterinary care and finger
amputation was necessary. The IACUC and the USDA were promptly notified of this event. The IACUC formed a
subcommittee to investigate this incident . Correction action was taken and sixteen additional enclosures were
modified to use in this area. Only modified enclosures are now available during change outs. Increased instruction
for the employees working in this area has been instituted by adding additional secure signage regarding need for
special enclosures on the doors to the animal room and tagging the modified enclosures so employees are certain
which enclosures are to be used .

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On 10/24/19 , one marmoset gained access to the top enclosure through the enclosure tray. The marmoset caused
severe trauma to another marmoset. The injured animal received immediate veterinary care however euthanasia
was necessary The IACUC was notified and the incident was investigated. The facility was unable to determine how
the animal moved the tray allowing access to the upper enclosure. Additional clips to secure enclosure trays have
now been added to enclosures to prevent a reoccurrence. Primary enclosures must contain the nonhuman primates
and prevent accidental opening by the animal.
