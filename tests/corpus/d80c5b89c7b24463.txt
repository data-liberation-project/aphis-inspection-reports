ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:35 a.m. on
06-Jun-17.
In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I knocked on the house and kennel building doors, hooked my vehicle horn and
called the phone number provided and left a message.
