3.101(g) Critical

Facilities, general.
On December 20, 2021 a California Sealion ingested a small, fish shaped enrichment item which could not be retrieved.
After medical management was unsuccessful, an endoscopy was preformed to attempt to remove the item from the
animal. The Animal did not recover from procedure. This was a direct result of the animal ingesting an enrichment item
that was small enough to swallow but not digest. Enrichment items should be safe for use for the species involved and
should cause no harm, injury or death to the animal. A correction was implemented and those types of enrichment items
were discontinued for use in those animals at the facility after the incident.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Director and CEO.
