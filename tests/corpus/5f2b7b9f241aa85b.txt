SANITATION.
A spray bottle of disinfectant was on top of a plastic small animal crate containing a guinea pig, posing a risk of
exposure of the animal to the chemical should the bottle spill or leak.
Improper housekeeping, which includes improper storage of chemicals, can lead to injury hazards for the animals.
Premises shall be kept clean and chemicals must be properly stored in order to protect the animals from injury and
to facilitate husbandry practices.
Corrected at the time of inspection by removing the bottle from the crate.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
A feeder in the enclosure holding the fistulated cow and her companion was rusted so that the metal bottom was
falling away, causing a sharp edge to be accessable to the animals. A yellowjacket nest was under the feeder in the
space caused by separation of the layers of the floor of the feeder, and many yellowjackets were buzzing around
the cow eating from the feeder.
The heavily rusted feeder is difficult to clean and sanitize, and the separated edge is sharp enough to cause injury
to the animals in the enclosure. It also provides harborage to pests that can bother or cause injury to the animals.
This was corrected at the time of inspection by replacing the feeder.
A wire cage containing a single gerbil was next to a sink. Two quart-sized bottles of bleach were on a shelf above
the sink. The placement of the caustic liquid poses a risk to the animal beneath if a spill should occur.
Improper housekeeping, which includes improper storage of chemicals, can lead to injury hazards for the animals.
Premises shall be kept clean and chemicals should be properly stored in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate husbandry practices.
This was corrected at the time of inspection by removing the the chemicals from the shelf.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel.
