HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wooden framework supporting the lemur enclosure is decaying which has resulted in the sagging of the
roof-line and the protrusion of a nail into the animal area. The wooden door frame that leads into the enclosure is
also rotted. These are areas that may result in injury to the three lemurs. The decaying wooden areas must be
repaired or replaced and maintained to protect the animals from injury and contain them.
