FEEDING.
At time of inspection there was a heard of at least 14 goats of various sizes and ages in one enclosure. Three of the
goats had a thinner body condition than the other animals. Feeding of hay to the goats was observed. All of the hay
is placed in one corner of the enclosure. Therefore, not all of the goats could access the hay because of the location
of feeding and dominant animals were preventing others access to the hay. Food must be located so that it is
accessible to all animals to ensure that they receive adequate nutrition. Licensee must ensure that the food is
located so as to be accessible to all animals in the enclosure.
