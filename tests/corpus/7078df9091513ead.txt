ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The feces of the solitary black bear are cow patty consistency. The bear is thin, with slight outlines of the spine and
long bones of the legs. From above he is flat sided and has a slight tuck up at the waist. The owner states the only
food the bear has been receiving this summer is dog food, and not the additional produce he has fed in the past.
The bear has not been dewormed in over a year also. The dog food being fed is of low quality. The bear needs to
be seen by the veterinarian and a diagnosis and treatment plan made. The licensee needs to keep records of any
veterinary recommendations. To be corrected by 9-25-15.
