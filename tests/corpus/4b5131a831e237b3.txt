2.40(a) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility does not have a Program of Veterinary Care with an Attending Veterinarian on file. The oversight of an
attending veterinarian is required to properly care for the animals covered by the license. As stated in the regulation:
each dealer or exhibitor shall have an attending veterinarian who shall provide adequate care to its animals in compliance
with the Act.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Disposition records for the two kinkajous that were inspected on the last inspection were not available. All animals that
are sold, transferred, or euthanized must have disposition records. These records should include the following
information: where the animal went, date of disposition, name of individual or business it’s going to, USDA license or a
government ID if not licensed, the vehicle license number and state, the species of the animal, the number of animals on
shipment, and address where the animal is been taken. This information was not found by facility representatives, and
they could not say where these animals went. This information is required to track the movement of animals within the
country and its territories.


Corrected from this day forward.
3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
Enrichment and furniture type items, such as barrels, toys, slides, and stairs were heavily soiled, and did not appear to
have been recently sanitized. Enrichment items that are not properly sanitized or removed and non-human primates have
daily contact with can lead to disease in these animals. The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a
manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized or removed or replaced when worned
or soiled. Furniture type fixtures or objects must be sturdily constructed and must be strong enough to provide for the
safe activity and welfare of nonhuman primates.

3.75(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
Multiple primary enclosures housing nonhuman primates contained rusted fencing, platforms, jungle gym type
enrichment, and shifting gates that were beginning to show signs of wear and degradation. Rusted primary enclosure
materials can lose structural integrity over time and cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust in surfaces
where animals have daily contact with can lead to injury and make the sanitization process difficult. Any surfaces that
come in contact with nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.

3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
Several interior walls of primary enclosures have varying degrees of chipping paint. The most affected walls were at the
natural height of large nonhuman primates, such as baboons and chimpanzees, or along the wall where there were
platforms or enrichment items for large nonhuman primates to engage with. Primary enclosure walls with chipping paint
don’t allow for proper cleaning and sanitization; additionally, nonhuman primate digestion of paint could have negative
health impacts. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.

3.80(a)(1) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On November 7, 2022, a black-capped capuchin named Jack escaped his primary enclosure, through the perimeter
fence, and into a wooded area close to the facility. A few volunteers were in the process of changing out enrichment toys
when the net they were using to keep Jack in a corner got caught on an enrichment toy. Jack was able to escape his
primary enclosure and climb over the primary fence and into the wooded area behind the property. Jack was missing for
24 hours before he was captured and placed in his primary enclosure. Escaped animals can get injured specially when
out in wild wooded areas. Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed to contain the species of nonhuman
primate in them.

On inspection, a primary enclosure housing two rhesus macaques had a gap between the enclosure fence and the
concrete floor, about two to three inches wide, approximately the diameter of a PVC pipe that was laid in the next-door
enclosure. A macaque was able to stick its entire leg out of the primary enclosure from the gap. Wide gaps can be

potential hazards for nonhuman primate limb or head entrapment. Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed
of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates contained in them. The
must be kept in good repair.

3.80(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Five of the off exhibit enclosures for nonhuman primates housed in “Diabetic Row” have sharp, broken-off edges of
metallic pipe that were placed between the enclosure fence and keeper access gate. Additionally, an enclosure housing
a Japanese snow macaque contained untethered fencing between connected enclosures that the animal passed through.
Nonhuman primates can come in contact with sharp metallic edges and unsecured metallic structures, and potentially
injure themselves.
Additionally, multiple enrichment items inside nonhuman primate primary enclosures, such as barrels, tube tunnels, toys,
swings and slides, were in despair with cracks, broken edges, and sharp points. These broken edges and sharp points
can lead to entrapment and/or injury to the nonhuman primates.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure
nonhuman primates.

3.81

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.

The facility had no written nonhuman primate enrichment program that is approved by an attending veterinarian. The
nonhuman primate enrichment program is developed to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates.
The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited as cited in appropriate
professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.

3.82(d)

Feeding.
Multiple PVC tubes used for nonhuman primate public feedings were heavily soiled inside, where the food items come
into contact. The heavily soiled pipes can lead to digestive or health issues and can also attract pests that can be
detrimental to the health and welfare of nonhuman primates. Food and food receptacles, if used, must be located so as
to minimize any risk of contamination by excreta or pests. Food receptacles must be kept clean and must be sanitized in
accordance with procedures listed in 3.84(b)(3) at least every two weeks.
