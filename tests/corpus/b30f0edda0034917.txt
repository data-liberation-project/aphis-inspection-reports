***The food storage area in the trucks have an accumulation of dirt on the surfaces of all items stored in the room.
There is sawdust and debris on the floor with supplies. There are 3 freezers in the food storage area in the trailer for
the tigers. There is a thick layer of dirt on the freezers and there are dead insects and dirt inside the two freezers
that contain meat. The third freezer was not checked because they had other items stored on top and they said it
was currently empty. There are ziploc bags used to store the food, dish detergent, a pressure washer, trash bags
and other items haphazardly stored in the room. Food must be stored in a manner that will protect it from
contamination. The dirt on and in the freezers as well as the clutter and debris increase the risk of contamination.
The room shall be cleaned and sanitized. All supplies shall be stored in a manner that will prevent contamination.
