ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:10PM on
10-AUG-16.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system.
Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was deployed, the “prepared by”
date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the original inspection report, which
occurred on 10 August 2016.
