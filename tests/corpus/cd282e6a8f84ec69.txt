2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is still no program of veterinary care available for review at either location. This was also an issue on
inspections in 2015 ,2016 and on the last inspection conducted on 7/17/2017 . Licensees states they will call the
veterinarian for an appointment this week. The program of veterinary care must be available for review at time of the
inspection and the veterinarian must make regularly scheduled visits to assure that adequate veterinary care is
provided.
The focused inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a board member at the 2nd location.
