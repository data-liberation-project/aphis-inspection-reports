2.33(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In June of 2018 the facility self-reported an incident to USDA. The incident involved a dog recovering from
anesthesia for a surgical procedure approved by the IACUC. The principal investigator’s laboratory staff that was
monitoring the dog’s recovery communicated with the attending veterinarian about some concerns they had. The
lab staff confirmed with the attending veterinarian by email that they would contact the on-call veterinarian if any
complications occurred overnight as the animal continued to recover. When complications did arise, the lab staff
failed to contact the on-call veterinarian. The laboratory staff attempted medical interventions, but the dog did not
survive. At this time the lab staff contacted the on-call veterinarian to tell them what happened.The Director of the
Division of Comparative Medicine confirmed that failure to communicate the complications with the veterinarian
violated the research facility’s policy. The director and attending veterinarian also stated that if the complications
had been communicated to a veterinarian earlier, then the veterinarian would have suggested other interventions
than what the lab staff provided. The facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care
including the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the
availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Failure to do so can jeopardize the welfare of animals. This
item has been corrected. The IACUC promptly investigated this incident and took corrective actions to prevent
future occurrences.
This was a focused inspection limited to information pertaining to the self-reported incident.
This inspection on Jun 27, 2018 and exit interview on July 2, 2018 were conducted with facility representatives.
