The indoor portion of the sheltered housing facility is dirty, with excessive cobwebs and dust accumulated on the
ceiling, hair caught on the wire tops of primary enclosures, and the floor is littered with feces and debris. The
degree of cleanliness on the inside of this facility is not sufficient to prevent or eliminate odors on the inside of the
facility. Dirty conditions caused by inadequate cleaning can facilitate transmission of disease to the animals housed
therein, as well as attract pests which can cause discomfort or pose another risk of disease transmission. All
surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices. Correct by cleaning and sanitizing all surfaces of the housing facility as needed
to prevent odors, insects, pests or vermin, and to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
