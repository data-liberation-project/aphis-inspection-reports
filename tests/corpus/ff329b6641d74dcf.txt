RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The indoor area of the vervet enclosure has power cords from a heat lamp plugged into an electrical outlet on the
wall. These live electrical wires and outlets were within reach of the vervet, posing a risk of injury to the animal.
The licensee must ensure this area is safe by removing or covering the outlet and power cords.
Corrected the day of the inspection.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The hyena enclosure has a large hole in the wall of the lockout, with loose wires and sharp points protruding into
the enclosure. There were broken boards with exposed sharp points on the ground in the lockout. This is a risk of
injury or entrapment to the animal, and also makes the lockout area ineffective.
- The enclosure housing three white tigers has exposed nail heads on the lower resting platform as well as loose
boards.
- The camel enclosure has a partially detached fence rail with exposed nails. Inside the front shelter are severalbroken boards, exposed nail heads, and a piece of jagged wood still attached to the wall.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. These items were corrected the day of the inspection.
