FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A 4 year old female Amur Leopard escaped from the outdoor portion of her enclosure the morning of 7 June 2016.
She was recaptured successfully and returned to the enclosure. The staff determined that the leopard had climbed
the enclosure wall and was able to squeeze out through an opening of the mesh on the top of the enclosure. She
had been observed in her outdoor enclosure by the staff at 7:15 am but was spotted by a zoo patron on an
overhanging beam adjacent to her enclosure at about 9:30 am. She was darted successfully and returned safely to
the leopards indoor enclosure. The escape put this leopard at risk for the use of lethal gunshot if the recapture had
not been safe and successful as well as for injury during the recapture process. The escape also put patrons of the
zoo at risk for injury by the leopard. The licensee must ensure that all facilities must be constructed of such material
and of such strength as appropriated for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be
structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals. The leopards are currently housed in the indoor portion of the exhibit. The leopards outdoor enclosure
must be corrected by 5 July 2016
This was a focused inspection to asses the leopard escape, medical records, and shade/temperature concerns in
animal enclosures.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and Margaret A Shaver, VMO in
attendance.
