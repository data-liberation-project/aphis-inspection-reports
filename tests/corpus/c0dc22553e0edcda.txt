2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) is incomplete. Revolution is listed for external parasite control, but the
concentration of the medication, instructions for use, dose, and route of administration is not listed in the PVC. The
program of veterinary care must be complete to provide adequate guidance to the licensee to maintain the health of
the hedgehogs.
There have not been regularly scheduled visits to the premise of the dealer. The PVC has not been reviewed or
updated by the attending veterinarian in over a year. Failure to provide for regularly scheduled visits to the facility by
the attending veterinarian can lead to lack of delivery of adequate veterinary care to the animals. The attending
veterinarian must be aware of management practices that affect the animals. Regular scheduled visits by the
attending veterinarian shall occur at the frequency established by the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the
written program of veterinary care.
Correct by February 23, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
