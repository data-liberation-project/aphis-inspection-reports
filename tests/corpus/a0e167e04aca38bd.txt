One male mini-golden doodle puppy (ID 487) and three female mini-golden doodle puppies (ID's 484, 485, and 486) were
sold and transported in commerce before 8 weeks (56 days) of age. The puppies were born on 6-30-2022. The puppies
were sold and transported on 8-23-2022. Thus, the puppies were only 54 days of age. No dog shall be delivered by any
person to any carrier or intermediate handler for transportation, in commerce, or shall be transported in commerce by any
person, except to a registered research facility, unless such dog is at least 8 weeks of age and has been weaned. All
