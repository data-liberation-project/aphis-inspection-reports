3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 5/10/19, the juvenile female fennec fox "Peggy" was injured. Based on statements from facility staff, the
licensee, as well as facility and veterinary records, two female fennec foxes were housed in a multilevel cage with a
metal ramp. Because the ramp was not adequately secured, one fennec fox sustained a compound leg fracture.
The fox was taken to a local veterinary hospital for treatment.
The enclosure for the fennec fox led to a serious injury in this animal. Housing facilities must be structurally sound
and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The facility instituted corrective action for this incident prior to this inspection by removing the ramp in the enclosure.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
