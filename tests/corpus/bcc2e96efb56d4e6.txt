ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One animals were noted to have a thinning haircoat at the time of inspection and one adult had died. These issues
appeared confined to two enclosures but were not recorded or relayed to the attending veterinarian. The animals
need to be monitored daily and recorded to assure early identification of adverse trends which may then be
conveyed to the attending veterinarian. This assures the continued health and well-being of the animals.
Correct: this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a licensee and ACI Bartels.
