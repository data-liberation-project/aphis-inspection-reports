2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Cavalier Female #385 was identified by the Attending Veterinarian on 4/26/2016 as having grade III dental
disease and required further dental cleaning at that time. The Attending Veterinarian and the Licensee did not have
any documentation indicating that this dog had received further treatment. On today's inspection this dog was
identified as having severe dental disease including a pinkish mass above the gum line by the left canine
surrounded by a thick yellow discharge, as well as moderate tartar buildup throughout all of her teeth.
In addition there was an unidentified female cavalier with no ID that was noticed to have very few teeth remaining.
The upper right canine and the lower left molar in particular both had moderate tartar buildup and swollen, bleeding
gums.
Dental issues can cause further health issues and be painful to the dog if it is left untreated. These dogs must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment must be
maintained by the Licensee and made available for further review by APHIS officials.
