HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are several animal enclosures with inadequate barriers between the public and the animals on exhibit. The
following observations were made:
Cougar, Serval, Bobcat, Kit Fox, Swift Fox, Ringtail: These animals are displayed in an area with enclosures where
the public viewing area in front features vertical strands of taut wire, with nearly an inch between each strand.
Inside the enclosures there are features that are meant to deter the animals from approaching the wire front, which
separates the animals from the public. These features include a pool of water and / or hotwire. The vertical wire
has some flexibility, and it is possible for a member of the public to insert a hand, or an object between the wires,
into the enclosure. The features may not be adequate to prevent contact.
African porcupine: This enclosure has a low masonry wall, and members of the public can easily reach over the
wall, potentially contacting the animal on exhibit.
Sand Gazelle: A low wall could potentially enable members of the public to reach over and contact the animals.
During public exhibition, any animal should be displayed so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to
the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to
assure the safety of animals and the public.
Measures should be taken immediately to ensure adequate distance and/or barriers are in place between the
animals and the public.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence is comprised of chain-link fencing, and the perimeter terrain is primarily sand. There are many
spots where the chain-link does not meet the ground, and there are gaps of three inches or more under the fence.While the majority of the fence meets the eight foot height requirements for facilities that house dangerous animals,
there are a few locations where there is a gate, or masonry fencing, where the fence measures less than eight feet.
The perimeter fence should serve to keep people and animals from passing under or through the fence, and also as
a secondary containment for the animals. Measures should be undertaken to ensure that the fence meets these
goals and specifications, so as to protect the well-being of the animals on exhibit.
To be corrected by 6/25/14.
An exit briefing was conducted with the curator of animals.
