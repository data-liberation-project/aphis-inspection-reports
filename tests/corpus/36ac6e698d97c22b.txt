2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown and white adult guinea pig in pen 38 was observed with an eye abnormality and was in need of veterinary
care. The right eye was swollen and held partially closed. There was hair loss and redness around the eye. The
surface of the eye was cloudy and there was a moderate amount of yellow discharge around the eye. The facility
reported they had observed the issue but had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian and were not treating it as
prescribed in the Program of Veterinary Care. In addition, there were 2 dead juvenile guinea pigs observed in Pen
30.
Eye abnormalities can affect the vision, can be indicative of disease or injury, can be painful, and affect the overall
health and well-being of the animal. Facilities must ensure that animals with health conditions are identified and
treated according to instructions by the AV. Failure to do so can lead to worsening of health conditions, up to and
including death.
The facility must contact the attending veterinarian to have the guinea pig with the eye abnormality evaluated in
order to determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility had no records of animals on hand, births, or deaths since July 2019.
Facilities need to make, keep, and maintain records pertaining to the number of animals held, including births and
deaths. Failure to do so can lead to inadequate tracking of animal health should problems arise in the herd.
Correct by maintaining an inventory of animals on hand and tracking births and deaths/euthanasias of guinea pigs.

SANITATION.There were several pens (at least 5) in which the area around the water nipples was completely soiled such that
guinea pigs were required to stand in wet, soiled bedding in order to drink.
Failure to provide clean, dry areas in enclosures around watering devices can result in discomfort to the animals
and possible spread of disease,
Primary enclosures must be kept clean and dry and if they become soiled to a degree that may be harmful or
uncomfortable to the animals, the animals must be transferred to clean enclosures.

SANITATION.
Two of the weanling/sorting pens and Pen 14 had an accumulation of fecal material, enough so that there were
large portions in each pen that consisted of only feces for the animals to stand on. There were another five pens
that had spiderwebs adhered to the wire mesh and upper corners of the enclosures.
Enclosures need to be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of feces or debris. The build-up
of fecal material and spiderwebs can have a negative impact on animal health through the spread of disease or
respiratory problems. Correct by cleaning enclosures and removing feces and spiderwebs from the enclosures.
