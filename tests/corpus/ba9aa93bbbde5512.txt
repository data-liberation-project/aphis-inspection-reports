FACILITIES, INDOOR.
** The housing surfaces for the rabbits are constructed with untreated wood. There were many stains on the surface
that can not be properly sanitized because the surfaces are not impervious to moisture. The housing surfaces shall
be constructed and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized
for the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by June 5, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the pen enclosing 3 goats there was a platform that was in disrepair. A piece of the platform had an exposed
nail head sticking out of it along with part of the still standing platform which also had some exposed nail heads that
the animals have direct contact.
** In the pen enclosing 5 sheep near the pond there were areas of the fencing that was in disrepair with some pointy
ends. There was also some mesh from a tree that was lying within the enclosure that could possibly become
ingested.
** In the enclosure containing a cow and a llama the fences top strand is constructed of barbed wire in which the
animals have direct contact. There was also several strands of orange hay bale twine on the ground within their
enclosure that could possibly be ingested.
** In the upper pen containing 7 goats and 3 sheep there were several areas of the fencing that were curled and
dragging the bottom of the ground. The top two strands of the fencing was also constructed of barbed wire where
the far left corner of the fencing had a strand of barbed wire haphazardly strung around the top the fencing to tie the
loose end in which the animals can have direct contact.
All of the enclosure should be constructed to prevent injury of the animals including the materials used for the
fencing and keeping it in good repair..3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** In the upper pen enclosing 7 goats and 3 sheep there was one shelter with only one side. The shelter would not
be appropriate and would be insufficient for the local climatic conditions (tornadoes and high winds). Artificial
shelters appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept
outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals. Correct by June 6, 2016.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
** In the two front goat and sheep pens there was an excessive amount of feces in the sheltered portion of the pen.
If the animals would like to use the indoor aspect of their pen they may be reluctant to use it due to the excessive
amount of feces inside. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. Correct by
