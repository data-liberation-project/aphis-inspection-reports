3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
There was an excessive accumulation of food waste present in and just outside the baboon enclosure during inspection.
Some of the cut up bananas or discarded banana peels were dark brown and appeared slimy, and the food debris creates
a disease hazard. According to the facility manager, the enclosure is cleaned every three days, and the employee
responsible called out on the day of inspection. Hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily in all housing facilities and all
other surfaces must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices. Excessive food waste that accumulates for multiple days attracts vermin and creates a disease hazard for the
baboons in the enclosure, and does not meet generally accepted husbandry practices.
