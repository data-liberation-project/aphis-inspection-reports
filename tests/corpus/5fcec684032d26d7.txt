3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Fencing around the Little Barnyard enclosing three goats was bowing on lower 1/3 portion. On the public viewing
side, the bowing fencing was separated from the ground post, creating a gap where the smallest of the three goats
could fit. The condition of the current fencing could cause injury to an animal if not remedied. The outdoor housing
facility shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
