ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1340 on
09-May-18.
I arrived at the facility at 1:40pm and knocked on the door. No one answered. I called the number provided in the file
and left a voicemail. I honked the horn and waited. The facility owner called me back at 1:50pm to let me know that
no one was available to take me through the kennel and would not be available for several hours. I informed him
that he would receive an attempted inspection and we discussed optimal hours.
