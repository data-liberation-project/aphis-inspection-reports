PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The chest height enclosure along the back wall had a hole in the back that was large enough for guinea pigs to go
out. Repairs of enclosures need to be made when the need is identified to assure that the problem does not cause
injury to the animals.
An Exit interview was conducted with facility owner.
