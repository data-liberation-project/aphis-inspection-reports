FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Section 3.126(b) Ventilation: There was a strong odor of ammonia in room 14 housing about 850 ferrets. This room
also had numerous enclosures with excessive piles of feces. (See Section 3.131(a) Cleaning of enclosures). The
ammonia odor improved some after the enclosures were cleaned, but was still noticeable in the back half of the
room. Ammonia odors may cause eye and respiratory irritation for the animals living in the room and result in health
problems. The ventilation system was checked by facility personnel and the facility escort informed the APHIS
officials that one of two exhaust fan motors was not working. The facility called a repair service during the
inspection and came to make repairs. Corrected by July14, 2016.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(a) Cleaning of enclosures: In room 14 there were at least 23 enclosures housing a total of 85 ferrets
that had excessive piles of feces on either the floor and/or elevated wire platform in their enclosures.
Accumulations of feces may harbor bacteria and/or parasites and cause odors. Excreta must be removed from
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination, minimize disease hazards and reduce odors. After
APHIS officials identified the excessive accumulations of feces in the enclosures, they were cleaned by facility
personnel. Corrected during the inspection.
Note: The attending veterinarian examined the animals cited on the October 27, 2015 inspection report.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility president; Mary Geib, VMO; and Corbin Ranslem, ACI.
