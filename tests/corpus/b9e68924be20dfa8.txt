Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A litter of nursing Miniature Pinscher puppies were laying in a kennel with their dam. One puppy was deceased and
decaying with its skin and fur sloughing off, a second puppy was deceased with flies going in and out of its nose, a third
puppy was laying listless with shallow breathing, and three living puppies were huddled next to them. The licensee was
unaware of the dead and severely ill puppies as she hadn't observed the puppies in two days. Observations of animals
should be accomplished daily to allow for information to be relayed to the veterinarian in a timely manner.

The inspection was paused and the licensee immediately took the listless puppy, the three littermates, and dam to the
veterinarian.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee was maintaining records at the facility that were missing required information. Cage cards were missing from
cages with litters. The APHIS Form 7005 had more dogs listed than what were on hand. Proper record keeping is
required for tracking and tracing purposes. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and
correctly disclose the required information at all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The washdowns under the whelping enclosures had excessive accumulation of standing fecal contaminated water. In
some of these enclosures the dogs were not able to avoid contact with the fecal matter when using the outdoor runs. This
resulted in a strong odor of feces and attracted flies. The licensee wasn’t aware of when the last time the wash downs
were cleaned properly. A buildup of feces could cause the dog to become soiled, could attract pests, and could also
increase the risk of disease.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily. The licensee must remove the feces from the
affected enclosure and ensure that all waste is removed from each enclosure daily. Cleaning of the washdowns must be
done as often as necessary to prevent buildup of feces, odors, and attracting pests.

Licensee corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.11(c) Direct

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the dog food storage area trash, junk, and chemicals are being stored directly next to the dog food. There is an open
bag of any chemicals within one foot of the stored dog food. Rodent droppings were also seen around the stored dog food
and an open box of dog treats. Areas where trash, junk, and discarded waste materials are allowed to accumulate can
serve as breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests.


Inside the whelping building there’s an accumulation of organic matter on floors next to the dogs primary enclosures. An
accumulation of deceased pests and organic matter is also on wall and on the air conditioning unit.

Housing facilities and buildings where dog food is stored, including enclosures and surrounding grounds, must be kept
clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for
rodents and other pests and vermin. The licensee must remove all the trash, organic material, and discarded items from
the housing facilities and the dog food storage area. The chemicals must be kept far away from the dog food and be
stored in a container with a tight-fitting lid. The licensee must ensure that the premises of housing facilities are free of
trash, discarded materials, chemicals, and waste products at all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the whelping kennel there was a severe accumulation of cockroaches. Cockroaches were seen in the dog food the
dogs were eating, in the kennels, on the air conditioner, on the walls, and were falling from the ceiling during the time of
the inspection. An effective program for the control of insects and pests must be established and maintained to promote
the health and well-being of the animals living in the kennel.
