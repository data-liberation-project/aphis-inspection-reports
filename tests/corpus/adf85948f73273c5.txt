FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is one large enclosure that houses 83 fallow deer. There is only one shelter structure within this enclosure.
The facility manager thought that this structure is approximately 16(cid:25) x 8(cid:25). The one shelter structure is not large
enough to allow all 83 deer to get out of the weather extremes at one time. Not having a proper amount of shelter
for these animals expose them to the direct effects of all weather conditions; rain, snow, wind, etc. All enclosures
must have enough shelters that are large enough for all animals within the enclosure to seek shelter with enough
space to stand and lay down in a comfortable and normal posture.

WATERING.
There are two black bears being housed in one primary enclosure. The watering source for this enclosure is a pond
like structure in the middle back of the enclosure. The inside and surrounding surfaces of the water structure has
an excessive amount of green to black algae and organic material build up. Unclean water sources expose these
animals to possible water contamination and unnecessary disease hazards. Licensee must ensure that all water
sources must be kept clean and free of algae and organic material.
