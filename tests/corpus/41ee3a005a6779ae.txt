ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:30 a.m. on
20-SEP-17.
After I arrived at the facility I called the owner and he stated that he was out of town for work and would not be able
to do the inspection today.
