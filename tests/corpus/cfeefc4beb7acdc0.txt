2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The majority of the dogs were heavily matted and need to be groomed. Once the fur becomes matted, it pulls
and separates from the skin potentially causing skin irritations. These dogs are currently being groomed two times a
year which is not frequent enough to prevent matting issues. The frequency of grooming needs to be changed and
dogs groomed when needed to prevent matting issues.

2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** The facility is not using the required forms of disposition (form 7006) when puppies are sold from the facility. A
record of receipt is given but does not have the required information needed for tracking the movement of puppies.
The required forms need to be used to address these issues.
Correct by: April 5, 2014 (7006 forms were left at the facility for future use)
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The dogs have wooden resting boards in the enclosures. The wood boards are not sealed and impervious to
moisture and there is a buildup of feces on the boards contributing to the strong odor in the kennel. These boards
cannot be cleaned and sanitized and need to be replaced now that they are soiled.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** The enclosures are built out of wood. In many areas the wood has been scratched by the dogs and is no longer
impervious to moisture. Urine and feces are stained into the wood identifying this problem. These enclosures need
to be cleaned and then stained or painted to make them impervious to moisture again. This is to facilitate cleaning
of the facility and enclosures.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The facility is not being sanitized on a routine basis. There is excess feces and food stuck between the wire
mesh and wood support beams. The wood platforms are soiled with feces and there is an excess buildup of hair
hanging underneath the wire mesh enclosures. The hair is trapping urine and fecal debris which is contributing to
strong odors in the kennel. This facility needs to clean on a routine basis by first removing feces and food waste
then sanitizing the enclosures. This needs to be done for the health of the dogs and to prevent disease hazards.
*** The feeders need to be cleaned and sanitized. A few of the feeders had feces in the feeders or the food was wet
and beginning to cake at the bottom. These feeders need to be cleaned and sanitized on a routine basis for the
health of the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The kennel building needs to be cleaned. There is a buildup of dust and debris throughout the kennel, on the
window ledges, the heater etc. These areas in addition to the enclosures need to be kept clean to promote goodhousekeeping practices and for the health of the dogs.
