ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were nine juvenile hedgehogs that had received veterinary care on 01/09/2016 for severe bite wounds to the
legs. The licensee stated she did not know these animals had any injuries until around 8:30 am on 01/09/2016 and
took them immediately to the Attending Veterinarian (AV). The medical notes from the AV stated 10 hedgehogs
were examined and or treated on 01/09/2016. Two hedgehogs had deep bite wounds on the legs, one was severely
injured on the left hind leg at the hock with necrotic tissue, both had compound fracture and were euthanized. Four
hedgehogs had bite wounds that were healing, wounds cleaned and antibiotics provided. Three hedgehog had
deep wounds with one being necrotic and one having pus coming from the wound, they were anesthetized and
wounds debrided. One hedgehog had no injuries. Since several of the wounds were healing, several were necrotic
and discussion with the AV it was estimated that these injuries could have occurred 5-10 days prior to these animals
being provided veterinary care. Daily observation is not being performed adequately. A failure to conduct adequate
observations can result in a delay of care provided to the animals and prolonged animal suffering.
All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being. Problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being shall be communicated to the attending veterinarian and addressed in a timely manner.

SANITATION.
There is a stack of dirty food receptacles being stored near the animal enclosures in the upstairs hedgehog
breeding area. Licensee stated they had been sitting for a day and would not be moved or cleaned until the next
day. Several of food receptacles had dead flies lying in the bottom. Dirty food receptacles attract pests which can
harbor diseases. These diseases could potentially affect the health and well-being of the animals.
Premises shall be kept clean to protect the animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry.

SEPARATION.
Medical notes from the Attending Veterinarian dated 01/09/2016 listed nine juvenile hedgehogs as having deep bite
wounds and two of them having compound fractures to the legs. Licensee stated the nine hedgehogs which had
sustained injuries had been housed with several other litters of juvenile hedgehogs upstairs in the breeding room.
Licensee did state she noticed one of the hedgehogs biting and removed it from the enclosure. It is evidenced by
the injuries to the nine hedgehogs that the animals being housed together were not compatible. Animals housed
together must be compatible to reduce the risk of fighting, injuries and undo stress on the animals. Animals housed
in groups need to be observed daily for any signs of over aggression and if such behavior is noticed animals must
be separated to protect them from each other.
Ensure that all animals housed in the same primary enclosures are compatible.
