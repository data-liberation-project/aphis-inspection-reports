2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Upon inspection, there was no Program of Veterinary Care available for review. Although the facility has a new
veterinarian they use on an as-needed basis, no formal arrangements have been set. The written Program of Veterinary
Care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian in regards to the
veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written Program of Veterinary Care is available for
review during all USDA inspections.

Each applicant shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written Program of Veterinary Care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the applicant.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete acquisition and disposition records. There were no acquisition records for the mountain
coatimundi, African crested porcupine, Patagonian cavies, arctic fox, prairie dogs, skunks, camel, alpaca, llamas, goats,


sheep, pigs, zebu, and Scottish Highland cow. Additionally, no disposition records were available for the rabbits.

Acquisition and disposition records, including offspring born at the facility, are necessary to accurately track animals being
used in regulated activities. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition/disposition of all animals
that fully and correctly disclose the required information.

Classification and separation.
One Flemish Giant rabbit was housed in the same primary enclosure as an African crested porcupine. Rabbits housed in
compatible groups with the same species help prevents injuries amongst the group and protects their well-being. Rabbits
shall not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals unless required for scientific
reasons.

Facilities, general.
The fencing infrastructure of several enclosures were in disrepair. The pasture housing a camel, llamas, alpacas, and pigs
had a hole along the top edge of the fence line, measuring 18 inches wide and 7.5 inches tall.

One pig and one sheep housed in another outdoor enclosure had left their exhibit area through a large hole in their
primary enclosure fencing. Upon inspection, the two animals were seen returning to their enclosure, walking through a
hole in the fence 36.5 inches high and 20 inches wide.



Several pigs were seen entering and exiting their primary enclosure through a 10.5 inch gap under the fence line,
preventing an accurate headcount of the animals without several attempts.

Openings present within primary enclosures pose the risk of animals getting trapped and/or injured when they maneuver
between gaps in the fence line, and are not being safely contained. Such areas that are not properly maintained can
injure the animals housed, especially when sharp points and edges are present.

Housing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the species involved. The
facility must have a system of maintenance such that all structures and devices remain structurally sound and in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
