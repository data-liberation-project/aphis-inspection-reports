HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are 2 bears that are being housed individually. There are 2 enclosures that are available to these bears.
One of these enclosures has a pool of water, and the other contains 2 small fans which are not adequate for type of
outdoor enclosure. The two bears are being rotated daily between these two enclosures so that only one bear has
access to the pool of water every other day. A fan with a water mist system or small pool on the side of the
enclosure that doesn't have a pool may be more suitable.
The fans in the camel/aoudad/deer shelter building continue to not work when the zoo personnel tried to turn them
on.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as
the animal's age, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation.
The summer months are extremely hot (frequently above 90 degrees F) with a high humidity. Each bear shall be
afforded an opportunity for cooling every day during hot weather

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Due to soil erosion there is a large gap under the fence dividing the llama and ram enclosure. The animals are
exposed to the sharp edges and points of the chain link along the bottom of the fence. The gap may entrap the
animals feet and legs if they slip under the fence, or the points may cause injuries.The housing facilities shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The exposed chain link shall be extended and buried as not to cause a hazard to the animal.
The camel/deer/aoudad exhibit still has an area along the one of the sides where the shelter roof & gutters continue
to have leaves, ferns, dirt, a small tree, etc, which continues to clog the drainage system. This also puts extra
weight on the gutters (as well as the roofs).
This roof shall be cleaned and maintained in a clean fashion to prevent vegetation buildups on the roof structure to
prevent additional structural weight/stress, as well as to facilitate drainage and keep the enclosures dry.
There is a dried tree limb with evidence of termite infestations hanging over the jaguar enclosure. If this tree limbshould break off and fall onto the top of this enclosure it may damage or break the mesh
There were also bamboo shoots in the tiger enclosure which have branched out towards the enclosure walls and
front. This can pose a risk, and provide a means for this animal to escape out of its enclosure.

SANITATION.
Cockroaches where again seen alive under the pallets in the feed storage area in camel barn. The rodent boxes
were empty throughout the whole zoo area. This is due to the pest control company discontinuing service because
they have not been paid.
Flies were observed throughout the zoo in sufficient numbers that they were causing discomfort, red areas, and
changes/scarring to the boarders of the ears of the lions.
A safe and more effective program for the control of cockroaches, rodents and flies shall be established and
maintained. The areas should be cleaned more frequently in order to remove old feed and hay. food boxes, old
food, and trash that were observed throughout the zoo which contributes to the fly congregation and reproduce in
these areas.
Adequate funds and their timely remittances shall be readily available to ensure ongoing services of a professional
pest control to reduce the pest that are known to exist at the zoo.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
