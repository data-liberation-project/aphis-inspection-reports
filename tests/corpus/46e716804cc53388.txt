2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
Photographs and videos found on social media show members of the public having physical contact with elephants at the
facility on multiple occasions over the past year. There were interactions utilizing physical barriers, and interactions
utilizing free contact with the animals as well. In these photos, a trained handler is not visible or is too far away to exert
direct control over the elephants. During the inspection, the facility confirmed the photos and videos were taken at their
facility. Handlers must be positioned so that they can immediately intervene should the need arise. The facility must take
steps to ensure the safety of all members of the public. Trained handlers must be present at or near the head of each
elephant in any type of public contact. This includes feeding, grooming, and photo opportunities.
Correct from this time forward.

Rosie, Bunny, Wimpy, Cameron, Val, Dory, Zola, Del Rita, Lily, Margaret, Obert, Tommy, Libby, Becky, Alta, Kelly, Lisa,
