2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
None of the three litters of unweaned puppies had any form of identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is
necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation.
The licensee must identify all puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Acceptable forms of identification include a
microchip, a collar and tag, a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written, or a cage card as long
as all the puppies in the enclosure are from the same litter.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 17, 2015.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
