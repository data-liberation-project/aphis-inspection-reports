3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
HOUSEKEEPING.
* The licensee still has not hired anyone to fill the vacant position of a janitor who used to clean the facility four days
a week. Instead, the licensee has the caretakers, volunteers, interns, and himself assuming those cleaning
responsibilities. There were a few areas throughout the facility which were still not getting cleaned appropriately.
There was trash, dust, dirt, and grime located under a vacant enclosure which was in close proximity to the
mammals. The floor of the kitchen area, especially in one corner, had an excessive build-up of dirt, dust and debris.
There were also feces on the kitchen counter from two sugar gliders who are housed in an enclosure which rests
on the that counter. Facilities which aren't kept reasonably clean can easily become a welcome environment for
rodents and other disease-carrying pests.
** The licensee must ensure the facility is cleaned often enough to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards
and practices.
This was a focused inspection to ensure all the non-compliant items identified during the inspection conducted on
18 February 2015 were corrected.
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with Dr. Amanda Owens (VMO), Mr. Bill Heine (ACI), and a
facility representative.
