2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Three dogs require evaluation by a veterinarian. A male brindle Boxer (Dez, m/c# 900115000783253) was observed to be
limping on the right hind leg. There was an open sore between the 2nd and 3rd toes that had a moderate amount of clear
discharge. A facility representative stated that it was not there the night before. Foot injuries can be painful and if not
treated, can worsen to become infected.

Maybelline, a female Olde English Bulldog (m/c# 9000085000740127) with 9 pups, was thin with the vertebrae and ribs
easily seen and there was an abdominal tuck. Weight loss can be a sign of inadequate nutrition, parasites or an
underlying medical condition. Loss of weight when nursing puppies can result in decreased milk quality. This dog must be
evaluated by a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment.

Stella, a buff and white female Cocker Spaniel (m/c# 900111881599146) was thin with a moderate abdominal tuck. She is
nursing 7 puppies. Weight loss can be a sign of inadequate nutrition, parasites or an underlying medical condition. Loss of
weight when nursing puppies can result in decreased milk quality. This dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for a
proper diagnosis and treatment.


A record of the evaluation and treatment of these dogs must be created and maintained and made available to APHIS
officials.
3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two outdoor enclosures have a medium size Igloo dog house with 3 dogs. Each dog house is large enough for 2 of the
enclosed dogs, but does not provide adequate space for the third dog to sit, stand, turn around and lay in a normal
manner. The temperature at the time of inspection was 42F degrees but have been below freezing at night. Adequate
shelter space for all the dogs in an enclosure is important for protection from the weather elements and as a place of
safety for dogs. More shelter space must be provided and maintained at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
In the outdoor enclosures constructed of chain link material, there is a gap between the gate and the post. The Boxer
housed in this enclosure was able to freely place his head in that gap. In the small brown building behind the grooming
building, a wire panel separating 2 enclosures was not attached securely to the wall, creating a gap large enough for the
dogs to pass through. When a dog is able to place its head or other body parts through spaces to the outside of the
enclosure, it could contact other animals that could harm the dog or become entrapped and injured. The owner must
ensure the safety of the dog by repairing this enclosure and maintaining enclosures to contain the dogs securely.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care does not have a frequency for sampling of heartworm, coccidia and giardia. Sampling of
parasites in accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian is important to prevent contagious and

deadly diseases of dogs and to know with certainty that the preventative treatment is effective. The applicant must add an
intestinal parasite sampling schedule approved by the attending veterinarian to the Program of Veterinary Care.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care does not include plans for preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and
unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. These plans are important
to maintain the health and well being of the dogs and must be addressed in the in the written program of veterinary care
that is signed by the attending veterinarian.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections by March 4, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply.
Please contact your inspector to schedule the next pre-license inspection.
Conducting regulated activities without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
