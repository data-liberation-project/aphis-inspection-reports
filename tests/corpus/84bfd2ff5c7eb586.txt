2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee is offering animal feed to the visiting public. There are still large enough gaps in the two sheep and
goat enclosure fences where the animals can place their heads through these openings. There is the potential that
the public can hand feed these animals and an attendant is not available at all times of this direct public contact.
Insufficient attendant supervision of animals during times of public contact can leave animals at risk for improper
handling and feeding of items by the public other than what is provided for the animals. Sufficient number of
responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employees or attendants must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are still numerous places where the established perimeter fence is inadequate. There are gaps of several
inches between the lower section of the fence and the ground, there are sections of fence that consists of metal
pipe fence with large gaps present, and there is one metal pipe gate that is not 6 feet in height. Inadequate
perimeter fence may not restrict animals and unauthorized people from entering the facility. The perimeter fence
must be at least 6 feet in height and have small enough openings in the fence and under the fence that restrict
animals and unauthorized people from entering the facility.

WATERING.
The facility is using one rubber water receptacle as well as two automatic waterers for the hogs. The rubber water
receptacle had cloudy water in it and was located in a wallow. The basins in the automatic waterers were covered
in a layer of dried mud. The seven hogs in this enclosure did not have access to potable water at the time of the
inspection. Dirty, unsanitary water receptacles can contaminate the water, play a role in disease transmission and
may discourage animals from drinking. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized. Correct by 4 Sept.
2014.This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
