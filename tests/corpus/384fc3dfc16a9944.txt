2.40(a)(1) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The program of veterinary care signature page documented a site visit by a veterinarian on August 2, 2022. When the
veterinarian was asked by phone to confirm the dates of the visit, she stated that she has not been out to the facility since
2020 and on August 2, 2022, she was at another facility. When presented with a photograph of the signature page, the
veterinarian confirmed that the signature on August 2, 2022 was not signed by herself.

Regularly scheduled visits to the premises by the attending veterinarian must be performed as a part of an adequate
program of veterinary care. When not performed, the veterinarian cannot assess and ensure the adequacy of veterinary
and other aspects of animal care. The licensee must ensure that the attending veterinarian regularly visits the premises
where animals are kept. Correct by 1/31/2023.
