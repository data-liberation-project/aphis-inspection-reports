Facilities, general.
The outdoor shelter for 3 domestic cattle is a metal sided building. The metal siding has become damaged in two spots
leaving large sharp edges at the height of the cattle. The sharp edges may cause injury to the animals housed in that
enclosure and affect their health and well-being.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. The metal siding must be repaired so sharp edges are not present.

3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
The outdoor enclosure that contains 3 domestic cattle has a large accumulation of mud around the grain feeding
receptacle. The cattle are fed hay in the middle of the enclosure where there is dry dirt but they must walk through mud to
get to the grain.
Poor drainage with areas of mud leads to animals being forced to walk and stand in wet conditions while eating and may
cause health problems. Cattle are more likely to have foot problems is kept in a wet environment for an extended period
of time. The outdoor enclosure must have adequate drainage so water may be rapidly eliminated and provide the cattle

have a dry place to eat.

Watering.
The water receptacle for 2 mini yaks had an excessive buildup of algae and organic material coating the entire interior
surface of the receptacle. This is the only water source for the two mini yaks. The facility representative states that it was
most likely cleaned last weekend. Buildup of algae and organic material in water does not provide the animals potable
water and may lead to health problems.
Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. All water receptacles
shall be kept clean and sanitary. The facility must provide potable water and ensure the water receptacle is kept clean
and sanitary.
