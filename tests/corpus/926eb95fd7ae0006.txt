HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The horizontal tube at the bottom of several gates in the primate enclosures (SPF section), had flaky rust and
jagged edges.
In order to prevent injury to the primates if their fingers come in contact with the rusted jagged edges and to
preserve the structural strength of the enclosure, facilities must be kept in good repair.
To be corrected by 7-1-2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
