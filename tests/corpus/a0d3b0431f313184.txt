RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
During the last inspection on 8-7-14, only 3 Geoffroys cats were observed and inspected. Currently there are 7
Geoffroys, 1 Asian Leopard Cat, and 2 Bengal cats. The Bengal cats, being hybrids with domestic cats, are
considered domestic cats under the Animal Welfare Act and their records must be kept on the required forms. Not
all of the required information is available for all of the animals. No acquisition records are available for the two
Bengal cats. The name and address, but no drivers license number or license plate number is available for the
Asian Leopard Cat (Tapanga) and the Geoffroys cat (Destiny) sellers. The Geoffroy kitten recently born is not
recorded in the records. Two cats were brought in at one time on loan, but one (Chloe) was returned but records do
not show this transaction.
Records of all acquisitions and dispositions need to be accurate and up to date. If an animal is obtained from
someone who is not USDA licensed, then their name, address, drivers license and license plate number need to be
obtained.
Records to be corrected by 8-7-15.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large wooden transportation crate is in the first enclosure with 3 exotic cats. The roof of this enclosure is loose
along one edge and falling down, exposing loose nail heads. This structure needs to be repaired or replaced. A
very rotten stump/part of tree is in the first enclosure on the ground next to the cage wire and is harboring a colony
of ants. A dried up evergreen tree is in the second enclosure needing removal. To be corrected by 7-27-15.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Blackened and slimy chicken food wastes and dried white bones are in the exotic cat enclosures. The rotting food
is attracting flies and ants. All enclosures need to be cleaned often enough to minimize vermin, odors and disease
hazards. During summer temperature extremes, when raw food is fed, leftover food should be quickly removed to
prevent cats from eating rotted food. To be corrected by 7-24-15.3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are three outdoor wire and wood cages containing 7 exotic cats (2 are hybrids). The tops are open wire and
the only shade structures are some wooden dens, an enclosed barrel, and kennel cabs. Two of the cages are over
12 feet tall. The cages are next to a row of trees, but these trees only provide shade in the afternoons.
Temperatures have been close to 100 many days already this summer. More widespread shade needs to be
provided for morning and noontime sun to allow the animals to be outside of a shelter where airflow can allow for
cooling. To be corrected by 7-27-15.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In two of the outdoor cages containing 3 cats each there is white dried feces in piles. One of the cages has a metal
roofed shelter and dried cat feces is on the roof. Flies are being attracted by the feces. Enclosures need to be
cleaned on a regular basis to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards. To be
corrected by 7-24-15.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Overgrown grass and weeds are in and around all three outdoor exotic cat enclosures. The weeds are 1 - 2 feet
high and are interfering with observation and adequate cleaning of the enclosures. The plants in these enclosures
need to be kept so they do not prevent easy observation of the animals nor prevent the necessary husbandry
practices. To be corrected by 7-27-15.
