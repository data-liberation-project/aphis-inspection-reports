ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is currently using a bottle of Vetericyn to treat an injured dog. The expiration date on the bottle of
Vetericyn is October 2013. Expired medical materials may lose their effectiveness and the health of the dog could
suffer. The licensee must either dispose of all such materials or segregate them in an appropriately labeled,
physically separate location from non-expired medical materials. The licensee must ensure that all medical material
used for the dogs have not expired in order to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.
Correction date: The licensee removed the expired Vetericyn from the dog kennel at the time of the inspection.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a heavy infestation of flies in the outdoor dog runs on the south side of the kennel building. A large number
of flies were sitting on the fencing, the enclosure floors, and flying/swarming throughout the enclosures. There are
at least fourteen adult dogs housed in these enclosures. The licensee stated that there is no pest control plan for
the flies. The infestation of flies could increase the risk of disease and contamination of animal areas.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of insects and external parasites
affecting the dogs in order to reduce the risk of disease and contamination by the flies.
Correction date: July 12, 2016
