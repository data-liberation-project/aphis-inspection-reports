Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 15:30 to 16:10
on 04/08/2014.
Inspector attempted to contact Director/President by phone and left message that the inspector was waiting at the
facility location for 30 minutes to conduct an inspection and the inspector could also be contacted by phone during
this time. At approximately 16:10 the licensee came to the location. The inspector honked her horn twice and
waved at the licensee as the licensee looked in her direction. Before the inspector could gather the inspection
materials and exit the vehicle, the licensee had left the facility. The inspector again tried to contact the licensee by
telephone, but again could only leave a message as the licensee did not answer the phone call. The licensee
contacted the inspector at approximately 17:27 and the inspector discussed the need for a backup person that could
be available to allow the unannounced inspections to occur and that this was a repeat attempted inspection.
