Facilities, general.
A section of fencing in the back corner of the enclosure housing two reindeer is in disrepair. The fence panel has
detached from the wooden framing and hangs into the enclosure, leaving a large gap that could allow the animals to
escape or become entangled. All outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
