PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the whelping building the floors of the enclosures are constructed of wire. There are two enclosures, housing a
total of two adult dogs and at least six puppies, which each have one puppy that was observed lying on the
enclosure floor and one leg of each puppy has completely passed through the openings of the floor. Openings in
flooring that are large enough for the leg of the animal to pass through can result in injury or entrapment.
Primary enclosures must have flooring that is constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and does not allow the dogs' feet or legs to pass through any openings. The licensee must alter this flooring
in a manner that does not allow the feet or legs of the puppies to pass through the openings. The licensee must
ensure that all primary enclosures are safe for the animals at all times.
Correction date: The licensee added a solid resting surface to one enclosure and returned the other puppy to its
whelping box at the time of the inspection.
Exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
