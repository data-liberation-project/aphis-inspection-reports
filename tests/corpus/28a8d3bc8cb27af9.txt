ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One plastic bottle containing flagyl pills had no expiration date recorded on the label. This medication was
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. This
medication was obtained from the attending veterinarian. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected
results could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated if the expiration date is unknown. The licensee
must ensure that all medications used in the facility are labeled with an expiration date.
******************************************

* There was one five ml container of Neomycin and Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Suspension that had an
expiration date of 05/2011. This medication was intermingled with other products that are currently being used at
the facility and are therefore ready for use. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results could be
drastically changed or may not work as anticipated if the medication is administrated past the recorded expiration
date. In addition, the usage of expired medications on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable
veterinary practice. The licensee must ensure that all medications used at the facility have not gone past the
recorded expiration date.
