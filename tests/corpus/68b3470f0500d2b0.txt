Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Approximately 5 goats and two llamas had varying degrees of overgrown hooves on all four limbs. The walls on each claw
had grown long enough to prevent standing or walking normally on the surface of the pad of the claw. Overgrown hooves
may increase stress on limbs with an abnormal gait, potentially leading to lameness, joint problems and alterations to
normal foraging and social behavior in the herd. Correct by creating and following a plan approved by your attending
veterinarian for routine hoof care for all hoof stock on the property.

Primary enclosures.


Two adult New Zealand rabbits are housed in a primary enclosure that is approximately 45in by 31in. Per regulations,
