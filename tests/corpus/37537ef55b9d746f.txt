ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the pig enclosure, there were at least four grower pigs (one spotted black and gray, one black with four light
feet, one black with white blaze on the nose and one black with white spot between the eyes) that were thin with
sunken in flanks and tucked back ends. The licensee stated that the pigs are dewormed once a month and that
they were last dewormed the middle of October. The licensee also stated that the pigs (33) are fed all together, two
bags of grain pellets, once a day. The attending veterinarian had not been contacted as the veterinarian was due to
conduct an inspection on 11/6/19.
The licensee attempted to contact the attending veterinarian during the inspection, yet the veterinarian was
unavailable prior to the end of the inspection. Contact was made on 11/6/19. The licensee must follow the
recommendations by the attending veterinarian for this condition. The licensee must also observe the animals daily
and ensure that accurate information concerning possible medical issues for all of the animals is relayed to the
attending veterinarian in a timely manner as required.
This inspection began at 1155.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
End of report.
