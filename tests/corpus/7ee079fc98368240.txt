FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. At the time of this inspection it was noted that the store front window housed rabbit, guinea pig and chinchilla
enclosures. The rabbits were allowed to exit their primary enclosures and roam about the store front window bay /
area. However, a shipment of 3 cardboard boxes and an unopened bag of shavings were being stored in this
window bay. That allowed the rabbits direct access to the boxes and bags.
2. When we moved the bag of shavings it was noted that there was a "live" electrical outlet on the floor. Again the
rabbits had direct access to this outlet.
3. There were also areas of damaged wallboard in this window bay. Facilities shall be structurally sound and shall
be maintained in good repair.
These issues will need to be addressed to ensure that the animals are protected from injury.
