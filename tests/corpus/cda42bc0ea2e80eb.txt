CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises.
There is an overgrowth of weeds and grasses inside and around the outdoor run on the south side of the sheltered
facility. Three adult American Eskimo dogs are currently using this enclosure. Many of weeds are taller than the
dogs. On the east side of the sheltered housing facility there is a large scrap metal pile. Old construction materials
and other discarded items have been piled up on the cement slab about six feet away from the building.
Accumulations of trash, junk, weeds and other discarded matter around the premise can provide a living/breeding
area for rodents and other pests. Keeping premises free of trash, junk, waste products, weeds and discarded matter
is necessary to ensure the health and well being of the dogs.

*The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 23, 2016.
