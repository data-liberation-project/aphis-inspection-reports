2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are 2 barrier fences at this facility. The first is constructed of panel fencing with a flat top rail and is 2 feet
from the primary enclosures. The 2nd barrier fence is a 2 rail pipe fence and is 4 feet from the enlcosures. There is
concern that small children can pass under the rail of the pipe fence and come within 2 feet of the primary
enclosures. The public has been observed allowing children to sit on the top board of the first barrier fence which is
close enough to allow contact with the animals. There must be sufficient distance and barriers between the animals
and the viewing public to assure the safety of the animals and the public. The barrier fence must be corrected to
prevent public contact with the animals.
