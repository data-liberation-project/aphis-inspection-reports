3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
In the sheep, goat, and alpaca enclosure, there are several areas of fencing in a state of disrepair. The owner is in the
process of installing new fencing, however, some of the old fencing lines and posts are still lying in the enclosure on the
ground. The new fence line that has been strung is not pulled tightly and is lying on the ground in several areas. There
are also several new posts and excess fencing wire on the ground in the pasture. During the inspection, facility
representatives were working in other areas of the facility and not actively installing the fencing material.
In the enclosure on the Nature Trail containing fourteen goats, one of the sliding doors, attached to the larger shelter, has
partially slide off the track and is hanging by one set of wheels.
Failure to maintain enclosure fencing and shelters can allow for gaps, unstable structures, or loose fencing wires which
can result in injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals.
Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
The owner has recently acquired ten calves which are contained in a pasture that does not have access to shelter. The
springtime weather in this region can be unpredictable with variable temperatures and weather events.


A lack of shelter could subject the calves to unfavorable climatic conditions which can affect the health of the animals and
create unnecessary discomfort.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the calves shall be provided for all animals
housed outside to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort.

Sanitation.
The enclosure housing five pigs has a large accumulation of feces. The outdoor area of the enclosure has approximately
2-3 inches of wet feces which the pigs have to walk through in order to access their water source.
Failure to remove accumulations of excreta from primary enclosures can allow for the spread of disease hazards, create
unpleasant odors, and attract pests.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals,
minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.
