Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:40pm on 24-MAR-
22.

I arrived at the facility at 1:40 pm. At 1:45, the licensee's wife arrived. She had another appointment and had to leave and
could not accompany the inspection. The licensee was at work and could not come to the facility.
