HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f) Drainage and waste disposal.
****
There is a drainage pipe from the elevated outdoor enclosures that discharges approximately 4 - 6 feet from and
enclosure housing 1 adult dog. This discharge contains fecal material, old bedding and other organic material.
There are a high number of flies present. This old bedding, fecal material and other material can attract pests and
rodents which could transmit diseases to the animals. The licensee must remove the old bedding, fecal material
and other organic material from the affected area and extend the drainage system so that it is far enough away from
the animal area of the housing facility to prevent odors, diseases, pests, and vermin infestation. The licensee must
develop and maintain a functioning system of waste removal so as the animals are not exposed to the affects of the
waste by pest, vermin or odors.
