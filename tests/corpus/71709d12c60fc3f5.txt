FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In trailer 18, the flooring panels have separated in one of the pens (last one on the left) creating a gap large enough
to cause injury to an animal that gets its foot caught in the gap. The animal in that pen (#667) has a mild abrasion
on a hind foot at the point where the nail meets the skin which could have been cause by the flooring.
Facilities must be maintained in a manner that prevents injuries to animals.
The flooring was repaired prior to the conclusion of the inspection. All similar housing should be checked to ensure
that there are no other flooring gaps.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
