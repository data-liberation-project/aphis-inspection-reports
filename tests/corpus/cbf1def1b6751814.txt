FEEDING.
***There were three out of four self feeders for three fox that had caked, molded feed in the corners of the feeders.
There was a spider in one of the feeders. The facility representative stated that it must be due to the recent rains.
Caked and molded feed increase the risk of illness to the animals from eating contaminated food and it can attract
pests. The licensee must remove molded food from the feeders and assure that all feed is free from contamination
as required.
To be corrected from this day, July 28, 2015 forward.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Bill Heine, ACI and Beverly
Hicks, ACI.
End of report.
