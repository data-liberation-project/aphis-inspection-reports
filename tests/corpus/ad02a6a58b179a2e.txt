3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
Enclosure # 10 housing 11 adult & 3 offspring guinea pigs and enclosure # 16 housing 11 adult and 4 offspring guinea
pigs had an excessive amount of feces and soiled bedding. The licensee stated that the enclosures are cleaned every two
weeks and were last cleaned on 10/9/21. The cleaning process (method & frequency) utilized is not effective in removing
this fecal accumulation and soiled bedding inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and frequency exposes the animals
to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often
enough to prevent an accumulation of feces and soiled bedding. In addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once
every 2 weeks. Correct by cleaning enclosures on a more frequent basis to avoid accumulations of feces and dirty/soiled
bedding. Correct by October 21, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
