ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility is not maintaining appropriate hoof care so as to prevent injuries. There are two alpacas that are in need
of hoof care. A brown female alpaca named 'Mite' and a white female named 'H-2' have overgrown hooves, some of
which have abnormally grown sideways. Overgrown hooves may cause the animals discomfort and lead to injuries.
The facility shall establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes adequate hoof care
and trimming when needed.
To correct by: December 19, 2014.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several areas of welded-wire material being used in the enclosure containing six hoofstock that are
mangled and broken apart with several sharp points. Wood fencing between the two silver livestock panels has
been chewed and is excessively damaged affecting the structure of the enclosure. The fencing material is not
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or to contain the animals. Failure to maintain housing
facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected structures must be repaired or
replaced and all housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound to protect and contain the
animals.
