ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) does not include provisions for heartworm prevention or testing for
dogs. Many of the dogs at this facility live exclusively outdoors in a heartworm endemic area. The licensee stated
that she administers Ivermectin for heartworm prevention however, the PVC does not list any products or dosages
for this purpose. The PVC should be updated at the direction of the attending veterinarian to accurately reflect the
current practices at this facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*Expired pharmaceuticals including atropine ophthalmic ointment (expiration date 2015) and prednisolone 5 mg
tablets (expiration date 2012) were co-mingled with unexpired medications on a shelf in the small breed dog room.
Expired drugs and products may lose their effectiveness and potency. The use of any expired products is not
consistent with adequate veterinary care. Expiring medicines and products should be identified and removed from
inventory as needed. This non-compliant item was corrected during the inspection by discarding the expired
products.
*The black female poodle "Gidget" and creme colored female papillon/poodle mix "Cleo" were noted to have
considerable matting on their backs and hind legs. Mats can cause discomfort to the dogs and trap moisture and
bacteria that can erode the skin integrity causing sores. To demonstrate adequate care and meet acceptable
husbandry standards dogs should be groomed with a frequency that will prevent mats. Mats should be removed
from from these dogs.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.The adult dogs on the premises have not been identified with an official tag, approved tattoo or microchip as
required of all Class "A" dealers. To ensure consistent and accurate identification of all dogs acquired and held on
the premises an official method of identification must be secured for each animal. An official tag as described in
section 2.51, a tattoo or microchip ( both options must be approved by APHIS) should be used to identify all adult
dogs.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outdoor run of pen #5 (left) housing small dogs has a compacted dirt surface that is eroded in one section and
buried fencing with sharp edges is exposed. The sharp edges could cause injury to the dogs if contact occurs.
Primary enclosures must be maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs. This
area of exposed fencing should be repaired.
