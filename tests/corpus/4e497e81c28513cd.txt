FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor, sheep enclosure did not provide sufficient shade to allow the sheep housed in this area to be
protected from direct sunlight. At time of this inspection, the sheep were seen gathering under one available shade
structure; however at least six of the sheep could not be comfortably provided with shade. Insufficient shade from
direct sunlight may cause overheating or discomfort of the animals. Sufficient shade by natural or artificial means
must be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
