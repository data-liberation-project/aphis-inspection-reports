2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has been given written guidance on how to treat foot problems by the attending veterinarian. The
licensee had four dogs that had foot care issues that had not been treated.
*** Adult female black and tan Yorkshire Terrier (0A01617845) had a pea-sized growth between the toes on its right
front paw. The growth was hard to the touch, but movable under the skin, and was dry with no discharge. The dog
was limping and holding the paw up.
*** Adult female white Bichon (0A01540045) had matting in between the pads on the foot and a pea-sized growth
between the toes on its left front paw. The growth was hard to the touch, but movable under the skin, and was dry
with no discharge. The dog pulled away and yelped as I was inspecting the paw. The dog was limping and holding
the paw up.
*** Adult male white Maltese (AVID 037365860) had spot about a quarter inch in diameter that was white in color
and scabbed over between the pads of the right front paw. The dog was limping and holding the paw up.
*** Adult female white Maltese (0A02514142) had a pea-sized growth between the toes on its right front paw. The
growth was hard to the touch, but movable under the skin, and was dry with no discharge. The dog was limping
and holding the paw up.
The growths between the toes were causing pain and discomfort to the dogs. The licensee must identify and treat
injuries according to the program of veterinary care. A licensed veterinarian must evaluate these animals for an
accurate diagnosis, and to develop a treatment plan. Documentation regarding diagnosis, treatment plan,
treatments given, and the resolution of the problem must be maintained and made available to inspectors upon
request.
The female white Maltese (AVID 026280633) cited under 2.40(b)(2) on March 2, 2016 was seen and treated by a
licensed veterinarian.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative and ACI Bartels.
