3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
Multiple enclosures housing non-human primates contain fixtures/objects that are in need of repair or replacement.
*One enclosure housing a capuchin female with infant has a damaged bamboo pole supporting a perch fixture. The perch
is slanting rather than horizontal.
*Two enclosures housing capuchins have a fabric hammock that is worn such that the center material is no longer
intact/has large holes and has thread like strings hanging from the damaged areas. One capuchin was noted playing with
the threads and putting them in its mouth.
*One capuchin enclosure contains a black plastic crate that has been chewed on its free edges such that pieces of plastic
are missing and sharp plastic points are protruding.
The worn fixtures/objects in the enclosure may lead to injury of the non-human primates and create a risk of ingestion of
foreign non-digestible materials.
All surfaces including the fixture/objects within the enclosure must be maintained on a regular basis and must be replaced
when worn or soiled. Correct by 3/27/21.
