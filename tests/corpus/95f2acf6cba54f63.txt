PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosures on the east end of the main building are beginning to deteriorate. The wire where the water enters is
becomming rusted and broken to the point that it could soon cause injury to the animals. The wooden frame is no
longer substantially impervious to moisture and could act as harborage for bacteria and disease. The enclosures
need to be repaired or replaced to assure the continued health and well being of the animals. Correct By: 21 March
