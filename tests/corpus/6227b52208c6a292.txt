HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility representative/owner of the property has not demonstrated adequate experience, knowledge and
training to maintain one adult cougar and two adult bears. The licensee lives about one hour away from the site and
will visit a minimum of once per week. When the licensee is not there, the owner of the property is the only
individual responsible for the daily husbandry of these animals and is the facility representative. The licensee stated
the facility representative is currently in training. When I asked the facility representative how much experience he
has with large carnivores, he told me he has been working with the licensee for about a month, but that was the
extent of his experience with large carnivores. When I asked him how does he clean the enclosure, he was unsure
how to. Failure to have adequate experience, knowledge and training in maintaining large carnivores increases the
risk of harm to the animals or to the public, if a potential escape occurs. The licensee must demonstrate the facility
representative has adequate experience and knowledge by submitting documentation detailing the experience,
knowledge, and training of the facility representative to the office located in Raleigh, NC for final approval.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although an
8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, there was a den box, approximately 4 foot tall, next to
the perimeter fence that had no preventives to stop an animal from climbing onto the den box and leaping over the
perimeter fence. The presence of the den box against the fencing effectively reduces the height of the perimeter
fence. A substantial perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required
for all outdoor housing facilities that contain potentially dangerous animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals
in the facility by ensuring in the event of an accidental escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to
prevent the animal from leaving the property and endangering public safety thereby placing the animal(cid:25)s life in
jeopardy. Correct by removing all material that is in close proximity to the perimeter fence that an animal can climb
onto or by extending the perimeter fence so there is an effective 8 feet in height fencing from the surface.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED FROM THIS SITE UNTIL THIS SITE IS APPROVED.The site inspection and exit interview were conducted by VMO Cody Yager and CS Patrick Keith with the licensee
and facility representative/property owner.
