3.53(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure housing male rabbit number 5 has a hole in the left corner of the wire floor. This hole, which is
approximately 2.5 inches across, has developed due to rust and urine, thus leaving protruding, sharp points
present. The opening, as well as the jagged, sharp edges, could cause injury to the rabbit housed therein.
The damaged flooring must be replaced to maintain structural strength and to protect the rabbit's feet and legs from
injury.
All enclosures floors should be assessed to determine if rust damage has begun.
CORRECTED AT TIME OF INSPECTION.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
