ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An approximately 4 1/2 year old male Yorkshire Terrier (#0A01640326) had the tip of his tongue hanging out and,
on closer observation, a dental condition was noted. The surface of some of the teeth appeared irregular and
jagged-like. A build-up of yellowish-brown to dark brown material covered much of the surface of the teeth. This
build-up was darker near the gums of the upper left canine tooth. The gums had receded along some of the teeth
and part of the root of the upper left canine tooth was visible. The gums also appeared reddened and inflamed over
some of the teeth. The abnormal build-up of material on this dog's teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and
tooth structures. The dental condition could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively
impact the overall health of the animal. The dog also had some generalized matting throughout the hair coat and
long toe nails. Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin sores. Long toe nails can increase
the risk of discomfort and injury. The licensee trimmed the dog's nails and began to clip out some of the mats
during the inspection. The licensee must ensure this dog is fully groomed and establish an appropriate grooming
schedule for all dogs. This animal had not been examined by a veterinarian for his current dental condition nor was
he under any treatment plan. The licensee must have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the
animals in the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
