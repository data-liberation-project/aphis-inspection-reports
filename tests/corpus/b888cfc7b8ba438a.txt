HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Chicken wire was wrapped around the exterior of the outdoor enclosure housing a Saki monkey. As viewed from the
front, at eye level, the chicken wire was rusted and deteriorated and a significant hole was visible. Sharp points of
wire were visible at the edges of the hole and could cause injury to the animal if he reached through the enclosure.
A second damaged area was noted at the rear of the enclosure.
Housing facilities for non-human primates must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. The damaged wire should be repaired or replaced.

3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
A male saki has been individually housed since January 2015 and unable to see or hear non human primates of the
same or compatible species. According to the facility primate enhancement program and as mandated by
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act special attention must be given to non-human primates housed under these
conditions.
The facility was unable to provide description either verbally or by documentation to indicate how special attention
has been given to this animal. Special considerations must be provided regarding enhancement of the environment
for individuals housed in this manner. The facility must develop, follow and document an appropriate plan for
environmental enhancements to promote the psychological well-being of all non-human primates housed at the
facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. * The top surface of a wooden resting bench in the off exhibit enclosure housing a clouded leopard was excessively
worn and damaged. One end of a wood panel was deteriorated enough that two screw heads were being elevated
and exposed. Continued erosion of the screws may allow sharp points to be accessible to the animals.
*The doorway of the giraffe barn leading to the outdoor exhibit has a metal frame that is damaged. The bottom of
the frame on the left side looking outside is excessively rusted and deteriorated with a resulting hole. Metal flashing
attached to the frame on the interior surface is bent and damaged. A section of metal frame on the exterior surface
edge has pulled away at the bottom. The body of a screw is now visible in this area that would normally remain
covered. Continued erosion could cause exposure of a sharp end of the screw.
Correct the above two items by: June 15, 2015.
*The countertop surface in the clinic surgery room is damaged. The edge of the countertop has pulled away with
resulting gaps. Part of this damaged area has been repaired with bandage tape. The floor adjacent to the drain in
the surgery room is damaged and missing pieces. The floor adjacent to the clinic entry is damaged and missing
pieces in multiple areas. Damaged surfaces and repairs with porous materials prevent sanitizing at a level that
would meet acceptable veterinary industry standards. The facility has initiated plans for renovation of the veterinary
clinic.
*The countertop surface in the kitchen is damaged and missing pieces. The painted wood cabinets are missing
paint in some areas and the bare wood was noticeably moist. Damaged and moisture soaked surfaces can facilitate
fungal and microbial growth and are unable to be properly cleaned. The facility targets groundbreaking of a new
commissary building next month.
Correct the above two items by: November 15, 2015.
Facilities must be maintained in good repair to maintain structural integrity, protect the animals from injury and
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices including those related to cleaning and sanitization. All the above should
be repaired or replaced.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the director, curator and APHIS personnel.
