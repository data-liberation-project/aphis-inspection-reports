2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the most eastern German Shepherd outdoor facility, there was an adult male German Shepherd (unidentified)
in the fourth enclosure that was limping on his right front leg. The facility representative stated that she had not
noticed the animal limping prior to the inspection. Limping is an indication of discomfort, pain, injury or disease and
increases the risks of further deterioration if not properly diagnosed and treated or if left unattended. The licensee
must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, follow the treatment plan and assure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care as required.
***There was an adult gray Poodle with excessive wads of matted hair around the nose and mouth. The hair was
discolored, indicating containment of dirt and debris. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort to the animal. In
addition, matting can create or worsen skin infections and can hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate
normally. Matted hair does not provide appropriate insulation for the animals. The licensee must remove the matted
hair from this animal and assure that adequate veterinary care is provided to all of the animals as required.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (3) Cleaning.
***In the outdoor facility, the housing units had gravel, dirt and debris in them. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential
for a healthy environment and reduces disease hazards by eliminating harboring places for diseases and pests. The
licensee must remove the gravel, dirt and debris from the housing units and assure that all areas of the facility are
cleaned and sanitized as required.
To be corrected by January 27, 2015.
3.1
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces (1) General requirements (i) Be free of excessive rust***At the east end of the most eastern German Shepherd outdoor facility, there was an enclosure housing two adult
German Shepherds that had rust along the bottom of the metal. There was a section approximately 12" long and 1
1/2" wide that was rusted completely through, leaving a hole with sharp edges. Excessive rust cannot be cleaned
and sanitized as required. It increases the risk for disease by creating a harboring place, can cause sharp edges
that can injure the animals and can cause damage to the structural strength of the enclosure. The licensee must
repair this area and assure that the enclosures are free of excessive rust as required.
To be corrected by January 27, 2015.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements. (4) Contain clean, dry, bedding material.
***In the out door enclosures, the housing units had a carpet rug on the floors. The facility representative stated that
shavings are put into the housing units when it is cold. The temperature was 41 degrees F during the time of
inspection. Lack of appropriate bedding in cold environments increases the risks of illness and hypothermic
situations to the animals. The licensee must apply an appropriate amount of bedding when temperatures are below
50 degrees F and assure that bedding is provided as required.
To be corrected from January 20, 2015 forward.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements. (2) Primary enclosures (i) Have no sharp points
***In the outdoor enclosures, there was one enclosure that was constructed out of 2"x4" horse panels that contained
three adult dogs. There was a hole in one of these panels where the self feeder used to be. The bottom of this hole
had parts of the wires protruding upward causing sharp points. Sharp edges create a potential injury for the animals
within the enclosure.
The licensee must remove the sharp edges and assure that there are no sharp points or edges in the primary
enclosures as required.
To be corrected by January 27, 2015.
This inspection began at 1001.
The inspection and the exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
***The female West Highland Terrier, Maltipoo #0A02142477, female German Shepherd, young female German
Shepherd and male German Shepherd from the August 4, 2014 report were evaluated by a licensed veterinarian
and their conditions have improved. End of report.
