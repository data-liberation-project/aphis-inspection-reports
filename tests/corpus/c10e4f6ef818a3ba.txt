2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Although the caretakers are noting medical issues with the dogs, the follow-ups with the Attending Veterinarian
(who is the owner of the dogs) is not always adequate for some surgical needs.
A 7 year old female beagle has a multi-nodular ulcerated mass one to two inches across in in her left rear mammary
gland. The caretaker noted a mass on 5-9-17, then there are no notations until 7-4-17 where the notes state she is
a surgical candidate.
A 11 year old male beagle has a large (almost one inch long) red nodular mass on its anal tissue. The caretaker’s
notes state this dog was noted as a surgical candidate on 5-15-17 as there was light bleeding from the mass. Then
on 7-10-17, the notes stated again there is a mass and the dog is a surgical candidate.
Both dogs are in good flesh with no other obvious health issues.
Generally, the caretaker will make a list of animals needing evaluation by the veterinarian, and have them all
examined on one visit, and then a surgical day scheduled. There is no set schedule for veterinary visits, but it is on
an as needed basis.
After masses are noted, the Attending Veterinarian needs to be notified, an exam scheduled, and a plan for
treatment made. If surgery is not to be planned until some future point, that needs to be explained and
documented. These animals and any others needing evaluation need to be seen by the veterinarian and a
treatment plan initiated. To be corrected by 7-28-17.
2.131(e)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Although the beagles are acclimated to this area’s climate, most of the dogs in the larger kennel are panting today
around noon. The ambient temperature was around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. In the middle of this kennel aisle way
at the level of the dogs, the temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, 50-56 % humidity, and a heat index of 115
degrees Fahrenheit. Although the manager installed a small circular exhaust fan at the top end of one eave last
summer, it apparently is only moving the hot air for a distance of three runs. Because the heat is being trapped inthis area and leading to uncomfortable temperatures for the dogs, more air movement is needed to try and bring the
temperatures down to a more comfortable level.
To be corrected 7-24-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the caretakers.
