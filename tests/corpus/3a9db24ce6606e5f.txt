ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1140 on
09-FEB-17. VMO Welch and I went to the campground and couldn't locate the licensee. I contacted the licensee
by the phone and left a message. The licensee called me back a few minutes later. He informed me he is out of
town and not available for an inspection. I informed him we would try back another time.
End of report.
Additional Inspectors
Welch Scott, Veterinary Medical Officer
