2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:55 AM on
05-Sep-19.
Stopped near the animal housing facility at 10:55 AM and called the licensee. Texted the licensee. Waited 50
minutes. Drove to the licensees residence and arrived at 12:17 PM. The front gate was secured so I yelled hello
twice. I went back to my vehicle and honked my horn twice. No one came out of the house.
