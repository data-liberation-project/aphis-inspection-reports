ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Employees have identified various animals with conditions that needed veterinarian treatment by labeling their
enclosures; however WKA-3 (enclosure 401) had a hairless, red swollen lesion on the top of its right hind paw and
its enclosure was not labeled to indicate this condition. The last notation in its medical card was 3/17/16 and does
not appear to be related to this active lesion. The facility must ensure that thorough daily observations are
completed and animals' conditions are communicated promptly to the attending veterinarian for initiation of any
needed treatment.
Note: During inspection, the facility took action to ensure the affected animal receives veterinarian-directed
treatment.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
