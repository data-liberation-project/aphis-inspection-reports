Facilities, outdoor.
There are three enclosures housing two red foxes, two bobcats, and two armadillos that are not contained within a 6ft
perimeter fence. A perimeter fence must be strong and tall enough to prevent unauthorized people and animals, and to
act as a secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Correct by
maintaining a perimeter fence around the three enclosures that is at least 6 feet tall and 3 feet away from the primary
enclosures, or by obtaining a written approval by the Administrator. Correct prior to the next relicense inspection.

This is a 1stRe-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 9, 2023, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
