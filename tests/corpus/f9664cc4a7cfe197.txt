2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
1. In June 2014 husbandry staff unexpectedly found 5 Peromyscus mice deceased in their primary enclosures and
immediately contacted the IACUC and Attending Veterinarian (AV). Upon being notified and in response to this
information, the IACUC and AV immediately looked into the incident and determined that laboratory staff failed to
perform the daily observations over the weekend as required per the research facility's standard operating
procedures (SOPs) and as a result, the animals died.

Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of animals by all personnel, including laboratory staff, should be done
as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm, behavioral stress, or unnecessary
discomfort.
The IACUC and AV at the institution promptly acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and swiftly
implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions included, but were
not limited to, updating and expanding the SOPs related to animal care and husbandry and re-training of the
laboratory staff on the updated SOPs. No additional incidents have occurred.
Item has been corrected by the research facility.
NOTE - Exit interview held 6/10/15 on-site with facility representatives. Report delivered by e-mail 6/15/15.
