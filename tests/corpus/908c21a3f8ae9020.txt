FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a forty foot section of Tapir outdoor enclosure fencing (with an exhibit access gate) along the service road
which is made up of multiple layers of fencing material. Pieces of welded wire panels have been added to the top
of the cyclone fencing to prevent the escape of the two tapirs housed in this area. Several of the metal fence and
gate posts have areas where metal brackets/metal plates have been welded on and some of the welds are broken.
The area of the fence closest to the exhibit access gate is leaning inward and animals could potentially be injured or
escape. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: June 30, 2015.
There is a sixteen foot section of Tapir indoor enclosure fencing (with an attached gate) that is constructed of hollow
metal pipe panels. There are multiple areas of excessive rust on these fence panels, located primarily at welded
joints, where the rust is deteriorating the thickness of the pipe. These rusted areas could potentially affect the
structural strength of the indoor tapir fence and fail to contain the two animals housed inside the building. Indoor
housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. To be corrected by: June 30, 2015.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a twenty foot section of zoo perimeter fence near the "Father Yermo" gate which has several broken
bottom rails and can be pulled/pushed inwards about 12" at ground level. Animals (such as dogs) could go under
the perimeter fence at this location and potentially come in contact with zoo animals. There is also a pile of
construction debris, tree limbs, and dirt in this same area which is in close proximity to the perimeter fence so that it
can no longer function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the zoo. The perimeter fence must be
constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals from going under it and having contact
with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility. To be corrected by: June 30, 2015.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
