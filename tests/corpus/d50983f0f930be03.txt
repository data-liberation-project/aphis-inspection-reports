TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(d) unweaned puppies or kittens need not be individually identified as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
section while they are maintained as a litter with their dam in the same primary enclosure, provided the dam has
been individually identified.
Two litters of unweaned puppies with their dam were not identified by a cage card. The cage card should contain
the facility USDA license number as well as the USDA number of the dam and the assigned USDA number, sex,
and date of birth of each puppy in the litter.
To be corrected by Oct. 20th and on all forthcoming litters.
