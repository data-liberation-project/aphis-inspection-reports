CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
The food and water certificate attached to the top of the primary enclosure was not completed for a 6 year old dog
shipped from LAX to PHL (see waybill 016-LAX 48070186). Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a
dog or cat for transport in commerce unless the consignor certifies in writing to the carrier or intermediate handler
that the dog or cat was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the carrier or intermediate
handler. The certification must include the time and date the animal was last fed and watered and the specific
instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for a 24-hour period. Failure to complete the food and water
certificate could affect the heath and well-being of the animal being transported. Carriers and intermediate handlers
must not accept a dog or cat for transport unless the food and water certificate is completed and attached to the
outside of the primary enclosure.
An exit interview was conducted with airline representative.
