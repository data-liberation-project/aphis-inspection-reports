2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The reports to the Institutional Official (IO) containing the findings of the semiannual program review (SAPR) from
June 2013 and December 2013 identified a recurrent minor deficiency with no detailed explanation of the issue, no
plan to correct the issue, and no schedule as to when the correction should be completed. These findings and plans
for corrections need to be communicated with the IO, especially in the instance of recurrent deficiencies, even if
minor, so that the IO can use his/her authority and resources to take corrective action so these recurrent
deficiencies are prevented in the future.
The reports also contained a statement that the IACUC members were reminded of their option to submit minority
views; however, there is no section containing any of these minority views and there was no statement that none
were submitted. A complete and accurate report (including all required information) of the semiannual inspections
to the IO is necessary to ensure that the IO has knowledge of the nature and extent of the facility's adherence to the
AWA and regulations.
To be corrected by: from this day forward.
Exit interview conducted with undersigned Attending Veterinarian and other facility representatives.
