2.126(c)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee has exhibited animals and stayed overnight in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. The licensee did not
send an itinerary to the office for any of these exhibits.
Any person who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at any location
other than the person's approved site (including, but not limited to, circuses, traveling educational exhibits, animal
acts, and petting zoos), except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a written itinerary to the AC
Regional Director.
A written itinerary shall be sent to and received by the AC Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel and
shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition
at any location other than the person's approved site. This is to be completed so that an inspection can be
completed on the facility in travel status and so that the inspector does not attempt an inspection of the home facility
when the licensee is no there.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This was a focused inspection at the home site due to the lack of itineraries from 3 separate animal exhibitions.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
