3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On November 4, 2021, a rhesus macaque sustained severe injuries from another rhesus macaque in an adjoining
enclosure. According to facility documents, an Animal Care Technician identified the injured macaque during routine
husbandry duties. The Animal Care Technician immediately notified the LAR Veterinarian. Due to the nature of the
injures, the macaque was provided veterinary care by the LAR Veterinarian.

At the time of evaluating the incident, facility personnel noted that the chain used to secure the divider separating the
enclosures was no longer in place and the lock used to secure the chain was open. Additionally, further evaluation in the
incident noted that a cage change had been done the day prior. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained
to prevent accidental opening of any part of the enclosure to protect non-human primates from injury.

The facility had implemented corrective actions before the time of inspection
3.82(b)

Feeding.


On May 28, 2022, a room of 52 rhesus macaques were not fed. On May 29, 2022, it was discovered by Animal Care staff
that this room of macaques did not receive their ration of monkey biscuits the day before and the animals were
immediately fed. The Veterinarian reviewed and observed the rhesus macaques on May 30th and determined that all the
macaques were in good health.

Non-human primates must be fed at least once each day to meet their normal daily nutritional requirements and to
maintain their overall health.

The facility had implemented corrective actions before the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conducted August 17, 2022 to August 18, 2022.
