HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ceiling in the rhinoceros building is deteriorating in places. The Cotton-top Tamarin enclosure is located in this
building. Pieces of ceiling/insulation have fallen and were observed caught on the top of the Tamarin enclosure,
within reach of the animals. Loose pieces of insulation within reach of or in contact with the animals can be
detrimental to their health and well-being. Foreign objects in enclosures could lead to toxicity exposure or various
gastrointestinal illnesses and/or injuries if ingested. The facility must ensure that housing facilities for nonhuman
primates be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates
housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. This was
corrected at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and Justine O'Malley, VMO.
