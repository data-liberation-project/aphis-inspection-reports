FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several metal panels held in place by string on the open side of the llama hay storage building. These
metal panels are not securely fastened to the hay storage building in order to function as doors. The metal panels
must be attached to the hay storage building in a manner which adequately protects the food stored inside from
deterioration, molding, or contamination. To be corrected by: November 13, 2015.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A section of the zoo perimeter fence, the east gate (downstream) over the spring river, has separated from the
posts on both sides, allowing it to swing freely. This has created a gap of approximately 2 feet on the north side of
the river and a gap of approximately 4 feet on the south side of the river. Animals (such as dogs) could go through
the gaps in the perimeter fence at this location and potentially come in contact with zoo animals. The perimeter
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals from going through
gaps and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment
system for the animals in the facility. To be corrected by: November 13, 2015.
