2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-Two female dogs were observed to be very thin. This included an approximately 5 1/2 year old female Boxer "Lily"
(#0A02082504) and a female Miniature Pinscher "Layla" which was approximately 10 months old according to the
licensee. Both dogs had obvious visible waists and abdominal tucks. The tops of their lumbar vertebrae were visible
and the pelvic bones were becoming prominent. "Lily" was housed with another adult Boxer and "Layla" was
housed with 4 other Miniature Pinschers. Both dogs were active and, according to a facility representative, the dogs
had been co-housed with other dogs for at least two weeks. The licensee and facility representative mentioned that
they had noticed the dogs were getting thin and thought the dogs may be getting "bullied" by another dog in each
enclosure over the food. They also said that they would go into the enclosure to separate the dogs during their daily
feeding; however, the dogs were still housed with the other dog(s) and they were still thin. A veterinarian had not
been contacted about these dogs' ongoing body conditions. A thin body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate
nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian
regarding the body conditions of both of these dogs. This veterinary consultation is in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-There were various surfaces within most of the enclosures that had roughened and/or jagged edges which
appeared to have been chewed on. Most of the enclosures contained water receptacles and/or food receptacles
that had these roughened and/or jagged edges. There were also chewed edges on the flaps of some shelter units
within outdoor enclosures. There were at least two shelter units that had edges around their entrances that had
been chewed on. A buildup of dirt was observed within some of the grooves of the roughened surfaces; also hair
was observed in some of the edges. These roughened and grooved surfaces may not allow for adequate cleaning
and sanitization increasing the risk of disease hazards. The jagged edges may also increase the risk of injury to the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces allow for them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or
replaced when worn or soiled to meet the requirements set forth in this regulation at all times.To be corrected by:

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Within one of the sheltered buildings, there was a large open bag of dry dog food. There was a small amount of
food in the bottom of the bag which was sitting on top of a container in the aisle way next to an enclosure housing
dogs. The open bag of food increases the risk of the kibble becoming contaminated and can also attract pests that
can increase the risk of disease hazards in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all open supplies of food and
bedding are kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitted lids in order to prevent contamination and spoilage at all
times. To be corrected by March 29, 2018.
3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-On the ground, directly adjacent to an outdoor section of an enclosure housing Pomeranians, there was an
accumulation of waste, including feces, hair and other material such as leaves. This accumulation of waste material
next to the dogs' enclosure increases the risk of pests, odors and other disease hazards. The licensee must
establish and maintain a program that provides for the regular and frequent removal of animal and food waste,
water and debris from the kennel area to protect the dogs from pests, odors and other disease hazards at all times.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
-Within an outdoor enclosure housing 5 adult Cocker Spaniels there were two shelter units without adequate
wind/rain breaks at their entrance. The entrances to these shelters were not off set and had no flaps or doors.
According to a facility representative the dogs had taken off the door flaps from the shelter units. The dogs need
effective wind and rain breaks on their outdoor shelter units to protect them from the elements and help keep them
dry. The applicant must provide adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrances of all the outdoor shelter units at all
times. To be corrected by: March 29, 2018
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
-There was an enclosure housing five adult Cocker Spaniels with two shelters units; one contained no bedding
material and the other contained only a very small amount mostly located in one corner of the shelter unit with most
of its bare floor showing. According to the National Weather Service, the overnight temperatures for the region the
night prior to inspection had dropped into the mid 30 degrees Fahrenheit; during the day prior to inspection the high
was only 54 degrees Fahrenheit. When asked about the last time bedding had been added to the shelters, the
facility representative said it was probably around the last week in February.
-An outdoor enclosure housing adult Saint Bernards had a shelter unit with bedding, however, the straw was heavilymatted down and appeared discolored as well as having an accumulation of debris, such as hair, and fecal material.
Clean, dry bedding is necessary for protection from the cold. Cold temperatures can cause stress, discomfort and
make dogs more susceptible to illness. Clean, dry bedding must be provided when the temperature is below 50F
degrees. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35F degree or lower. To be corrected
by: this point forward on March 22, 2018 which was discussed with the facility representative during the inspection.
3.11(a) DIRECT REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-There were at least 16 enclosures throughout the facility housing dogs that contained greater than a day's worth of
feces. Some of the enclosures were in the outdoor facility and others were in the indoor and/or outdoor portion of a
sheltered building. One enclosure within a sheltered building housing five Miniature Pinschers had a heavy
accumulation of mashed and caked fecal material as well as dirt and grime covering most of the entire flooring of
the indoor portion of their enclosure; there was not enough room for all of the dogs to occupy the indoor portion of
the enclosure without walking, standing, sitting or laying in this material. There were additional enclosures that
contained enough feces that the dogs were walking through it to maneuver through the enclosure. There were feces
that had been mashed and dried into the floors of many of the enclosures. Also, some of the feces had hair
embedded into the dried feces and some had mold-like discoloration observed on the feces. When asked how often
these enclosures were cleaned, the facility representative stated for many of them that they were last cleaned on
Saturday but for some it was every other day. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease hazards
and create an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is removed
from the primary enclosures daily as required.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-There were various hard surfaces in contact with the dogs that had a build-up of dirt and grime. Some of the
enclosures within the sheltered buildings housing adult dogs and/or puppies had a build up of dirt and grime on the
floors, walls and/or access doors. The inside of at least 2 shelter units for dogs inside outdoor enclosures had dirt
and grime on their walls. There were at least 2 food receptacles with a build-up of grime as well. At least two water
receptacles contained a light to dark green algae-like material on the inside surfaces of the receptacles. Some of
the flaps on the shelter units for outdoor enclosures also had a build-up of dirt and grime on them. According to a
facility representative, the door flap for at least one enclosure was last cleaned in the Fall. The build up of dirt and
grime can increase the risk of disease hazards in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures and
food and water receptacles are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards. To be corrected by: March 29, 2018.3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-There were at least 10 empty discarded bags of dog food that had been thrown into an unoccupied outdoor
enclosure that was located near the center of the outdoor facility and near two occupied dog enclosures. These
empty bags were strewn sporadically throughout the enclosure. These empty bags of dog food increase the risk of
harboring places for pests as well as increase the risk of contact between pests and the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that the premises are kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products and discarded matter to
protect the health and well-being of the animals at all times.
-The inspection and a preliminary exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative on
March 22, 2018. An exit interview was completed with the licensee on March 23, 2018.
