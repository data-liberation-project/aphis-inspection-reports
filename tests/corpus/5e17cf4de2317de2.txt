FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, housing two African Warthogs, two metal electric fence posts are no longer standing vertically
upright, but are leaning over at an extreme angle. The ends of the metal fence posts are now at the same level as
the heads of the warthogs. There is also a large piece of green colored metal lying on the ground in the enclosure.
Contact with the piece of metal could cause injury to the animals' feet and legs and the angle at which the electric
fence posts are leaning could cause injury to the animals' face and eyes should they inadvertently run into them.

The housing facility must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The licensee must remove the large piece of metal from the enclosure and either remove or alter the electric fence
posts in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the warthogs.

In one enclosure containing at least two groundhogs, a blue tarp had been covering the top of the enclosure, but the
tarp has now been shredded and spread throughout the enclosure. The potential consumption of the blue tarp could
have a negative impact on the groundhogs' health and well-being.
At least four enclosures, containing a total of two groundhogs, two bobcats, two badgers, and a porcupine, have a
floor constructed of welded metal rod fencing that will stop the animals from digging out of the enclosure. Substrate
such as dirt has been laid across the top of the fencing, but the animals have completely excavated the substrate
from areas of the flooring causing the metal rod fencing to be exposed. The dirt beneath the exposed fencing has
also been dug out and the animals' feet and legs can now pass through the openings in the floor fencing. Openings
in the flooring that allow animals' feet and legs to pass through could result in injury to the animals.
The housing facility must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The licensee must remove the shredded tarp from the groundhog enclosure and alter the exposed flooring fence in
all the affected enclosures in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the animals.To be corrected by: October 19, 2020
