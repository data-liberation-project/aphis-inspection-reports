3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On January 4, 2022 two Sika deer and two Tur goats were found dead in their primary enclosure held off exhibit. After
reviewing the animal count for this enclosure, ten Fallow deer had also escaped. The deceased animals had wounds
consistent with bite marks from an unknown predator. While the fence appeared intact, the facility suspects a predator
was able to enter the enclosure, attacking the animals and startling the Fallow deer to the point they escaped from the
enclosure. Per the licensee, subsequent areas of the fence line may have loosened after repair from a tree falling on the
fence, permitting the deer to jump over the top. Following this incident, the facility has made widespread improvements to
strengthen and enhance the enclosure.

Enclosures must be maintained in good repair to ensure safety and prevent access by wild animals that may harm the
animals housed. Outdoor housing facilities must be constructed and maintained such that they protect the animals from
injury and contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
