2.33(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Rabbit number 254 has a head tilt. The facility could not produce any records showing the animal had been seen
by the attending veterinarian or received treatment. Failure to provide veterinary care to the rabbits could lead to
unnecessary pain and discomfort. A system should be in place to ensure that rabbits needing medical attention are
evaluated by a qualified veterinarian in a timely manner and records documenting any treatments are maintained.
