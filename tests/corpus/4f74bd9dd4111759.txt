ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230 on
29-Jan-20.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door and rang the doorbell. I also honked my horn. I called the
contact number provided and left a message. I then waited in the driveway for 30 minutes and departed.
