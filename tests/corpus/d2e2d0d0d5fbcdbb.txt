Facilities, general.
Some structures providing shelter for the animals are in disrepair and do not adequately protect the animals from injury.
*** In the Zebu pasture there is a shelter with torn and bent metal siding. The left wall of the shelter is comprised of four
metal panels attached to the underlying wood supports. The lower front panel has a large hole about 2-3' wide with sharp
metal edges bent in multiple different directions. The lower back panel has a smaller hole, about 2-4" wide with sharp,
bent edges.
*** The pig shelter has a piece of metal fencing closing off the back wall with two sharp edges of metal protruding towards
the interior of the shelter. Additionally, there is an old blanket with chewed/frayed edges hanging on the front door of the
shelter within easy access of the grazing sheep and goats that are housed around the building.


Structures/shelters in disrepair with sharp metal edges can cause injury or harm to the animals. Fabric that has exposed
threads and has been chewed/torn can lead to ingestion and disease or illness in the animals.

from injury, and contain the animals.
