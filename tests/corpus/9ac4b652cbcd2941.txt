FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal: A middle row of empty pens and the southeast corner inside the animal building has trash, soiled
bedding, and other waste on top of them and inside them. This waste provides possible areas for rodents/pests to
live and increases disease hazards for the animals. The soiled bedding causes strong ammonia odors in the
building which can make animals sick. Ensure that trash, waste and soiled bedding is removed promptly away from
animal housing areas to decrease risk of vermin/pest infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
