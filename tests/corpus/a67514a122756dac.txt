2.134(a)(2)

Contingency planning.
The current contingency plan as written identifies the situations the registrant considers potential contingencies and the
items/resources carried during transport to help with emergency response. However, it lacks a description of the specific
tasks required to be carried out in response to the identified emergencies/disasters. Tasks considered should include
items such as detailed evacuation or shelter in vehicle instructions and provisions for feeding, watering, ventilation,
bedding and veterinary care during the emergency. Having a plan in place which includes the details of the tasks to be
carried out will help ensure the good health and well-being of the animals in the transporter's possession during an
emergency. The facility shall, in their written contingency plan, outline the specific tasks required to be carried out in
response to the identified emergencies. Correct by 2/7/23.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
