-(cid:9) At the time of the inspection there was an 11 year old black female pug aka "Mattie" microchip number
0A02173973 that had bilateral ocular discharge and an abnormal gait. The facility representative stated she had not
noticed her eyes or the abnormal gait. Mattie knuckled over on her left front foot when she walked. She also had
bilateral ocular discharge. Her left eye appeared enlarged and the hair below the eye was caked with crusty
material. The discharge from both eyes was yellow to green in color and thick in appearance. Gait abnormalities can
be painful, may be due to underlying medical conditions and affect the health and well-being of this animal. Eye
discharge can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful.

-(cid:9)At the time of the inspection a female Japanese chin aka "Yoshi" microchip number 087817520 had a 2 week old
puppy nursing and had an excessive buildup of a dark brown material on the teeth extending up into the gum line.
Most of the teeth could not be visualized. The gums were swollen and reddened. There was a yellow creamy
material along the gum line near one of the large cheek teeth on the right side (the large molar tooth). The buildup
of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat
normally, and harm the health of the animal.

-(cid:9)At the time of the inspection an 11 year old female Yorkshire terrier aka "Susie" microchip number 064027313 had
most of her teeth removed prior to the inspection and her tongue protrudes out of her mouth. However, there was
an excessive buildup of a dark brown material on the remaining teeth extending up to the gum line on the left rear
lower molar. The gums in this area were reddened and swollen. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a
discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the
animal.

WATERING.
- There were three of four water receptacles that had an algae looking substance in them in the main kennel
building north of the house. The receptacles are located in the indoor portion of the enclosures. There are
approximately 20 dogs drinking from these receptacles. The licensee stated that these receptacles were cleaned
every 4 to 6 weeks. Contaminated water is no longer considered to be safe for the dog to drink and could lead to
potential health risks. Algae and particulate material present indicates the lack of cleaning and sanitization which
can prevent the water from becoming contaminated. The licensee must ensure all water receptacles are cleaned
and sanitized once every two weeks or more often if needed for the health and well-being of the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- At the time of the inspection there were rodent droppings accumulating on the floor concentrated around the
edges in the vinyl building and as well as on the floor around the fed bin in the food storage building. Lack of an
effective program that controls rodents can create unsanitary conditions and lead to potential spread of disease.
There weren't any bait, traps, or other means to control or eliminate the rodents in these areas. The licensee must
establish an effective program of rodent control and ensure all rodent droppings are removed from the kennel area
for the health and well-being of the dogs.
