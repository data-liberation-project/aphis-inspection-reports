RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records for the acquisition of the prairie dogs were not kept and are not available. Records of Acquisition,
Disposition, and Transport of animals are important so that the animals can be traced back at during times of
disease outbreak and to monitor animal shipments in commerce. These forms of Acquisition, Disposition, and
Transport of animals other than dogs and cats (APHIS FORMS 7020) should be filled out and available to APHIS
Inspectors at times of request.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Upon time of inspection, a rabbit was housed inside the gift shop and had free range of the building. With free range
housing, the rabbit is exposed to a risk of injury, predators and escaping from the facility. The rabbit must be
maintained in structurally sound enclosure to prevent these risks.

The cages that kept feeder rabbits had broken wire exposed on the floor of the enclosure. The cage needs to be
structurally sound and in good repair to prevent injury. The wires must be removed and replaced in the feeder rabbit
cages.

bacteria and other infectious agents if not cleaned weekly. The pans must be replaced and cleaned at least once a
week to be sanitary. Correct by: October 7, 2014
3.56(c)
SANITATION.
There were a number of metal sheets rusted and no longer useable adjacent to the cages of the feeder rabbits.

3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Three prairie dogs were kept in a flexi-glass enclosure. There were two rows of holes (approximately 1 cm in
diameter) drilled into each side of the glass for ventilation. The holes are not adequate for proper ventilation and
exchange of air for the prairie dogs. More holes must be drilled into the enclosure to provide the animals with fresh
air.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter inside the fox enclosure (a log from a fallen tree) was not adequate for the number of animals in the
exhibit (three). The shelter provided should be appropriate for house all animals comfortably and protect them from
local climate conditions. A larger shelter must be placed in the enclosure to accommodate all three foxes at the
same time.
Correct by: October 14, 2014
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The outside enclosure for three foxes was heavily soiled with excreta and other material. The surface of the
enclosure were made of wood and made it hard to remove the excreta. Excreta must be removed as necessary to
prevent contamination and serious health concerns. The fox enclosure must be cleaned when necessary and a
material should be used to prevent accumulation of waste.
