Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A significant modification was made to a protocol without submitting it to the IACUC for review and approval. Protocol 21-
002 states that mice will have their health assessed by body condition scoring, weights, and visual observation. Body
condition scores are utilized as a humane endpoint in the study. Inspectors requested body condition score records for
the mice currently on protocol, but the PI was unable to provide any records because he did not conduct body condition
scoring. Making changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC to perform
adequate oversight into the use of animals for medical research. Correct by May 20, 2022 by allowing the IACUC to
review and either approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the
care and use of animals in ongoing activities.
2.31(d)(1)(vii) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A mouse was on a study, did not receive veterinary care, and ultimately succumbed without the benefit of a veterinarian
intervention. Protocol 21-002 discusses potential adverse events to animals on study, one of which is mice showing signs
of discomfort and pain such as hunching over, dehydration, unkept coat, and malaise. If there are any signs of undue pain
and discomfort in the animals, the protocol states the animal will be humanely euthanized. On May 4, 2022, at 10:45 AM,


the vivarium staff noticed one mouse currently on Protocol 21-002 that appeared hunched, lethargic, and dehydrated with
a sunken abdomen, squinting eyes, increased respiratory effort, and a rough hair coat. A mass was observed between
the left front and thoracic area. The PI and AV were both notified via email regarding the findings. At 11:00 AM, the
veterinary technician went to evaluate the mouse and confirmed the earlier findings, recommending euthanasia as soon
as possible. Although hydrogel and wet food were placed on the floor of the cage, no veterinarian provided a treatment
plan or medical care. An additional email was sent to the PI and AV at 11:19 AM informing them of the veterinary
technician’s evaluation and seeking approval for euthanasia. The PI responded at 11:42 AM to the veterinary technician,
approving euthanasia for the mouse. The email was not received by the veterinary technician until 12:48 PM. According to
the room logs, the veterinary technician returned to the mouse’s enclosure at 1:00 PM, to euthanize the mouse. However,
the mouse was found deceased.
Failing to provide medical care for animals on a study resulted in a mouse that endured undue stress and pain for over
two hours without veterinarian intervention.
Correct by May 20, 2022 by ensuring that animal care staff follow the IACUC approved written protocol by providing
medical care for animals by a qualified veterinarian.
2.33(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
At the time of the inspection, dairy cow number 4807 was in the sick pen. According to daily observation logs, the animal’s
feed intake first dropped on May 13, 2022 and continued for several days until she completely stopped eating on May 16,
2022. The facility did not contact a veterinarian until May 17, 2022. The animal caretaker told the inspector, earlier that
day he determined the cow has a left displaced abomasum, prompting him to call the veterinarian. According to facility
SOP "Dairy Unit 2021 Treatments", any cows that show signs of reduced feed intake should receive 8 gallons of water,
1/2 gallon of mineral oil, and 6 Maglax boluses for three days. However, after speaking with the animal caretaker and


reviewing daily medical logs, the cow did not receive the treatments listed out in the SOP and no veterinarian was
consulted until the cow had experienced 5 days of clinical signs. Following attending veterinarian approved SOPs or
consulting with the attending veterinarian for animal diseases or illnesses is critical to provide appropriate treatment and
avoid unnecessary pain and suffering. Correct by May 20, 2022 by ensuring the program of veterinary care includes the
appropriate methods to diagnose and treat diseases and is followed by all animal care staff.
2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Animals with illness or signs of disease are not being detected by animal care staff during daily observations.
- Inspectors found a calf with a golf ball-sized swelling on the lower left jaw. According to logs, daily observations had
already been performed by facility employees prior to the inspectors observing this calf. The swelling was not noticed or
documented by the facility.
- Inspectors found approximately 7% of chickens in the acclimation stage of a protocol with soft feces, fecal staining and
reddened and inflamed skin surrounding their cloacae. Additionally, one bird showed clinical signs of depression with
squinting eyes and reluctance to move. According to logs, daily observations had already been performed by facility
employees and no abnormalities were noted. Due to these chickens being in the acclimation phase of the study, GI
disruptions would not be expected. Veterinary intervention had not been provided by facility employees prior to
observations by inspectors.
Daily observations are necessary for the detection of illness or conditions that may require veterinary care. Correct by
May 20, 2022 by ensuring facility employees are performing adequate daily observations and recognize signs of illness,
injury or disease in animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with .facility representatives.
