2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One black and white adult Lhasa Poo ( microchip number 105 123 015 ) has matted hair on the back, abdomen
and on all four legs, covering approximately 60 percent of the body. In addition, one black and white female Shih
Tzu ( micro chip number 076 051 281) has matted hair on the lower back, rear end and on all four legs, covering
approximately 40 percent of the body. The matted hair on both dogs was matted to the skin. Matted hair can
cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture and affect the skin. It can foster skin infections, affect the
animal's mobility or be able to defecate normally. Matted hair does not maintain the same insulating qualities of
normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for coat
maintenance for the health and well- being of the dog. The matted hair on both dogs were removed during the
inspection, correcting this NCI.
3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Broken, protruding vinyl coated wires with sharp points were observed in two enclosures. Four dogs are in
contact with the affected wiring. Sharp points could injure the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosure
wires are maintained in good repair at all times and be free of sharp points that might injure the animals. The
licensee removed all four dogs to different enclosures during the inspection to correct this NCI.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, Robert Bacon ACI and Dr. Margaret
Shaver VMO.
