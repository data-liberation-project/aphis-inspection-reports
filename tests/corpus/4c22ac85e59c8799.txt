ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility attending veterinarian visited the facility 21 May 2015 and prescribed medication for the guinea pigs.
Hair loss in the animals has responded to the treatment but the facility continues to lose animals. Additional
treatment was discussed over the phone between the facility and the attending veterinarian but has not yet been
implemented. The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases must be
established and implemented to assure the least loss and suffering in the animal population. Correct by
implementing and documenting treatment immediately.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
The facility had an accumulation of cobwebs containing dust on the ceiling and top of the enclosures. Cobwebs hold
dust which can later be released and cause irritation to the respiratory tract thus making the animals more
susceptible to disease. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect
the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Correct By: 10 July 2015
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
The facility had open windows at the time of inspection to allow cooling for the animals but the windows did not have
screens and flies were abundant in the facility. Flies can serve to spread disease between animals and introduce
disease from outside the facility. Open windows without screens is not considered an effective program for the
control of insects. Correct by: 24 July 2015
An exit interview was conducted with facility owner.
