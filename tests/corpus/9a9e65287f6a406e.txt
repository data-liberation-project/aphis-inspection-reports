3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The licensee has several rabbits that are not housed in any type of enclosure and are allowed to roam free at large
on the premises.
Allowing the rabbits to roam freely is not a sufficient primary enclosure, does not adequately contain the rabbits and
cannot protect the animals from injury and the threat of predators.
The rabbits must be housed in an enclosure that functions to contain and protect the animals.
