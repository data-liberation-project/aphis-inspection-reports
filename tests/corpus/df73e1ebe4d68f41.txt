3.2(d)

Indoor housing facilities.
The main building that serves as a classroom, procedure prep area, cat housing, and surgery has several spots of flooring
that are bubbling up and pulling away from the subfloor or have been completely broken free. The largest of which is by a
door to the room and consists of two spots measuring approximately 5x3 inches and 4x2 inches respectively. The
exposed subfloor allows intrusion of moisture preventing the area from being appropriately clean and sanitized. The
floors, walls, and any other surfaces in contact with the animals in indoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture
or be replaceable.
