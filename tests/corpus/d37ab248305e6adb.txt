PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the whelping area of the residence two enclosures had puppies with their feet through the mesh flooring. One
enclosure housing a female Maltese and her three puppies had one puppy with at least two feet/legs through the
mesh flooring. The second enclosure housing a female Chin and her four puppies had two puppies with at least two
feet/legs through the mesh flooring. The licensee corrected the situation at the time of the inspection by placing
solid floored whelping boxes in the enclosures.
Feet passing through mesh or slatted flooring can cause injuries to the legs of all ages of dogs, and puppies not to
be able to nurse. All enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the
floor.
TO BE CORRECTED: From this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensees and ACI Bartels.
