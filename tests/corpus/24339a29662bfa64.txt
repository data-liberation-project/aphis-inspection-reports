FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The kinkajou enclosure is in disrepair. A sharp, rusted metal edge is exposed to the two kinkajous in their
shared enclosure. The sharp, rusted metal edge, approximately six inches long, is located on the sheet metal that
surrounds the bottom of the enclosure. Two additional areas of the sheet metal are excessively rusted.
Additionally, there is two by two inch hole in the enclosure wire shelving. This hole has exposed several sharp
wires.
The sharp, rusted edge and the wires could potentially injure the kinkajous. The excessive rust can no longer be
properly cleaned and sanitized.
Assure that the kinkajous are housed in an enclosure that is structurally sound and protects them from injury.
