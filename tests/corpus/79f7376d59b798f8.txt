OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b)(4)
***** At time of inspection the dog houses provided for the outdoor animals contained no bedding. Bedding is
required when the ambient temperatures reach 50 degrees and additional clean dry bedding is required when the
ambient temperatures reach 35 degrees or lower.
The ambient temperatures for the area this facility is located in are expected to reach below the temperatures
experienced so far which have hit into the high 30 and low 40 degree range. Forecasts are for several nights in the
range of high teens to mid and high 20 degree temperatures. The addition of clean dry bedding will enable the
animals to help in retention of body heat and aid in keeping them warm and confortable during times of extreme
cold. This will help to keep the animals in good health.
Arrangements for bedding for these animals had begun during the exit interview stage of the inspection and are
expected to be in place by this evening.
