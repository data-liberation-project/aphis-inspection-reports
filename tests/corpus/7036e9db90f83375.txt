ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1710 on
20-Nov-18. I went to the licensee's house. The licensee was home, but was not available to conduct the
inspection. The licensee gave me their optimal hours for inspection. I told her I would try back another time.
End of report.
