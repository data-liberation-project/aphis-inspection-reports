2.31(d)(1)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC-approved protocol 250-XX-XX contains no search for alternatives and the narrative statement indicates that
no search was performed. The IACUC-approved protocols 256-XX-XX, 248-XX-XX, 252-XX-XX and 261-XX-XX contain
no narrative describing whether alternative procedures were found. Failure to search for alternatives to procedures that
may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and not including the narrative to document that
search, can result in the use of procedures that may be duplicative and/or cause harm or injury the animals. The
regulations require the search for alternatives and a narrative documenting whether alternatives were available. Correct

2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol 250-XX-XX does not describe a significant procedure to be conducted on the animals. The protocol was
approved by the IACUC, despite this important procedure’s description being omitted. Not including the required
significant procedure description in a protocol, with subsequent approval by the IACUC, may lead to serious injury to the
animals to be utilized in that protocol. Per the regulation, a complete description of the proposed use of the animals must
be contained in a proposal to conduct an activity involving animals. Correct by October 30, 2020.
