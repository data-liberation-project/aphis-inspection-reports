3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee has performed some corrective measures on enclosure #19a by adding additional fencing around the
top of the enclosure to 16 feet in order to try and bring the trees next to the fence into compliance. While the fence
has been raised to the appropriate height, there are trees that are too close to the fence that could still provide an
opportunity for an animal to escape. The remaining previous enclosures with trees that are too close to the fences
are #8, #11, #12, #14, #15, #17 and #19a.
The facility needs to remove any trees that are too close to the primary enclosure fences. If the trees are not going
to be removed, an adequate kick-in over the top of the tree and/or around it that prevents the animals from climbing
the tree to escape must be added or another method must be devised by the facility to effectively prevent the
animals from using these trees for the purpose of escape. This has been done as an adequate fix by the licensee
on enclosure #9. Taking these preventative measures and maintaining the enclosure fence according to AWA
regulations and standards should decrease the risk of escape by the regulated animals that can climb and decrease
the potential for safety risks to the animal and general public.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee. The licensee refused to sign the inspection report upon
advice of their lawyers. The report was left with the licensee and a copy was sent via certified mail.
