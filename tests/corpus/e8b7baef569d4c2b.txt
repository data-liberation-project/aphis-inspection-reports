3.6(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
In the first outdoor pen, two shelter structures had exposed sharp metal edges. This is a potential injury risk to any dog
using these shelters. In another outdoor pen housing two dogs, there were two pieces of broken glass on the ground.
This could easily result in injury to a paw or mouth. Any sharp points or items must be removed or repaired to prevent
injury to the animals.
Correct by: Glass was corrected during the inspection. Sharp edges should be corrected by 8 August 2022
3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
In the first outdoor pen, an enclosure housing three ridgebacks has two areas where the dirt floor has washed away. One
is the border fence between two enclosures - this could allow dogs to cross under the fence into the neighboring
enclosure. The other area is a section of ground that has exposed a sheet of wire buried to prevent the dogs from
escaping. This is now a potential source of injury if a paw was to slip through this wire. These holes must be filled and
maintained as needed.

Watering


Several pens contained water buckets that were dirty or discolored. One old english sheepdog did not have water at all.
All dogs must have potable water continuously available. Water must be changed frequently enough to prevent
contamination, and water buckets must be cleaned as needed.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
- In an elevated pen inside the whelping room, there was an accumulation of old feces with an adult female dog. The
fecal material had clearly been present for some time, and some was covered with mold. This is a source of
contamination to the enclosed animal. Excreta and food waste must be removed daily from all primary enclosures.
Corrected at the time of inspection
- In the two elevated outdoor enclosures (North and South Pen #6) the drains are full of liquid and waste, with numerous
maggots present. Beneath each enclosure at the location of the drain exits, there is a large accumulation of hair and
other organic debris on the ground. In the center of these piles of debris are large swarms of maggots. The blocked
drains expose the dogs overhead to noxious odors and the large number of maggots indicate a severe pest control issue.
This is a clearly negative impact on the health and welfare of these animals. The drains must be cleaned as soon as
possible, and all maggots/pests removed as well. The facility must implement a cleaning plan to ensure that drainage is
addressed in a more appropriate manner.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
An outdoor enclosure housing two Rhodesian ridgebacks had an overgrowth of grass and weeds filling the back half of
the pen. This is potential harborage for pests and insects and needs to be cut. Facility must maintain all grass and weed


growth to minimize the risk of contamination to the animals.
