Facilities, general.
The refrigeration racks for thawing meat in the lion food prep area were peeling and rusty. Chips of paint and rust could
get into the food. These racks cannot be cleaned and sanitized properly. Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in
facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination. Refrigeration shall be
provided for supplies of perishable food. These racks need to be repaired or replaced.

Sanitation.
There are two areas where waterers were removed and the concrete behind it is now exposed. This is on either side of
the lion night housing wall of cage numbers 5 and 6. These areas need to be made impervious to moisture to enable
them to be cleaned and sanitized properly.
