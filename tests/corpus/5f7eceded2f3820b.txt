2.38(f)(1) Critical Repeat

Miscellaneous.
A macaque sustained a left humerus fracture on 12/01/2021 when it moved suddenly during a handling event. It was
reported that the injury was immediately identified and reported to the veterinarians, was treated and has recovered.
Handling methods were reviewed and retraining of the technicians was scheduled prior to any more handling of non-
human primates. Adverse incidents of handling that cause fractures cause unnecessary discomfort to the involved
animals. Ensure that handling methods and techniques are refined so that handling is done as carefully as possible to
prevent any adverse incidents with trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort to animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
