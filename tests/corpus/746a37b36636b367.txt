Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:53 AM on 15 July
2021. Inspectors tried to make contact at the house and shop. In addition, they honked their horn and called phone all
phone numbers on file, no voicemail was able to be left. So inspectors followed up the call with a text message. No
response was received. Inspectors waited 30 minutes on the premise prior to departing.
