it stands while carrying the affected leg. A veterinarian has not been contacted regarding the current condition of the
dog.
The injury can be painful and affect the health and well being of the dog.
The animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administered by 5:00 p.m.
March 4, 2015. Documentation should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended
treatment must be part of this documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Condition and site.
There is a pile of empty dog feed sacks on the floor and an open sack containing cat food in the food storage area.
There is also an accumulation of old straw bedding and dirt on the floor.
This can attract pests and provide a place for rodents to nest and breed.
The licensee must ensure areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash,
waste material, junk and other discarded materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and
free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and
necessary for cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
Within the indoor housing facility the linoleum type floor is damaged around the walls and entrance. The damaged
areas are exposing wood not impervious to moisture.
The two wooden whelping boxes being used have chewed and worn surfaces. These surfaces are also not
impervious to moisture and are collecting dirt and fur.
The two piece type plastic shelters being used in the outdoor housing area are excessively chewed and worn
around the entrances.
The worn surfaces cannot be properly clean and sanitized. This can create a disease hazard and affect the health
and well being of the dogs. The licensee must maintain all surfaces in the housing facility on a regular basis.
Surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility
that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Direct-The indoor housing facility has dirt, hair and food waste on the floor and hair caught on the wire fronts of the
enclosures affecting 23 dogs. The animal waste collection tray in the right-rear corner of the building is overflowing
with urine. The urine is soaking into the wooden floor under and beside the used enclosure where the linoleum
flooring is damaged or missing. A strong odor of noxious fumes is present and is causing the inspector's eyes to
feel itchy and irritated.
The unsanitary conditions can contribute to pest, odors and disease hazards which can affect the health and
well-being of the dogs. Inside of the building is in need of a general cleaning and sanitizing to remove dirt, grime,
excreta, food waste, hair, etc. from between and behind the enclosures, from the fronts of the enclosures, the floors
and walls. All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis to reduce odors, pest,
disease hazards, and to contribute to the health and well-being of the animals.
Direct-All of outdoor enclosures have more than a days worth of feces, and soiled bedding on the flooring and inside
of the shelters. The floors of the outdoor enclosures that are on the ground are completely covered in excreta,
soiled straw bedding and food waste affecting five dogs. The dogs paws are wet and covered with excreta and other
soiled materials. The five dogs do not have access to a clean and dry area in their enclosures. This can cause
discomfort for the dogs and can contribute to odors, pest and disease hazards. The outdoor enclosures must be
spot cleaned to remove excreta, soiled bedding, food waste, hair, etc. from the floor, wire fencing, and inside of
shelters. All enclosures must be spot cleaned daily to reduce odors, pest and disease hazards. 3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
The outside runs have excreta, food waste, hair, old bedding etc. surrounding the enclosures. The licensee must
remove the waste from around the enclosures and maintain the collection of waste to minimize odors, pest, disease
hazards and to contribute to the health and well-being of the animals.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are at least five plastic shelters being used in the outdoor housing area that have a damaged or missing wind
and rain break. Lack of wind and rain breaks does not provide protection from the elements. The licensee must
ensure all shelters being used be provided with a wind and rain break.
3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outdoor enclosures with plastic dog houses do not have sufficient bedding provided. The temperature during
the inspection was 37 degrees Fahrenheit. This can be uncomfortable for the dogs and could contribute to health
problems. Outdoor shelters must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50
degrees Fahrenheit to help the dogs conserve body heat and to contribute to the health and well-being of the dogs.
The licensee must add clean dry bedding to the dog houses.
