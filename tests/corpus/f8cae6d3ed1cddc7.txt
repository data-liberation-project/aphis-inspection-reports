3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
After inspecting the rabbit hutches and discussing cleaning practices with the facility owner, it was confirmed that
the rabbit enclosures are not being sanitized.
Primary enclosures for rabbits must be sanitized at least once every 30 days by either 1) washing them with hot
water (180° F) and soap or detergent, 2) washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe
and effective disinfectant, or 3) cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.
Failure to sanitize the rabbit enclosures may have a negative impact on animal health by facilitating the spread of
disease to the animals. Correct by sanitizing the primary enclosures of the rabbits at least once every 30 days.
Correct by August 25, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
