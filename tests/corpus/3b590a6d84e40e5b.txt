Notification of change of operation.
Hawaiian Airlines did not have a site listed at Boston Logan Airport on the registration at the time of inspection, and
reports that they have transported to Boston for a period of approximately one year. Two dogs were noted by USDA
inspector to have been transported on July 27, 2022, under Air Waybills 173-35702015 and 173-35741064 without an
active site at Boston Logan Airport. The registrant is required to notify the Deputy Administrator of any change in address
within 10 days of making such change. The inspector informed the registrant of this requirement, and the registrant then
officially notified Animal Care of the new site.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative. An inspection item is under review.
