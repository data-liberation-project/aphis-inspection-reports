HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An outdoor portion of a marmoset enclosure had a hole in the lower corner that was big enough for one of the
animals to get out. There other enclosures that the lower edge of the bent wire panel had been blocked by
sandbags.Several marmoset enclosures had severely rusted access panels, one of which was rusted to the point
that it was being held in place by an extra scrap of wire that was keeping the lose panel in place. Deteriorating and
poorly maintained enclosures can cause injury to the animals or could enable them to escape. The housing facilities
for nonhuman primates must be kept in good repair and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the
animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. The holes in the enclosures must be repaired and the
rusted deteriorating panels must be repaired or replaced.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
A single marmoset was individually house on the porch of the residence where it could not see or hear other
primates. It did not appear to be ill or injured and the licensees stated that it was still young and had concerns for it
being out near the others due to incompatibility and territoriality. There were originally two marmosets in this
enclosure but one had died not long ago. One of the owners indicated that she provides the remaining animal with
individual attention herself. The environmental enhancement plan does not have any provisions for the individual
housing of nonhuman primates. The attending veterinarian was contacted and she was not aware that they had a
marmoset housed where it could not see or hear other primates. In addition, this facility breeds primates and there
is no provision for infant/juvenile care in the enrichment plan. Housing a primate by itself and out of sight and
hearing of other primates can affect the psychological well-being of the animal and result in stress or behavioral
problems. The primate environmental enhancement plan must address the social needs of individually housed
primates. Individually housed primates must be able to see and hear others of their own or compatible species
unless the attending veterinarian determines that it would endanger their health, safety, or well-being. The reasons
for exemption must be recorded by the attending veterinarian for each exempted primate. Unless the condition is
permanent it must be reviewed every 30 days by the veterinarian.

WATERING.
Multiple marmoset enclosures contained watering receptacles with cloudy water and dirty receptacles, debris, and
algae build up. Drinking dirty or contaminated water could cause illness in the monkeys and the lack of clean
drinking water is a significant health concern for these animals. The water issue was also cited on the previous
inspection after a mortality event of undetermined cause resulted in the death of multiple marmosets. Water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized and animals must be provided with potable water.
3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There has apparently been no change in the cleaning, sanitizing, and housekeeping of the primate facilities or
procedures since the last inspection. There was an accumulation of significant amounts of decaying food and fecal
waste in most of the enclosures housing marmosets. Marmosets housed in cages in a utility shed had excessive
wet and decaying food and fecal waste on the bottom of the cage form which a foul odor was detected. Those
cages had large areas of rust on them and resting platforms and nest boxes that were coated in a dark layer of
grime and which were splintered and in disrepair.
Multiple outdoor portions of the other sheltered marmoset enclosures had many very dirty surfaces with varying
patterns of discoloration. Some were green with algae, some had dark greasy appearing staining, and some were
black and/or patchy white with what appeared to be mold. Dirty surfaces included feeding areas, ropes, perches,
toys, nest boxes, pass through tunnels, and walls. There was flaking and worn paint and wood that was
deteriorating. Some water and food receptacle holders/access portals were very rusted, some to the point of
possible structural compromise.
The room where the nest boxes and feeding stations are accessed was very dirty with black discoloration that
looked like mold on the walls and, on the nest boxes and the food access panels. This room is also where food is
stored and brought in for distribution.
Soiled surfaces and accumulation of food and fecal waste may cause a risk of diseases, odor accumulation, or
pest infestation that could affect the health and well-being of the animals. There was a significant mortality event at
this facility several months previously and there continue to be sporadic deaths of undetermined causes. Lack of
adequate sanitation may be a contributing factor to increased mortality.
Rusted or deteriorating surfaces cannot be completely cleaned and need to be repaired or replaced. Food and
excrement must be removed from indoor primary enclosures daily. Dirt floors and absorbent bedding must be spot
cleaned frequently enough to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with bodily waste and other waste,
and often enough to prevent excessive waste accumulation, pest infestation, and disease hazards. Surfaces must
be kept clean and replaced when worn and when they cannot be cleaned and sanitized.
3.85EMPLOYEES.
(cid:9)The facility lacks adequate personnel who are available and able to routinely maintain the enclosure, the facilities,
and the daily husbandry practices to meet the standards of this subpart. The owners have grandsons who
occasionally assist with some tasks but the help is not on a routine and reliable basis. Multiple conversation with the
licensee have covered the topic relating to the need for adequate personnel and assistance with the care of the
maintenance of the facility. The licensee must have enough employees or other reliable trained staff to carry out the
level of husbandry practices and care required in this subpart.

3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee purchased ten fennec foxes about one month prior to this inspection. There were only seven foxes
present at the time of the inspection. According to the licensee, one of these animals died. Two others, housed as a
pair, dug out of their cage and escaped. They have not yet been recovered. The licensee has put out traps to try to
catch them. The owner stated that the animals escaped due to faulty construction of the pens by some individuals
who were helping him. The pens were supposed to have a complete wire floor that was buried in sand, but
apparently there was a gap in the wire floor panel of one of the pens; the animals found the gap and dug out. The
owner indicated he checked the other enclosures for gaps. Improper construction and maintenance of enclosures
for the species resulted in the animal escapes. Escaped animal could be injured, get killed, or suffer from the lack of
food or water. Housing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
species involved and they must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.
Correct from this point forward.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Water bowls in several kinkajou enclosures were dirty and contained dirty/cloudy water. The lack of clean drinking
water can result in health problems or disease in the animals. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Several primary enclosures for the kinkajous were dirty with significant accumulations of feces and food wastes.
Some material appeared to possibly be diarrhea or vomit. Rotting food and fecal waste was seen around a food
station that was attached to an extremely dirty wall. The waste material was mixed in with other food materials.
Many walls of kinkajou enclosures were dirty, discolored (moldy appearance), and in some cases deteriorating.Inadequate cleaning of the enclosures can created a disease or health hazard for the animals. Several of the
kinkajou were being treated for parasites and they were housed adjacent to some marmosets. The possibility of
disease or parasite transmission may pose a significant risk to cage mates as well as to other animals in the vicinity.
Excreta and discarded food debris must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals, to avoid attracting pests, and to minimize disease hazards.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Seven fennec foxes were housed in enclosures located in an old shed. The shed was in disrepair with a damaged
roof and support beams and a sagging and partially separated metal roof over the cages housing the foxes. At least
one support post had a major split in it at the top with nails exposed and pulled away from the cross beams. The
metal roof at the top was separated creating a gap where rain could come in. The disrepair of the shed roof and
supports is a safety hazard to the foxes who could be injured if the beams fell or the roof collapsed.

The premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from
injury. The shed where the foxes are housed should be repaired or the animals should be moved to enclosures in a
safer location.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
