FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several guinea pig enclosures were in need of repair:
-The top enclosure in the northeast corner (upper building) housing young males had some loose wire with points
exposed to the guinea pigs.
-An enclosure in the northeast corner (upper building) had a loose latch which allowed 4 guinea pigs to get loose.
-The bottom enclosure's floor in the southeast corner (upper building) was loose which allowed some guinea pigs to
get out of it.
-Points from screws holding the feeders in the lower building were exposed to the guinea pigs.
The loose latches and broken floor don't safely contain the guinea pigs. Loose wire and sharp points can hurt the
guinea pigs. Ensure that enclosures are maintained in good repair to contain the guinea pigs and protect them from
injury.
***Correct by 2/20/2020.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The upper and lower building's temperatures were 46 to 50 degrees F when the inspection started. The licensee
turned up the heaters and the buildings started to warm up during the inspection. For their health and comfort; the
temperature around the guinea pigs isn't allowed to fall below 60 degrees F. Ensure that the temperature around
the guinea pigs (the ambient temperature) is maintained between 60 and 85 degrees F.
***Maintain correct from this day forward.
