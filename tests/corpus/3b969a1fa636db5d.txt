3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There was a broken pane of glass in the garage door in the building housing the guinea pigs resulting in an opening
approximately 4 x 9 inches in size with a feed bag placed in the opening. The interior surface of the base of the garage
door was broken in a few areas resulting in gaps where debris may become lodged and may be difficult to clean and
sanitize.
Failure to maintain the building in good repair including repairing broken windows and garage doors can allow birds,
pests, or insects to enter the facility and cause injury or disease spread to the guinea pigs.
The guinea pig housing facility must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and disease spread.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
