MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
Sec. 2.130 Minimum age requirements.
**** Further review of licensee's APHIS form 7006s when I returned to the home office. One APHIS form 7006 with
a Date of Disposition of 11-14-16 shows puppy identification number 16 SF-69 microchip number 516 7660 a male
King Charles Spaniel with a whelp date of 9-20-16. The dates show this puppy was 55 days old when it started its
travel in commerce. The ability of puppies under the minimum age of 56 days to handle the rigors of travels is
greatly hampered. All future sales of puppies must meet the minimum age requirement of 56 days.
To be corrected by: Every sales transactions from this date forward.
