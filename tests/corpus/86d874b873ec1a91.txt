2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At approximately 1:30 pm, east of the carnival area (#32), the inspector observed Woody's Educational Wildlife
Show. During this show, a licensee brought a five month old, female, brown bear named 'Dottie' out of the transport
vehicle and onto the stage. The bear was wearing a 1" wide, red nylon-type dog collar around its neck. A black
leash was attached to the collar and was being handled by a licensee. During the exhibition, the bear was observed
struggling and did not seem accustomed to/acclimated to the collar restraint being used. The bear was trying to pull
away from the handler, tossing its head and biting at the leash. Additionally, the bear appeared distressed and was
trying to bite the handler. When asked about the weight of the bear, a licensee stated that it weighed about 65 lbs.
A wild animal that size, especially when distressed and trying to bite, cannot be adequately controlled with a collar
and leash. The struggling and biting at the collar are signs of behavioral stress.
Handling of all animals shall be done expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. During public exhibition animals must be
handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.
To be corrected this day forward.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with licensees at the Linn County Fairgrounds in Central City, IA.
