3.28(c)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The guinea pigs are currently being housed in blue transport enclosures for the past 2 days. These enclosures measure
25 inches by 17 inches by 7 3/4 inches in height or 425 square inches of floor space. At total of 23 of 27 transport
enclosures are housing 8 or more guinea pigs with ages between weanling and adult. The animals are being housed in
these transport enclosures while their racks that house their primary enclosures are being cleaned and repainted. The
licensee stated that he changes these enclosures every 2 days.

Weanlings up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches of floor space and adults weighing over 350 grams require
at least 101 square inches of floor space.

Inadequate space does not allow animals to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement and
can lead to stress, fighting, aggression, and injury to the animals. The licensee cannot house more than 7 weanlings
weighing up to 350 grams in these transport enclosures. Additional space is required to house the guinea pigs. Correct by
October 3, 2022.

Watering.

The majority of the 27 blue transport enclosures had brown discolored water in 2 of the 4 receptacles in each corner of
the enclosure. The other 2 receptacles contained pelleted feed. The licensee stated that he cannot clean the water
receptacles unless he dumps the entire enclosure. He mentioned that he moves the guinea pigs to new transport
enclosures every 2 days.

Potable water shall be provided daily except as might otherwise be required to provide adequate veterinary care. Failure
to provide clean, potable water can result in disease and health risks to the animals. The licensee must ensure clean,
potable water is provided to the guinea pigs. Correct by September 29, 2022.
