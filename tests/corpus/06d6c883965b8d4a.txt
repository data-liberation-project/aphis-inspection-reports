ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Yorkshire terrier (microchip #016-789-113) is observed to have his tongue hanging out the left side of the
mouth. Closer examination of the dog’s mouth revealed a buildup of brown tartar covering the entire surface of both
the left and right cheek teeth. The upper right canine tooth has a buildup of dark colored tartar along the gum line
and extending half way down the tooth. An upper right cheek tooth and the lower left canine tooth are loose and
moved easily when touched by the inspector. There is a grey, creamy material along the upper gum line on the
right side of the mouth. The gums are moderately reddened.
Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as, lead to further health issues. This dog
must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The
diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Correction date: The dog was evaluated by a licensed veterinarian at the time of the inspection.
