FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The effectiveness of the perimeter fence has been reduced by the placement of miscellaneous items such as hay
bales, mounds of dirt, and unused metal material directly next to areas along the north side of the perimeter fence.
All areas near the perimeter fence must remain clear of items which could facilitate the entry of unauthorized
humans or animals and allow potential contact with the animals. A system must be in place to ensure the perimeter
fence is maintained in an effective manner for the protection of the animals in the facility.
