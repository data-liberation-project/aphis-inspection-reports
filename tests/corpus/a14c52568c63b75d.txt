FEEDING.
Currently the majority of feeders (12) need to be cleaned and sanitized more often due to the brown grime and
greasy film that is left along the sides and under the rim of the food bowl where the dogs mouth comes in contact
with the feeder when eating.
A buildup of dirt and grime in the food bowls and feeders can be a source of bacteria and pose a possible health
hazard.
The food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often as necessary to
prevent the buildup of dirt and grime where the dogs will have direct contact with the food and feeder.
