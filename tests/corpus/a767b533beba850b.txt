ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved written program of veterinary care (PVC) does not include all the covered species at the facility. In
addition, portions of the form are not filled out.
All covered species should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the facility has a program to follow concerning the
care of their animals. A system should be in place to ensure all the required paperwork is complete and available at
time of inspection.

The pig has an overgrown hind hoof. An excessive hoof length can cause an animal to stand and walk abnormally.
Abnormal posture and gaits may cause strain on joints and may be accompanied by possible pain, discomfort and
joint damage. A system should be in place to identify animals that are in need of hoof trimming and provide trimming
in a timely manner.
