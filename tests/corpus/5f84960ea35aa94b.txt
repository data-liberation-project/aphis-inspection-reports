RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The inventory of animals on hand was not accurate at the time of inspection. The inventory to include animals
acquired from being born on the premises or acquired by other means, such as purchase or trapping, was not being
maintained. This includes, but was not limited to; 2 snowshoe hares offspring, 5 gray fox offspring, 1 bobcat
offspring, 7 lynx offspring, 5 porcupine, 1 flying squirrel, 9 woodchuck, and 6 red squirrels. Incomplete or lack of
records does not allow APHIS officials to track animals when necessary. Develop and maintain a method of
maintaining complete facility records to include all required information under Sec. 2.75(b)(1). Correct by: 9 October

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Five porcupines are housed in primary enclosures outside of the main perimeter fenced in area. Without the
perimeter fence, these animals are unprotected from wild animals and unauthorized persons from coming in contact
with the animals which could put their health at risk to disease or injury. There is also no secondary containment
system for these animals in event of escape. Provide a perimeter fence for these animals. Correct by: 5 October
