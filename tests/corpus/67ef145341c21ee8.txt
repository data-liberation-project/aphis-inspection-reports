Appropriate Methods of Treatment
One Cavalier (USDA Tag #272) was noted as having an open and discharging laceration on the bottom of its neck
seeming to be caused by having a chain collar on that was too tight. The animal has not been diagnosed or treated
as of this inspection.
One bottle of Oxytocin in the medication storage area expired as of March 2014.
Without proper methods of disease and injury control, there is a high risk of injury or illness to animals in the facility.
The animal mentioned above must be seen by a veterinarian, diagnosed, and a treatment plan must be created and
followed. Any expired medications must be removed no longer used. Correct by

Daily Observation
A Cavalier (USDA Tag #272) has a chain collar that was unacceptably tight around the animals neck. There was
an open gash approximately 1 1/2 long on the bottom of the neck that was wet and discharging fluid. The licensee
had not noted this before today, and the collar was removed in the presence of the inspector. Daily observation of
all animals is crutial in order to discover and remedy problems with the animals before they become worse. The
animal noted above must be seen by a veterinarian, diagnosed, and a treatment plan must be created and followed.
