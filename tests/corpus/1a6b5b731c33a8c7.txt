Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Ten transport enclosures containing eighteen dogs in transit were not cleaned for over 24 hours. The dogs arrived on
flight RJ 5281/28 (AWB numbers 512-5018 4643, 512-5018 4676, 512-5018 4654, 512-5018 4665, and 512-5018 4680)
on 8/28/20 and were held in the cargo facility until 8/31/20. When asked about the cleaning frequency of the transport
enclosures, the facility representative stated none of the transport enclosures were cleaned until 8/30/20. Failure to clean
transport enclosures and replace litter/absorbent material every 24 hours while in transit can cause the dogs to become
soiled with animal wastes.

Dogs in transit for more than 24 hours must have their enclosures cleaned and litter/absorbent material must be replaced.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative
