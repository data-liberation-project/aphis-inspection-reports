Housing facilities, general.
In the enclosure for the langurs, the walls and ceiling of the enclosure had cracked areas with crumbling concrete
surfaces where deterioration was occurring and moisture was seen to be seeping through cracks, causing discoloration
and exposing underlying material.

In the enclosure for the howler monkeys it was observed that the wooden den boxes in the sheltered night-house area
showed a water line mark a third of the way up their walls indicative of moisture permeating into the wood, and in some
areas a green growth was present on the surface of the damp areas of the wood.

All surfaces in primate housing must be maintained so that they can be readily cleaned and disinfected. Crumbling
surfaces with moisture seeping through cannot be adequately maintained in sanitary condition. Wood that is permeable to
moisture, especially when not subject to sunlight and drying, cannot be maintained in sanitary condition. Housing the
animals in enclosures with surfaces that are not adequately maintained or replaced when worn or soiled could put the
health of the animals at risk.



All surfaces in non-human primate enclosures should be appropriately maintained and repaired or replaced when soiled
or worn. Langur and howler repairs to be completed by 3/2/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
