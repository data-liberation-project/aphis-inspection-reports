MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
***In April 2017 a marmoset escaped from an acclimation device that was being used by investigator staff as
described in the IACUC approved protocol. The animal’s tail was injured during its recapture by laboratory staff.
The facility veterinarian was contacted, immediately assessed the animal, and began treatment. The animal made
a full recovery. Upon being notified and in response to this information, the IACUC and AV immediately looked into
the incident.
It was determined that investigator staff did not follow the recapture SOP when the NHP escaped from the
acclimation device. A method not included in the recapture SOP was used that caused the tail injury in the
marmoset.
Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible
in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Upon being notified and in response to this incident, the research facility acted promptly and conducted an
investigation, reported the incident to OLAW, and swiftly implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent
similar incidents in the future. Corrective actions included but were not limited to providing additional retraining of
investigator staff, revision of the recapture SOP, and modifications were made to the acclimation device.
No additional incidents have occurred since these corrective actions were implemented. This item has been
appropriately addressed by the research facility.
NOTE – Inspection conducted 6/26/17 and 6/27/17. Exit briefing held 6/27/17 on-site with facility representatives.*END OF REPORT*
