MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on 07-FEB-20 at 3:00 pm.
When I arrived at the facility at 3:00 pm, no one was at the front desk. At 3:10 pm a veterinary technician student
arrived and informed me that no facility representatives were present. At 3:15 pm I called two facility
representatives, one representative was out sick and the other one was not in the area and could not meet with me
to do the inspection on this day. I informed them that I would write up this inspection as an attempted. I left the
facility at 3:30 pm.
