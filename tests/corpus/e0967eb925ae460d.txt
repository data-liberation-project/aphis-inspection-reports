PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During the inspection, a Capuchin monkey, named Romeo, escaped his outdoor enclosure. He was seen running
along the ground and the top of enclosure fences. After about 15 minutes, he was captured and safely returned to
his enclosure, uninjured. The facility was open but no members of the public were present. Upon close inspection, it
was determined by the facility that the lock on Romeo's outdoor enclosure was not latching appropriately and could
be jerked open, leaving the enclosure unsecured. Animals that are not securely contained within their primary
enclosures can be injured or even killed when they escape. Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be
constructed and maintained so that they contain the animals securely and prevent accidental opening of the
enclosure.
To be corrected from this day forward.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two black bears are housed in the first safari area in an enclosure near the cougars and leopards. As we
approached the enclosures, the bears were seen pacing along the fence. Upon inspection, a significant portion of
their enclosure was flooded. Water was overflowing from their automatic waterer, which is an in-ground watering
receptacle located near the middle of the enclosure. The area around the waterer, under their elevated platform,
and around the back of their den was flooded. The ground in front of their den was muddy. Water draining from the
flooded areas of the enclosure was green and slimy, indicating that it was not a new development. Since their water
source is located at ground level, and the area around it was flooded, the bears’ access to clean water was limited.
Prolonged exposure to standing water can cause disease conditions of the skin. Additionally, standing water is a
breeding ground for pests. A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water from enclosures
containing animals.
To be corrected immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.Additional Inspectors
