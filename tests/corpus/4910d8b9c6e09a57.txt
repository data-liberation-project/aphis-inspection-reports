2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
****None of the two litters of unweaned puppies had any form of identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is
necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation.
The licensee must identify all puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Acceptable forms of identification include a
microchip, a collar and tag, a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written, or a cage card as long
as all the puppies in the enclosure are from the same litter.
This inspection covers only the whelping facility and records.
Inspection and the exit interview were conducted by William Heine, ACI with the licensee.
