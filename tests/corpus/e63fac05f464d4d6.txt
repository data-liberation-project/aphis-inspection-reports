RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
While reviewing the records it was noted that the following animals: 1 pot belly pig, 2 coatimundis, and 3 prairie
dogs, are no longer on the premise. However, there is no documentation present as to whom these animals were
sold / donated too. In speaking with Ms. Bardin, over the phone, she did tell me that the Canadian lynx had passed
away in Oct 2013. However there was no documentation on the premise at this time. All records need to be kept
current and accurate.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The capuchin is being housed in the warm barn, behind the house. There is a panel of a plastic, white board on one
of the walls. However, the edges of this white board have been damaged. The white material is peeling away and
now a pressed wood material is present. There are also jagged edges present. This board cannot be cleaned and
sanitized in this condition. Therefore, this board will need to be addressed.

3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. During this inspection it was noted that the red fox enclosure, adjacent to the parking lot, was in need of repair.
This enclosure is up against the wooden stockade perimeter fence. To comply with the perimeter fence requirement
chain link fence was strung down the middle of the primary enclosure. However, the fox has been able to gain
access to this back section of the pen via a gap in the chain link fencing. Therefore there is a lack of a perimeter
fence in this area and the animal has access to jagged chain link fencing. This section of fence will need to be
repaired.

2. The African Crested Porcupine is currently being housed in the warm barn behind the house. However, this
animal has chewed a section of the wood wall. There is now an ~ 8(cid:29) gap in the wood wall, along the back, right
corner, of its pen. There is a piece of plexi glass, or some sort of plastic, that prevents the animal from escaping this
enclosure. However, due to the nature of this animal and the jagged wooden edges around the gap this area will
need to be addressed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the previous inspection (6/24/13) it was noted that the area ("tiki hut") around the freezer was in need of
attention. The situation remains this same at this time. The area around the freezer is partially enclosed by walls
with countertops. The walls are approximately three feet high. The areas under the countertops, and on the ground,
have an accumulation of debris, hay, tools and supplies present. Also noted during this inspection was an issue with
other food items not being stored properly. There was an opened bag of dog food sitting directly on the ground, in
the snow, adjacent to the "(cid:28)tiki hut"(cid:29). There was also 2 boxes of frozen meat sitting in the sun, on the countertop of
the (cid:28)"tiki hut"(cid:29).There was an opened box of vegetables in the warm barn. In the same area of the warm barn there
was also a box of empty containers sitting on top of another box of vegetables. All opened bags of food and
bedding need to be stored in closed containers. Perishable food items need to be refrigerated. The meat that will be
fed out to the large cats needs to be thawed out in a refrigerator.
Food storage areas need to be maintained in such a manner which will minimize contamination. This area needs to
be addressed.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
During this inspection it was noted that the lion and 2 servals were being housed outdoors. They have access towooden den boxes that contained some hay. Due to the nature of these animals and the extreme cold weather that
this area is experiencing this winter, additional bedding will need to be added to these den boxes. According to the
Weather Channel the temperature in the area tonight will be -9 degrees and 13 degrees tomorrow night. To ensure
the health and safety of these 3 animals they will need to be provided with more bedding.

3.129(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the male lion and female cougar were extremely thin. Hips and
vertebra of both animals were visible. In speaking with the family members, I was informed that the cats were fed
daily. However, when I asked to see what would be fed out later today I was shown 2 boxes of meat. These boxes
were on the countertop of the (cid:28)tiki hut(cid:29) and frozen solid. The air temperature at ~3:00 pm was ~18 (cid:19) 20 degrees.
Therefore this food would not have been thawed out before the night feeding. There was no other food source on
the premise at the time of this inspection. Due to the condition of these two animals, and the lack of food present,
this facility will need to have their attending veterinary visit the facility and evaluate the condition, diets, housing, and
care of these animals. The food shall be wholesome and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the
animals in good health.

WATERING.
On the previous inspection ( 6/24/13) it was noted that the lion enclosure had a dirty receptacle. During this
inspection it was noted that the following enclosures did not have potable water assessable to the animals: the red
fox, black bear, lion, red fox / silver fox, and servals. The water receptacles in these pens were frozen solid. The
Syrian bear had no water receptacles present. Potable water needs to be provided to the animals on a daily basis.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The warm barn, behind the house, is in need of a thorough cleaning. Both sides of the aisles had an accumulation
of miscellaneous items: pipes, bowls, sheets of plexi glass, hay, cages, wood, etc., presents. To ensure that this
barn can be maintained clean and not harbor any pests, it will need to be cleaned out on a more frequent basis.
