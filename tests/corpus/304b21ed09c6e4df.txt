2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
An enclosure containing five weaned puppies didn't have identification. Lack of identification doesn't allow for the
animals to be easily identified. Provide identification for all weaned puppies with an official tag or a plastic-type
collar or cage card attached to the enclosure containing the information required on an official tag. Correct
immediately.
3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two dogs were housed in an enclosure that didn't meet the minimum space requirements for both dogs. The first
dog measured 37 inches and the second dog measured 41 inches. Together they needed 4,058 square inches.
The cage measured 46.5 inches by 81 inches for a total space of 3,766.5 square inches. The cage was 291.5
square inches short of meeting the minimum space requirements of primary enclosures for those dogs. Cage
space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their cages. It minimizes
the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the minimum floor space
requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
