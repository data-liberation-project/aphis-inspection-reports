3.132 CRITICAL
EMPLOYEES.
At this facility, flying squirrels are housed in an appropriate enclosure in the mammal room, and this enclosure is
routinely cleaned by animal care staff. In July 2019 after routine duties, an employee left the enclosure door open,
failing to ensure that the animals were safely contained. One flying squirrel escaped the enclosure, and was outside
the enclosure for an unknown duration of time. The animal was found during routine cleaning of the environment
and replaced in its enclosure. The licensee stated that the animal appeared to be behaving normally at that time,
but was found dead the following day.
Employees that are involved in the care of animals must be adequately trained in order to maintain professionally
accepted husbandry standards. Acceptable husbandry standards include handling and enclosure use that results in
the safe containment of the animals. In this instance, an inadequately trained employee failed to secure the animal's
enclosure, which led to the escape of a flying squirrel. While outside of the enclosure, the animal did not have
reliable access to food and water, and may have been subjected to additional exposures or stressors that werehazardous to its health. The animal passed away within 24 hours of being recovered.
Employees must be trained to ensure that the husbandry practices maintained at this facility are professionally
acceptable, including the safe containment of animals within their enclosures.
