FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
1. The shared fence between the adjacent camel and kangaroo pens was constructed of a layer of rectangular wire
mesh attached to horizontal wooden boards. There was one area of the fence about 4 feet from the ground where
the coated wire mesh had detached from the boards and was curling into the camels' pen resulting in a space
approximately 6x6 inches in size. There was another area of the fence along the ground where the uncoated wire
mesh was rusted, and the wire was broken in a couple of places resulting in sharp points as well as a space
approximately 4x6 inches in size. The 2 damaged areas of the shared fence could cause injury to the animals' face,
nose, mouth, tongue or the skin on their limbs. This item affected 2 camels and 2 kangaroos.
Per this Section of the Regulations, outdoor housing facilities should be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.
