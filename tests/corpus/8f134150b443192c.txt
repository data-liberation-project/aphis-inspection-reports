LICENSEES WHOSE LICENSES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED OR REVOKED.
On Feb 9, 2017 APHIS officials observed this licensee exhibiting at the San Angelo Stock Show. The Stock Show is
scheduled from Feb 3 thru Feb 19 with a gate fee to enter and see the exhibits.
“Woody’s Menagerie” had 2 shows scheduled for Feb 9th. A morning show and a 6:00 pm show. APHIS officials
attended the 6:00 pm show which lasted 30 minutes. During the 6:00 pm show the licensees exhibited a 3 and 9
banded armadillo, a fennec fox, a coatimundi, a kinkajou, a kangaroo baby, and a lynx. The “liger exhibit” was open
continuously with a $2.00 entry fee in addition to the Stock Show gate fee. The “Barnyard Races” exhibit was set
up but APHIS officials did not attend this show.

This license was suspended for 90 days beginning Oct 25, 2016, and continuing thereafter until such time as the
respondents have demonstrated to APHIS that they are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and the
regulations and standards. As of the date of this attempted inspection the suspension had not been lifted.
Any person whose license is suspended shall not be involved in any regulated activities during the period of
suspension. This includes transporting and exhibiting.
To be corrected from the date of this inspection forward.
2.126(a)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On Feb 9, 2017 APHIS officials attempted to do an inspection of this licensee’s TRA location in San Angelo, TX.
The licensee stated that if his license was suspended then he did not have a license and we had no authority to do
an inspection. We explained that he still had a license but it was currently suspended. He insisted that if he was
suspended then he didn’t have a license and we could not inspect.
We considered this a refusal of inspection. Even though this individual’s license is suspended he must continue tocomply with the Animal Welfare Act and the regulations and standards. During business hours the licensee must
allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business, examine records required to be kept by the Act and the
regulations, to inspect and photograph the facilities, property and animals as the APHIS officials consider
necessary.
To be corrected from the date of this inspection forward.
