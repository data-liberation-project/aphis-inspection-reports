ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There was an adult male Chihuahua (#0A01480129) who was squinting and excessively blinking his left eye. The
eye was tearing and the hair immeidately around it was wet. To the lower right of the pupil, there waas a slightly
blue, cloudy opacity on the eye. Abnormal lesions on the eye combined with squinting, blinking, and tearing
indicate the dog may have a painful eye condition.
* There was a black, male Miniature Pinscher puppy (no ID #) housed alone in an enclosure. The puppy appeared
to be unthrifty and slightly lethargic. It was reluctant to move about in its enclosure, but when it did it had an
exaggerated arch to its back, tucking in its abdomen. The puppy's breathing was noticeably labored. These
abnormal signs indicate the puppy could have a medical condition which could be painful or harmful to his health.
*There was a red, female, adult Dachshund (#0A02236428) with very dry skin that was flaking off throughout most
of her coat. Whole clumps of hair were crusting off from her ears, leaving bald spots underneath. She also had
areas of generalized hair loss throughout her coat. The dog was seen by a veterinarian one month earlier for the
same condition. The veterinarian prescribed a 10-day treatment regimen of twice daily antibiotics but the licensee's
records showed that the treatment was only administered twice. Skipping anitibiotic treatments will not help the dog
heal properly and could even be harmful to the animal.
** The licensee must have the three animals mentioned above seen by a licensed veterinarian by 29 April 2014 to
obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans.
* There was a black and white, adult, female Miniature Schnauzer (#0A01387878) whose white, left, hind paw was
tinged dark red from a discharge oozing from a wound on the top surface of the paw. The licensee has a
veterinary-approved protocol for treating such wounds, but the dog was not under any treatment. Open wounds
seeping discharge could easily become infected and painful to the animals.
** The licensee must treat this dog in accordance with the facility's veterinary-approved treatment plan for lesions on
the paws no later than 26 April 2014.* There was an adult, male, white and brown Chihuahua with excessively long toe nails, especially on the dew
claws. Excessively long nails are at an increased risk of being ripped out or broken, resulting in a painful injury.
** The licensee must trim this dog's nails and ensure that the toe nails of all the dogs at the facility are maintained at
a length which is not likely to result in injuries.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(e) Storage.
The food storage area had both opened and unopened bags of dog food on the floor of the building and there was
kibble strewn out across much of the floor. The building is cluttered and is used to store additional material. Trash,
food waste, and clutter offer optimal breeding grounds for pests such as vermin and food sacks stored on the floor
are at risk for contamination. The licensee shall provide storage facilities that are kept clean and protect supplies
from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the
walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Furthermore, all open supplies of food must be kept in
leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f)Drainage and waste disposal.
Appropriate waste disposal methods are not being used in the adult sheltered housing facility. During the inspection
the kennel employees were washing down the outdoor runs of the facility using a hose and water pressure. The
wash waste, including piles of feces, flows from the first enclosure of the facility across the floor of all the enclosures
until the waste runs off into the drain adjacent to the last enclosure. This process spreads waste material from the
enclosures across subsequent enclosures carrying with it any disease or parasites. Additionally, the wash down
drain of the indoor portion of the adult sheltered housing facility is at floor level and is surrounded with coated metal
wire to prevent the animals from having direct contact with it. While the animals do not come into direct contact with
the drain it is located only a couple inches from the primary enclosure of three dogs and is therefore close enough
to be a disease risk. The drain and surrounding area is covered with hair,grime and fecal material from the wash
down.
The licensee and kennel employees must develop a cleaning/drainage system that minimizes contamination and
disease risks.

3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
(c) LightingThe indoor portion of the adult sheltered housing facility had 2 out of 4 light fixtures that were not functioning. One of
the fixtures did not have any light bulbs in it. The facility has a window that provides some light in that area of the
kennel. However, the facility has non-compliant cleaning issues in the area that the lights are not working and
inspectors had to use a flashlight to fully visualize the area. The licensee shall ensure the facility has adequate
lighting to permit routine inspection and cleaning of the facility, and observation of the dogs.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements (2)(x)
Inside the whelping facility there were 6 weaned Pug puppies that were observed with their feet and legs falling
through the flooring of the enclosure. Young animals that are not provided adequate support can result in an
inability to learn a proper gait and has the potential to cause injury. The licensee shall provide enclosures that have
flooring that does not allow the feet or legs of the animals to pass through any openings of the floor.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures
During the inspection, the kennel employees were washing down the outdoor runs of the adult sheltered housing
facility. The employee was using a hose and water pressure to wash waste from the first enclosure of the facility to
the last enclosure during which time an adult Miniature Pincher was standing in his outdoor run. The dog's entire
body became soiled with water and and brown specs of fecal material from the previous enclosures. Allowing an
animal to become soiled and wet in this manner exposes them to disease and parasitic contamination and may
cause the animal distress.The licensee and employees shall ensure that when water is used to clean the primary
enclosure, whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, dogs must be removed, unless the enclosure is large
enough to ensure the animals would not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in the process.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS DAY FORWARD
Both the kennel employees and the licensee were notified of this non-compliance during the inspection and asked
to correct the action immediately.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(b) Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles(2)
There were food and water receptacles throughout the facility that were dirty. These included but are not limited to;
the water bowl in the last enclosure of the whelping facility that had brown tinted water with fecal material in thebottom of the bowl, as well as the metal food receptacles in the outdoor housing area that had a brown thick film
covering the bottom of the pan. The licensee shall clean and sanitize food and water receptacles at least once every
2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other
disease hazards.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest control.
There was an abundance of ants crawling on the back wall of the sheltered adult housing facility. Pests such as
ants spread disease and can contaminate food and water sources. The licensee shall incorporate an effective pest
control method to reduce the number ants in the facility.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 5/8/14
This inspection was conducted with the licensee and an inspector from the Missouri Department of Agriculture. All
non-compliant items were discussed with the licensee during the inspection. An on site exit briefing was conducted
during the report delivery on 4/25/14.
