2.40(a)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee does not have an adequate program of veterinary care and is not following all aspects of the current written
program of veterinary care (PVC).
*The PVC states that carnivores and coatis will be vaccinated against rabies annually, but the cougar has not been
vaccinated against rabies since 2/12/20 (over 2 years ago) and the coatis have also not been vaccinated against rabies
since 2020.
*The PVC states that sampling and treatment for intestinal parasites will be performed "yearly or as needed more
frequency" but the licensee stated that he empirically treats the goats, Zebu, and previously treated the alpacas with
commercially available dewormer once per quarter and has not spoken to the Attending Veterinarian (AV) about the use
of this dewormer.
*The licensee has not found a veterinarian to provide care for a male adult dromedary camel which was acquired in July
2021. The camel is thin but has not been tested for parasites and is not on a fecal testing or deworming schedule; the
camel also has potential dental issues that have not been evaluated by a veterinarian.
*The licensee stated that the AV has not been made aware of a young female hyena that was acquired in December
2021. The hyena has not been evaluated by the AV and is not on any parasite testing or treatment schedule despite living


outdoors.
A program of veterinary care is essential for animal health and wellbeing. The veterinarian must be aware of all animals
on site and must have the authority to provide care for those animals. Animals without adequate veterinary care may
suffer from disease, illness, malnutrition, or parasitism. Correct by 5/1/22 by establishing a program of veterinary care that
includes all regulated animals on the property, and by following all instructions from the attending veterinarian. The PVC
must also be complaint with 2.40(b).
3.80(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Three adult ring-tailed lemurs are housed in an outdoor enclosure. The wire fence making up the outer walls of the
enclosure had approximately 8 holes in it, two of which were approximately 2-inches in diameter. Holes or openings in
animal enclosures may allow animals to escape, or may entrap parts of the animal resulting in injury. Correct by 5/1/22 by
ensuring that enclosures for nonhuman primates are maintained in good repair to adequately contain the animals.
Corrected during the inspection.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
The enclosure housing one female adult lion does not provide adequate shelter from rain. The only source of shelter from
rain is a structure which has walls that are made of cinderblock in the lower areas and welded wire in the upper areas.
The welded wire sections of the walls allow entry of rain into the shelter structure. The previous night it had rained, and
approximately 1/2 inch of standing water was evident on 90% of the floor of the shelter structure. There was no elevated
platform or dry resting area for the cat to use within the structure. Animals who experience exposure to rain without
adequate shelter may become cold or stressed. Correct by 5/1/22 providing a shelter that will protect the animal from the
elements and allow the animal to stay dry during periods of heavy rain.


3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
There is an approximately 40-foot long gap in the perimeter fence behind the big cat enclosures. A few sections of the
perimeter fence have approximately 10-inch gaps between the bottom of the fence and the ground. In one area behind
the lion enclosure the top and bottom panels of the fence are not secured together adequately to prevent separation. A
perimeter fence is essential for preventing contact between unauthorized people or animals and the captive animals. A
perimeter fence is also important for animal safety as it acts as a secondary containment system in the event that an
animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Correct by 6/1/22 by ensuring the perimeter fence is at least 8-feet tall for
dangerous animals, 6-feet tall for non-dangerous animals, and is adequate to prevent contact between between animals
in enclosures and those outside the perimeter fence.
3.132 Critical

Employees.
In July 2021, a volunteer put a generous amount of sweet feed into an enclosure housing 3 Patagonian cavy and 2
capybara. According to facility management, one adult cavy consumed the sweet feed and suffered from severe
gastrointestinal illness as a result, and despite veterinary treatment the animal died from its illness. According to facility
management, sweet feed is not permitted to be fed to cavies because it is not an appropriate diet and can be harmful to
these animals. The facility maintains a list of appropriate food items for cavies, and sweet feed it not on this list.
Employees who are not adequately trained to handle or feed exotic animals may make mistakes that cause animal
illnesses, injuries, or death. Correct from this day forth by ensuring that a sufficient number of adequately trained
employees are utilized to maintain professionally acceptable husbandry standards, including the feeding of appropriate
diets to animals. Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
