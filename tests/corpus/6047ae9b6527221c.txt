Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 522 guinea pigs
were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults, weanlings, or
newborns present since August.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Primary enclosures.
There was 1 guinea pig pen that did not provide the required amount of floor space. There were 61 weanling guinea pigs
housed in a pen that measured 56 x 51 inches or 2,856 square inches of floor space. Each weanling requires a minimum
of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required to house these weanlings is 3,660 square inches. There


cannot be more than 47 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure measuring 56 by 51 inches.
Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.

Feeding.
Approximately 1/3 of the guinea pig self-feeders were empty and contained an accumulation of fecal material. The
licensee stated the feeders are filled every other day. The animals appeared in good body condition and were not
lethargic.
Failure to clean feeders often enough to prevent contamination with fecal material can result in avoidance of food or
spread of disease.
Food receptacles must be located to minimize contamination by excreta and must be kept clean.
