OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Building surfaces in contact with dogs must be impervious to moisture and replaced when worn. At least two
support fence posts in the northeast corner hunting dog pens are much chewed. The chewed areas are rough and
cannot be cleaned and sanitized properly. The owner must replace or repair these support posts. This will help in
the cleaning/sanitizing and give dogs a healthier enclosed to live in. Correct by 03-26-2015.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
