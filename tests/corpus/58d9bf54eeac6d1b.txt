2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white female Chihuahua approximately six years old (tag number 38) has an accumulation of dark brown and tan
colored material coating the entire surface of the upper cheek teeth. The gum line is red and swollen and has
receded away from the upper cheek teeth. The front teeth and canine teeth have a tan colored material on the
surface. The buildup of abnormal material on the teeth can be painful and lead to a decrease in appetite. It can
impact the ability of the dog to eat, affecting the health and well being of the dog. The licensee must have this
animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administered. The outcome of this examination
must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.
The dog also has long toe nails. Long toe nails can be painful causing discomfort when the dog is trying to walk.
The potential for injury exists if the toe nail becomes caught in the openings of the flooring. Lack of nail care on a
regular basis can affect the health and well being of the dog. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
