ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current program of veterinary care is two years old and does not include animals acquired since 2012. This
includes the New Guinea Singing Dog, Prairie Dogs and Coatimundi.
Each exhibitor shall have an attending veterinarian and in the case of a part time attending veterinarian it must
include a written program of veterinary care.
Have your veterinarian add to the written program of veterinary care every time a new species of animal is acquired.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee acquired 2 New Guinea Singing Dogs and they do not have a sufficient barrier fence for the public.
The outside barrier fence is too close to the primary enclosure and a person could stick their fingers inside the
enclosure. There is also a hallway inside the barn that has no public barrier and the public is allowed to enter this
area. The wire for the inside housing is made of 2" by 4" wire and a person could put their whole hand through this
wire.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
Rebuild or remodel these areas so that the public cannot have contact with these animals for the safety of the
animals and the public.

FEEDING.
The prairie dog food and the micro pig food is being kept inside the warm building and is open and not in a
container.
All food must be free from contamination and open bags of food are succeptable to insect, bird and rodent
infestation.
Keep all open bags of feed in a container with a lid so there is no possibility of contamination.

Inspection and exit conducted with the licensee.
