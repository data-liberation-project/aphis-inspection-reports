2.126(a) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
At approximately 2pm, on September 7th, another USDA APHIS inspector and I arrived at the facility to conduct an
inspection. Stopping at the gate, a call was made to the licensee and a message was left. Approximately 15 minutes later
the licensee returned the call stating she was not there and that an attempted inspection could be written. She stated that
she was unsure as to why we were there and then proceeded to explain that she would not allow me to do an inspection
of her facility anyway because of past interactions.
I tried to explain why an inspection needed to be done and the licensee quickly became agitated and explained again that
she would never allow me to conduct an inspection of her facility ever. The licensee brought up a point from a past
discussion regarding the perimeter fence and when I stated that I did not recall stating the point, the licensee called me a
liar and yelled through the phone for us to get off of her property immediately. Upon the licensee’s clear instruction to
leave, we backed out of the driveway and left the property without conducting an inspection.
Access to animals, facilities, and records is necessary to complete an inspection to ensure the health, well-being, and
safety of the animals being housed and exhibited at the facility. The licensee must allow APHIS Officials to enter its place
of business; to inspect facilities, property, and animals; to examine and copy records; and to document non-compliant
items via photographs and other means.



The licensee needs to allow USDA APHIS officials access to her property to conduct an inspection of the animals, the
facility, and the records. To be corrected from this day forward.

No exit briefing was done.
