reach the ground . An animal may become trapped in the gap at the bottom of the fence and the fence line is no
longer structurally sound due to the broken board. The perimeter fence next to the tunnel is in need of repair. A top
rail is bent and there is a section of fence that is no longer secured to the support poles. These damaged areas may
result in animal injury or escape and must be repaired and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
