PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.53(a)(1) Primary enclosures: The hutch enclosure housing three rabbits has the wire floor detached from
the front of the blue shelter leaving a small gap between the shelter and the floor. A rabbit may get a foot caught in
the gap and be injured. The wire floor must be reattached to the front of the blue shelter for the enclosure to be
structurally sound and to protect the rabbits from injury. Correct by September 11, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
