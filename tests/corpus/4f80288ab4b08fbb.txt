3.14(a)(6)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Construction of primary enclosures.
Two transport enclosures containing one adult dog in each (airway bill 48327602) had lettering for the words 'Live
Animals' that were less than 1 inch high on the top of the enclosure. The lettering measured only 1/4 of an inch
high.
This may negatively affect the animals' safe transport since the small lettering may not be noticeable. Improper
labeling of transport enclosures could lead to improper handling of the animals during transit thereby increasing the
risk of injury or discomfort. Accept for transport only primary enclosures that are properly labeled on the top and one
or more sides with the words 'Live Animals' in letters at least 1 inch high, and with arrows to indictate the correct
upright position of the enclosure.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
Food and water receptacles.
One of the food/water receptacles for a transport enclosure containing an adult dog (airway bill 48327602) was
loose on the floor of the enclosure. The receptacle is not securely attached to the inside of the primary enclosure so
that it can be filled from the outside without opening the door. This could affect the health and comfort of the dog
since feeding and watering is limited to a single receptacle since the other one cannot be used or could result in
escape, if the door is opened to feed or water the animal. Accept for transport only primary enclosures with securely
attached food and water receptacles so that the animals may be safely fed and watered without escaping their
transport enclosure.
