In the facility's east building, approximately 14 enclosures affecting about 27 dogs, there is a blackish/brown dirt and
grime on doors and doorway walls. The doorways are approximately 50% covered in grime. In these same
enclosures there is more than a day's accumulation of fecal build-up inside the outdoor portion of the enclosures.
The amount of fecal material present on the floors made it difficult for the dogs to avoid stepping in it. In the facility's
middle building, two enclosures housing 7 dogs, has newspapers on the painted wood building floor that are soiled
with urine and feces, which have not been changed daily. A build-up of feces is a disease hazard and can attract
pests. The accumulation of dirt and grime can cause diseases and attract pests. Cleanliness is important to the
health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must ensure that enclosures are spot cleaned daily and sanitized
at least every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt and grime and other disease
hazards.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
