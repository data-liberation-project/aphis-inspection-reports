Cleaning
****
Throughout the sheltered facility an accumulation of hair dirt and grime present on the woven wire tops of at least 2
enclosures, on the walls of at least 5 enclosures, 8 access doors, 3 access entryways, and the floors of the inside
section of the 5 ground pens. This affects 25 dogs. This accumulation of hair, dirt and grime could become a
disease hazard to the animals. The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact
with are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks (or more often if necessary). All other
surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Wind/rain 3.4
In 1 outdoor enclosure, housing 4 dogs, the wind and rain break at the front of the shelter was severely chewed to
where it was ineffective. The dogs need an effective wind and rain break on their outdoor shelter units to protect
them from the elements and help keep them dry. The licensee must provide this shelter with an adequate wind and
rain breaks and ensure that all shelters are provided with a wind and rain break at the entrances of all the outdoor
shelters.

FEEDING.
****
The sheltered building had 5 enclosures housing 15 dogs that had pieces of straw bedding mixed in with the food inthe self- feeders. The dogs in these enclosures could not eat the food without ingesting pieces of bedding.
Contaminated food may harm the health of the dogs. The licensee must provide these dogs with uncontaminated
feed and ensure that all food provided to the dogs is uncontaminated.

3.10 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
Water
****
In 3 of the outdoor enclosures, affecting 5 dogs, the water in the receptacles was frozen. When the inspectors
asked the licensee to give the dogs water she dumped the ice out of the receptacles. As the licensee was getting
water for these dogs one of the dogs was observed eating the broken pieces of ice and another dog was observed
scratching at and licking the bottom of the empty water receptacle. When the licensee provided water to these dogs
they drank continuously for approximately 50 - 60 seconds.
In one enclosure within the sheltered facility the inspector noticed 2 dogs scratching repeatedly at an empty water
receptacle. The inspectors instructed the licensee to give the dogs some water and when she did the dogs drank
continuously for approximately 50 - 60 seconds. Lack of water can cause medical problems. Licensee must ensure
that all dogs must be offered clean potable water as often as necessary, but not less than twice daily for at least 1
hour for the health and well-being of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
****
In a at least 5 of the outside portions of the sheltered enclosures, containing 15 dogs, the amount of fecal material
present on the floor made it difficult for the dogs to avoid stepping in it. Some of the dogs feet and legs have
become soiled with feces and/or urine. This could become a disease hazard to the dogs. Licensee must remove
the accumulated fecal material from these enclosures and ensure that all excreta and food waste is removed daily
from primary enclosures or more often if necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
This is a repeat non-compliant item.
