ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Boston Terrier,(cid:29) "Sandy"(cid:29) USDA tag no. 189, was seen holding her left hind leg up off the ground while
standing and moving. Licensee stated that the dog had cut her foot while running and playing in an outdoor
enclosure. Physical examination of the bottom of the dog'(cid:25)s foot revealed that the pad of one toe had a deep
laceration running down the middle of it. The licensee had isolated this dog from other animals and was self-treating
the wound with Vetericyn spray and Nitrofurazone. This dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.
Lacerations can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to other health problems. This dog must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. This diagnosis and treatment plan
must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
