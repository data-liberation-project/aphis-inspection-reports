2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Several species of exotic animals present at the facility at the time of the inspection were not listed on the
Program of Veterinary Care (lynx, lemur, and hedgehog). The instructions for parasite control on the Program of
Veterinary Care need more detail. Section III for Wild and Exotic Animals (dingos and wolves) lists "Advantics" and
other instructions that aren't readable for ectoparasites. For intestinal parasites it states "Goats - Alternating
deworm every 4 wks. The line below that states "Panacur Regularly - fecal floats as deemed necessary." It is
unclear if the Panacur instructions apply to all the animals or just the goat. Section IV for Other Warmblooded
Animals (rabbits, chinchilla, kangaroo, kinkajou, coatimundi, porcupine, cavy, groundhog) instructs "examined by
owners daily and treated if found. NO Frontline Toxic" for ectoparasites. However, there are no instructions on what
product to use or a dose the licensee is to use if ectoparasites are found. Unclear or incomplete instructions for the
Program of Veterinary Care can result in the wrong product or the wrong dose being used for the animals. The
Attending Veterinarian must provide clear, specific instructions regarding product, dose, and dosing interval for any
medications that the licensee or his staff are allowed to give the animals. It must also be noted if the licensee is
required to consult the Attending Veterinarian before giving medication to any specific animals. All animal species
present at the facility must be included on the Program of Veterinary Care.
