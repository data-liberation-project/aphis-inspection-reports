Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Within the enclosure housing ring-tailed lemurs, there was a live rodent observed. The rodent was only briefly observed
within the enclosure before it was seen scurrying across the floor away from the animals’ enclosure. There was also a
rodent hole noted in the flooring of the facility adjacent to the wall and near the lemurs’ enclosure. The lemurs’ enclosure
was also near the portion of the facility housing other exotic animals where another live mammalian pest was observed.
According to the licensee, there were several traps located around the premises, however, it did not seem to be enough
to control the number of pests being observed this season. Pests increase the risk of disease hazards to the animals. The
licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective program for the control of pests, including mammalian, avian,
insects, and external parasites, so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by
pests in animal areas. To be corrected by: January 1, 2023.
