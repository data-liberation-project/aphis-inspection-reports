3.106(b)(1)

Water quality.
The coliform test conducted on August 4, 2021 had a value of >2419.6 MPN. Following the initial reading there was only
one other reading on August 5, 2021 that was 12.4 MPN. There wasn't a second retest to get an average to determine if it
would be under 1,000 MPN which is the regulated coliform bacteria count not to be exceeded. Also the first sample result
did not reflect the actual number of coliforms because a ">" ("greater than") sign was used in front of the number. When
the limit of the testing method is reached, a dilution must be performed to determine the coliform count. The bacteria
coliform count should not exceed 1,000 MPN per 100 ml of water. If it does exceed that amount, two subsequent samples
may be taken at 48-hour intervals and averaged with the first sample. If the average doesn't fall below 1,000 MPN, then
the water in the pool shall be deemed unsatisfactory, and the condition must be corrected immediately. Correct from this
day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
