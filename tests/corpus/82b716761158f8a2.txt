ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In Pen #1, a grey, brown, and white adult guinea pig was identified during inspection as having a cloudy right eye
with slight blue discoloration of the cornea and a mild green discharge from the eye. This same guinea pig also had
an approximate 1in spot on it's back near the shoulder blades that was missing hair. The licensee stated that this
guinea pig had not been previously identified for either the eye or the hair loss and therefore had not followed the
protocols provided by their Attending Veterinarian (AV) for these conditions.
Additionally, in another pen, a deceased red-and-white adult guinea was identified. This carcass was observed to
be lean with protruding hip bones and a sunken-in appearance.
Facilities must ensure that animals with health conditions are identified and treated according to instructions by the
AV. Failure to do so can lead to worsening of health conditions, up to and including death. Correct by contacting
your AV to pursue treatment for this animal. Correct by January 9, 2020.
3.25(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were 2 loose guinea pigs huddled behind the heating unit in the corner. The side walls of the wooden pens
measured 7 inches in height but there were several gaps especially around the waterers and the corners where the
height was as low as 2 inches in some areas.
Inadequate wall heights below 7 inches may result in escape of guinea pigs from their enclosures and may lead to
injury during their escape or prevent access to food and water.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**Most of the thirty-five wooden pens at the facility had wire that was used to extend the wall height. However, the
sides of this wire was trimmed so that there were exposed wire ends of approximately 1in in length. These cut ends
were often in the corners of the enclosures and were at a height of 5-8in. The wire used also had several areas ofrust in addition to the protruding ends.
**All of the thirty-five wooden pens had areas where the guinea pigs had chewn and worn down the wood, exposing
unsealed wood underneath. Most of these areas were concentrated around the water spigots.
**Pens 2, 3, and 4 each had an exposed screw head of approximately 2in protruding into the enclosure at a height
of approximately 4in. The licensee explained that these screws used to hold salt licks for the guinea pigs and the
screws had never been removed.
Enclosures for guinea pigs must be kept structurally sound, maintained so as to prevent injury, and constructed of
material that is substantially impervious to moisture. The wire tips and exposed screws can cause injury to the
animals and the exposed wood can also cause injury as well as lead to the spread of disease through inadequate
sanitation. Correct by repairing the wire and exposed wood as well as removing the screws. Correct by February 8,
2020.
3.29(d) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The self feeders attached to the inside of the guinea pig enclosures contained fecal material and bedding material
mixed in with the feed. There was also fecal material observed on the outside of the feeders.
Failure to clean feeders often enough to prevent contamination with fecal material can result in avoidance of food or
spread of disease.
Food receptacles must be located to minimize contamination by excreta and must be kept clean.
Correct from this day forward.
3.30
WATERING.
There was a buildup of bedding, fecal material, debris, and wet greenish material around the nipples of the
automatic waterers.
Failure to clean waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water intake or
spread of disease.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized when dirty.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
In Pen 45, there was a substantial amount of spiderwebs adhered to the upper corner of the enclosure.Primary enclosures need to be cleaned and sanitized enough to prevent and accumulation of debris with sanitizing
occurring at a minimum of once every 2 weeks. Correct by cleaning and removing the spiderwebs in Pen 45.
Correct by January 9, 2020.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There were several cobwebs around the overhead PVC piping for the watering system and the piping was coated
with a layer of dirt and debris. There was an accumulation of dirt, debris, bedding, and fecal material coating the
PVC piping for the watering system that runs along the floor at the rear of the first 2 rows of wooden pens closest to
the entry door.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room and may contribute to spread
of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean in order to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and
maintain the health of the animals.
