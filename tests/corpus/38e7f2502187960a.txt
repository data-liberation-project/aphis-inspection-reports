2.5(d) REPEAT
DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
- The drive through area of the park is currently open for visitors, but is not an approved site. Site 002 (drive
through site) is not a valid site and must be in complete compliance with all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act prior
to being used for regulated activity.
2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
- At the time of inspection the animal inventory dated 31 March 2016 was not up to date and the licensee was not
able to provide an accurate animal inventory. There were at least 14 Pere David deer observed in the park by the
inspectors and only 2 were listed on the current animal inventory. Complete and accurate records are necessary to
ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace those animals. The
licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all animals at all times and must ensure those records are
available to the inspector upon request.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, such as a rhinoceros and a tiger, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals might
negatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office with written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle
these animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site
can be approved for regulated activity.
2.131(d)(2) REPEATHANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- At the time of the inspection members of the public approached the inspector's car and gave them Pepsi cups
containing animal feed that they had purchased from the gift shop and had not used. The drive through area of the
park had members of the public driving their cars through and feeding animal feed from paper Pepsi cups that are
available for purchase at the gift shop. There was a member of the public riding in the back of an open bed pickup
truck feeding park animals as well. There were no park employees present during this public/animal interaction.
Empty Pepsi cups were noted scattered on the ground throughout the park. A responsible, knowledgeable, and
readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The border fence for the drive through area is leaning sharply in several areas, and one section has a fallen tree
leaning on it. Fencing in this condition is not secure, nor is it safe for the enclosed animals. The fences must be
repaired and maintained at all times.
- Just inside the front cattle guard, there is a section of empty enclosures with an approximate four foot wide fenced
alley way circling around these enclosures. This alley way use to be the public barrier when animals were in these
enclosures. These enclosures have metal angle brackets and metal posts leaning in this alley way making it
dangerous for the enclosed animals, that have access, to navigate through this alley way. The alley way is open at
one end and closed at the other end and the animals in the front section of the park have free access to this alley
way. This is a potential source of injury to these animals. The alley way must be removed or closed off and
maintained in good condition to protect the enclosed animals in the front section of the park.
The alley way was completely closed off during the inspection.
- There was a large drainage pipe, just prior to the Serengeti area, that has a metal grate in front of the pipe. The
grate has detached on one side and has sharp points and the grate can serve as a possible limb injury or
entrapment. The grate must be removed or reattached to protect the enclosed animals from injury.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative, USDA APHIS VMO Debbie
