ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white male chinchilla's left front leg that had previously been evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) with a
plan of monitoring it for changes was observed today to have changes that need to be re-evaluated by the AV. The
area of its left front leg had a hard, white, pointed protrusion sticking out of a swollen crusted area. Lightly touching
the crusted area confirmed that the area was swollen around the protrusion and there was some pale discharge that
came out from underneath the crusted material. The swelling and pale discharge are signs of an active disease
process that needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for treatment. To prevent pain and a worsening
condition in this chinchilla, the facility must ensure that the chinchilla is re-evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and
follow the recommended treatment.
