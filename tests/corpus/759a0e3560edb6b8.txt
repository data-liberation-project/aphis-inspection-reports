**During a review of Protocol LA18-0015, no mention was made indicating if the activity had the potential to cause more
than momentary pain and/or distress in order to allow the IACUC to ensure the PI had considered if the proposed
activities had the potential for pain and/or distress and if so what alternatives might be available. Proposed activities
should include a consideration for procedures that have the potential for pain and/or distress and the means to avoid or
minimize the discomfort, pain and distress to the animals. It is the responsibility of the IACUC during the review of
proposed activities to ensure the principal investigator has taken into consideration any procedures or activities that have
the potential to cause more than momentary pain and/or distress to the animals and provide consideration to possible
alternatives to such procedures.
