2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female zebu and male llama had excessively long hooves. The llamas toes were curling abnormally as a result of
not having routine hoof trimming.
Excessive growth of hooves changes the angle of the toes, changes the gait, and can lead to chronic problems in
the feet and legs such as arthritis.
**These two animals need to have their hooves trimmed by 12/22/2014.
**A plan needs to be developed and documented, with the input of the attending veterinarian (AV), to address the
need for hoof trimming for any animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the development of chronic
foot and leg problems. This plan needs to be available for review by APHIS officials.
Exhibitors shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the appropriate methods
to prevent and control diseases and injuries.
