3.2(b)

Indoor housing facilities.
There was inadequate ventilation in the whelping building. The whelping building is a converted reefer trailer with a door
on one end and a small window and air conditioner unit on the other end that was unplugged. Upon entering, there was
an ammonia odor that got stronger as the inspectors progressed towards the back of the trailer. Both inspectors had
burning eyes and one inspector's eyes began to water by the time we got to the end of the trailer. Strong ammonia levels
can lead to respiratory issues and burning and sensitivity in the eyes. Indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently
ventilated at all times to minimize odors and ammonia levels to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
Correct by 11/4/22 by properly ventilating the kennel building at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
There were multiple broken wires and sharp points protruding into several kennels containing dogs. Seven enclosures
containing 11 dogs had broken wire flooring or wire ties pointed into the enclosures that the dogs could step on or brush
up against. Two kennels containing 2 dogs had solid aluminum sheeting between 2 adjacent enclosures that had been
bitten, chewed, and pulled up, creating sharp edges. Three kennels containing 4 dogs had metal feeders with wire hooks
protruding into the enclosure, right at eye level next to the food. One of the feeder hooks had a large clump of fur stuck to


it. Sharp points could scratch or cut the skin, feet, or eyes of dogs in the enclosures. Primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs. Correct by 10/30/22 by
ensuring that no primary enclosures contain sharp points.
3.6(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
In the whelping building, 3 separate primary enclosures containing 4 dogs had broken flooring, creating holes large
enough for feet to fall through or become entrapped. The holes ranged from 2" x 2" to 2" x 3". Wire flooring in disrepair
can cause injury if dogs' feet fall through. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the
dogs from injury. Correct by 10/30/22 by repairing the holes in the wire flooring.
3.8(a)

Exercise for dogs.
In the whelping building, one dog, a dachshund named Black Satin did not have adequate space to exercise. The facility's
exercise plan is to group house dogs or provide individually housed dogs with twice the minimum required floor space.
Black Satin was 20" long, requiring a minimum of 676 square inches of floor space with additional opportunity for exercise
or doubled (1352 square inches of floor space) for exercise. Black Satin's primary enclosure was 36" x 36", providing
1296 square inches, falling short of the exercise requirement. Dogs must be provided with adequate exercise to promote
physical health and mental well-being. Dogs that are housed individually, must be provided twice the minimum space
requirement per the exercise plan. Correct by 10/28/22 by ensuring adequate space for exercise.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The licensee is not sanitizing primary enclosures in the whelping building at acceptable intervals. The licensee stated that
she sanitizes the enclosures before she moves a new dog into a used enclosure, which occurs when puppies are weaned


and new dogs are brought in before they whelp. She spot cleans daily but is not sanitizing at least every 2 weeks. When
enclosures are not sanitized, dirt, debris, and disease causing organisms can flourish and cause illness. Primary
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using an appropriate method per the regulations, or more often
as necessary. Correct by sanitizing enclosures at appropriate intervals from this day forward.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care did not list a sampling frequency for heartworms and no medical record existed to
demonstrate that heartworm testing is occurring. Testing is necessary to detect infections of heartworm, which is a
deadly and contagious disease. The program of veterinary care must direct and accurately reflect the prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of diseases common in kennels, including rabies, parvo, distemper, fleas, intestinal worms,
coccidia, giardia, and heartworm. Correct by 11/30/22 by ensuring sampling and treatment protocols are written and
approved by the attending veterinarian in the program of vet care.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
There were no medical records available to document the annual exam by the veterinarian. The attending veterinarian
performed his annual visit several months ago and provided a list of dogs needing dentals. No other record exists to
document the findings of the exams. Medicals records are important to track health history of dogs over time and ensure
complete and thorough treatment of medical conditions. Correct by maintaining medical records of all veterinary
encounters from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
