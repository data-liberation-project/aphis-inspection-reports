Official identification is required in order to facilitate the required record keeping and to ensure that each animal's
identity can be known for certain.

by methods described in Subpart E (cid:19)Identification of Animals Section 2.50, or by microchip.

with no identification.
Official identification is required in order to facilitate the required record keeping and to ensure that each animal(cid:25)'s
identity can be known for certain.
The licensee must ensure that puppies less than 16 weeks of age be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar, a
tattoo, a plastic type collar with the required information, or a microchip. If weaned puppies are maintained as a
litter, it is also acceptable to use a cage card containing the puppies' individual identification numbers and
identifying characteristics such as date of birth, breed, and sex.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor inside of "Building #3" has a lot of dead flies and some dog kibble scattered around. When asked by the
inspector how often the floor gets cleaned, the representative stated that underneath the enclosures gets cleaned
every day, but the floor between both sides of the enclosures gets swept about once a week.
A buildup of dirt, debris, and other organic material can cause odors, attract pests and other vermin which can
spread disease and cause other health hazards.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to
satisfy generally accepted husbandry practices.
3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

These exposed wires panels could cause the animals to get their foot or leg caught and result in injury.
The licensee must ensure that exposed wire panels or other hazards are repaired and maintained to protect the
animals from injury.

There are two dogs that have old, almost healed wounds on their ears. The representative stated they were from fly
strikes and that they have been using an environmental fly control spray which had been successful until the past

Fly strikes are evidence of excessive flies on the premises.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of insects and other external parasites
affecting the dogs to promote the health and well-being of the animals and to reduce contamination by pests in theanimal areas.
