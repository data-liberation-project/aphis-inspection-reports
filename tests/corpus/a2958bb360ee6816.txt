fox, Patagonian cavy and wallaby area there are still items like children's toys, extra kennels and miscellaneous
items throughout the animal areas. In the sheltered area where the coatimundi are kept there is straw strewn on the
floor, various debris and excess supplies in disarray. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept neat and clean
and accumulations of trash plus items not used to care for the animals shall be placed in a designated area. The

for rodents to hide, reproduce and cause infestation. The clutter in this area makes it impossible to clean these
areas. The licensee must remove all trash and miscellaneous items and place them in a designated area.Remains uncorrected
