FEEDING.
This is a focused inspection in regards to the exhibition of one tiger cub currently open to the public.
In this inspection was found a tiger cub of 9 weeks of age, receiving a diet of only meat without additional calcium
and/or vitamins for the last 2 days also was not found a plan or instructions to supplement the diet of this cub.
The ground turkey, chicken or beef only diet with no calcium supplement is not an adequate diet for tiger cubs, the
absence of calcium in the diet leads to an unbalance in the metabolism and these cubs suffer greatly because they
will develop Metabolic Bone Disease and suffer with fractures and painful bone conditions.
The licensee should consult with the veterinarian and obtain guidance for a proper diet and supplementation for this
tiger cub.
A comprehensive guide for the diet and supplementation of the tiger cubs must be documented in writing, must be
approved by the veterinarian must be followed all the time and be available for the Aphis officials during inspections.
