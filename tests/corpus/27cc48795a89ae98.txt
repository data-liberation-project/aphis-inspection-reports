2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230 on
28-MAR-19.
I attempted to make contact at the original address listed on the registration as well as the corrected address
provided by the USDA Eastern Regional Office. There was no one at either location. I attempted to make contact
by phone but the person answering the phone stated that I had the wrong phone number. Please contact me at
(240) 731-4240 or contact the Eastern Regional Office at (919) 855-7100 and provide updated contact information.
Thanks.
