2.31(d)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
The IACUC is not providing all committee members with a list of protocols submitted throughout the year for approval
before directing them to designated member review. When protocols are submitted to the IACUC prior to each semester,
they are immediately sent for designated member review before allowing committee members to request a full committee
review. All IACUC committee members must be provided a list of the proposed activities to be reviewed and given time to
request, if desired, a full Committee review of those activities. This is crucial to ensuring that all members have an
opportunity to review every submitted protocol for potential concerns before allowing it to go through a designated
member review process.
Correct by September 15, 2021 by providing a list of all proposed activities submitted to the IACUC for approval to all
IACUC Committee members and allow sufficient time for them to request a full Committee review of the protocols prior to
assigning them for designated member review.
2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocols VET205 and VET121-66 are missing complete descriptions of the proposed uses of the animals. The IACUC
approved feline neuter protocol VET205 on file and reviewed during the inspection is missing details regarding


intravenous catheter placement, intubation of the patient, who is performing each procedure, and how many attempts at
each procedure is acceptable. Specifically, the protocol does not include: 1) the location of intravenous catheter
placement; 2) a step indicating intubation of the feline patients with an endotracheal tube; 3) whether a LVT or DVM is
performing the listed procedures or a veterinary technician student; and 4) if a veterinary technician student is performing
the procedure- how many attempts they can make on the animal. The IACUC approved feline neuter protocol VET121-66
on file and reviewed during the inspection is missing details regarding intravenous catheter placement and how many
attempts at each procedure is acceptable. Specifically, the protocol does not include: 1) the location of intravenous
catheter placement; and 2) when a veterinary technician student is performing the procedure- how many attempts they
can make on the animal.
Although the institution has a document that lists various procedures commonly performed on animals and the number of
attempts per animal per week, this document does not clarify if these attempts may be performed all in one sitting, are
they all in the same location (e.g. jugular vs. cephalic vs. lateral saphenous veins), or if repeat procedures are allowed.
Additionally, this document is not referenced in either protocol.
Incomplete descriptions of procedures do not allow the IACUC to fully understand and review the proposed activities
involving animal use. This oversight is crucial to monitoring and enforcing animal welfare standards in research.
Correct by December 1, 2021 by ensuring that all protocols (those currently in use and all future) contain all five
components listed in this subsection, including a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and the IACUC administrator.
