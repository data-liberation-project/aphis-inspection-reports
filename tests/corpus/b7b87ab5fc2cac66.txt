2.131(c)(1) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This was a focused inspection of the male white tiger named "Goliath" due to a bite incident.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public On the 6th of October a member of the public was able to approach and insert
his hand into the enclosure which housed two large cats. One of the large cats, a male white tiger, bit this man on
the hand causing serious injury. No barrier was present and sufficient distance was not maintained to protect the
animal or the public member. A barrier needs to be erected or a sufficient distance must be maintained at all times
when the public is present.
Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted over the telephone with the President. A copy of the inspection report was provided
via email.
