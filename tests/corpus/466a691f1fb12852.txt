3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the outdoor facility portion of the main building, there are 10 enclosures housing 20 adult dogs that had a build of
dirt and debris on the exterior portion of the spring loaded dog doors and the wooden framing of the dog doors.
The build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
enclosures, and food and water bowls daily and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Autumn Unck, VMO.
