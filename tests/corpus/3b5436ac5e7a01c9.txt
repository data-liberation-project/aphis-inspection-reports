2.8 REPEAT
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The owner of the facility, Mr. Richard M Evola, has moved and not passed a pre-site usage inspection. The owner
of the facility has been exhibiting and selling regulated species without approval of this site since at least March 14,
2016. On February 19, 2016 the previous inspector notified me that Mr. Evola had moved to Hillsdale, MI and had
marmosets for sale online. On March 14, 2016 I completed a search with Dr. Kurt Hammel. No one answered the
door and I left two business cards to call concerning his move to Hillsdale. Mr. Evola called on March 15, 2016. I
let Mr. Evola know that any change in address required written notice of change to the Eastern Regional Office
(ERO) in writing and that he could not conduct regulated activities until he passed a pre-site usage inspection. On
April 5, 2016 Mr. Evola was cited for not notifying the ERO in writing of his address change and it was stated on the
report that no regulated activities could be conducted until the site was approved. I received Mr. Evolas' renewal
with address change on July 21, 2016. I called the number listed on the renewal on July 25, 2016 and was hung up
on two times. I tried to text to the number, but it did not accept texts. I sent an email to the business email address
and received no response. On August 22, 2016 I called the phone number again and the person that answered
said he changed his phone number. I sent another email to the business email address. I found a new phone
number on Mr. Evolas', business, Facebook page for potbelly pigs that he was selling and called that number and
left a message. I also texted that number. On August 31, 2016 I visited the address again to try to set up an
appointment and there was no answer at the door, so left a business card. I yelled hello from the driveway and tried
to call the new phone number and no answer so left a message. I left the address and headed towards my next
facility. Mr. Evola called and made a statement asking if I had received a call. I replied no, that you are not
supposed to be conducting regulated activities. At this time we did set up an appointment for the pre-site usage
inspection. On September 1, 2016 a complaint was sent by email to the acting supervisor. The complaint is
concerning the body condition of a camel that Mr. Evola was using for camel rides at the Michigan Renaissance
Festival.
A licensee must promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in address within 10 days
of the change and no regulated activities may be conducted until this site has passed a pre-site usage inspection.
I have tried numerous times and numerous ways to contact the facility to conduct a pre-site usage inspection and
never received any response.NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL THIS SITE IS APPROVED.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owner, Dr. Kurt Hammel and Carrie Bongard, ACI.
